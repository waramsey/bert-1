5277	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
5457	0	a	I Want my money back!
80	1	a	Very unique and fun twist on poker. If you like Puzzle Quest or just like poker/other card games, then you should give it a try at least. There's a demo out but the game is worth the price for sure.
4743	1	a	really great game! Zombies gameplay but with dinosaurs is brillant! the weapons and graphics fit quite well with the era(whatever era it may be anyways) and the objectives and conquest are deffinitly the winning game mods here! they've done an amazing job with this game and i can't see it going anywhere but to the top!
2993	1	a	I recommend this game to the people who like first person shooters and 3rd person. There are tons of very uniqe weapons and equipment. PLAY THIS GAME!
3753	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
1139	1	a	I love game same oblivion IV and mass effect. great game!!!.....
1093	1	a	Really enjoying this game ,snap it up on sale (something like fable)
2411	1	a	The game I feel that it is underrated and it's developers have been keeping to their promises and are still developing it with community ideas with support from people.
2762	1	a	T-Rex ate me.. EPIC!
4586	1	a	i mean, its bad, but it IS a fun game with friends xD
3470	1	a	Very fun to play, never gets old.  The amount of effort the Devs have put into this game makes it worth way more than $1.
373	1	a	Even a few years after the release I still think that this game is among the best RPGs ever created for console and computer. The graphics plus characters are lovely and the world is as many-sided as it is dangerous. You can do a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of sidequests which sometimes makes you forget what you are supposed to do, but personally, I love that about my openworld RPGs. After 20 hours of playing this game (yet again since I started it when I came out but started over again here on steam) and completing all sidequests so far, I can say that this game is totally underrated and has a lot to offer. Personally I don't share the opinion that this was crappily adapted from the consoles. I've seen far worse adaptions over the years and it's really easy to get along with this one; of course, sometimes you might encounter situations in the menue where you definitely clicked on 'Load' instead of 'Save' but who the hell cares about that anyway. Go back and make sure you click the right one xD  I haven't encountered any bugs or problems with the game so far; not now and not when I played it back when it was released for the computer. So anybody who likes RPGs and open-world and a ridiculously interesting story: You should really buy this!
6029	1	a	nice game for couple hours of gaming or when you bored and very cheap 8/10
5827	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/  TL;DR: The developers have been stealing copyrighted content to put in there games, however, this is not the sole reason I am giving this game a negative review, the developers have also been trying to victimize themselves by trying to make a big social media backlash for the DMCAs, and threatens to 'take legal action' against anyone that 'spreads false information' about their situation...
3352	1	a	This sheit is tight yo. Play the role of extinction and laugh at god for doing so
2644	0	a	It was a free weekend, and I wanted to see if it was as bad as people were saying. Words cannot describe how abysmal this game is. Supposedly the devs went through the game and fixed all the bugs.   Supposedly.  Honestly don't waste your time, and certainly don't waste your money.
1256	1	a	An 3rd person RPG lacking a good storyline; reminiscent of something fail. On the contrary, despite it's rather feeble attempt at immersion.  Good fun all around, no forced classes, variety of weapons/play-styles, graphics are good, stable and no bugs.  7.5/10
2452	1	a	Halo ft. Dinosaurs. Still buggy but constantly updated, get some friends, crack open a box of Scooby Snacks and don't go into the long grass
63	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
708	1	a	This is a game I have a love hate relationship with... when I get bored I tend to go back to this game... After playing it for awhile i tend to get fed up and move on to other things but its a very underrated game.
4087	0	a	This game has potential.. to bad the controls are all wonky and bugged. .99$ meh...
1661	1	a	Well if you liked Fable you'll probably like this. Apparently it's a large game since people are putting 100-150 hours into it. I'd say it's a great game. I got it for $12 for the whole collection. I kept passing this game up before the sale and now that I have it I have no idea why because it is a great game.
5516	1	a	It's alright, probably not as bad as a lot of nerds are making it out to be
4098	0	a	Sorry but once I played it.... It was horrible.. I didn't enjoy it.. I was excited about it, but yeah.. Hope the next game you make is actually being a dinosour, story mode. Would be awesome or having them as pets. I didn't get far but if you can do this in the game. Well that would have been interesting to see in trailers.. Something new and epic would be interesting. Not common and same as every other game. Even though this one had lot of different things, It's basic. But it had some pretty cool stuff too. more down than ups..
2152	1	a	Best â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game I have ever played. First time I played this game, I was at school in the librarytrying it out, got ambushed by spiders and freaked out. Everybody around me was looking at me wierd. This is my go to game for when I get bored with Skyrim. I do recomend this game to everybody, however, I must point out that I did not have any problems with running the game or with gameplay.
5905	0	a	this game is garbage. the ai is bad and the teradactals are s op you usually die from them.Also the guns are garbage and the dinos are just focused on the genorator and if it goes offline you loose.  so dont waste the dollar this game is this game should be .0000000000000000001$
2238	1	a	I play this game because its Disciples but im like Disciples II more Disciples II simple and fun more !
4384	0	a	This game is garbage. The devs are shady scumbags that have changed the name of the game twice to dodge bad Metacritic reviews. Look up Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dinohorde. Those two games, and this one, are all the same. Their other game, Project Orion, was taken off steam because of a valid DMCA by Activision where these devs blatantly stole assets from Black Ops 3. And now they are trying to bleed more money out of gullible steam users by having an indiegogo campaign that was allegedly to let them fight Activision in court, but has now been changed to claim its to make up for damages Activision has caused them. Don't fall for their lies. This game is garbage. Project Orion, or whatever they decide to change its name to, is garbage. Don't give these people any money.
1805	1	a	If you're looking for an open world combat and loot game, you've come to the right place. Amalur manages to do exploration and gameplay pretty good.   If you're looking for a game with a good story and fun quests, look elsewhere because it lacks either of those.
313	1	a	Extremely great combat system, decent skill trees and pretty good blacksmithing / sagecrafting mechanics. I definitely recommend this. Chakrams are my favorite weapon in this game lol. Get it!
2707	1	a	Ignore the metascore. I believe it has something to do with a previous iteration of the game. This game is great fun with friends. There are plenty of different game modes and most of the bugs seem to be ironed out. The development team are also constantly adding new features and game modes.  If you're looking for some entertaining co-op or versus action with friends then I highly recommend it.
6300	1	a	The best dino-killing-game ever. Its a fun shooting game, were you don't need to always shoot at player, but in stead have a great co-op. But hey! they got jet pack and medic gun, what can possibly go wrong :D
3666	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
5215	1	a	I got into a knife fight with a Triceratops and lost. 10/10 would play again.
5126	1	a	some pretty fun co-op for a buck.  
3445	1	a	how much sorry?!!! 99p?!! Thats a great deal but the recent updates have made it worse than better. Sad times :( Still it's fun to play coop
4688	1	a	Didn't play the game Still get to make a review 10/10 would review again
4988	0	a	Boring Buggy Mess
4825	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME
1874	1	a	Having tons of fun switching between weapon styles and the fast combat. Reminds me of Fable and WoW mixed?
4396	0	a	It's like Left 4 Dead but with slightly more advanced weapons and Dinosaurs. Oh and vehicles. Oh and there's no map that you progress through, in Orion it's more of just defending a generator (which for whatever reason these Dinosaurs have a vendetta against) and occasionally running away to capture some point that has no relevance to anything. You also get an in game currency for killing the dinosaurs which you spend on other weapons, which are quite expensive. There's a microtransaction shop as well in the game which is a huge turn off even if it is a very cheep game. Third person animations are ridiculously stiff. Also what's with this misleading 'Work together to survive the devastating Dinosaur horde in huge, endless environments.' on your store page? Is it huge or is it endless? It's neither. How can you legally just throw words like that around when it's completely untrue? 3/10, Dinosaur poop.
3077	1	a	Purchased the game watching the videos. It looked like alot of fun. But then a saw that it had such a low metascore... i then thought dumb for buying a game that has a low metascore.. i shook it off and started the game. I loved it!! its alot of fun with friends. by yourself it can get hard. I recommend this game only if you have friends to play it with! 8/10
6211	0	a	Graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. The gameplay is â¥â¥â¥â¥. The sound makes me want to cry. The recoil on some of the weapons are trash. Even if it's only one dollar, I would rather have the 4 gumballs that could buy me.

1275	1	a	Had a save with 60hrs in and maybe 70% done, decided to replay to remind myself what's the plot, now 15hrs in and still having metric sh**tonnes of fun. One of the best RPGs I've played
5256	0	a	A big steamy 75 cents worth turd. There's nothing else to be said.
609	1	a	Good game :) make sure to play on hard mode 1st playthrough as it is hardly any different to normal

2187	1	a	I never write reviews for games, in fact this is my first... This was also the first game where i beat ALL of the game.  Kingdoms of Amalur is without a doubt one of the best free world rpg's out there. With a fast paced combat system that varies drastically depending on weapon choice, a unique doging ability allowing for quick strategy, and an amazing storyline crafted by the great R. A. Salvatore himself, this game is one you should not miss out on. Personally, I am a huge fan of R. A. Salvatore's works and my view on the story may be a bit biased in saying it is top notch, but regardless of how biased my opinion is, any fan of fantasy will respect this story and recognize the genius behind it. The graphics are also fantastic in this game as well; i never had a single problem while running it.  All in all, this was a great game for the price. Plus, if you can grab it on sale, as it is now for 5.99, dont hesitate  updating for nomination badge, still an amazing game
2551	1	a	Very fun game! Great Co-op style and is like fighting a militia.
3370	1	a	nice nut a bit Laggy :/ 
1585	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: reckoning is a great RPG experience with rocksolid gameplay and lots of loot it feels like a mix of Skyrim Diablo and World of Warcraft the world is very immersive and beautiful and it has a rather interesting story line.  +World design +Questing and rewards for doing so +Combat system +graphics and modelling for the gear +Loot and lots of it +Junk bag system +Gorgeous skill system and crafting system +Fast travel to places you've been -Long walks from place to place -Non changable FOV -No mounts :( -Not able to see full stats on stuff you buy -Sometimes hard to differ light from heavy armour  8.5/10 Great game go get while its cheap played it all morning :D if its not on sale you can get the collection for 4-6 TF2 keys
2161	1	a	The game is very good. Graphics and WIDE World access great. Some challenges might be beyond the intellectually stunted, but over-all many hours of inter-active play. Wide assortment of character types and styles. ONE caveat of concern is the loot tables and inventory program....IT IS BUGGED. Stackables items do not always stack. Example: Have a potion stack (limited to TEN), but only have ONE in the que,,,and can NOT loot a drop of the same potion. BANDIT arm bands, normally stack (upto TEN), but some do NOT stack, indicating to me that there is some CODEX diff in the items. The inventory limits for loots can be raised by TEN items per backpacks, which are VERY hard to find. Apparently, there is some rare need to limit ONE to a vendor. Some vendors are really egregious thieves, even in your own Faction. My toon is ArchSage, and has highest level of Warsworn, et al, at the vendors rip him off. Pitiful. Training can be had for a hugh cost, IF you can find the trainer at the appropriate time/level. Otherwise, you have to use your ONE POINT/level to advance skills. NO SKILL UPS for usage, or accomplishments. The LOOT system is badly flawed. due to the stackables NOT stacking in many cases. Also, this time around I made a BAD choice to accept the Niscaru Lord power and that put me as NEMISIS of the Warsworn. BEWARE. No remedy except to start OVER. Shame on EA, et al. And don't do Master level pots as you will use up your Fate Essence and probably NOT have enough to finish the Dragon Boss. Reccomend NOT using the Fate pots untill you get to the LAST boss fight. Hours fighting the Dragon. Failed. Waste of 12 hrs time. And that was level 40 MAXED skills.   ALL SAID, it is worth the sale price, and having logged WELL over 500 hrs, , what with dozens of side jobs, quests, and HUGH world to explore, I would buy it again, if needed. I recommend the game to any adult, with sound moral values, as there is quite a bit of off-color, 'mature' content, suggestive themes, and plainly VILE content. Sire, the world is going to hell in a race-car, but I do not want to advocate capitulation. Keep looking UP....Col JDM
5634	0	a	The graphics are nice (thanks to Unreal Engine) and it's fun for a while, but the game is very buggy, the maps are too big, you have to travel way too far to buy upgrades and weapons, and it get's very repetitive pretty quickly. The only way I'd actually recommend it is if it's cheap, especially since it has lots of in-app purchases and seems like it should be a free to play game. I don't regret buying it since I got it cheap but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're really into dinosaurs.
3649	1	a	Since its $1 im going to ask myself this: Was this more enjoyable then something on the dollar menu at a fast food joint? Short answer Yes Long answer HELL YESSSSS brings me back to when i played turok as a kid 8/10
19	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
4518	0	a	Won't even start up. Tried to restart steam, computer, and reinstalling the game itself but nothing works. I just get the loading wheel then it just says it crashed :/  Honestly I was looking forward to this game but now, I can't even play it! Quite dissatisfactory.
3502	1	a	Okay, now you are sitting here looking at the trailer for the game and see its like a dollar USD... I got it on sale for .50 cents just because I like to collect random steam games. After seeing some of the cool mech and helicopters I decided to try this, mainly out of bordom... then it happend.... im flying around, blasting t-rexs in the face with machineguns and rockets and had to keeping, The only thing I really dont like is how the dinos look. Theother things such as the terran, buildings and mechs like unique awesome and theh multi player is not horrible!  Do it... spend a dollar and have fun!
4833	0	a	Not bad but the animations are a 'bit' weird and not worth 11 â¬,i would take primal carnage and dino d day any day of the week..
2483	1	a	I have to say, this game has turned out to be pretty awesome. Keep up the good work devs, and thanks for making a fun game.
1984	1	a	This is one of the best RPG/Open world Hybrids I ever played. This game makes me wish more games like this existed. It has very sastisfying controls/battle system. It really feels like you are your own character, by the choices you make. Yes, I know the company went under, and there are still bugs, but hell give this game a try if you like Skyrim and the like.
4410	0	a	Did not like it, felt horrible and bulky to play, UI is horrible, idk how there are so many good reviews?! Lack of server hosting, customisations is minute to nothing, would not play again, did not enjoy  3/10
2179	1	a	So, this is gonna be short. This is one of the mosty polished, expansive and fun action RPGs i've ever played. The level of character customization is moderately high when it comes to appearance but the customization of skills is where this hidden gem shines. The backstory for all the drama that went into creating isn't widely understood by many... but i'll say it was a storm of excrement. A damn shame really.  8/10 Deserves a sequel
2134	1	a	Great game if you are lacking rpgs to play  Pros:  -Fun combat systems -Exploration -Unique artstyle -Awesome crafting system -Good Class progression   Cons:  -Story could be better -Needs more avatar customization  -Your character doesn't have a voice (might not be a problem for everyone) -Choices don't really affect the story
2685	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
734	1	a	1. Game is old but still enjoyable. 2. Got error 83 when first attempted to run the game. 3. Never could get EA to accept my account email and password. 4. Tried 3 times to download the game on ORIGIN but the download failed each time. 5. Game cost more on STEAM but at least the download works. 6. Will play the game for a bit before trying the DLC which must be purchased. 
5298	1	a	0 hours played but hey its 1$ and it has guns and dinosaurs thats a winner in my book  will release a full extensive review on this game
6032	1	a	I like the game, though don't expect a whole lot of depth. It's fun for $1, so I would recommend it for that price.
1519	1	a	Aside from the limited gamepad configuration that only allows you to have 4 skills on shortcut (compared to 8 skills if using keyboard and mouse), this is actually a nice little gem of an action RPG. I am not really enthusiastic about digging through the whole main story and the history behind it, but generally find it as solid. I was a bit disappointed that no matter what race our main character is, no changes of plot are given. Your human character starts the same journey and ends it just like your elf character.   The main feature that pulls me to this game is its gameplay. It has a tight control in movements; attacking and switching between weapons are fluid; the battles are fast-paced enough that u will be thrown frantically many times, especially if set to hard mode. Although for more action-oriented gamers, this game is still assumed too easy.
6220	1	a	+This game got dinosaurs like you won't believe  +â¥â¥â¥â¥ tha dinos in a mech suit  +â¥â¥â¥â¥ tha dinos in a tank +â¥â¥â¥â¥ tha dinos with a knife -deinosuchus will â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur â¥â¥â¥ up  +deinosuchus will â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur â¥â¥â¥ up
2553	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
680	1	a	A severly underrated game from a short lived team (Big Huge Games). If you're a fan of action RPGs then this is worth the money.:)
4930	1	a	needs more harambe
765	1	a	games great but great deal of a P.o.a. to install would rather have 10 dentist appointment than reinstall 2nd time. problems not with game install per se itself but idiotic e.a. account.
4583	0	a	as humorous as i thought it was playing for the first five minutes, this game did not sway me into buying into it. even with the sale price of 99 cents at the time of this review. is it entertaining? i'd like to think so? is it worth a dollar? debatable, at times it feels literally unfinished. wait, I take that back, pretty much all the time it feels unfinished. but I did enjoy the few minutes i played it but didn't see it go anywhere past 1 or 2 plays. if free gameplay and a 93% discount doesn't sway me into buying your game then i'm sorry i cannot reccomend buying this game. do play it at least once though. it'll be interesting.
4215	1	a	Hell yes. This game is awesome. Reminds me of the wildly inventive mods of the early 2000s.
3785	1	a	The finest hour for FPS.
5274	1	a	  I LOVE THIS GAME SHOUT OUT TO THE CREATORS IF YOU EVER MAKE A NEW GAME PLEASE MAKE IT AS COOL AS THIS ONE 
1899	1	a	This is like...the best thing. You should get it.
5501	1	a	Hey everybody so I played this game and I'm impressed it's very good and haters gonna hate saddly I stoped playing because I'm on a laptop and my graphics card sux and It's laggy alot and I really mean ALOT but yea I recommend this game and it's under one dollar
5019	1	a	a sick game
3131	1	a	I have no idea why did it take me so long to adore this game. Maybe it's the weird Metacritic score or some bad reviews from random people. I tried the game during free promo weekends and was all like: 'Meh, I'd better play some Killing Floor'. Now, I make a statement that this game is really fun. TONS of play modes, plenty lots of weapons and enemies. I won't say that this is a co-op game where you shoot dinos and stuff. It's all about how YOU play it. Deathmatch, Survival, Rampage, CTF. Weather changes, heavy rain and night time make you almost blind, your FOV can be frozen if you play in Arctic maps. Too much to say. You should really give this game a try? The most I like about it is that you level up. You gain additional damage, guns, ammo capacities and stuff. Buy it! P.S. You can 'arrow to the knee' a T-REX and build turrets! :D P.P.S. You know what would make this game hell? A FLYING BOSS DINO!
5025	1	a	This game is amazing. I'm woundering how could the metascore for this game is low. Coming from someone who loves playing co-op games, this is really fun. Gets really hectic and hard and it's just the way I like it.  Gameplay is Good Graphics is Pretty Awesome Scenery is Amazing if you take the time to look around  There are some bugs here and there that I found but nothing really significant that will alter the game.  Overall I really enjoy this game and is a blast to play with friends :)
5801	1	a	If you think this game is bad, it's not. It is life, it is better than all the steam games combined. If you ain't talking ORION Dino Horde I don't wanna talk!
3232	1	a	this game is the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ I`ve never played for 0.79â¬ and will give u tons of hours of entertaiment
4181	1	a	Rustalions always had a issue with 'The Dinos' this game helps teach my Rustalions warriors how to 'Deal' with them.
2246	1	a	Any map or this game full a lot of quests, thay are interesting and game is really balanced. Desciples 3 was not good but reincarnation much better.
2323	1	a	YOU NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR: THE âI THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARDâ AWARD  Deserving.
2425	1	a	Definitely far from a bad game. If Borderlands had a Horde Mode sponsored by the National History Museum's Dinosaur wing, this is it.
5069	1	a	IT S COOOLLL AS HEC
3986	1	a	This game is amazing! Definitely worth 50 cents
1433	1	a	The gameplay is pretty fun! Unfortunately, mages are underpowered (IMO!). Lots and lots of quests, factions and although the world map seems small at first, it really isn't. You'll be able to pull many hours out of a good RPG, which is a nice change from the 16-20+ hour storylines you constantly see in other games nowadays. Downside is the silly movement you'll experience sometimes: you can't jump and you won't be able to jump down ledges (when there's no jumping point) so sometimes you'll be stuck at an invisible wall that actually is an elevation of the floor. Ahwell. It's still a good game!

6043	1	a	This could be a great game, just needs some more maps, and a little refinement.  Right now though, with some friends, you could have a blast in the co-op. reminds me a lot of Unreal Tourny but with big dinosaurs to take down..   And cant beat this price.. your 'Dollar to Enjoyment' ratio is definitely higher than most of the games in your library right now.  
3421	1	a	It might have been complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ once, but after trying it, it isn't too bad for such a cheap game. Think Killing Floor, except really, really stupid and with giant enemies and vehicles. The hate for this game is a little bit ridiculous at this point, so I suggest getting it once it's on sale and just have some fun. With a more polished sequel with more content and variety it might actually be a great game... Hell, give me a sequel with climbing mechanics from Dragon's Dogma and we have a classic.
4507	1	a	It's like playing Left 4 Dead but with dinosaurs that are also mentally challenged. Also you're mentally challenged. And the big dinosaurs are especially mentally challenged and op 8.75623/5 stars
5046	0	a	It has potential but its not fully realized the game's menus are absolutely horriffic and the chat menu is annoying as hell in game. It seems like a cool idea shooting dinosaurs but needs more polish. ALOT more polish.
1157	1	a	This game is a sure fun and enjoyable game.   Kingdoms is sure one of the better RPG typr games i have played as yet. The pure fantasy and interactive npc's on here makes every story line very intresting.   i suck at reviews but i would take this game over many other games any day, i have played a few RPG's.   There is a downside or two in the game, the sound tracks used seem to not fit in the game too well but still acceptable. amount of side quest that cant be completed is rather high as well.   Buy the game and find out just how wonderful the gameplay is, some might not enjoy it and some will. The prefrence is in your hands.
2699	1	a	Very Fun game for that price. MUST BUY++++!!!!
5345	1	a	Fifty-fifty
3707	1	a	Let's be honest - this game is seriously outdated. But you can still have some fun if you find any friends willing to join you, cause multiplayer is almost dead. I bought it for 13 russian roubles (which is $0.25 now) so it's the cheapest non-free-to-play game ever. Dirt cheap.
4929	1	a	I love this game. Its definitely worth the 99 cents. My friends and I like to take the cars and run the dinos over or take the flying ship things and have two people on the sides so 3 of us get air lifted to the next site. Its kind of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when one of us falls off and doesnt have the no fall damage perk.
5370	0	a	Running from giant dinosaur. Dinosaur gets stuck on a small rock step. Free kill easy wins gg no re topkeklol. 10/10 would not recommend.
4798	1	a	Friend bought this game as a joke. We played it for 3 hours straight. 10/10 we're getting more friends involved.
2986	1	a	Possibly the most fun you'll have with a bad game.  10/10 would bang.
4178	0	a	Very poorly made game. Logic is cringeworthy but it has it's moments. Would reccomend ONLY on cheap sales.
1729	1	a	While not quite to the level of an Elder Scolls game, it still is quite fun.
169	1	a	Despite the company going bankrupt after the launch of this game, this is actually a really solid, involved, RPG. I downloaded it years ago and finally decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.   +Pros -Immense character customization -Incredible variety of equipment -Fleshed-out, interesting characters -TONS of side quests -Innovative, easy to learn/difficult to master combat -A huge, expansive, living world -Lots of lore and background into the world -Interesting, forward-moving story -Crafting/alchemy -Solid DLC -Good enemy variety  Cons: -Level cap of 40, which I hit at about 3/4 of the way through the game -It gets EASY towards the end. The final boss was hilariously simple to beat. -Silent protagonist. -Occasional camera issues -A few bugged quests  As a completionist, doing all side quests, I beat the entire game in about 70 hours. If you are a fantasy RPG fan, you should check this game out when it's on sale.  
1095	1	a	Awesome game, I have played Skyrim, Dragon Age, The Witcher and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's with depth and good combat system and the characters are well thought out with good skillsets to compliment most play styles.
2845	1	a	I really like this game. Totally worth the money, especially if you have friends to play with. The game is still sometimes rough around the edges. For example, the animations aren't as smooth as you expect them to be. Still one of the most fun I've had playing a game. Occasionally, you'll die from something dumb like being glitched into 2 dinosaurs, but I'm looking forward to the game being polished by their updates.
5441	1	a	Cant go wrong for only a dollar, easily the cheapest game on steam and it really isnt that bad, gets better with friends.
1900	1	a	Cool game with nice controls for keyboard/mouse. Try it at harder difficulties and different playstiles.
1668	1	a	Underrated game, better than buggy skyrim in some way.
3777	1	a	Just simply amazing!
2782	1	a	this game is good for 0.99 i dont see why you wouldnt get it i would probably pay 5.00 for this game 9/10 bugs
4135	1	a	at 0.99c its worth it, you and your friends will have fun, my only problem is there isnt enough lobbies
4290	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
115	1	a	(most of my hours in this game are on Origin, not Steam)  A lot of users compare this game to Skyrim, when really it is more like a single-player mix of Torchlight II and Guild Wars 2. Tons of missions, deep crafting, combo-friendly combat, a huge game-world and genuinely interesting lore means a lot of time can be spent in Amalur.  Installed size on hard drive (with all DLC): 11.6 GB  Reckoning is rather like a single-player MMO, if that makes any sense. Looting, crafting and leveling are the primary attractions. There is a ton of loot; putting points into the âdetect hiddenâ skill reveals secret rooms and passageways that have even more loot. You'll want to loot as much as you can, even armor sets that you won't use â put points into blacksmithing, disassemble the armor and weapons you don't want to get the parts, and craft something truly epic. Leveling up provides new abilities, new special moves for weapons. At the end of each leveling session, you get to choose a âFate Cardâ with special bonuses. Fate Cards are not class-specific, meaning you can use them to create a warrior mage who equips heavy armor, or an archer can wield heavy weapons, or a thief / rogue who also has some magic. There are dozens of hybrid âFate Cards.â And if you're not happy with how your build has turned out, visit a Fateweaver to âRemix your Fateâ and reset your build so you can level up again with your existing points.  The world is huge. There are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The graphics are 2012 era DirectX 9: Colorful, bright, and occasionally low-res. The general comic-book style of the artwork hides some graphical shortcomings. And on the plus side, if you have a less-than-stellar gaming PC, the game will probably run just fine. (Back in the day, I ran it on a 1GB Radeon 6670 without issues). The soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope catches the ambiance nicely. The voice acting is generally good (though your hero is silent, a la Dragon Age Origins).  Not everything is excellent, unfortunately. Combat flows well, encouraging the use of different moves. Despite the many different skills and abilities at my disposal, once I found a way to dispose of mobs, I just stuck to that, and never really tried to change up my attacks. I won't say combat is easy â if you go into an area under-leveled, you'll die fast (even with potions). But once you're comfortable in the system, combat becomes just another chore. Fetch quests are repetitive. All exploration is done on foot â no horses. The dungeons are NOT copy / pasted; there's a lot of variety here. But the missions that use the dungeon and cave levels tend to follow similar patterns. If you try to do a completionist run of Reckoning, you'll need a titanic level of patience and dedication. Inventory management, frankly, s*cks. Oh, and jumping. You can't jump, except at prescribed places (âpress F to jumpâ).  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game if you love messing about in an open world while worrying about plot later. If you're looking for a go-anywhere, do-anything adventure (with the freedom to jump wherever you want), you'll probably be happier with Skyrim. Or online with friends in Guild Wars 2. Sometimes, though, a solitary, easy grind for loot is exactly what you want - and exactly what Reckoning provides.  On DLC: The Weapons and Armor DLC provides three complete weapons sets that are accessible at the start of the game. While great to have, the things you craft will quickly surpass them in quality and effectiveness.   The Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel are both large additions to an already massive game. Each provides a new campaign and entirely new areas to explore. Naros in particular is a great piece of DLC. Both have a lot of content in an industry where content-laden DLC are rare. Definitely worth it to get both.  Notes: An EA account is NOT required. Though the game asks for an EA login on startup, you can simply click the X in the corner to skip the login. The game will play and save normally.  The company that developed Reckoning, 38 Studios, went bankrupt in 2013. The only support for the game is what you will find when trawling the forums.
1410	1	a	Story isn't the strongest but exploring the world and gameplay is solid.
223	1	a	This is a really good game and doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The combat system in it is awesome, the landscape is awesome and the world is HUGE. There's also a crap ton of sidequests, and the main story is pretty good too and has a decent length. Lots to do, like alchemy and blacksmithing and there is more than that too. You can mae completely custom weapons and armor too. The graphics are not increddible, but they are definitely not bad.
477	1	a	F-   I think this game is trash, as you can tell by my playtime of 111 hours.
5397	0	a	Wasnt expecting waves of dinosaurs but more of a dinosaur survival game. Not a bad game just not what I wanted or expected.
3082	1	a	Guys this is a great laugh........ give it a try!
4648	0	a	This game is unbalanced as HELL don't buy!!!!!!!
5191	1	a	The Metascore is really bad, but the game is so amazing its like halo but with dinosaurs ! Who wouldn't want that?
5535	1	a	That Game seems really bad but when u playing once its really fun
2491	1	a	best game NA jimmy buy this right now u cok guzler
914	0	a	Im quite sad,,, i played this game and loved it, but it kept crashing every ten minutes.... i did everything i could to fix it but apparently certain computers with Windows 10 just dont work on certain games.. SAD
4294	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
2749	1	a	Best dollar I have spent in a long time. The CoOp is a ton of fun.
2028	1	a	If youâre looking for a solid action-RPG to play, Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning would be a great choice, but itâs not without its faults. My 89 hours at the point of this review are straight after completing the main storyline and the vast majority of the sidequests, but while Iâve enjoyed my time I wonât be going back to 100% or play the DLC any time soon.  The Good:  + Combat is sharp, responsive and entertaining. I played a rogue/mage hybrid, using a combination of either daggers or faeblades, with a bow and magic to support throughout. Once you get used to the combat style, you quickly learn a series of useful combos. I only played briefly with some of the other weapons, but they seemed ok as well. I was using the Xbox 360 controller for Windows that worked really well.  + The creators have put together an interesting world, with a few ideas that put it above the generic tropes it could have fallen into. Lore isnât normally my sort of thing, but I felt more interested in the world than I do with similar games.   + Loads of content. My playthrough was a fairly swift run, despite doing most of the sidequests, and I think I could have padded this out with an extra 10 â 15 hours if I was a bit more thorough. Sidequests are largely solid with a minimal number of fetch quests. The House of Sorrows faction questline towards the end of the game was a particular highlight for me.  However, it felt like the content became sparser as you got closer to the end â with fewer sidequests per area. I remember spending ages in the first area, but got through the final continent in no time at all. Might just be me though.  + Loads of concepts. Blacksmithing, alchemy, two types of lockpicking, stealth, enchanting, hidden items, player housing, interesting collectables â the game feels like it has it all. Admittedly, each of the areas are fairly shallow, but they do help spice the game up.   + The game is fully voice acted with the exception of the protagonist. I know this has annoyed a few, but to me it felt like a conscious choice by the devs to help the player project onto their character. Real choices in dialogue are fairly minimal and the consequences irrelevant, but the voice acting is consistently high quality and there is loads of backstory in the dialogue if youâre looking for it.  + The graphical style holds a nice point between realistic and cartoony. The art is sharp and colourful throughout and works well.  + The game performed well on my mid-range PC, with no slowdown at 1080p. Iâve read that many people had lots of technical issues with the demo, but these seem to have been resolved for the end product. A couple of issues do creep in more towards the end of the game (getting stuck on scenery, interaction with some objects), but nothing gamebreaking at all.  + Lots and lots and lots of loot. Most of it is fairly useless, but the illusion of variety holds strong in the items you pick up.  The Bad:  - Iâm a fairly average gamer, and found the difficulty far too easy after the first 10 hours. Once you find your playstyle and learn how the limited number of beasties attack, you will be in cruise control for the rest of the game. The only times where the difficulty was higher was against mages, where their attacks can be harder to dodge and they also back away from melee types. This is quickly sorted by the âfateshiftâ mode, which offers from stylish killing blows but removes any real challenge.  The difficulty completely fell apart in the last 10 hours for me, as I made my own equipment (without playing the system) that ended with me being so overpowered I was one-shotting most of the regular enemies with my bow.   The final boss also failed to land a single hit on me.  There is an attempt to up the difficulty by making the âharderâ enemies more frequent on the second continent, but itâs too little, too late in my mind.  Itâs worth noting that I was aware of the issues around difficulty before starting, and played through the full game on hard. Iâd recommend that everyone does the same if they are a vaguely competent gamer. A fan made difficulty patch is around if you are looking for more challenge, but I havenât tested it.   I seriously doubt I would have finished the game on a lower difficulty, there would have been no challenge at all.  - Content repeats itself far too often, and disappointingly the developers failed to offer up even reskins to give the impression of there being more enemy types. This extends to the dungeons as well, which are limited to a few themes with only the minority feeling unique. Given the size of the world, this becomes a big issue around the midpoint of the game â I had to take a break from playing for a solid week to avoid getting bored.  - Like almost all games of its ilk, money becomes completely pointless after the opening 20 hours. I finished with about 12 million gold, and this was with salvaging all of the equipment in the last 15 hours. For perspective, the biggest gold sink for me were trainers, who only cost 45k each at the highest level.  I rolled my eyes after a quest to collect a set of books across the world, spanning about 60 hours of game time, rewarded me with 800 gold on my return.  - The main storyline is a disappointment. While I said above I enjoyed the lore of the world, the main storyline was about as bland as it comes â amnesiac protagonist travelling across the world to face the big bad. Amnesia can be played well, but you learn nothing of your past until the final 10 minutes, where one of your companions gives you a load of exposition. A really lazy effort in storytelling.  The main quest also suffers badly from being too sparse. You end up doing a larger quest in the story, but then get sent a few areas across the map before you can progress it further. After doing all the sidequests along the way, Iâd completely forgotten what was going on by the time I reached the next point â this being the only game I was playing at the time.  - The camera, especially in combat, is slightly odd and far too low angle. While you do get used to it, it is a shame there is no flexibility.  Conclusion:  Reading the above, it seems like I donât like the game. Quite the opposite â I really enjoyed my time playing and do recommend it. I think the negative points above stem from the fact that the game is close to greatness, and with a bit more time and direction Big Huge Games could have made something really special. Itâs disappointing to see that they went under after finishing the game â although something this large is a huge task, especially for a first game. I would have loved to have seen a sequel to solve its issues â the finale also set up nicely for the proposed MMO if it was successful.  Overall, this game gets a recommendation from me. If youâre looking for a fairly light action RPG, you could do a lot worse.  
5483	0	a	dimond in the ruff mabey in 2001
5089	1	a	absoolutsly awsome, i would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes action packked FPS games
1706	1	a	You might as well buy it now while it's cheap. As an RPG, it fails. As a pale God Of War imitation, it fails. As a jack-of-all-trades mashup of the two styles, it mildly succeeds. Decent enough for the time investment, and the story's not bad, considering R.A. Salvatore had a hand in it.
1155	1	a	I'm upset with myself for one reason: I hesitated to buy this game. On sale for $5 and with an 82 Metascore, I was still a bit iffy on the game, even though it happends to be an RPG, of which I love. I shouldn't have wasted the time thinking about whether to buy it.  To start, if the game is ever on sale for 5 dollars and you like RPGs to any degree, add to cart.  About the game, you are the reanimation of a fallen soilder from a battle against a new-found enemy awoken from the chaos created by a new Emporer. You first see yourself as a dead body being dropped into a pit, but soon enough you awake atop hundreds of dead who where like you. The story then takes off, introducing you to what will become an exponentially more intense battle style and to a wide system of freedom and choice.   You choose what to say in a ring of different phrases you may speak. These phrases can start quests or make enemies depending on how you choose them, a feature I enjoy.  The system of battle is intense and never gets old. Dodging, shield parrying, and combos all mix to create a battle style I hate to stop playing. You choose, through unlocking powers, active and passive, in one, two, or all three trees of skills. Melee, Sorcery, and Finesse are your three skill trees, with different powers and skills for different playstyles. You can also mix the three trees' skills to create your own style. This customization is wonderful and fun to explore, and I've only scratched the surface.  All in all, 9/10 at least, I am very happy with where my 5 dollars gave me, and the full price is fairly reasonable for such a game. As I said earlier, if you enjoy or respect RPG games in any way, this is most definatly a game to try out.
4404	0	a	Beware this game is not for everyone.  I give it 6/10 and here's a few interesting things about it.  The game feels like a Halo 1 mod. The locations, the power armor, the weapons, most of it's design choices. You could pretend you where playing master chief and you'd feel somewhat at home.  There's a reason for this beyond the art style. It's because many of it's game resources where lifted or âstolenâ from Halo 1. I've played Halo 1 for 5 years give or take and I've really got to know the game, it's physics, it's weapons, maps, everything.   Playing Orion: Prelude I saw a warhog, then I saw the exact same animation when you get off the turret. Then I saw animations from using the melee button from guns. You also realize for a new game it sure looks like it came out in 2001 same as Halo 1.   I had no idea this game was a kickstarter, and it's a perfect example why I've never supported a kickstarter and probably never will. (including paid Early Access).   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/orion-prelude/description   The number of things they say in the Kickstarter and it ends up just all being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Even the in game shots look nothing like this game when you play it. Just watch the video and then compare it to screen shots and videos of the actual game. They promise things like a deep lore, etc. I'm sorry this is just a Horde mode game, and a easy one at that.  The game itself is lots of mindless fun, but so many other games do everything this one does better. There is no sense of challenge, you can easily go on a mountain and shoot all the dinosaurs out of range. You have many weapons and augmentations you can buy to make turn this game into Very easy mode even on medium settings. I can't say for the higher settings.  The game does lack polish. Things like getting stuck in graphics, warping dinosaurs, unpolished animations, etc. When I said it feels like it's a Halo 1 Mod, it sure does due to it's unfinished quality.   The creators are already on their sequel so I wouldn't expect this one to be polished, they probably learn that from EA games.   In itself the game can be lots of mindless fun, but don't expect anything amazing, just like a cheap mod, it's fun to try out, but rarely better then the original.  A few annoyances;  One thing I'd like to point out, you know how in Halo 1 the sniper rifle leaves a white trail, well in this all the bigger guns seem to, so after a while you only see cloud lines and not your target so well. Then you got rain on your screen, you know the dripping water, I was never a fan of this. And in this game it's constant. There are a number of things that make it harder to see your targets but it's mostly just annoying and pointless. Especially then it's raining on your screen in third person view.   I bought this game for 1$, I would be willing to pay up to 2$ but no more. If you want a good horde mode game I'd say Killing Floor tops this hands down.   This is the type of game you have fun messing around and shooting easy targets, but you'd probably never recommend it as anything worth wile. Not â¥â¥â¥â¥, but not great.  
5086	1	a	Good game. Offers lot and lots of fun, even more with friends. Fun concept and easy to learn. High variety of guns, you can play with ( obviously not with dinosaurs ). I found it more enjoyable in co-op mode, not playing as dinosaurs that much. Again you have to decide on your own playstyle. Recommended!
225	1	a	This game has an MMO feel to it without multiplayer, but with many great features such as the combat and crafting system. The setting is very well made, even so the story isnt that amazing. So anyone who decides to buy this game will be playing it for the fantastic gameplay not the lore.
5512	0	a	This is easily one of the worst games i have ever played. The game looks and plays like trash and the developers are disingenuous pigs. DO NOT GIVE THESE MEN MONEY.
5694	0	a	Not what i expected... But gj to the devs anyway
5644	0	a	it's cheap and it feels cheaper
4502	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
110	1	a	Fantastic game but unless you have a major amount of time to burn it is hard to get very far into the game since there is so much content.
2266	0	a	New title needed: Disciples, The Miss Simulator
4021	1	a	This is one of my favorite dinosaur games the graphics is amazing the vehicals in this game are like halo vehicals also like the charactors like like halo this is a halo and a dinosaur game conbined you can fly as well with a jet pack and it is also game of the year and im going with that it is the best game of the year 
2592	1	a	Was â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the start, developers were like 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ me with a mango flavored popsticle, looks like we gotta improve this â¥â¥â¥â¥.' and then they gave us an update more vicious than a hobo hurling out of his trolley in believe of hearing a 5c coin dropping to the ground and seeing you about to pick it up. This game could kill a 78 year old man just by... know what, it probably can't do that, BUT NOT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING YET ANYWAY, this game is still being worked upon to become such a popular steam game that it will have its own store where you can buy in-game items and trade them over the steam community with your beloved friends and other members of this ever growing community, now where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ have we heard of this before???? Till then it will be a 10/10 and HOPEFULLY remain that way after all those traveling salesmen come along and turn this game into a bartering simulator.
2787	1	a	I admit i HAD to give this game a try as soon as i noticed how the devs. mocked their own game, and hey it only costed me like 7 bucks to find a very enjoyable game, yes a poorly designed but fun game and i can only cheer the devs for the improvement they've made so far. With some more work this game could be a coop-dino-classic.  At first glance this game will simply remind you of Halo. The armors, vehicles and even the weapons must be inspired by Halo i must say.  This is a focused co-op wave-survival game which offers several difficulties and competitive modes such as Conquest, Deathmatch and a 5v5 where both teams need to protect a power generator while destroying the enemy's. Very fun.  Graphically the game does not offer anything new, i can be honest and tell you that this aint no eye-candy, at all. They seem old and poorly designed.  Right away you will notice clunky animations aswell. Robotic movements and weapons being held by thin air, dinosaurs that may disappear for a second while they chase your sorry-â¥â¥â¥ making it difficult to kill, specially the small ones.  Dont take me wrong, i really enjoyed this game for a couple of days nowadays i play it when i dont know what else to do and i still find it fun. Remember, like 7 bucks for a fun ride !!   If you are considering if this game is a go or a no-go, please do.
547	1	a	So bad, but so good. The story, characters, and lore of the game are at best forgettable, and at worst utterly nonsensical and irritating. The questing is SO BORING, almost everything is copy pasted with SLIGHT changes in who you get to face smash. The enemy variety is quite low, I don't think there are more than 15 different enemies that fight uniquely outside of the bosses, most of the enemy variety are just skin changes with better stats. The NPCs are very bland and uninteresting. Also, I don't know if it was just me, dispelling was super bugged. I literally could not unlock spelled containers with the dispelling game because it was so bugged, I had to crank dispelling so I could auto-unlock them.  On the other hand, the combat is SO GOOD. Admittedly, their archery doesn't make a lot of sense(THATS NOT HOW QUIVER WORK) but it is still really fun. You get magic, archery, and melee talent trees with different special abilities liberally sprinkled throughout (including Scorpion's signature move). The weapon augment system is kind of interesting, unless you get and finish the Legend of Dead Kel expansion and then you can just use your diplomat to farm the best augments and call it GG.  Overall, I would only lightly recommend this if you are looking for a good hack and slash game.  6/10 would Fate Shift that lone Boggart again.
261	1	a	picked up this one from steam sales. seemed like a crappy low-end rpg at first. started playing it with not much hope. but wham! it blew my mind in no time! totally immense story, effing vast open world map, deep character customization and improvement, and action! lots of it! there soo many things in this game that i am not sure if i could find and do all of them. got me hooked up as much as skyrim or fallout 3. a definite recommendation for the fans of the genre...
671	1	a	It's like fable and dragonage had a child  PROS  Beautiful design and environments neat gear and weapon designs interesting story and lore a super vast number of side quests very cool skill combos and fight style variations very well done skill try and class management  CONS  Repetitive af with tons backtraking ending up feeling like a chore. Had to start rushing just to see what happens in the main story. Sidequests and guild quests are ending up the most boring thing. It's nice to have a huge quanity. But varietion start feeling way too poor very early. Invisible walls in an open world design. It's not too bad, but it's a bit stupid some times.   It's recommended. Especially during special offers.

4667	0	a	Worse the 'Day One: Garry's Incident'. Although the price it one dollar, dont buy it.
2211	0	a	The game has gotten better then other D3 games, But there are TONS of typos, Bad or senceless sentences. they had over a year to fix this but they havent done that. That soooo says no support, so if you get into trouble with this title, your mostly out of luck.
6227	0	a	What a horrible and junk game
561	1	a	From what little I've played of this game, one thing is for sure: I wil certainly be playing it a lot more. The world is beautifully designed and quite a spectacle. The combat and gameplay are incredibly fluid, something I was skeptical about but was quickly reassured. The gameplay style itself is very unique, and it works very well. It combines an Elder Scrolls feel while playing like one of the Fable games.  The combat is more or less very close to 'God of War' and 'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow', but you're always excited to get into a new fight. It's not a chore to battle your enemies, and the use of certain combos and combining skillsets make every battle a fresh experience.  The story isn't anything to laugh at either. It's quite interesting, even from what little I've played so far. I will be replaying this game many times after I finish it, just so I can create new characters and try out new combinations.   9/10
2245	0	a	still very disappointing, interface and gameplay are very cluncky. Nowhere near as good as Heroes, Age of Wonders, Warlock, etc.  The voice acting, music and art are very good though.
911	0	a	The story was pretty good. Game tried to be like Dragon Age: Origins. I just gave up on it, bored me.
2455	1	a	The metascore is definitely something you should just ignore. The developers have really done a fantastic job and I hope that they will continue to do so. The gameplay (survival) can become boring since you're playing it over and over again but if you're playing it with your friends it can be extremely fun. With all the current features that it has e.g. gamemodes, weapons, vehicles etc. that will definitely expand in the future I recommend it.
3001	1	a	If you didn't get this game when it was a dollar you really missed out. Honestly, i would have been more than happy to pay the full $15 for it. i put off actually loading this game and trying because of the low, low meta score, but you need to ignore the **** outta that number until they re-evaluate this gem. I reminds me of halo 1 charcter, vehicle and world design but on a much bigger bigger scale and more polish. it has a solid perk and weapon purchase sytem in game and a meta loadout your unlocking those same perks for you to use in matchmaking. and too top it all of ive hardly experienced any framerate drops, but ive been playing on med graphics when alone and low when online. All in all, on of the best multiplayer games if your lookin to have fun with a group of friends.
4701	1	a	Is good... Don't let those damn critics let you down... Give it a try for pete sakes! Though this review may not sound promosing, try it, play it, and then come here and try to prove me this game is a downfall.
823	1	a	If you're bored as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and like games with no choices but good combat, You might enjoy this
4608	0	a	very poorly made game
5725	1	a	Screw the Meta-critic this game is heaps fun!
4769	0	a	Its not a game with bugs, its bugs whit a game.
4245	1	a	This game is great grahpics may not be the best but content has lots of things in it definatly recommand this game its quite cheap too
5417	1	a	Could use a tutorial Also better than all the new CoD games... srly... WHY DO YOU GUYS KEEP BUYING THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥?
3602	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1319	1	a	Really great game if you just want to sink time into playing a beautiful world. The story is kind of bland but the voice acting is pretty decent. Listening to the fae voices alone makes it worth it. This game has a ton of flaws but is overall good. Don't buy this game expecting excellence. It does everything it set out to do well, not great but well. It's a really decent game and if you don't go in with high expectations you'll be pleased. The breadth and variety of environments is great. One of the best things this game has is that it looks great and there is always minor backstory to be found while exploring giving a little more depth to the world. This game is kind of like that netflix show you put on when your bored but not really paying attention, its fun, doesnt demand attention, and you walk away satisfied. Get it on a sale and you have great ROI, a completionist could easily put 60 hours into this game. At a 5$ sale your only paying ~ 0.08$ per hour. More cost efficent that netflix! (Maybe) Go buy this game and enjoy yourself! 
626	1	a	To its core, kingdoms of amalur is a MMORPG but not MMO. Quest spread around the world, massive in scale and length. Not extremelly versatil in the combat aera though many weapon are available they sometimes feel the same in your end. Regardless the art style mass scale and variety of the environnement makes this rpg a very good one well worth your time.
3999	1	a	Tl:dr although this game is only a dollar, it's still fundamentally broken and loses it's charm after a couple of hours   Longer version. Orion prelude is a game about killing Dino's in space. It's a cool idea but it gets boring quickly. The main gamemode 'Conquest' consists of killing Dinos defending your base and capturing more land. It's fun, but after around 5 hours the different weapons and skills make no difference. The other game modes are more of the same and are not a printed are conquest. Although the devs fixed the Dino A.I the CPUs are still broken. I don't recommend playing by yourself for more than a hour.  To wrap up the game is worth a dollar, go ahead and buy it but it's not worth more than around 5-10 hours
3235	1	a	8/10. A few bugs, but still really fun.
4209	0	a	I do not recommend this because it's a buggy, unfun mess.
98	1	a	A simple fantasy-themed card fighting game based loosely on poker.  It's debatable how much tactical depth there is here, and how much 'role playing' there is on offer. Maybe one to avoid if you're after something with real depth.  Nevertheless it does possess just enough of something to keep my attention. As a simple/casual game to de-stress to it ticks the box.
1976	1	a	This game is addicting if you like RPGs. Very fun, though a little bit slow at first. The story and the DLC's will suck you in fast, though, and is definitely worth a play.
2224	1	a	very good game,i recommend to anyone :)
5528	0	a	It worked extremely slowly on my old computer and no servers were up. Keep in mind, this was some time ago. I do not understand why I must re-buy this game to play it now.
6161	1	a	Great game :) Don't expected an indie multiplayer/coop shooter to be that good :)
2174	1	a	Underrated af, but still a great and fairly gorgeous game! Seriously, the voice acting is top notch!
3151	1	a	Cheap and pretty fun. It's a win-win.
6345	1	a	There is no reason why you should not own this game. It's $0.99! Buy the 4 pack and gift it to your friends!
4375	1	a	One heck of a game if you start playing it ,hard to stop. Cuz so much fun ^^
1397	1	a	like skyrim, but with better hair.  also I havent left my house in days.
3600	1	a	Now when I bought this game I thought it would just be a cheap dinosaur game, but I was wrong. This game is amazing, I recommend it to everybody who loves Halo because it kind of has that halo futeristic style feeling. Good Job guys at spiral!  Pros: 1. So many achievements (I'm an achievement junkie) 2. Gamemodes are great 3. Fun single player and multiplayer experience 4. Great gameplay 5. Great controls  And why did Metacritic hate this game so much?
1989	1	a	A fantastic RPG that has good gameplay, decent story, and great leveling and item implementations.
4744	1	a	Although I have only put about 5 hours into this game (as I have to update it and been wanting to install other games first), this game is addicting!! Halo meets Star Wars vs Jurassic Park! Incredibly broken but my brother and I couldnt stop laughing from the sheer insanity of it all!! Shows what a .99 game can do and outshine some of those games that want $19.99 and are just subpar. What are you doing here still? BUY IT MEOW!!!
4979	0	a	I don't write reviews. But when I do, it's cuz the game sucked.
5993	1	a	ORION: Prelude is one of the best games I have ever played thats under 15 dollars. This game should be $10.00, definitly would recomend. Buy it.
116	1	a	Great game, spent a lot of time on quests. Stable, good looking and nice voiceover. It felt a bit tedious at certain points but at the end it was a great experience.
4211	1	a	ORION: Prelude has changed me forever. It has made me a different person.
5757	0	a	call of oblivion: the taken assets
2169	1	a	Flawless in nearly every way its possible to be. Would have been much better with co-op play but the world design and gameplay are fantastic, if a little to godmode once you get the hang of it
5948	0	a	The best part of the game was when I uninstalled it. 10/10
6334	1	a	Great game, don't trust Metacritic's broken system
5109	1	a	Get it on sell I bought a 4 pack for $3 me and friends love it so much
5857	0	a	crap bob poo and infected pee
5705	0	a	I rather buy a big mac.
3729	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'
4738	0	a	bad optimization. I meet minimum specs but still forced to turn town resolution and graphics-everything looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥
2193	1	a	This is a great RPG to lose yourself in. Has just about everything you would expect from most MMOs without the hassle of ninja looters!
5007	1	a	Have you ever wanted to shotgun a T-rex in the face and fly away with a jetpack only to realise that he has the ability to bite the ground and throw it at you? Oh, you're in for a treat in this one...
2879	1	a	This was 39p
134	1	a	An excellent RPG. Simplistic combat system, but i like that it's not needlessly complicated. No need to open a UI and allocate combat options every time a conflict ensues. World is fairly open, seemingly endless quests and gorgeous graphics.
4651	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
5879	0	a	Okayish game, horrible devs. Changing the name of their game, TWICE, to avoid bad metacritic scores. Stealing assets. Playing the victim after Activision calls them out on it and slaps them with a DMCA notice. Pretending to take the high ground by saying 'I won't retaliate against Activision' and then writing walls of text doing exactly that. Laying employees off after taking their work. Threatening to sue the 'kids' of reddit for all they're worth. Throwing a temper tantrum and saying 'OMG I WAS HACKED BY ANONYMOUS.' 'Flexible funding' on indiegogo and then funding the required $500 themselves. Deleting negative comments and anyone who disagrees with them the slightest. How anyone could continue to support him is beyond me. I'm returning these products immediately and I encourage everyone to do the same.
2840	1	a	its like cod bo3 with dinosaurs.
649	1	a	I got this game the day it game out on 360. It is one of the best game I have ever played. If you can get it on sale do. If you miss the sale and have the money and don't have it yet..get it. I have only ever played with a 360 controler so can't speak to the KBM controls. The combat is fast. And once you get the hang of it yes it can get ez. The DLC is fun and worth it I think. The added gear from the none story DLC is way OP so I would only use it if your having a hard time. O and play on hard.. there are Mods but I have used none. The base game is a rock and is what I judge all other action combat games buy...anyway play it.
4232	1	a	Very Good Game heavily suggest it... however get you connection ready for the amazing dino chaos; they swarmp you litrely it's... SOOO COOL!!! 9/10 (could improve on the paid customizations make a in-game monet system for to look awsome without spend too much money *not complaining on the prises*)
2001	1	a	This is probably the only(?) good game EA has their name on.  Yes, I said it. EA has a game that doesnt have stupid microtransaction baits, terrible graphics that are 10 years behind everybody else or pay-to-win DLC.  Primarily, it is because the game is very, very easy. Not you-will-always-win easy, you are perfectly able to lose, but it does follow the somewhat shallow trend of 'click this button and youÂ´re doing good!' type of gameplay. DonÂ´t be afraid to start off the first playthrough on hard, especially if you are used to RPGs or even brawlers. If youÂ´ve played any of the recent Batman games, this combat will feel somewhat home-y to you. The Might tree is your 'Warrior' playstyle, Finesse covers 'Rogue' and 'Ranger' and the third and final tree, Sorcery, handles all your Wizardry needs. And because the game is this easy (due somewhat to the fact that healing potions are plentiful, even solely from drops/vendors and have NO cooldown despite being full heals unless youÂ´re using the first ones at endgame) any player who can handle themselves will gravitate towards the Finesse tree to don the armors that boost damage the most. Magic especially has little merit since it really is just a Finesse Bow playstyle without the critical hits. Not to say that you canÂ´t don a shield and robe and play through this game as a tanky wizard; ThereÂ´s a specialization for that!  In fact, there are specializations for pretty much ANY playstyle. Whether you want to go for a 'pure' playstyle of absolute wizardry, Teleport around in plate armor while firing lightning bolts or be a complete Jack of All Trades, the games Destiny card system will have bonuses that suit this playstyle. You can truly go into combat however you want and not feel like you're doing something the designers didnÂ´t think of. (Unless youÂ´re like me and just want the damn teleportation aspect without spending the points in Sorcery to get it ;~;)  That is probably also one of the selling points of this game, to start off with; The combat flow is GORGEOUS. Without a doubt, the spectacle of combat (At least dual-wield combat, from my playthroughs) and the flow between enemies is pretty much the same as in the Batman: Arkham [Word] games, only without the QTE prompts to avoid hits or change targets. Instead, abilities, dodge rolls or even teleportation lets you avoid big hits and zoom between enemies to perform more beautifully animated combos. You can feel the weight behind the heavier weapons, and the devs know exactly when to slow the game down and where to hold on a pose to get the most out of each hit. Even though youÂ´ll be seeing the same exact hit combo throughout 95% of the game (the Main Story which I completed in 34 hours, with casual but active side questing in between) you wonÂ´t grow tired of seeing it.  As for the visual style, the game is best described as if World of Warcrafts art team had to design for Skyrim. You have large, beautiful world areas with lush forest, canyons with huge rock structures and shapes and wide open plains but still kept in a comic book-y, colorful palette that is almost like a childs imaginary world. The game is played in third person, but try and remember to turn the camera and look around, because it is indeed a beautiful game to immerse yourself into.  So, SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME? I would definately say yes. I got it for â¬20, and for that price it is well worth the fun youÂ´ll get from the base game alone. If youÂ´re the type of person who likes to replay the game, but in a different way, the Destiny cards definately allow for tons of fun here.  Now, thereÂ´s also 2 DLC areas, the Legend of Dead Kel and the Teeth of Naros. IÂ´ll quickly cover these two;  THE LEGEND OF DEAD KEL DLC: This DLC is very well suited for those who just finished the main quest line and want some more Kingdoms of Amalur, and get the best items. A big thing at the end of this DLC is that you gain very, very easy access to lots of Blacksmithing materials, which makes it a billion times easier to craft the best armor possible (Not needed in the slightest, but hey, if you want to catapult a giant across the map with a sneak attack, hereÂ´s the way forward!) once you complete the quests to own your own keep. The story takes you to Gallows End, an island ravaged by Dead Kel. You meet a small town of survivors who seem to pray to an otherwise unknown god, and through ship stealing and offerings for human possesion, youÂ´ll uncover who this god is, why Dead Kel is angry at everyone on the island and just how owning a pet rat is actually quite a neat thing.  The DLC is feels relatively short in terms of the main story, but considering the â¬10 price tag and all the side content that you have to enjoy, IÂ´d say it earns the price tag. ItÂ´s not needed (nor is any other DLC) to enjoy Kingdoms of Amalur, but if you have the spare euros and want an evening or two of fun, then you can safely purchase this one. ItÂ´s just as good as the rest of the game, and even introduces an interresting AOE mechanic from a new mob (even if it is just a reskinned enemy skeleton). I reccomend to download and play this after reaching the level cap at 40 (or, if you are short a few levels and donÂ´t want to spend an hour or two farming mobs, 35+) for the best rewards for your effort.  There is only one problem, and that is that the final quest has a somewhat buggy NPC AI that doesnÂ´t always go where you need(read NEED) it to go to end the last main quest. Look on the unofficial wiki for a couple of easy ways to fix your NPC pathfinding at the end. As long as you donÂ´t save once youÂ´re standing on the beach with no NPC in sight to talk to, you should be able to reload the earlier (quick)save and fix it right up. DonÂ´t let this scare you, just be aware of it :)  THE TEETH OF NAROS: I feel this is really the one where EA might have shoved the content out without some proper QA. If you look this up on the unofficial wiki (AND YOU SHOULD!) youÂ´ll realise there is a downright scary amount of bugs that can hardlock your character in this region. I reccomend saving outside the DLC area before and after going in (checking no bugs occoured of course) and only saving inside using F5 to quicksave and F9 to quickload. Look up every quest to be aware of potential bugs. As with the bug I just mentioned, they are avoidable with reloads, but there are so many you really want to look up what youÂ´re doing.  The DLC feels a tad bit shorter than the Dead Kel DLC, but perhaps this is just because I rushed the main story for the reason I just mentioned above.  This area looks and feels very different from the rest of the game, with an obvious roman/greek influence. I feel the main selling point (besides some more KoA fun!) is the it offers the best core components for weapons in the game, better than the Prismere available otherwise. Perhaps best is that if you, like me, feel Prismere looks more like rock candy than deadly crystal, these components resemble the earlygame iron counterparts, but with better damage than prismere. If youÂ´re sad that your OP weaponry looks horrid, this DLC fixes it!  Overall, if you donÂ´t mind being careful with (quick)saves, itÂ´s also worth another â¬10.  Oh, and as for the weapon pack, itÂ´s not endgame related and NOT needed. DonÂ´t waste money on it. YouÂ´ll get more fun out of throwing the bills out the window and watching the wind catch them as they fly away.
872	1	a	i love this game
6018	1	a	Good for 50 cents.
4266	1	a	i ate chilli last night so i can take a â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is better than this game 
4893	1	a	Played this game before seeing the metacritic review and was surprised to see how low of a score it got. It's actually been a lot more fun than i thought it would be, I've found myself putting hours into it so far and for the price it's worth it. Maybe because I grew up playing turok and loving dinos ( especially Killin um) that makes this game so much fun!
4185	1	a	Best game ever played it for DAYS!! Thumbs up god work!!!!!!
6107	1	a	fun game to mess around in and its so cheep
1107	1	a	This is a very enjoyable, well made, easy to play, and i highly reccomend it. It's currently cheap, and 100% worth it if you like the genres. 
4612	0	a	This game have good gameplay but you get bored preety fast and there are a few players.Don't recommand it.
2478	1	a	worse than cancer 10/10
1318	1	a	Simply put, game looks great, story was alright, but the item progression REALLY killed it for me. The world was pretty big with plenty to do, but I didn't want to carry on because I don't feel excited about the gear I get, especially when what seemed to be epic bosses dropped.....blues, just like every other monsters. Also, the special moves are not always valid, so I felt like doing basic attacks the whole game  But it's a pretty good filler if you are running out of RPG games to play  pros - pretty nice art-style - fluid gameplay - 'cool to pull off' combo attacks - large variety of weapons - good enough story  cons - un-interesting quests - EXTREMELY boring items
1963	1	a	Overal nice graphics and locations desing.For me too colorfull.Good voice acting,good combat system and combination of character class also skills,lots of weapons, armors and side quests.DLCs are pretty cool. Here comes somethink about story ....... nothing special or maybe its beacause of so long long and repetitive gameplay, that you will lost point even its just the good against evil.NO chance of changing something in story(truly just little).Camera is also strange sometimes get stuck or its to close or far.This game is for fans of WOW or Lineage,if youre looking for something really good i will choose Witcher or Masseffect series thats my favorites rpgs. 7/10
1672	1	a	This game is a lot of fun if you want more of a casual type of RPG. The music from Grant Kirkhope is fantastic.
3055	1	a	well well, let me see... after a long break i have returned to Orion: Dino Horde .. it's fun.. with the right people, the job get's done easily..   do note, if you're planning on hosting a game, have a powerfull CPU.. a 4-core core2 series cpu won't do the job in later rounds..
5912	0	a	Paying for a game that becomes f2p? its like guild wars 2 all over again. I'M HAVING FLASHBACKS
1893	1	a	I played this on Playstation and it was soooo good I just had to get it on PC too!
5394	0	a	probably the worst game i played for 10 minutes
5113	1	a	Drive around in a jeep with an auto-aiming gun, firing at extinct dinosaurs with high technology.  I'd play more if it wasn't extremely laggy for me. Fun game, though. Cheap, too.  Play it. 
1118	1	a	It's a really good game, only problem is that it's terribly easy to cake walk through it.
6206	1	a	Ok, so: Automatic weapons? Check. Jetpacks? Check. Dinosaurs? .....DOUBLE CHECK!  This game is WAY fun! I'm not sure how anyone is finding this boring. YOU FLY AROUND ON JETPACKS AND SHOOT DINOSAURS WITH SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY.  'Nuff said. If you don't own this, you're wrong.
6260	1	a	When I saw the graphics in the game, it took me back to the year 2002. Ah yes the early days of the PS2. The summer of 2002 was a great summer. I was a young lad of 13 years old. I wore Hawaiian shirts every day and drank Sprite Ice as I rode my mountain bike my parents got me for my 12th birthday. I would visit my friends who skateboarded. I would try and jump the skateboard ramp on my mountainbike and crashed horribly. I ripped one of my Hawaiian shirts doing this. Boy, was my mom sore with me. Those were the last days of my innocence. After these precious moments, I grew up more and more each year. My mountain bike eventually passed down to my brother, as did my Hawaiian shirts. Summer became autumn. Autumn became winter. And so on. The ps2 got better graphically. Then the ps3 came out. Then the ps4. Most of my skateboarder friends are dead now. Sprite doesn't make Sprite Ice anymore. Thank you, ORION: Dino Horde. 10/10.
1978	1	a	For all the drama on the studio and poor business decisions, this is a damn great game. It probably would have been a gigantic hit if it had not come out around the same time as Skyrim, which raised the bar exponentially for what an action-rpg should be. But that doesn't mean it's not a great game in it's own regard; it just had the misfortune of coming out and being instantly last-gen. I still like the combat system better in Reckoning, but to be honest, I wish Skyrim had Reckoning combat more than Reckoning had the Skyrim lore/world/graphics.
4223	1	a	Fighting against hordes of dinosaurs? How much better does it get?!
1179	1	a	Really enjoyable so far. Reminds me a bit of Fable to be honest. Oh wolves sort of at the begininng..... really annoying!
5980	1	a	I should by all means, not be enjoying myself.  The textures are quite subpar, GUI is of sketchy quality, animations when viewing another player is non existent, it still runs on DX9, and the list goes on and on and on.  But I can't bring myself to hate this game, it is just so much fun.   The idea of killing dinosaurs in a survival setting with teammates is absolutely great, and the gameplay is something I can't really describe with words other than fun incarnate. This is way more fun than it should be. Dare I say that this is more fun than most recent Call of Duty game, and when you consider that all of that is done at a very low price, this is a game that is worthy of being added to the Library.  Seriously, just buy it. It's cheap and it's a great game, what more do you want?
3576	1	a	An interesting mix of Dino's meets Killing Floor. Not a bad game but the lag is noticable, even as host which is annoying. Animations could be much smoother and enemy AI leaves much to be desired. Still though, for 1 dollar, it's a steal.
4546	1	a	I don't care what people say, this game is worth at least $15 but I payed .99c for it. I killed a Triceratops and a Stegasaurus with an op tank but was run down by a massive Spinysaurus. Get it, play it with friends and enjoy it. 10/10 It's Halo with dinosaurs.
3630	1	a	it's like halo but with dinosaurs 10/10
3568	1	a	This game is a great shooter that is tons of fun. A great game to play with friends and to play either PvP or rounds of horde against monsterous Dinos. The game can be a bit laggy and the animations are a little off but if you can put that aside it is a very addicting game and promises lots of fun. There are a decent number of weapons to equip and there are 3 classes you can choose from giving the player a nice variety when playing. Try out new guns and see how they destroy dinos as you try to survive.
3967	1	a	Great game I love it the Meta Critic score is bs atleast give it a GOOD try and its amazing!!!!!!!
6123	1	a	This game is a beacon of peace and love. Here you see carnivores and herbivores working together, to kill you. Creatures that are natural enemies put their diferences aside to achieve a common goal, and it's beautiful.
5921	0	a	i pay for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ !!! now its free... fku dev team...
4735	1	a	Killed a stegosauraus by shooting it in the â¥â¥â¥â¥. 12/10 BEST GAME OF ALL TIME
5741	1	a	This game is a little like passing a kidney stone made out of angels.  Space robots fighting dinosaurs is something i only knew about from the ramblings of my drunk uncle when i was but a child, to be able to experience it first hand, brings forth a feeling of pride, honor and dinosaurs to me.    If you like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥, buy this game.  If you don't like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥ please consider sounding with a fire extinguisher.
801	1	a	More cartoon then skyrim but entertaining

4201	0	a	WARNING THIS IS JUST ME RANTING ABOUT HOW â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND UNFINISHED THIS GAME IS.  The rant: This game is a cheaply made clone of halo trying to be original by throwing in some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaurs. At first I was excited when I booted up the game and played for a few minutes, 'aww yeah this is fun' then it hit me these guns all feel like toy guns that shoot little plastic balls and feel really underwelming. so you are either shooting at enemy players that all look like a ridiculous version of Zero from borderlands 2 but with more LED lights glued to their suits or you are shooting some stupid as â¥â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs. It is full of bugs, glitches and this game should of at least been finished before they released it. Oh wait this is the finished product, let me just shove that Â£0.59 up my â¥â¥â¥. Oh and all the maps are big open planes with a few rocks and if you're lucky a puddle of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing water.  The pros: This game would be okay if you were playing it with friends for less than 30 minutes before deciding to go back on PAYDAY 2 because all your friends you were playing with have killed themselves.  Thanks for reading, now im going to go play with my balls.
280	1	a	A must play!!!
4716	0	a	It's endless rounds of the same objectives over and over, there is no winning this game. You instead keep fighting hordes of dinosaurs until you die, then you can try to do better again I guess. It has ZERO plot, dinosaurs and unnamed futuristic Soldiers. This game must have taken the designers all of three minutes to come up with. I was hoping fr something like Turok and was very disappointed.
3026	1	a	I got this for $0.99. 100% worth it. Great game to kill some time with your mates and a lot better than the usual Zombie Horde kind of games.  It's cheap and fun. Why not. Just like a street hooker.
6304	1	a	No point reviewing this game because it is the best game ever created
5570	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT COSTS 0.99 $ BETTER BUY JETPACK JOYRIDE OR ANGRY BIRDS OR WHATEVER JUST DONT SUPPORT THE CRAPY WORK OF THE DEVELOPERS
4928	1	a	this can all be decribed in one word... superfuntaculasamazeingaddictingbestthingeverdinosaursfulmazeing (pronouced- super funtaculas amazeing addicting best thing ever dinosaursful mazeing) NOW PLAY IT OR DIE OF OLD AGE!!!!1111ONE ONE ONE ONE UNO UNO UNO UNO BEARS BEARS BEARS BEARS  now walk the dinosaur
2896	1	a	This game is optimized worse than a giraffe for raising a baby. It runs terribly, looks MUCH worse than in the screenshots, dinosaurs are dumber than Donald Trump running for president, all of the sfx are ones I hear in flash games on kongregate, and the price is a couple dollars over what I would pay. Also, i'm reccomending so people actually see it.
195	1	a	One of the games that got me into playing, so underrated!
191	1	a	Not bad at all. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this game. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was a well-fleshed out single player RPG with a very Blizzard-esque art style. The combat is active and lively, the progression is deep, and exploration is rich. Story is a weak point, but otherwise it's hard to find fault in this one. I'd give it a go if you're in the market to sink a fair amount of time into an active combat RPG.
422	1	a	play this game. now. why are you still reading this? buy the game, download it, and play it. im serious.
5594	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
697	1	a	one of few rpg games i enjoyed playing.. greet story line and good fighting system , i love games which enable u to make ur own talking script and equipment .. any one loved (Dragon age ) games he must try this 1 ...
2354	1	a	Futuristic shooter with Dinosaurs. Lots of Defense game modes that mainly consist of surviving waves of dinosaurs and protecting your base from them. 9\10
921	1	a	Not the most innovative RPG, put the gameplay is really good, so it will keep you playing.
5689	0	a	If you really need to look at negative reviews for a 99 cent game you probably shouldnt be playing videogames.
1979	1	a	A great fun RPG. There is a ton of content and area to explore.
4365	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
6091	0	a	worst game ever lol
4540	0	a	If you're buying this game recently, don't it doesnt work.
700	1	a	Love the overall impact of the game especially how the combat works. Gameplay is also good and also for the art!  Issue:  The game crashes after a few minutes when opened in Windows 10. I hope that this will be updated.
92	0	a	Don't let the tags fool you; this is not an RPG. A Royal Flush deals the same amount of damage in hour 1 as it does in hour 5. My 1st steam purchase where I felt I wasted my money.
4557	1	a	As a man of simple tastes, this game strikes my interests at heart. I like shooting and blowing things up, and I also have a tender love for dinosaurs. When I saw this game, a game where these two interests collide, I bought it. I have not regretted it one bit. Although the game doesn't have the amazing technical aspects of other shooters, it still retains the fundamental goal of the game; make dinosaurs playable and shootable. That's all I need.
6292	1	a	This is an awesome game. Need to fix some of the small glitches though from where dinosaurs can move to / can move from. But apart from that, its all good!
97	1	a	Amazingly fun game. Unfortunatly it lacks multiplayer and even after a year of waiting, it seems like the Devs aren't too keen on expanding what could have been an incredible thing,
1471	1	a	I've spent 7 plus hours on this one and so far I really like it. It works really well on Windows 8.1. It's well worth the price in my opinion.
2836	1	a	somebody clean up my â¥â¥â¥
4850	1	a	is this even a game-dankay kang
4835	0	a	Not even worth 99 cence, this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pile of dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ topped with asscheeks
3263	1	a	What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥
2347	0	a	The devs jumped ship to release another copy of this game under the name 'Orion' to avoid the press on this game because they stole assets and fired their artists right before release so they didn't have to pay them and are now playing the victim and claiming it's a witch hunt because 'they're a small studio and wahhh AAA publishers are mean'.
1802	1	a	A truly amazing game. Beautiful graphics, intense gameplay, vast open world, and incredible storyline.
6248	1	a	Very addicting
4383	0	a	Lol besides the fact that they changed the games name...Its a pretty bad game

3951	0	a	Where do I start... well this first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The first game of the Halo franchise, it was released on November 15, 2001 as an exclusive launch title for the Xbox gaming system, and is considered the platform's 'killer app.' More than five million copies were sold worldwide by November 2005. Microsoft released versions of the game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2003, and the surrounding storyline was adapted and elaborated into a series of novels, comic books, and live action web shorts. The game was later released as an Xbox Original for download onto an Xbox 360 HDD.   5/10 only semi-enjoyable with friends. Other than that sucks major grunts ya feel me.
144	1	a	Such a shame about 38 Studios going under -- this is one of my favorite games of the past 5 years. Wonderfully polished, beautifully realized world with all the loot, spells, enemies and environments you could ask for in an RPG. Playing in Big Picture Mode is especially delightful and the story is fantastic as well. --Highly recommended!
5670	0	a	Pings were so high!
2365	0	a	What a huge piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Very poorly optimized.  Framerate is poor and drops constantly. Specially when the dinos come.  Unplayable, unenjoyeable.
1082	1	a	This is definitely a hidden gem because I had no clue this game came out. The best way I can describe it is combine Fable with Dragon Age, and then update the graphics from both games. This game is amazing so far, only regret I have is not buying the Collectors Edition or the all DLC content edition. Please, you can't go wrong for $4.99!
5431	0	a	Dino Horde pfft...... *whispers is not goood because i hvent played it* 
815	0	a	KoA: Reckoning is a single player take on the MMORPG formula complete with hundreds of uninspired fetch-quests and tedious, loot-driven character progression. I am actually relieved to have suffered a game-breaking bug 23 hours in, as I hadn't been enjoying myself since the 15-hour mark.
3544	1	a	I got this game when it was on sale for a couple of dollars, personally after playing it it would have probably been worth 3-5 times what I paid for it. I don't know why the rating score is so bad but this is a very fun game, not necessarily an enormious amount of depth, but still very fun and fairly memorable. Sometimes thats all that matters, so definetly if it goes on sale go ahead and try it, you may not LOVE it but who doesn't like killing dinosaurs :)
1137	1	a	I wasn't expecting much when I went into this game, given its lackluster reviews. Ended up pouring almost 100 hours into it. The story isn't amazing, but not bad. The exploration and gameplay are great. It plays a lot like the first fable as far as combat goes. I probably wouldn't recommend it to a non RPG fan, but if you're looking for something to fill the gap between TES/Dark Souls/Dragon Age type games, this will do the job well. It's a shame there won't be a sequel.
4073	0	a	This is most likely the worst game i have ever played. I would literally need so many combinations of drugs just to tolerate the bugginess. Its legitimately horrible but its a great joke gift for friends.
4620	1	a	It's like Borderlands with dinosaurs.
4451	1	a	Really fun game
6335	1	a	Truely, with a dollar, you can't buy many things. A candy bar at most, but this game is truly worth a dollar if you got one, especially if you have some friends to play it with you.
216	1	a	This is an amazing little gem, it has all of the characteristics of an early Skyrim but it is simple enough to play, I would recommend this game because of the playability which is second to none. Its really easy to pick up and you can play to how you prefer to play it in terms of fighting style, there are 3 base classes to choose from, which in turn, each have a complex tree of varying combinations of classes. The world you play in is a very vibrant one, full of colour and texture. There is alchemy, blacksmithing, you can upgrade certain weapons and armor and best of all, for all lovers of RPG's, there's plenty of loot. Money is scarce at first but after a dozens missions or so under your belt and you will see how quickly your money can build up. You can level up your character, choose as you will because you can always change completely at anytime by visiting Fateweavers who will, for price, reset your levels so that you can rebuild to a different style.
3197	1	a	Billions of great experiences and action in a 1 dollar game! 
3595	1	a	If you've got like 4 friends who really like either dinosaurs or shooting things this is going to be a blast for you. Easily 10 hours of gameplay.   And then theres people like me who like driving people around in awesome vehicles. I'm kinda wierd but this game scratches that itch too.   Just call me Mr. Transporter.
6017	1	a	Hey doode? Want to go on a dino safari? Then jump in my jeep and go!   Seriously - it's the best Road Kill adventure that you mayhave in any game.  I pretty frakking gurantee you will lauch you pants off.  Also for this price, everyone who hates this game - I will run you over personally and take your hands!
5875	0	a	ORION: Prelude  This game is fun enough, fairly basic but fun to spend some time shooting up dinos and whatnot. But the reason I don't recommend this game is due to the company actions and the CEO David Prassel.  The Trek Industries and the CEO David Prassel have lied and mislead customers multiple times, two instances being them trying to 'rename' the game in order to get a new MetaCritic score and get people to essentially pay twice for the same game, and the most recent being Trek Industries initiating a slander campaign against Activision. Previously, David Pressal has also treated employees with disrespect, firing them once they completed their work and before they were paid.  DO NOT SUPPORT THIS KIND OF DEVELOPER
3494	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1053	1	a	I'm giving it a yes for now but I don't know what it is that bothers me about this game, the comabte , is good, the stories are interesting. I just don't know I feel like it's elder scrolls put into a fable game without the soundtracks. It is a good game don't get me wrong it's that I don't have a want to play it.
5749	0	a	Do not buy this game, even as cheap as it is... the Dev does not deserve a penny for all his stolen assets.  Search 'ORION DMCA' and you will find a reddit post explaning everything.
1046	1	a	I've only played a little bit of this game so far but I'm already loving it. I wouldn't really call it an 'Open World' like it says in the tag but the map does look pretty huge. I can see getting alot of gameplay out of this one:)
2499	1	a	PHEW *Wipes Sweat From face* Just got done playing a conquest on wave 30, man what a ride it was.  It was litteraly the most enjoyable 2 hours spent on a match i've ever had!  There was never a dull moment each part had action killing murdering beating down dino noobs across the tundra. Got in my VTOL/Helicopter started wrecking all types of dinos across the map I felt like the damn ice age myself the way i was killing those dinos.  DOUBLE KILL TRIPLE KILL MEGA KILL ULTRA KILL ARMAGEDDON LAST BUT NOT LEAST BRING ME SOME PIZZA!  Those are the coolest kill streak quotes in the game i feel like a damn boss when they guy is telling me all that mojo! This game has AWESOME REPLAYABILITY I RECOMMEND GETTING IT NOW WHILE IT'S ONE DOLLAR! You're paying one dollar for a game that produces $60 of fun honestly, which in my book is pretty darn good.  Highly Highly Highly recommend this game to all you guys looking for something new or something to play with friends with this is you're game I for sure know it!
6234	1	a	best game ever...meta score was a lie! Better then most 60$ games!
3419	0	a	I 'played' this game for twenty minutes before I had enough.  Five minutes were spent in a solo game to test out graphics settings. Noticed the AI was pretty terrible, but I figured it was just easy because It was only the second wave. Anyways I didn't want to make any judgements about it until I tried out the multiplayer.   So I navigated through the buggy menu for fifteen minutes. I tried to join multiple different servers. I restarted the game several times trying to get it to work, and I could not join a single game. It's really frustrating to have to give a game a negative review because I legitimately could not access the multiplayer (Which is the only draw to the game in this case) Rather than on the merits of the gameplay itself.   I could have probably had a better time smoking cat hair out of the dollar I spent on the game.  Still better than Infestation Survivor stories.
1221	1	a	very good game so far and its worth the money it costs.
3523	1	a	Bloody brilliant, great for the whole family
5506	1	a	The deinstallation works fine. 10/10
5255	0	a	Most terrible piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the internet ever.
241	1	a	This is one of those underrated games that got overshadowed by Skyrim because they came out around the same time, and the company was pretty new and unknown. But there are major differences between Kingdoms and Skyrim most noteably, Kingdoms doesn't freeze, get lost, or crash like Skyrim does, especially the xbox version. HOWEVER this game was made for Windows 7, and the company didn't survive, which stinks btw... so there are crashes on Windows 10. Every time I tried to play this game on W10 it did crash after about 15 minutes of play, and others have said the same...so if you don't run Windows 7...you may want to pass on this one, even though it is a really great game.  Kingdoms is really well written, engaging, and fun to explore. The map is huge, AND most importantly, its easy to follow. There are a lot of cool features like dispel chests which are challenging to unlock but hold a lot of valuable stuff in them. Although learning to open them can be a real pain in the fanny because if you fail, you suffer health loss, but they will still be unlocked. There are chests to find, tons of them...and lore stones that when you find and activate them, they reveal narration of the backstory. There is a lot going for this game, it's visually beautiful, reminiscent of Fable, but also holds its own original story and style, and great music, and so is the voice acting. The combat is fun with lots of weapons, spells, etc, to aid you. But the best feature of this game is the combat because it doesn't require the player to be at a high level before they get powerful weapons and spells. You get that pretty darn early so that is a plus in my book. There are 3 game difficulty levels, and several races to choose and build your character from male and female. Human and other. I have logged about 90 hours on this game (mostly offline not recorded by Steam)... and I still haven't finished everything. There are a ton of side quests but not necessary for leveling up , but can be over-whelming if you start too many at once, which is very easy to do. Basically it is open-world, however the story is linear. The character design and environments were created by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) so ...you know it's great. This really is an overlooked game...but it plays very well, and you should check it out IF you run Windows 7.
2765	0	a	it sucs
599	1	a	A hidden gem among the RPG games that are overshadowed by heavy hitters like Mass Effect and Skyrim.
2716	1	a	this game is awesome i cant wait to play it every day 
2537	1	a	this game is so fantastic i cream my pants EVERY TIME I PLAY IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LOVE DINOSAURS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH
808	1	a	Awesome game. has a few bugs but ii's definitely worth it on sale.
2398	1	a	This game is honestly great, you'll buy it for the Horde mode with the dino's and stuff and when i got bored one day i didnt even realise that they're other game modes i could play! This game is worth it!
3855	0	a	This would have been an awesome game in 1999, would have competed very well with Half-Life 1. But in today's gaming landscape, it is garbage.
177	1	a	Possibly the best open world rpg sngle play game I ever played, and I can replay it without getting bored of it. The menu style is super clean, though the weapons and armor are abit out of wack but overall it's good. 9/10
1905	1	a	I'll keep it simple - solid game with lots to do, lovely world and nice combat system. Definitely worth it.
841	1	a	This is an awesome game! kinda of like a singleplayer rift with better graphics and combat.
2988	1	a	Although more work on the game needs to be done, the game itself is really quite fun. that of course if you play with or in a group of people or friends. playing alone is a more hard and really just pointless, you wont survive long and it way less fun.  for my opinion there is no point of buying the game without friends to play with. its just don't worth it, but if if you do have someone to play with and you love the idea then give it a shot
137	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do.
323	1	a	An amazing lore rich game with fun combat unlike Skyrim. I highly recomend this game to anyone who loves rpgs.
2326	1	a	Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.  Longer review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.  Nothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.  My only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.  You'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.  Similarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.  Pros:
6262	1	a	This game is downright off the wall silly. you want a wave based survival game, you got it, you want a futuristic shooter, you got it, you want vehicles, you get 6 or 7 different types, you want multiplayer, bring 4 friends with you into survival. you want pvp, do it up. this game has it all, including shenanigans. honestly i really enjoyed it and will play more. 2.6 hours in the past 40 hours of owning it, and thats just cause ive had business to attend to off of steam
2129	1	a	I have played the game for quite some time now, and I guess it's time to review this game. The game is good, combat is fun, voice acting is adequate, and visuals aren't outdated in my opinion. However there are some other things that bother me about this game. For one, doing the DLC's midgame, along with the sidequests over-levels you. This game does not use dynamic scaling at all, and is however set per zone. Therefore you must be certain that you are sure about entering a new zone, because it to sets the level based on your character when you enter the zone. Other than that it's fun, story interesting and the gameplay is very good. DLC's are worth it too.
4567	1	a	Otion: Prelude is funny game, much better now then it started!  + Various weapons; Vehicles; Perks; Habilities; Chalenging; Leveling; Weather changing;  - Optimization; Maps Quantity; A.I; A lot of bugs; Physics.  Score: 7/10 
3371	1	a	It's kinda like Halo2 and the oiginal Turok decided to go out for drinks, ended up getting smashed and got hoard mode confused with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥...ooops we got a baby!  It's not a hardcore fps, take it serious kinda game. For just messing about, having some fun shooting dinosaurs and flying away to safe ground with the jet pack (and who dosen't like shooting dinosaurs or jetpacks) its perfect. The gameplay is great (once you figure out what the hell you are ment to be doing....there is no tutorial), maps are pretty big, dinos are plentiful, graphics are ok too, guns are fun. For 59p you can't really go wrong! Although i now know what the guy in the toilet felt like with a T-Rex about to eat him in Jurassic Park!  8/10 Would get â¥â¥â¥â¥ out by a T-rex Again!  
13	1	a	The recommendation is pretty weak because I didn't actually like the game. I think it has the potential to be enjoyable and it is fairly unique, so that alone might be worth it to you.  This game is essentially puzzle quest but with a solitaire combat system instead of matching gems. It's not fast by any means. Essentially you build poker hands to charge attacks, then launch the attacks at your opponent. Essentially you spend the entire game moving stacks of cards on top of each other to make a combo of five, and the higher the combo on the damage scale, the more the attack will do. You can also 'steal' cards from your enemies so long as they aren't stacked.  The combat is cool once or twice, but after that it becomes so repetitive. Nearly every fight is identical, save for the select few where you need to charge and use special attacks to win.  Beyond the gameplay, the music, sound effects, story and graphics are all ok. They're mediocre, they're fine, they're acceptable. Without a doubt they are not great and won't sell the game, but they sustain it without detracting.  All around, that describes the experience: alright, ok, passable. It's not thrilling or revolutionary, but it is unique and if that's what you're looking for in a game then you'll find it here.
3944	0	a	I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout 'rad'. A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.  I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck.   That's what playing ORION: Dino Horde felt like.
4781	1	a	Pretty fun for it's price. It's not a game that I could see my self playing for days on end but overall it's pretty good.   Cons: Graphics could use some improvment
3471	1	a	It's a gud game, only $1 pretty cheap m8.  360 no scopin' dinos like no tomorrow.  9/10
852	0	a	I gave up on this game. Just could not get into it. It just didnt make sense.
2624	1	a	THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN AIDS! I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS AMAZING AND I LIKE DINOSAURS. ONCE A BIG BIRD THING GRABBED ME AND IT CHUCKED ME OFF A ROCK AND I GOT SCARED. BUT IT WAS FUN AND I LIKED IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITED GAMES OF 2015. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
1131	1	a	the best of fable and oblivion, and none of the dissapointment of those series' sequels
1286	1	a	Interesting game, lots of content and such with a great combat and leveling system. This game is unlike other RPGs due to its unique combat system that actually requires a skillful player to succeed in battles. In other RPGs it is simply a button mashing and xp grinding game of frustration but with KofA: Reckoning the player needs to strategically level their character and manage the weapons they use. Overall this game is quite fun and the combat is definitely the highlight.
4827	0	a	officaly the worst game i have ever played thank god i only spend Â£1 on this peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥. I have a pritty good gaming PC and this game can only run on 20 FPS on high settings and it looks like a monkeys â¥â¥â¥. It is falsely advertised as the screen shots look nothing like the game its self please just on one els buy this game it want even be worth it if they made it free!!!
3031	1	a	GET a group of friends All get this game HAVE A BRILLIANT TIME
2822	1	a	I honestly didn't have much thought about this game when I first started, I thought I'd play it once, think 'Yeah, alright, good laugh' and never touch it again.   I absolutely love it. Fun, frantic, fast paced, and getting ontop of a rock with an LMG spraying down dinos is immensly satisfying.   Easy to pick up, easy to play, little brain processing required - good, simple fun.
969	1	a	I just want to start off by saying that this is one of the most satisfying role playing games that I have ever played. I enjoy it more than Skyrim Chakrams OP
6256	0	a	Not worth the $1.50 i paid for it. Although it presents a decent concept, it feels unfinished with LOW 2d graphics on small dinosaurs and a lack of both game mode variety and gun textures.
3972	1	a	cool game
2751	1	a	Pew Pewing at Dinosaurs, what more could I ask for!
2610	1	a	Started off as really biggy and unplayable but has been pbeen getting better and better and is now qite fun to playh, Highly recommended.
2673	1	a	STEP ASIDE DINO D DAY FOR A NEW DINO GAME HAS COME FOURTH! FOR ALL OF YOU THAT LIKE A 99CENT GAME WITH UNPOPULATED SERVERS AND â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOS THEN BUY IT FULL PRICE, EAT ME, #DINO4LIFE#ALMOSTASGOODASPEGGLE  #YALLBETRIPPIN
308	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, took around 75 hours to complete including the DLC. The only criticism I'd level it at is that it's rather easy, especially once you start crafting your own gear.  If you are a fan of action RPGs, you should definately play this game.
635	1	a	Awesome game, have some great battles in it, love the lore of the game fighting is quite fun and always looks awesome although its easy combat really, but for any fan of RPG's get this must have game its a gem!
6132	0	a	Only play this if you have a good computer. Please look at minumim requirements for your computer and if you can run it. It was so laggy for me.
2623	1	a	Dinosaurs are awesome, so the laws of physics literally state that this game is awesome too.  Play it.
3506	1	a	Shoot dinos in the face!
2677	1	a	It would appear to be a work in progress. For one dollar this game is amazing. Full price though..... I do like that the developers seem intent on adding content without charging the user for it. I like to support the little guy and this is a good game.
3147	1	a	This games just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.
2534	1	a	This game, like others have said, is a mixture of Halo and Left 4 Dead in gameplay, with maybe something else thrown in. My computer runs Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and Team Fortress 2 just fine, but for some reason, struggles with this game. I had to lower the graphics settings in-game to their lowest just to even get close to a decent performance. And even then, I didn't find the game that fun. I can see its potential, though. It's just not working for me personally. So my recommendation only comes half-heartedly, but only because I don't think it would be fair to say I don't recommend the game.
5863	0	a	This game is realeased for 3 times. Why would you expect that this game is GUD. I buy it for a cents CENTS last year, its not worth it. Dont even bother this game.
2968	1	a	fantastic value, good gameplay and all forÂ£0.99??? AMAZING!!1
1955	1	a	Some people told me: this game is too childish. I don't think so... Don't let the design fool you! Huge amount of content, a lot of blood, interesting story and a good upgrade system packed into it. The combat system also makes me smile. I love the fight even in close and ranged combat with weapons or use of magic. Just give it a try...
5063	1	a	My thoughts: At first this game was unplayable because all of the lag but I fixed it after playing the game I just have to say that it's 'ok' not the best game ever but it's ok this game is worth 99 cents.  About the game: This game is a shooter you go wave to wave shooting and pistol whipping the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of Dinosaurs theres a bunch of modes. King of the Hill, TDM, Free for all and survival ETC.  Pros and Cons: Pros.  You get to pistol whip Dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs!  Mother ******* Dinosaurs!!!!  It has Coop  Cons.  A lot of lag on some platforms: how to fix it   http://steamcommunity.com//app/104900/discussions/0/864976115810928810/   It would of been better if it had a story.  Anyways I hope this helped you have a nice day :)
3674	0	a	Junk.  Laggy, boring, ugly and (as should be obvious) very few people play.  This game has been out for 2 years, gotten several updates, and is still unbalanced and glitchy.  If you paid a buck for this, you got ripped off.  If someone gave you a copy for free, slap that person for having anything to do with this and get a real game.  Edit:  You know what? I'm not even done. I'm going to rant a bit more.  I gave this game extra time, hoping something, ANYTHING would get better. My time was wasted.  Most of the guns feel the same, aka single or burst fire, and very very weak. Depending on lag, a raptor may take up to 2 - 3 pistol clips to kill, and half to a full rifle clip to kill. The poison spitters, in addition to being able to hit you almost anywhere, shooting nonstop and leaving toxic puddles everywhere, seem to have maybe 25% to 50% of a boss dinos health (aka ridiculously hard to kill, especially early game, on easy, and considering how many spawn).  The average credits per dino is about 100, and the guns/upgrades start at about 1500 (for weak pistols) up to around 5000 for the better upgrades and guns.  And when you die? You lose it ALL.  There is a lives system that's actually more like the pickup system in Borderlands, but if you get locked in a corner where your team can't reach you and you can't get a kill (which happens quite a bit), all those extra lives basically mean nothing.  And while you do get some credits for damage done to a dino, it's going to be more like 20-30 credits if you have teammates helping.  There's not very much to say about the sound, as aside from the occasional roar, there is the non-stop, annoying TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP of you putting dozens of rounds into a single dinosaur, over, and over and over.  Oh and hey, there's a leveling system, where you do get very very minor buffs in exchange for long hours of slow grinding. 10% damage boost for my super weak pistols? Yes please! Each class has levels of it's own with almost exactly identical skills as other classes, to give you that wonderful feeling of starting from scratch for trying different characters?? Woot!  Ok, Now I'm done.
1352	1	a	A wonderful game. Skyrim but simplified a bit. Good storyline, awesome gameplay. Finished it 3 times.
3117	1	a	The reviews are very misleading as they were reviewing a dfferent game... This game is pretty fun and right now its only a dollar so grab it and have fun with some friends
5093	1	a	This game truley cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. One moment it was Orion: Dino Horde. Now it's Prelude It once cost Â£1.35, then it was free for a while, not it costs Â£0.79. Once it had a leveling system instead of a ingame real-money store.  Overall this is only good if played with friends.
4399	1	a	I paid a $1 Can't Complain
4479	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
3434	1	a	Got this game as a gift, very fun game. 8/10
2073	1	a	This is an excellent game overall and I fully recommend it, despite how it looks like there's many cons. Just try not to take things too seriously and don't think it'll be the next Skyrim, but enjoy it for what it is. I did get pretty addicted to it though, because it IS fun to play :).  Pros:   - Beautiful graphics. Those spells man, they're gorgeous! - Really fun and flexible combat.  - Good story. - Nice characters, with voice-acting for every NPC. Quite well done too. Good facial expressions as well. - Plenty of character flexibility, in terms of choosing how to play.  - Good DLC. - Beautiful cutscenes.  - Very stable game. No crashes or glitches after 60h of play. Even after resuming the game after PC sleep. - Very quick saving. Odd, but true. Esc&gt;Save Game&gt;Esc again to re-enter game fast. Other games need time to save. - Player housing, which is both expandable and comes with beautiful rooms and useful features.  - NPCs are often quite beautiful facially and they also respond to event changes or differences. At one point, NPC A was talking to me and he then complained about a race in the game, the Dokkalfar, but my character was of that race, so he added something to the effect of 'Ahem, except you of course'. Very nice touch! - Safety mechanism in place to stop you from accidentally hitting friendlies. So you need to press H to enable this. However this is less realistic than in Skyrim. To make matters worse, you can't always enable it, such as in certain safe areas it seems and thus you can't attack annoying people, as the games loading screen suggests... - Makes you feel special as â¥â¥â¥â¥ lol. - Fast loading times between going in and out of buildings.  - Nice 'junk items' system, where you go through your inventory, add the items you don't want to junk and then go find a merchant. Then you click 'sell all junk' and you're done. Quite nice and easy. - Many different items, both clothing and otherwise. - Lots of hidden items and locations to find, as well as collectible armor sets. - Many different kinds of enemies and areas. - Possible to stealthily kill NPCs, although you only get a stealth-kill animation if using a Dagger. - Really nice tarot-card-like destiny system, with good RP options, due to the descriptions.  Cons:   - No followers.  - Your character has no voice and so is silent during dialogue. - Not possible to yield, if accidentally or intentionally hitting a friendly character. - Sometimes clunky system of having to constantly re-do the same dialogue to make multiple selections, such as if you choose to buy all upgrades to a house at the same time. This also means you can't choose what gets added to your house, but instead have to follow a set order. So if you don't want an Alchemy room for instance, but the Alchemy dialogue option comes first, then you're forced to buy the Alchemy room to get to the next dialogue option, for other house segments. - Character creation is based on presets mostly and thus isn't very deep or flexible.  - After creation, only certain features can be changed; not major things such as eye color. - Mini-games such as lockpicking can be tedious and not as refined as say, Skyrim. - Game is generally less 'free' than Skyrim and is more cartooney, but still pretty. Less options. - Less freedom of movement. It's one of those games where you can't jump over edges, but need a prompt. - Character facial gear *always* gets removed during normal dialogue, annoyingly, so you can see their face. - Combat can be annoying sometimes, because you can't always just stop a combo or spell mid-cast, to dodge or block. Thus when you do long basic attack chains, but know that an enemy is charging an attack, it's not possible to stop and block. Thus you often get hit. - Shields aren't visible when you equip them. Instead, they just appear out of nowhere when you press the block button. - No mounts.  - Shallow interaction with environment, such that you can't interact with chests or bookshelvs by putting things back into them, like you can in Skyrim. So once you take everything out of them, they stop their characteristic shining. - Lacking a screen that shows which clans/factions you're allied with and their respective banners and your status within them. I would've liked this, even though it's not a big deal.  - Inventory system is annoying because if you have health potion A in your inventory already and you find a new health potion, you won't be able to add that potion to your existing stockpile of the same potion, if your inventory is full. Thus you need to clear at least 1 slot, in order to be able to pick this up. Quite tedious. On the other hand, ingredients from things like plants don't require space. As goes for crafting materials. - If you press F to talk with an NPC, but they're in the process of laying down to sleep or getting up or something, then your character is completely immobilized until the dialogue starts. This is a small thing, but quite stupid.  - Lack of mods and steam workshop support.  - Block is simplistic, which means you can just hold down B for block and then enemies can't even flank you, as your character will automatically turn to block them.  - When you have just finished a quest, the game will, perhaps unless you've unticked tutorials/help, auto-select the main quest line for you again and add a pop-up notifying you of the fact that you have no quest. This is annoying, as it means you've *always* got a quest and can't just ignore it.  - When buying items, the game doesn't calculate the cost for you. So if an item costs 446 and you want to buy 3 of it, you get to select how many and then click buy and you won't know how much the final price is, unless you calculate it yourself. No pop-up shows how much money you used either. - NPCs using weapons you can't get. I've seen a few NPCs use spears and I love spears. Yet I haven't found a single equippable spear in the game.  - Sleep is purely for role-play it seems, as there's no benefit to doing it, besides healing up to full health/mana for free. - Unless there's an enemy in sight, you can't aim neither spells nor arrows, but only shoot straight ahead. Thus you can't really look up at the sky and shoot that way, for instance.
4497	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
5973	1	a	Fun game with lots of vehicles like mechs tanks hovercrafts and helicopters ,also lots of different weapons addjustable difficulty levels, a solid server system and summarized a little fun game defenetly worth 74cent.
1021	1	a	Inventory system is a little bit clunky to use but once you get past that this game is damn entertaining
4044	1	a	I don't understand the hate that this game gets, though I had never played the earlier versions as I am a new player. The value this game has at 99 cents is very high in my opinion, with a decent variety of multiplayer modes, weapons, maps, enemies, vehicles, and more. The addition of AI teammates is a plus as I enjoy playing offline shooters. The scenery in the game is very well designed. Its not the most technically sound shooter I have ever played and it is not quite the kind of game that I could sink a large amount of hours into, but anyone who nitpicks a 99 cent game too much is taking things way too seriously in my book. I genuinely believe this game is better than some FPS games that I have paid $60 for in the past.
684	1	a	Yes it is has good as the video. Ignore the demo issues, the finished game is good.
1078	1	a	Found myself spending copiuos amounts of time playing this game, but towards the end I just wanted to get it over and done with as it started getting to dragged out. The main quests are easy to follow, but once you start going into all the side quests it takes forever to finish. Definetly worth playing though.
1388	1	a	For the most time this game can be extremely fun. The faction quests are interesting enough, the rewards can be very useful, and some NPCs are very likeable.  The graphics are amazing, the Reckoning mode animations make the player feel like a badass. Most of the achievements are quite easy to get and your character isn't constricted into a class at the beginning. (Also your chara can be a male or a female, and there is a character creation sequence at the beginning, so yeah, that's a plus in my books.) You can choose abilities from whatever ability tree and play however you want and if you rethink your 'class', you can use a Fateweaver to respec (for money of course, but at the end of my playthrough I had more than 7 million coins).  The DLCs have their own storyline, with level scaling loot, so that's a plus too.  Problems imo: -Sometimes the camera just flies away when you are fighting. I don't know why (my bet is on its' console port origins), probably watching something more interesting, bc it clearly isn't interested in me dying because I can't see what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am I doing atm. -Probably connects with the previous: auto-targeting system. It can be nice, but most of the time, it will randomly change targets while you are in the middle of finishing an enemy or get stuck on a downed enemy in Reckoning mode. -Level cap at level 40. The problem is that I haven't even came close to finishing the main questline when I hit the level cap. I haven't grinded at all and used Reckoning mode sparingly (it builds up extra XP). Reached it with just finishing every faction quest and every sidequest I could find (minus the DLCs, bc I did them after the endgame). (After reaching the level cap, I just bulldozed my chara through the main questline, and the DLCs. Almost no enjoyment.)  So.  Pros: lots of loot, interesting stories, nice environment, lorestones, Reckoning mode, some NPCs (Cydan, Secandra, Dren etc.), crafting system, ability trees, destinies, factions, Twists of Fate. Cons: sometimes wacky gameplay mechanics, occasional scream-worthy bugs, LEVEL CAP @40 (!!!), enemy respawning on top of you, not that wide variety of monsters (in the end I got sick of Jottuns, Leanshes and Sprites).  I wouldn't regret buying this game, bc it was awesome. Till I hit the level cap (never going to forget this!), after that it was still exciting but has it's 'meh' moments.  (Also I would like to add that the jumping out spiders almost made me â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself a few times, because that freaking noise is just really over the top when you are concentrating on something else.)
1761	1	a	Best thing about this game is the combat and the art style; amazingly fun combat with a versatile class system, you can pretty much play whatever you want without problems. Tad too easy even on Normal/Hard. Feels like an offline MMO, every quest is kill X or fetch X and the plot is generic. Lack of graphical options but still runs very well even on low end systems. Huge world but as stated, quests are the same throughout. Worth a buy when on sale, requires an EA account if you plan on redeeming demo items/buying DLC.
2557	1	a	It's Halo with Dinosaurs
3558	1	a	Fun, dumb game dont take it too seriously :)
4668	0	a	Awful graphics and awful game play. no wonder it's being flogged for 99p this weekend.
2077	1	a	One of (if not the) best RPG i've played so far. Combat is challennging, story is amazing, and there is more than enough to do in terms of sidequests (and no grindy ones either). Add to that the crafting mechanics, and I'm convinced this belongs in a hall of fame somewhere.
3725	0	a	You are wasting money if you are going to buy this game for 0,99 cents,believe me it's not worth that money. The game is buggy and they are too many glitches,bad gameplay. Anyway it's â¥â¥â¥â¥!
4051	0	a	To be honest this is the second worst game I have ever played! It's even worse then civ 5 which is a waste of money. Never buy this game even if it is free.
3841	1	a	Awesome game! Work together and kill some dinos.
1780	1	a	Great, great game. One recommendation though - go for melee build, especially daggers. The melee combat in this game is close to perfection when it comes to fun.
5541	1	a	I 460 BLAZED A DINO FOR 74 CENTS TOTTALY WORTH IT
4110	1	a	Great game! Ignore the meta score! Lots of changes have been made and you are missing out if you dont spend a buck to buy this! Better yet buy the 4 pack so you can give some to your friends.
1794	1	a	Awesome. Great storyline, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing combat.
4856	1	a	This game is Great but the thing is you need good graphics to run it my pc was running the game so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing slow but if you got the graphics then buy it
4062	1	a	Like Counter-Strike with dinosaurs
3582	1	a	You wake up, drenched in sweat. 'That same dream again?' Asks your wife, you glance back and your wife is now an oviraptor. You scream and nothing but bullets come out of your gaping mouth, the words appear on your wall, written in blood. 'ORION: Dino Horde'. You scream the words 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUY THIS GAME' (5/5)
1308	1	a	Nice game to play, its not a must to play but a nice rpg if you have been missing some rpg action
3971	1	a	The survival/horde gamemode of this game gets a bit repetetive after the first area has been cleared, and becomes very easy, since all the waves are as the first ones...
3846	1	a	Downloaded the game 4 days ago but only played it today. First match we were doing pretty well, holding off the dino's and progressing steadily. We then have to take an outpost. On our way there, my friend and I ran into a Triceratops in our 4x4. It rams us and we are sent flying across the map, we fly off the cliff and land on the side of the mountain, where we somehow remained alive. We manage to fall through the mountain and we are glitched into a cave. Our entire team rapidly failed and we were the only 2 left. Took us 10 minutes to discover we could teleport home, and when we did we lead the charge and emerged victorious. 5/10 opinion not yet fully developed...
744	1	a	I love this game. Extreme skill customisation ftw. Be a mage! Be a rogue! Be a warrior! Be all of them at once! Made even more interesting with the card system, giving further specialisation options depending on how you distribute your skills in the 3 skill trees. Combat itself has a great flow, and experimenting with different combos is a lot of fun. And The finisher move animations from the reckoning mode are varied enough, so I never tire of seeing them.
3907	0	a	I'll give you 10â¬ if you delete the game from my library!!!
1910	0	a	I picked up Kingdoms of Amalur with high hopes from the reviews and screenshots. It looked pretty and promised things like an open world, a well written interesting story, and dynamic combat. Sadly, it was bland and left me with a bad taste as it failed to deliver on many of those promises.   Impressions
6274	1	a	Actually a lot better than the reviews would say, it is great fun in local co-op!
192	1	a	One of the best RPG design I have seen. The best is the combat with the evolution of the character, very impressive and with good control. Very very big but easy to learn. I also like the history and the setting. Very good graphics and better if you use SweetFX and Nvidia inspector.  Just one thing, is too easy so PLEASE use the Ysa mod, search in the forums, it makes the game HARD. Read about the mod, is very customizable, if you don't want a overhelming difficulty, to me the most important thing are:    - Reduced EXP - Reduced Fate Points - Reduced Gold; They don't add a real difficulty, just the thing is to not overlevel everything, not use everytime the fate easy mode and make gold have an actual value.  Is the thing most close I have found to Dark Souls, and you know, Dark Souls is one of the best game I have played.
2704	0	a	The excitement of this game is about on par with Minesweeper.
3180	0	a	Well, it sucks.
287	1	a	Absolutely love this game, Beautiful graphics and keeps me busy for hours.
2528	1	a	Noscoping dinosours has never been so fun.
414	1	a	Fantastic game. It's pretty linear, but not in a bad way. Sidequests will fill your questlog as you pick them up every 10 feet or so if you explore a little. I think it took around 70 hours to finish the main quest and all the side stuff I could find. Combat took a little getting used to for me for some reason, but got the hang of it once I found a weapon style that I liked. Worth playing as this game goes on sale really cheap quite often.
6265	1	a	Surprisingly fun, like Halo with dinosaurs
6317	1	a	Buy this game it has everything every man needs like guns .....and dinosaurs....and cars with mounted guns..and well everything just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it already...
2285	1	a	Ah yes, Orion: Prelude, or as it will always be known to me, Orion: Dino Horde! This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.  So, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).  This game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.  So, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!
312	1	a	Cool storyline, great voice acting, interesting artwork, fun combat... if only it was co-op it would be a 10 star game.
4757	1	a	This game is wierd. Dinosaur nazi zombies, except without the nazis or zombies. I have a mixed view about this game. It is well animated and the graphics are great. The weapons work well and fighting huge dinosaurs in a round system could not have been done better. I feel this game isn't deep enough, even though you pay to play, you have to pay to customize, which might not be so bad. Also I think it would have made a good freeroam game. Not survival. But for what you pay for, I suppose its all right.
5296	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
5092	0	a	Controls are bad, visuals are bad, options menu does not save changes.
740	1	a	I can't wholly recommend this game, but neither can I give it a thumbs-down. The game is rather good-looking for its age, similar to and slightly better than Fable 3. The levels are generally bright and feature vivid colors that are a very welcome change from the dark palette so many games utilize. Gameplay, too, is much like Fable - there is some room for character development and loot progression, but it's mostly an action romp. If one chooses to do all the optional quests (many of which are rather boring), the game is fairly lengthy - I clocked more than 40 hours when I came to a game-breaking bug. Which brings me to my biggest complaint - no game of this depth and length should ever be released without some sort of dev console. At the point that I encountered my glitch, the only option was to revert to a saved game some 30 hours prior. Unacceptable. If it weren't for the bug, which I understand not everyone experiences, I would rate this game very highly. As it stands, I'm just not sure.
6205	1	a	This is really a pretty terrible game. But, if you grab the right friends and you can get it dirt cheap, it can be a ton of fun.
1662	1	a	Alittle bit fable, alittle bit skyrim, alot bit addicting.
29	1	a	Grate game to help past time
851	0	a	Does not work properly with Steam's game streaming. The camera look is messed up when the game is streamed, does not react to mouse movements properly.
2817	1	a	After 78h I'm glad that I bought this game. That is really great time-killer with a lot of fun.  If you don't have this game - buy it now. :)
5425	1	a	It's not bad.
2533	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME 
1109	1	a	Highly recpmmend this game. It's not quuite as huge as Skyrim, but then, unlike Skyrim, it has very few bugs and flows much more smootly on half the machine. One delightful thing that I found is that it auto switches between mouse/keyborad and controller (if you have a controller for your PC). Just use the controller and it responds with the controller icons or use the mouse/keyboard and it responds with those icons, even partway through a multi step sequence of commands.  IMO, the combat is smooth and challenging enough to stretch your tatical skills even at medium difficulty. The quests. subquests and side quests come fast and except for only a couple of oddball scenarios can be done in any order regardless of who you choose to side with and without confusing the questlines.  The graphics are a little flashy, but who wants to see the twisted strands in their bowstring. I seriously prefer to get by on way less than the super duper graphics card that some other games require.  Character development is very inovative and you can switch from a super tank slash-n-bash style to a high powered fireball slinger any time you have the cash.  The two DLCs are well worth it and all together I have spent several hundred hours on a single playthrough. It's a shame there won't be a KOA-2
5410	0	a	Total waste of money, i could feed a whole african village with that 1$. The game runs like complete **** and looks like a bad version of halo and borderlands together.
2041	1	a	Great game, Its alot like Skyrim just with more of the fantasy. I love this game, sometimes its hard to play in long periods but if you still play in short bursts it doesnt lose you in controls or anything. Sometimes i just have to stop and look around at the world they have created and stare in awe. If its possible to catch the game on sale since if you dont like it it's not much of a loss but if you like Skyrim Elder Scrolls then this is a game i throughly suggest.   ~Life is a war, days are a battle. Everyone once in a while loses a few battles, the thing that matters is to not lose the war.
2981	1	a	Ok it is sooo broke but thats what the fun of it is, also there are jetpacks!  I will say get it, BUT ONLY IF ON SALE FOR LIKE $1  Because even if it is funny it is still a rather unfinished and badly programed game. But with good mate it can be very fun good time waster  4/10 for me
77	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
6160	1	a	Probably one of the best games for that price, tonnes of fun and lots of achievements to be won
385	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is your typical fantasy open-world RPG. Its fantastic combat system has you pulling badass moves right from the start, rewards player use of variety and offers a well thought out skill progression. The level scaling unfortunately makes the game too easy later on. The environments are lush and visually spectacular with a huge amount of variety. Despite this, its populace are cookie-cutter NPCs and youâll fatigue from the hundreds of quests constantly being thrown in your face. The resulting little characterisation makes it hard to get invested into this game. Combat and exploration are its saving factors.
5585	1	a	Honestly this game isn't that bad. it has a wonderful concept but if it had better graphics and less bugs it'd be godly in my books.
3172	1	a	Don't listen to the haters. Its 79p for god's sake. You get what your paying for and for the money, with some mates, it's really not that bad.
1765	1	a	The game content seems to be really huge so you will have lots and lots to do. I have spent quite a few days with this and generally it is a nice game to play.  Pros: - Big map - Lots of quests - Easy to play, easy to get into - Very much voice acting and lots of lore - Graphically appealing if you like cartoonish look - Cool monsters, cool effects, etc  Cons: - Annoying combat controls with both controller and mouse&amp;keyboard (turning in mid-combat and throwing spells in different directions are very unreliable and half the time you don't have idea where the next spell or hit is gonna go) - Camera with controller is way too slow in combat making you die just because you can't see what's happening - Camera overall is so close to you you have no idea what's going on - All other kinds of camera problems during the whole game
757	1	a	Absolutely underrated and unbelievable game. Great story and environment. 10/10 Don't expect something absolutely new, its like most of MMOs around, just single player.
4878	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
1455	1	a	Amazing game with a ton of content. You wont get more gaming for your money than this game as to offer from any other game out there.
2967	1	a	HELP!!! I can't move because my head spinns
2262	0	a	You will most likely ignore me and waste your money but still.... Game is long abandoned. Still have tons of bugs, very poor storyline, gameplay try to look like heroes of might and magic and fails.  disciples 2 better than this in any way. Just buy it if you want real disceples experience.
2903	1	a	Pretty dank, fun time waster
1261	1	a	Opened secret door.  Found chicken overlords.  Attacked chicken overlords.  Chickens fought back. Died fighting chickens.   10/10 - Would hunt chickens again!
1331	1	a	the game is sort of odd in the beginning, you arent sure the base of how it plays and the story isnt so clear. once the intro and first few side and 2 or 3 main quests are completed the game falls into a comfortable setting and environment to play. it runs very much like a baby of skyrim and world of warcraft. there are a couple of classes and races to choose from and a distinct definition is given for what class uses what type of armor and weapons as you find the items throughout the game.  i would definately recommend this to someone who is starting out in an open world RPG as the mechanics of the game play easier and you will most likely not want to stop after the first hour or so of playing. I found that the game ran smoothly at around 60 fps around high and i have a gigabyte nvidia gtx 650 1gb GDDR5 card. i guess you can say the game is value for money  6.5 / 10
1038	1	a	Recommended.
3603	1	a	The support class has a bad â¥â¥â¥ black man voice. 10/10
5654	0	a	if you review this game saying '39 cents lmao' you definitely should consider suicide because nobody above the age of twelve finds the meme funny
5795	0	a	This game sucks, I got it when it was paid for. It justs throws you into a server without showing you how to do anything. Don't waste you time, play a better game like anything else than this.
4524	1	a	Game of the year
2962	1	a	Absolutly love this game.  10/10  would jurassic world again.
5383	0	a	THIS GAME IS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE TO BE BOUGHT FOR A DOLLAR  ARE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ME
1821	1	a	If you want a time sink that's not Skyrim this game may be it. 5 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface of the man quest, but have done at least 20 or so side quests. Plus the combat kicks â¥â¥â¥.
3668	0	a	this game lags on my god computer, with glitchy dinos bad servers and weapons that feel as unsatifying and hard to aim as possible. the game mecanics arte repetive and often break. i went int this agem thinking this look reasonably good. NO dont even try. its all well and good adding more items and features they are good and its a good idea but they need to fix the gameplay and i dont think they would be able to address thewse issued as they would probibly have to rebuild the engine. F*** no never again.   as of 25th feb 2014 (i dont think it will improve)
6281	1	a	Just started playing it, but I can already tell it's going to be a favorite. Cross all the best aspects of dinosaur-hunting games with the multiplayer of Halo, add weapon upgrades based on XP you collect from each wave, and many awesome vehicles that are fun to operate and totally devastating. The bosses (large dinosaurs) are challenging, but it's the small ones you'll forget about that will end you. Planning on losing a lot of hours making dinosaurs bleed. Can play alone, but multiplayer is the most fun.
6406	1	a	Really solid game. For what its worth, it's absolutely awesome. Sure it isnt grade a, but what more would you want for a buck? High potential for fun, and just overall badassery.
2117	1	a	Great game but underrated. Definitely worthy to play. :)
6083	1	a	I never in a million years thought I would be dino poop in space. 11/10.
2351	1	a	Cheap game but very enjoyable. though graphics is outdated for me its gameplay is nice. But kinda boring playing alone.And If you go online Few players are there and sometimes no one.  But this game really worth its price .. so i recommend this for every gamers out there.  NOTE: if you dont know the name of some dinosaurs you'll know it emmidiatly when you play this game, and not just their name but also their cute faces.
2739	1	a	I'd recommend Orion: Dino Horde because the game's a good run for the money especially because it's only like a dollar right now. I've played this game for a few hours and while it gets a bit repetitive and isn't as challenging as I'd expected it to be, the game's fine. In my opinion, this game merges the FPS and dino elements together in a rather fine manner. The netcode isn't as smooth though and the game works best when you're playing with friends that are close-by, not with people across the world because the ping has a huge impact on the gameplay. In conclusion, the game's soild especially since it's available for only a dollar right now.
4741	0	a	I dont realy like this game, the graphics..nah not that good.Best graphics since Atari 2600 :/ the gameplay, more like â¥â¥â¥â¥ play.the idea of hunting dinosaurs in the future,what i thought they were dead.sorry 2/10 :/
3918	0	a	No i feel like I wasted 99 cents so yea its pretty bad
4605	1	a	what am i doing with my life
3309	1	a	better than what you pay for it
39	1	a	nice but the hard game
5548	0	a	I seriously think the people who like this game have never played another coop shooter or something because the 'coop' is the only thing that could ever be considered fun about this garbage and no I don't think it's fun... Sure, I'd like to shoot dinos but this game is a joke.  Dislike: 1. Crap framerate yet the dinos are fast as balls half the time so theres nothing fun about shooting a speeding incomplete animation.   2. Buggy... don't get stuck  3. Guns aren't even fun to shoot. The pistal doesn't even have a shooting animation it just stiffly sits there making gun sounds.   4. I get that it's a buck and that's 'soooo cheap' but I feel like I wasted my money. If I buy games like Killing Floor on Steam for 2 bucks that are immediately great games then a buck for this broken, ugly, laggy, crap is way too much.   5. It seriously just sucks  Likes:  1. Jet pack was actually fun.    If shooting dinos with friends sounds fun to you it also did to me and I think this game is crap. If you want a truely good coop FPS with giant things to kill get the Serious Sam games. This game doesn't deserve your money.     
5960	1	a	It's a mindless shooter. Reminds me of nazi zombies from Call of Duty series. Waves of dinos to kill, points to score and spend on guns and upgrades. I wouldn't pay $60 for it - maybe 4 years ago I would've. Graphics are kinda dated... but $#!t it was 99 cents!
5510	0	a	Bought the 4-pack to play with my friends, but this game is nearly unplayable and isn't worth the $0.3725 per copy I paid. It's also funny that the devs are accused of stealing assests and right in the trailer for the game it shows quotes saying that it is a combination of other properties as a positive XD
4460	0	a	LITERALLY the worst game I've EVER played.
1602	1	a	It's close to Skyrim, but with a Fable type gameplay and story. Don't really care if it's made by EA, was worth the sale. The customization is vast and the combat is adequate. Starting with 3 classes and can mix em up as you progress is very interesting, even though im starting out all Sorcerer! Money well spent.
3200	1	a	HIghly recommended for people looking to play team-based games, or just waiting to have fun with friends online.
2872	1	a	I'ts worth .99 cent but that's all I'm going to say about it.
1178	1	a	Think Skyrim meets WoW and action is like Dynasty Warriors. Awesome game.
6226	1	a	Get to shoot dinos with futuristic weapons with ur friends. best few bucks i spent
4739	0	a	Orion: Prelude a game where you get to protect power generators and shoot dinos! Sounds fun right? Tried it out, guns sounded generic, abilities seemed a bit uninspired. Dino models looked great, gun models looked pretty decent, but the game crashed. Combine that effect with a lack of single player story and well... you get to shoot dinos right? Unfortunately the games not for me, you don't get to build anything permenanet, design any dinos, and from asking around all the matches, waves, and spawning rates are typically the same. I am not able to recommend this game.
829	1	a	Maybe ill get 1000000 bad comments for this, but in MY opinion, this game is way better than The witcher 3,,,, (I had this game and i returned. Smooth gameplay, nice fights and lot of armors, upgrades, etc. Some ppl descrived this game pretty well, is a mix between torchilght, skyrim somehow, maybe WoW too, with a really good and interesting result. for me 100% RECOMEND this game.
4613	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again
663	1	a	Single player mmo... kinded like any mmo people play nowadays minus goldfarmers.
3489	1	a	Ran over a pack of raptors in a Humvee. Later, while running away, got my head chewed off by a T-Rex.  10 of 10. Would play again.
6068	1	a	I was killed by invisible man with egg in his hands... best game evah !!  15/11 -IGN
3491	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
3479	1	a	very fun and addictive game with quite a few game modes. fans of dinosaurs and a halo mixture will likely enjoy this
4638	0	a	If you didn't think you could waste 50 cents, look no further.  
1795	1	a	If you like third-person adventure RPG's, enjoyed Oblivion and want a different kind of story, then get this game. There are some similarities to Oblivion especially the way the fae in this game look like elves from TES, but most of the art is Todd McFarlane. The game has a type of perk leveling system that allows you to freely swap points so you can change how you want to play. There seem to be lots of side quests to keep busy exploring. My only complaint is the FOV is way too close, but I was able to fix that with Widescreen Fixer. Great game. Been having lots of fun.
5524	0	a	It's still â¥â¥â¥â¥
3022	1	a	Theres like dinos and guns and mechs and planes and â¥â¥â¥â¥
5138	0	a	4/10 it's not worth the $15
2602	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ !
2878	1	a	This game is insane... and fun!
4342	1	a	Muahaha.. its free to play this game now!!   i got this 2 months ago, then refunded it 'cos the game wasnt played nicely on my pc. Multiple crashes in the game, laggy in some parts.  Should just lower the price to .10 cents so those trading cards will still get drop.
1278	1	a	This is one of the really enjoyable games I have played and am just playing it for the second time. It kind of 'grows' on you the longer you play. I started it again and first thought hmmmmm and now an hour later I don't want to stop lol
754	1	a	This game is pretty unique, I would say it is sort of like Fable. The game is pretty easy to pick up and there is alot to do right from the start. Also the main quest will talk you through just about every zone when you are the propper level. Its like Fable with guns. 10 skyrim copies out of 10. wood recommend!
703	0	a	Can not get this game to run. Forums are no help. Want a refund. No game should take this much of my time to fix.
4229	1	a	For the two hours i've played. I highly rated this game, considering it cost me a whole 4 dollars on sale for 4 copies. However, i just wish the multiplayers worked for me, as it seems to for my friends. I want to murder some dinosaurs :( I'm going to blame the game, but i should probably blame my ISP. Would buy again, if on sale for 99c.
3331	1	a	Where to begin with this game. Dinosaurs, guns, mechs and explosions. What is better than that absoluetly nothing.
3957	0	a	guns need better sound effects, open world is nice but leaves much to be desired, there is no cover to hide behind or in or building to shoot from roof tops or towers, no cities or city ruins to run a muck through... just a couple guns, open area to run around and dinos to shoot that spawn in waves. i would say it's 'back to the drawing board' guys. the game mechancis are solid and create a good foundation for what could of been a really fun game had they taken advantage of level design and gameplay is poor and instantly repetative.
328	1	a	Highly enjoyable, fun gameplay, good story, quite a bit of customization and seemingly great deal of replayability. I went full Warrior, you can do Thief and Mage as well or any combo of the 3. I hear people call this a mix of God of War and Oblvion. I can certainly see what they mean, but its not quite right. Youll occasionally have to rapidly click M1, M2, or space, Its not like GoW's massive amount of button presses and analog stick twistings QTE sequence.   Tiny gripe;   Oftentimes, youll be on a cliff or ledge, youll have to find the predetermined spot that the game allows you to jump off. Its not hard its just a bit silly. Its the only time youll be able to jump in the game.    A must buy on sale!
4058	1	a	While this game definitely had its rough beginnings, Spiral has really kept moving forward to make a great game. Yeah there are bugs and problems here and there, but you can be sure that Spiral is trying their best to fix as much as they can. With that said, the game has a great concept to it and is fun to play so always try to take problems with a grain of salt. Like others have said already, metacritic ratings aren't accurate as the game has evolved immensely since its origin as Beatdown. If you purchase during the sale, it's a steal for 99 cents since you get so much more than a dollar's worth. So put in that one dollar and help Spiral out, who knows? You might find the game just as fun as any other game out there on steam.  A great game with hard working devs, definitely worth your money and fun to play solo or alone. 9/10
1015	1	a	One of the best games I've played thus far from any RPG open world game I've played!! Really it's a must grab game!
24	0	a	game keep crashing at a certain point every time, i tried starting over with a new campain and it keeps effecting it and crashs as soon as i get into the game.. dont waste your money on only a few hours worth of game before it crashs. and you might think its just my computer doing because of my graphivcs card or something, but ive tried it again after replacing my graphics card
759	1	a	Nothing earthshattering or unique, but definitely a game to pick up if you are into RPG's. Not a bad game, especially if you pick it up on a steam sale.
2344	1	a	This is the cheapest coffee, And it cant be finished, Didn't sleep for 2 days,yes 2 days straight. Dinosaurs + Jetpacks + Mechs+ FPS + TPS game. 12/10
3243	1	a	Best dollar game I have ever bought.
3512	1	a	One of THE BEST games I've ever played. You can fight each other, team up and survive or just plain muck around. Orion is DEFINETLY in my top favourites.
2092	1	a	It's honestly what Fable tried to be. While they don't deliver anything extraordinarily ground breaking here, every element they have pulled into the game are ones I have found fun in other games. And one point I feel I have to make early on: This is nothing like Skyrim. Many people have asked me if it's like Skyrim/Oblivion, and I'm assuming this has to do with the designer being involved in the game. Really, the only thing familiar was the lockpicking, the rest of the game plays vastly differently from Skyrim and it's a good thing. Really, though, if you're not sure if you want this game, play the demo. It runs you through the tutorial portion of the game and then gives you 45 minutes to explore--and while you'll only touch the tip of the iceberg in that time, it will either save you sixty bucks if you don't like the style of the game or it will make you crave more. Personally, I'm betting on the latter.
5020	1	a	Make sure you watch out for those Spinosaurs, dem motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥as ain't just jackin' off in the corner, they'll â¥â¥â¥â¥ in your cornflakes.
4086	0	a	You can get 6 cards from this game. I recommend you play the game until you get the cards, otherwise you're missing out on about six nickels' worth of value. The best way to play the game until then is to idle out in the main menu and read a book.
267	1	a	This game is amazing so far. There are always challenges everywhere you go. If you're a skyrim fan, then this is a game for you since the stories are kind of similar. The gameplay is a bit like Dark Souls except easier and less rage inducing. Either way, I'm having a load of fun with it and its easy to get used to the controls and quest concepts. Great game :)
4506	0	a	6 minutes well wasted.
5403	0	a	I haven't bought this game and I can write a review? That is pretty dumb.
3408	1	a	A truly fascinating commentary on Muslim life, told through the eyes of a young Japanese man stranded in Antarctica following the death of his family by mass seppuku. What it lacks in visuals it makes up for in its terrific fighting mechanics, which require the player to mash not only X, but left trigger as well.  11/10. A masterpiece
4348	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
3025	1	a	Real fun often you can get this with a discount so be sure to check it out
6294	1	a	this game is good for the price buy it...dont listen to the meta score....i enjoyed it and i only bought it for 1 $...
591	1	a	This was a lot better on ps3. A poor port.
6315	1	a	It is so fun to kill all the dinos!
4036	1	a	Survival mode is very fun with a friend. There are a number of balancing issues and bugs but these don't really spoil the game. The game is so cheap that I would recommend ignoring metacritic's outdated review and giving it a try.
661	1	a	THE most memorable RPG I have ever played. This game combines the best of my RPG favorites such as Fable, Warcraft, and Elder Scrolls and marries them together beautifully. The immersive and diverse environments will constantly make your jaw drop. The graphics, scenery, and storytelling are fantastic. Before buying this again on Steam I had previously owned a copy that I sunk hundreds of hours into. I bought it again and chose to revisit it for nostalgia. A fantastic RPG for anyone that enjoys rich combat, deep customization, and the freedom to truly play the way you want to. 10/10.
4438	1	a	Really fun, old game. But ffs 251 Achievements. 11/10.
1682	1	a	Games â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome. Fable meets diablo
971	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMEND -- LOVE THIS GAME.... It's a Must Have for RPGrs!!!  Honestly... I've never really been much into Graphics or Music... so for that I'm going to assume that both are fine. Personally, I don't see an issue there, but again... not really my thing.  Okay... no game is truly perfect, so I will make one complaint. Armour-sets, which are available, are a problem to attain before they become obsolete; unless, of course, you use the internet and try to find them early. I like having a well-dressed adventurer... so that kind of sucks, because I won't use the internet to spoil my game play.  Now with that said....  Game Play... beyond awesome. This game was created with ME in mind. I often restart a character several times before completing the game, because I'm curious as to how other builds would do in this game... in short... which would I truly enjoy most. With this game, you can actually re-set all your stats, for the most part, at any given time. Thus, if Warrior isn't floating your boat, become a Rogue... just like that; without having to start a new game.  The missions in this game is another point of great excitement. Besides the fact of being a completely NON-Linear game, there are tons of Faction Missions... Side Missions... and Others which can peak your interest, or even immerse yourself in your own Character's Story. Admittedly, all missions; Story, Faction, etc., are a bit linear in the sense that you complete the mission Their way or not at all... but if that's the only down side... I can live with that. As well, I'm finding the various stories of this world fascinating... like a really good book; Very Well Written!!!!  Combat is a whole 'nother story... or more like an Epic Tale. Besides the many many many diferent attacks that are available, I love the fact that it's not just about point and click. Timing makes a difference, direction makes a difference, distance makes a difference, reflexes make a difference. (just as an example.... Boggarts are one of the easy mobs in this game... I got murdered by 4 of them, because I wasn't paying attention and I got cocky; That's a Real Game).  Special Note: If you get and play the demo for this game, it really doesn't do it justice. If I recall correctly, it gives you a time limit, and an area limit... this is their mistake. It should be limited by a certain level... maybe 5 or 6; by then, you'll get a true feel for this game.  I easily give this game 6 thumbs up out of 5...and a Slap on the Hand, to me, for not finding it sooner.
381	1	a	Awsome game :) 4 out of 5 stars.
4255	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
1199	1	a	You can see the Salvatore influence in the storyline, and gameplay is heavily remnicsient of the Elder Scrolls series, both of which count as positives in my book. Hours of content, and a genuinely fantastic game.
2075	1	a	very happy i bought this game 9/10 allday !
1280	1	a	Takes some of my favorite elements from Skyrim and World of Warcraft and mashes them together into something new. Play this one with a gamepad on the big screen if at all possible.
1027	1	a	This game is a 100% buy at this price. It's like a more combat-oriented Skyrim and I really quite like it.
1590	1	a	This game is like World of Warcraft, but single player and not stupid. I give it a 9.1/10, but I heard there are some compatibility issues. I run this game fine on my Windows 8 so I don't know what the problem is. I would make sure you can run it before you buy.
5134	1	a	I love this game! Its one of few games that I own that I not only like, but I am pretty good at as well. You really can not beat the price of only $0.99 which I am not sure if that is what I got it for or not because I do not remember when I bought it, but its worth more then a dollar! Most times when I play I host the game, and most times I stream it via  Stream.AWFordJr.net  which I use D3DGear to stream to Youtube. If you like FPS type games, then you may like this one. Its well worth the low price its going for. So get it!
5722	0	a	Paid money for this. liked the game.  check the price a few months later. Its free.  10/10 would pay 1$ again
644	1	a	Fantastic RPG. Its like a cartoonish Elder Scrolls game with a better fighting system. Very easy game to get into.
863	0	a	Do not buy even if its on sale for a dollar! This game has silly cartoon graphics and is NOT open world. It is the worst game I have ever bought even for 4.99.   1. Not open world 2.Nothing to explore 3. Cartoon graphics   BUY SKYRIM NOT THIS GAME. While it may not seem fair to compare the game to skyrim the reason I do is because of how they portray the game when the describe it.  1. They decide to throw in a name from the Elder Scrolls 4. 2. on Steam this game is listed under 'similar games to skyrim or oblivion 3.There is no massive open world. In combat it basically closes you off into a small area of the map thats where I lost the open world part. 4.The graphics are not just differnt their pretty bad even for an older game  Below I have how they described the game.

3166	1	a	I got an achievement for being eaten. 10/10
999	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has a rich lore, excellent combat (TIP: play this on HARD, normal is too easy), solid graphics, simple, yet deep and customisable leveling system, and TONS of content.   In fact, the amount of content is overwhelming, especially for a new IP. There are tons of armor and weapons and crafting items, and quests (especially with the DLC) that you will spend many, MANY, hours playing this game is you intend to do everything there is to do (I've clocked at over 230 hours).   I really can't recommend this game enough. If you like high-fantasy action-RPG's, you can't go wrong here.
1637	1	a	good game as long as you die few times or save alot.
3045	1	a	This game is great, i picked it up for the $0.99 sale. It is a fun game, it does need server work and i think there should be a TDM type mode as to where 2 teams battle it out, but also have to watch for dino's.  the graphic system does need an upgrade, it is a great looking game but it can be better, the menu needs an overhaul as well, the store items and character loadout is really pixeled and not clear.  The game has potential, and i see that there is another update coming this year, for a change of it to be orion: prelude with new maps, characters, menu, game modes ect. i hope graphics and dedicated servers are in it as well. Maybe more players in each game as well. But while this game is on sale id reccomend it, you cannot go wrong for $0.99
342	1	a	Great game, worth every penny sad that it never got the attention it deserves
3414	1	a	Â£1 for a game thats like cod zombies in the halo universe (obiously with dinosaurs instead of zombies), brillent, shame about the wave limit.  10/10 ragdoll physics - rammed a triceratops witha tank, did a double backflip then exploded
5362	0	a	Well this is one of the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games ive played in a while I feel scamed about paying one whole doller on this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
5846	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.
6027	1	a	+This game exceeded all expectations for 39p this game was well worth it's weight in gold and i would even go as far as to say this game is better than most full priced crap out there.   -Microtransactions.
2434	1	a	After reading the reviews, I bought this game thinking I would get a few lolz with 3 friends for 3 euros. After playing for a while, I have to say that this game is ridiculous and looks funny, but it is also absolutely fun and awesome.  Animations look weird, graphics are dated and some illustration are hilarious in a kitsch way. It can be confusing too and doesn't make much sense. But as long as you don't take the game seriously it's surprisingly fun. Just try it if you can without expecting too much. It does a very good job at making you forget its flaw.
3249	1	a	For $0.50 this is the best investment of 50 cents you could ever have. I would gladly pay 10.00 for this beauty of a game. Lots of replayabilitiy, good for wasting time with friends.  I love it.
3120	1	a	This game is total â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6085	1	a	Orion: Prelude is an FPS dinosaur-based game. It feels like it takes place in the future.  The gameplay is designed well, and there is a large variety of maps to play on. The dinosaurs are spot-on, and the objectives make the game a lot more fun. There is a multiplayer function, but it sometimes won't work. This game has tons of potential. Especially for a game that costs $0.99. It is easily worth the one dollar.  Pros: Great gameplay Well designed guns, maps and enemies Helpful upgrades Challenging objectives Large variety  Cons: Multiplayer may get a bit shaky. For me, atleast.  Overall: 9.4/10
3207	1	a	Great game the Meta score does not do it justice at all!!!
1655	1	a	This is a decent action RPG, and the sheer amount of content for the price can't be beat.
1578	1	a	Absolutly fell in love with the game. The fighting style is like god of war, yet free roam. Maps are HUGE and just worth every penny. I seen it was on sale and just HAD to get it again. 9/10
1820	1	a	If your looking for a Skyrim like game you found it. In my personal opinion this one is better.
2579	0	a	Eh. Can't launch a game with a friend, that's kinda why i bought this :/ if this gets fixed i might change my mind. why release a game that has that many bugs?
1200	1	a	Great Fun been plaing it for months and still haven't finished it...The DLC's are awesome also but wait for everything to go on sale
1104	1	a	Good little game. Plenty to do &amp; explore with interesting stories. The talent system works well and can be adjusted to suit how you like playing the hero.  Especially good value while it's on special, wish they had it on when i bought it.
3974	1	a	This Game Is Great......Very Glitchy Though hahaha But that my friends is what makes this game AWESOME! 
1507	1	a	Its a pretty solid open world RPG that is worth 20 bucks. I'd easily pay 30. Its promising a lot of play time, has a decent crafting and character development system and has a nice combat system.  The graphics are alright, the voice acting is pretty good, and the combat has some issues but is something I find enjoyable.  I'm running as a warrior/mage on hard mode and so far its kept me entertained.  My only complaint so far is that the user interface is kinda crappy and a pain to work, and blocking in combat is just odd. Sometimes combat feels a little sticky, but I think thats just me as a player. I have trouble blocking an dodging incoming damage sometimes because breaking out of a sword swing isn't instant.
1076	0	a	This game is not worth your money. It is poorly balanced and it's more up to luck than skill wether or not you will become a wet stain on the ground. Combined with a louse save system this adds up to a lot of frustration. The idea of the game is good, and I do like the way you can specialize in several schools (mage, warrior and rogue) and pick skills from all three schools. But it's poorly implemented into the gameplay.
1151	1	a	Being an avid RPG player, I can assure you that this game is a great buy. I spend hours collecting loot from the bodies of fallen adversaries, completing quest after quest as my character become more rich and powerful. The hours turned to days as my total immersion into the game increased and my GPA plumetted accordingly. I needed excellent grades, no longer, for I was Sparkles the Destroyer and Amalur, my kingdom. In short, I recomend the game.  Pros: Solid RPG experience.  Cons: The story was a very basic experience and your decisions did not have much of a ripple effect through out the game.  This may be a pro or a con to different people, if don't like to see your smallest actions (You Kamehameha'ed a chicken out of existence with your magic when you were at level Two) having long lasting effects (Eight levels later you find out the chicken was actually a local deity that provided sustenance to a small village, who will now starve, and it's your fault.) Then this game is for you, if otherwise then please, cringe in terror of the chicken deities.
1476	1	a	The fight system is really nice. Alas, the game is a bit too linear. It's like long (very long) corridors linking different arenas. But even so, the innovative fight system and the nice illustration are worth playing. Game difficulty is not a challenge. It is perfect for casual gamers but for players who like some challenge, it can be disappointing.
4911	1	a	omfg,evolve must be like this.There is 0.50$.T-rekt 
1958	1	a	Great story, great game. I like the ease of the multiclass system. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. there are only a few things I think could be improved: 1. Jumping... The character should be able to jump over or climb the smaller obstacles. Coming from similar games, it is hard to get used to not being able to jump 2. More classes. Although most of the classic RPG class attributes are there, there could be more customization. Should get more than 1 skill point and 3 ability points per level, or raise the level cap. Other than that, the game is very well designed and a load of fun.
4494	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
2469	1	a	cool.
3281	1	a	Thosands of Dino's, lot's of guns, good multiplayer, lots of gamemodes (One is almost an open-world kinda thing), 420/10 Fun Game, reccomend to all.    In a Doni-Shell: It's Worth Playing!! (If you have a good PC 'cause this game eats your CPU and Memory more then John Belluci and Cheese)
1807	1	a	Love the game really great rpg game
3303	1	a	Summary: This game is WELL worth the $0.99 it is selling for now. Gameplay is enjoyable, and the the overall graphics top it off.  8/10 Would knife a t-rex mid air again.  I bought this game for $0.99 when it went on sale as a game sold regularly at $12.99. This game by far was not worth $12.99. I didn't even consider it worth $4.99. The gameplay is nice, but very repetitive. Playing with friends is by far the most enjoyable way to play, but to fully play a match through, you have to play for a few hours non-stop. Point shoot point shoot point shoot.   The graphics make up for how little thinking is involved at times, and I'm not saying that you don't have to think strategy sometimes, just not most times. Out numbered yes, using your cloak to get past groups or larger dinosaurs is very enjoyable, but sitting at base sitting and spawn killing dinosaurs with a minigun, it gets boring.  Another problem with the game is how the pvp matches seem out of place. Not only do some of the maps have cartoon-like graphics, but the pvp system is so screwed up that it isn't enjoyable to play on those servers. All you see in those servers is people spam clicking with their sword until the other person dies or they die.  Overall the game I could have seen going for $2.99 and being well worth the money. Now that it is set at $1.00, I see it maybe getting more of a playerbase.
4191	1	a	It was....a fun game with friends.
2742	1	a	This is the best 75 cents you will ever spend on a game. Just buy it dammit. Its got terrible graphics terrible physics terrible sounds and the announcer sounds like he was ripped right off the Halo 1 disk and rammed into this game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ get enough kills and the announcer hollers bring me a pizza like â¥â¥â¥â¥ SON thats way better then any game already. Trust me if you want to have a great night with a group of friends playing an actually pretty smooth running comedy of a game buy it. DOnt ask questions. It doesnt get much better then this!
1	1	a	The core concept of this game is essentially solitare poker againt the AI. Matching varying combinations of cards will inflict damage against the AI (and AI to you). The damage will increase the better the combiation, from two of a kind to a royal flush. The game mixes things up by adding in spell cards which can be used to inflict status effects, heal, do elemental damage, etc. The additions of the spell cards keeps the battle fresh as certain enemies require specific cards to counter their abilities. Overall, this game is average to above-average. I recommend a purchase of this game during a sale.
1904	1	a	Underated game. Not a must play or anything (Ex: skyrim). But it's a good rpg with its very unique style to it. 
647	1	a	One of my favorite games of all-time. It's a shame that the company was so horribly mismanaged that a sequel will probably never be made. The state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations has a large chunk of money tied up in the IP, and refuses to let go of it.  Curt Shilling brought animator Todd MacFarlane together with master story writer R.A. Salvatore to create what I view as one of the greatest RPGs ever created. If you can pick this one up on sale, definitely do. It's pretty long and has some replay value as well.
1691	1	a	another great action rpg noce this time i play like mage lets burn this weekend!!!
4308	1	a	Not even gonna bother reviewing it. 80 cents for this game is great. You got dinos and guns and pew pew pew and stuff. Just buy it.
2227	1	a	Fantastic game, especially for fans of classics like age of wonders and heroes of might and magic. The music and atmosphere is great and the artwork for the different characters is good (although the faces are a bit generic at times) I played through a portion of the Elven campaign and it was very interesting. Only thing I would like to mention is that the difficulty is steep at the start of a campaign and then it gets really easy and I end up just autobattling most fights.
2304	1	a	Why the hell do games nowadays NEVER have any dinosaurs?  This game has dinosaurs. 10/10, Game of the Year, best 50ct I've ever spent. Seriously, this game was hella fun for a few hours. I'd say it's well worth the money.
2855	1	a	Awesome game for such a low price! Definitely worth it!
5446	0	a	A steaming, gigantic, dynosaur TURD!  Want to kill hordes of brutal enemies? Play killing floor... You love dynos? Go to a museum or watch discovery channel...   Please, for your own sake, STAY WELL CLEAR FROM THIS GARGANTUAN PILE OF DYNO CRAP!!!
2256	0	a	Turn based combat and a overcrowded ui. Looks like warcraft 3, not a bad thing if it was 2002 all over again...
839	1	a	Ok Everyone who loves this game and planded on Crytisysing me for my choice of words about this this game cuzz they knew what i said was rong. Fair game. I just started i got ahead of my self and jumped to conclusions story is anoying yes gameplay is good unlike what i said. It was kinda stuped at first but i gess it just took geting used to. But after a wile it actualy got me prity entressted. So those who love this game and knew my Revew was fals if u guys dident crytisys me for it out of kindness its open game for u guys. Everyone els who hasent played well u got no room to talk even less than me infact. lols Over all The combat is kinda Ify its hardly a challange unless u turn up the Difficulty but Even then it can be off ballance. Why u ask? The World in wich u are playing is desined like a MMO's world for some reasion. With areas stronger then others if u go to far out ur too week if u go to far in ur to strong. its rather anoying sence theres is not anyreasion the game cant ajust to one persons charicter becose its singleplayer. As for the swiming u can swim in certan areas. Agien i jumped to conclusions. For me its the Enteraction that makes a Openworld RPG and Tip Craft ur armor if ur a warrior. Oh shops do change once u aquier a home from a village being attacked by spiders ull know it when u see it. by the way. They dont change level just invintory. :)
4520	1	a	Worst FPS i have ever played! But cuz i love huge cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥s that dont make sense i give this game 10/10 Bad game! But good game..........Im bored..........seriously im bored............
1908	1	a	You can use the Chakrams, THEY ARE AEWSOME! (Why don't other games have these things?) A very nice game, sould've used more customization options.
1942	1	a	Good game. Some glitches but I enjoyed it anways.
3004	1	a	There're dinosaurs in this game.
1439	1	a	Wonky Camera at times, fun combat, and much more content then I thought. A good buy if you can score it on a Fire Sale.
2401	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is solid. Orion Dino Horde has a Halo/Jurassic Park/Avatar feel to it and I like it! You've got guns, tanks, and planes to kill the dino's. It is mostly PvE but it does have PvP as well. Great pick ESPECIALLY for $1. Get it!!!
6180	1	a	More fun than a stripper with no inhibitions at a bachelor party!
317	1	a	This game is a hidden gem all the way and I wish the company would have continued with a series. If you loved playing fable you will love this game, I highly recommend this game.
1079	1	a	Surprisingly fun to play =)
955	1	a	This game is an amazing rpg that have great batlle mechanic. The crafting is pretty sweet, as you make your potions, shards, weapons and armors, the weapons and armors that you made can be name them as you see fit. Speaking of weapons and armors, you'll be getting cool one early on compare to most other rpgs. Plus you be putting a really long time into playing this game you be having a blast playing it.  I really love this game. I recommended to everyone who's a fan of Fable or any Action RPG games.
6328	1	a	Its a fun game.
4818	0	a	I dont know what i bought it was 99 cents
4871	1	a	Brought me a pizza.  10/10
5632	1	a	good game, much yes. 12/10
5015	1	a	It's â¬0.99  You can't lose.
1184	1	a	A lot of people will call this generic and boring. It's not, it's like Oblivion with better bosses, like skyrim with better item drops, like dragon age but with cooler weapons. The only problem is no mod support so the graphics are a bit stale and users can't add anything cool.   8.25/10
650	1	a	This game has to be my all time favorite. It has a vast and wonderous world to explore, and and an entire worlds worth of in game lore to explore made by reknowned author R.A. Salvatore. There are tons of things to do, so many quests to complete. Also it has a coveted aggression mode to toggle on. So. Remember that town that you were mad at. Wipe it of the map. Or not. I don't judge. The combat system is very good so it has a very gratifying feel to it, and is well 1v1 or 1 vs an army of trolls (but decidely harder then -_-). The DLC adds so much to do as well so I would highly recommend getting it as well. It also has a beautiful musical score. This game is worth going back to play agains to experience it from all possible angles.  11/10 would unsuccessfully woo blue elf that stalks you throughout the game
4323	1	a	Very addictive.
6152	1	a	During the 2014 Winter Sale, I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends, and we had some of the most fun and hilarious moments we've had in a while. It's not too high quality of a game, but worth $1.00 (let alone $1.50 for a 4-pack during the sale)? Hell yeah.
2854	1	a	One of the most fun co-op games i have played in a while and with still more content coming out this year!
2952	1	a	I got stuck in a rock. 10/10 I will get stuck again.
642	1	a	This game is great, pretty heavy actually but who cares the game is well made, nice graphics, smooth gameplay its interesting because its no like some games where u pick a class and its the almost the same as the others in this game the 3 set of skill or abilites that u can choose are unique they all have their own style, on each skill tree u can choose diferent type of weapons which u can use to create a lot of unique combos. The history its interesting sometimes i can't stop playing because i want to know what is going to happen when i finish the quest, plus u have different type of side quest, not only the usual side quest but faction quest to that can help to get some permanent bonus when u finish the entire quest or quest that u can repeat to get make some cash. The game itself its all around u can picks the paths in the story and depending on ur choice u might get different rewards or results. something that i really like its the balance between the classes it is actually balance. I strongly recommend this game if u like long games with intresting story with different paths lots of enterteaning quests and nice gameplay not so fast but not that slow its just the way it has to be.
3819	1	a	Okay so this game is pretty cheesy, let me warn you. But that's what happens when you have a Republic Commando-esque soldier firing a bow or wielding some kind of lightsaber against a T-Rex. Also, one of the reviews the devs chose to display on the trailer said 'Its not buggy anymore.' So it has that going for it.  Anyways, lots of fun, better with friends, graphics are a bit pitiful but not terrible generally. Except for the 'water.' Definately worth the 99 cents I paid for it, probably not worth the 15 it normally is. Also, you can explore dino innards.
242	1	a	ALthough not widely-known, this game heas heaps to do! Creating weapons and gear and improving with gems. The map is vast and the options endless. Different skill trees and ways to play. Weapons I haven't seen in any other game.! Great RPG! A must try, a personal favourite of mine.
301	1	a	This is actually a really fun game with engaging combat, tons of stuff to do, and a lot of replayability. Its a shame the studio went under.
4101	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sick game omg its like a mix of The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite
2387	1	a	Is this seriously only Â£0.79?!  It's fun, it's lively, it's simple. Kill the dinosaurs, secure the objectives, buy cooler guns. This is a bargain, get on it.
3916	0	a	This game sucks in every way.
2132	1	a	A really good RPG with a lot of choices (moral,gameplay and so on) with a really robust combat system, a very rich lore.
1676	1	a	Like Fable, but with more depth. An excellent light RPG.
5060	1	a	GREAT GAME!!!! GOT IT FOR ME AND MY FRIEND AND ITS GREAT!!! (Is 40p on summer sale) I WOULD PAY Â£10 FOR THIS GAME!!!
1465	1	a	easy game but has amazing story and tons to do and the game makes you feel very important and special

5098	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. No instructions on how to get started or what you're supposed to do.
3762	1	a	Seriously, do not be fooled this game can provide hours of fun alone or with friends! The dinosaurs are bad â¥â¥â¥ and the gameplay is way better than you would expect. Buy it on sale though 15 bucks is a rip off. I got it for like 3 or 4 dollars.
4510	1	a	ORION: Prelude (formerly ORION: Dino Beatdown and more recently ORION: Dino Horde) is easily one of the most underrated games of the last 5 years. It's been torn apart constantly and consistently by the gaming press and given a right beatdown of its own. Since its release in May 2012 I've put a solid 100 hours into the games and I can say with great confidence that it deserves much more credit than it is given. Spiral Game Studios has come a long way with this title and ORION: Prelude is a fresh, fun, and exciting gaming experience.  If you've ever played Left 4 Dead, Killing Floor, Gears of War Horde Mode, or Halo's Firefight you know what to expect from ORION: Prelude. It's a co-operative FPS where up to 5 players work together to defend or capture objectives by fighting off wave after wave of dinosaurs. To vanquish said dinos there are three classes to choose from at the start of each match; Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault sports a jetpack, Recon a cloaking device, and Support a healing gun. Each kill earns a player cash depending on the damage they contribute which can be spent on upgrades between waves. Those upgrades range from bigger guns and bigger knives to Augmentations like a double jump or stronger melee attacks. There's enough to choose from that you'll be mixing and matching with the different classes to create unique builds each match. This really helps the game stay fresh.  On top of the class customization there are plenty of different modes available to chose from including a VS mode called 'Duel' which is akin to elimination style modes in other games. There's Survival, King of the Hill, Free for All and many others including a mode where you are able to play as the dinosaurs themselves VS other human controlled characters. Controlling the dinosaurs is a bit difficult at first as they are large and stiff feeling, but after a round or two you'll be crushing human face like a true prehistoric behemoth and laughing the whole time.  When it was first released in May of 2012 as ORION: Dino Beatdown it was, admittedly, a mess. The word 'glitchy' comes to mind with a hard lean towards broken and many of the game modes mentioned above weren't available. It was playable, but dinosaurs didn't behave intelligently. They would clip through the stage and animate like caffeine loaded squirrels with rigor mortis, guns wouldn't make noise and would even sometimes disappear altogether. Not to mention the announcer getting stuck repeating lines such as 'threat eliminated!' and 'threat down!' over and over until the match ended. But, for what ORION: Dino Beatdown was at its core, a co-operative horde-mode FPS with dinosaurs, it was amazingly fun.  Yes the game had its moments, to put it lightly, but it wasn't so bad that it deserved the media meltdown that ensued after its release. Spiral was quick to respond to community feedback and within a few short weeks issued a number of patches that corrected graphical errors, class balance issues, optimization problems, all the while preparing large and free content packs that were released the following months. Eventually the game was re-branded and soft re-released twice to what it is known as today: ORION: Prelude.  If you were to compare the two games side by side it would be like night and day. Should Spiral have released Dino Beatdown as it was? No, probably not. But I'm glad they did. After playing the game day in and day out over the past few years my friends and I all realized that playing it together was the most fun we'd had since Super Smash Bros. Melee on our old GameCube. Time and time again we found ourselves laughing to tears and getting chomped. Much like Melee, L4D and Street Fighter did before it; ORION: Prelude has earned itself a spot on the shelf as one of our go-to party games for years to come.
924	1	a	this game is definatly one worth buying especially if its on sale! buy it buy it now..... unless your broke then im sorry now off to play more of this game
1997	1	a	While not without it's flaws, KoA is a massive game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. The gameplay is unlike anything I've ever seen in an RPG, the customization options are endless and the story is entertaining. The DLC (especially Teeth of Naros) is definately worth it too. It's a shame there will not be any patches for this game, while it could use some. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience too much.  8.5/10.
444	1	a	Finished the game on PS3 and got all achievements (trophies), but didn't do every sidequest, some other things and never got the DLCs, so now I got it on here with all DLCs and I'm planning on doing everything.  It runs well, so giving it a review already since I already know the game quite well.  Amazing game and easily one of my favourites.
2308	0	a	  Weapons seem pretty weak . I guess its not my cup of tea . The concept is good but it laggs for me most of the time.   Fast paced gameplay , and much spray and pray . however the lagg-spikes make it really hard for me to play :/
2614	0	a	Honestly the concept of being able to play in various game modes along side your friends in this Jurassic slaughter house is a great idea. Personaly tho I found the controlls for the Dino's hard to manage and clunky. If you can get around some of the frusterating controll draw backs you could probably get a couple hours of fun out of it if you play with a buddy. ORION: Dino Horde shall remain a game full of quaint notions and maverick game modes.
711	1	a	The 'Teen Titans, GO!' of Skyrim.
3598	1	a	This game is truly a masterpiece if anything this deserves the top list i never found a game company who was willing to work on a game this long this people are comitted and are really nice the game is badass GET IT!
2414	1	a	Old review was completely inaccurate and overly subjective, stating in a nutshell, 'this game has jetpacks and dinos what more could you want?' Actually, that was the review in its entirety. An honest review of this game would be that it is a stupid buggy mess, that has its moments, but even when it has those moments, they're a result of the game's utter lunacy. Put that on the box and quote me with it. That said, you'd think I hate the game. You couldn't be more wrong. ORION is to Transformers (Bay Films) as Matt Damon is to a heaping pile of fecal matter. What exactly that means, I'm not sure; and I really only thought through the first bit of that analogy, but what I'm getting at here is that ORION: Beatdown/Horde/Prelude/WorkingTitle is stupid fun. Even more stupid and even more fun with friends, and really its best described as Just a Good Time. Quote that too. It's fun.
5590	1	a	Really nice and really fun! Game have great potential.
4981	1	a	Dinosaurs, Guns, Vechicle combat and HUGE MAPS  What more would you want
4320	1	a	Love this game &lt;3 i even thought it was awesome when it first was realesed
1689	1	a	Bang for bucks this game is off the chart!  100+ hours for the cost of lunch.  Game mechanics are good world is big  quality RPG!
570	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5103	1	a	meh. better than cod i guess
258	1	a	One of the best RPG's I have ever laid my eyes on. Huge world. Great graphics. Main story is more than great. Side quests suck and feel like some bad MMO quests at level 3. Don't be fooled by my playtime. I've got more than 200 hours on Origin (Drop dead EA).  Graphics 9/10 Sound 7/10 Story 9/10 
1177	1	a	Good game if you want a single-player mmo. Do wish it had some multiplayer with that said though as the game has a very, very large feel of an mmo.
5927	0	a	Laggiest, game ever!!!!! WIsh I never had it
2963	1	a	Is it perfect? No. Is it a Triple A game? Nah son. Are the dinosaurs smart and tactile, like most dinosaurs were? You bet your â¥â¥â¥ they aren't.  The game is a dollar. You can kill freakin' dinosaurs with lasers and light sabers and grenades and â¥â¥â¥â¥. No, it's not the amazing FPS dinosaur game every kid that grew up watching Jurassic Park wants, but it's still cheap and fun for a while. The one thing I absolutely hate about this game is the audio. The guns sound like they have ZERO power. When I shoot a velociraptor in the face with a shotgun, I want my ears to vibrate from the loud blast coming out of my headphones. Aside from the â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor sound fx, the game is worth your dollar. Besides, what else are you going to buy for a dollar? A candy bar? That'll be gone in 2 minutes unless you lose it in your couch cushions. Buy ORION: Prelude instead.
1176	1	a	No need for me to be fancy... this game is great. If you don't have it, buy it. 9/10.
6384	1	a	This is the worst game on earth but it's still the most fun you can probably have in a multiplayer game. This is not a AAA title, you get what you pay for. A 99 cent game, what's not to like?
6048	0	a	I played this game on a free weekend and still thought it was a waste of time. The game was just terribly set out, I have to run for 15 minutes to get to some random checkpoint and I wasn't sure why, the guns all feel similar, the dinosaurs don't even feel particularily fun to fight. You can get the game for less than 50p right now, and I'd say it still isn't worth it.
4998	1	a	fun game i just need friends to play it with :(
3597	1	a	You can powerlevel like mad  10/10 would grind again
1287	1	a	This is a great game, the story line is amazing. Enjoying it very much.
6193	1	a	This game is like a halo style shooter with a nazi zombie feel as you have waves of dino's both land and air attacking you. cool and very fun to play with friends, i also like the addition of the tanks, at-at things and the jeeps they make getting around the huge map a lot easier ( as its dino sized and you are tiny ) 7/10
6122	1	a	Fun Shooters. I was hoping I could become the Dinosaurs lol. But anyway, fun games to be played with friends or family.
2679	1	a	This game has hot dogs you should buy it
1971	1	a	1-10 (ten being the highest)  Story: 8/10 Graphics: 9/10 Combat: 9/10 Customization: 5/10 Difficulty: 3/10 Content: 5/10 -- Overall: 6/10  Completed the game and I will admit it was a fun adventure; however, there were many thing in the game that could have used improvements. Nonetheless, the game itself was outstanding. It's a love hate relationship.   What I really found impressive with the game was the storyline, the graphic, the combat, and the world. No questions asked, there was a lot of work and creativity that was put into this game to make it what it is. Big kudos the the developers. The combat was a lot of fun, if you're into hackn'slash games, then this game is for you. The combat is over the top, you feel like you're kicking â¥â¥â¥, and it's just a lot of fun to enter 'fate'.   Things that I had experienced that I thought needed improvement was the amount of repetition that the game had. After playing about 40 minutes into the game, you've pretty much experienced the entire game. The quests are all really similar and you're going to find yourself fighting the same monsters over and over. There really isn't a need for gold, other than buying health potions, curing yourself, and fixing your armor. The skills were meh at best. The only skills that I felt were useful: Stealth, and pick-pocketing for the loot. Crafting was OK, but you end up finding better armor in a random box, so it kind of felt pointless.    Overall, great game if you're into RPGs, just don't expect to get everything you want from an RPG. 
3713	1	a	This game doesn't deserve as bad a meta-score as it has been given. I can honestly say, I was happy to purchase five copies. And everyone I know who took a chance and bought this game on a whim have all been excitedly surprised and have maybe even had as much fun as I have. The survival (which is all I can speak for) game-mode is really satisfying and definitely scratches that itch the original 'Zombies' console shooter infected me with. As far as I'm concerned, all the other game modes are just extra fun icing on a really yummy dino-blasted cake. If you were expecting Halo6Doom128 with the super epic plot twist bulletquicktime minigames...please resume playing the other shooters. But if you wanna try somethin' a little different and you enjoy shooter games that have 'vending machines' and waves of enemies to eliminate give Orion:Dino Horde a try, you'll probably really have fun with it if you give it a real chance.
1017	1	a	Fully recommend this game, scored it during steam sale for next to nothing. Best way i can explain it is a more cartoonish/fable version of skyrim. Fantasy, lvling up, finding gear, questing to your hearts content through side quests or main story, mixing it up and creating your own character/class  Clocked about 10 hours gameplay in past couple day and loving it i do however get bored very easily and theres alot of running about but it hasn't stopped me happily playing yet!
5246	0	a	Bad gameplay, horrible graphics, even worse optimization (I have 2x the reccomended specs!) And the lensflares are horrible, they burn my eyes!
5596	1	a	*Steam Workshop *Achievements *Cards *CO-OP *Great Graphics *FUN I dare you to find a game as good as ORION: Prelude for $1.
743	1	a	Love it apart from the map interface.. the map and quest tracking sucks... will go more in depth later, but since it's on sale I thought I'd put in a few words. I recommend this game, even when it's not on sale. But since it currently is, there's some insentive.
1827	0	a	It is possible to change the play styles you use so it wont become boring too fast but I feel this was the only thing that allowed me to continue playing. It is not very user friendly because majority of the times when completing a dungeon you would have to run back to the beginning yourself and shortcuts were rare, though it is not a problem it is time consuming. I also do not feel that the levelling system was well balanced because as soon as you get the hang of the controls it gets easy real fast, even if you are playing on hard difficulty. It was not very rich in story either. I found it to be a very generic, something you can find in any RPG and doesnt really make it stand out. The fateshift feature is pretty much a berserk mode, which is very overpowered and very easy to fill up. Not only are you overpowered on your own it also alows you to use potions to temporarily increase your stats during combat and also permanent boosts known as twist of fate. To summarise it is a very generic RPG game.
1429	1	a	Extremely underrated RPG. Imagine skyrim, with a slightly less interesting world and slightly less immersion but formidable combat.
4063	1	a	played 8 minutes and got eaten by a t-rex 10/10 best game ever
5156	1	a	Don't let the Metacritic review turn you away. This game is really good, and deserves another chance. Through months of vigorous patching and updating, this game is lots of fun to play. Really feels like Halo with dinosaurs plus mechs.
569	1	a	I wouldnt call this game bad, but not good either. Its an rpg that lets you skill what you want, in 3 skill trees. Missions are always the same, ala kill this or bring this, or collect this and that, but mostly they have somekind like a story or a background, and some of them are really interestening. The fighting system is quick, fast and based on blocking or dodging. It needs a bit of balance, since i think this game is too easy, and only enemys with much life are annoying because you need really much time to kill them even tough they dont give a threat. But the atmosphere, is fantastic. It looks like in a (bloody) fairy world. R.A Salvatore, made a interestening story,also reminds me some of the dragonworld saga from him. The repetetive missions and gameplay(you come into a new place, there is somewhat a problem, you solve it , or not, and advance further ) is the only thing i dont like about the game thats why its just an 'okay' game.  5/10
1606	1	a	I played this on the PS3 last year for the first time and from start to finish it is - without a doubt - the best Arcade Action RPG I've ever played. The whole scenario, story, backdrops, characters and playability are totally immersive and had me putting in countless all-nighters of play. I was going to buy the add-ons but since Steam are doing this whole collection pack for the same price of the Teeth Of Naros DLC on PSN I thought I'd go for it and I'm glad I did, even though I still remember the plot, Amalur is a great place to revisit especially since I've got two new maps, an increased level cap and some weapon/armour upgrades all in the mix. Obviously check the specifications first, I'm running at Ultra level on my PC and everything is....sweet as!  Totally Recommended to any and all RPGers out there!
2369	1	a	amazing game 8.5/10, me and my friend had invested in this development in order to find an amazing first person shooter. it was on sale for 99c, so we thought, why not. it was the worst game we ever played, so after 1 hour, we immediately uninstalled. Coming back almost a year later, we both downloaded it, as we had heard of the word that it ha totally and utterly transformed into a monster of a game, and we thought, 'How on earth could this be?' We came on to have a bunch of giggles, fun, suspense, action and glory,.....   Biggest transformation i have personally seen in a game.  Great Job game devs, hats off to you lads.  - Good ol' dusky
250	1	a	If you've heard of this game you may have heard that it is like an MMO. Don't walk away just yet. I'm not an MMO player, but I do enjoy this game.  It is like an MMO in some respects, but it lacks the things that make MMOs not fun. For one thing, it isn't grindy. You don't have to invest many hours to get into this game. There are a lot of side quests, but they don't feel as trivial as the ones you might encounter in MMOs. The battle system feels very fluid and polished and you don't have to spam your number keys to get attacks off.  As far as what I kind of don't like about this game there is a rather large land to explore, but it consists of a lot of trails and forks in those trails. There are some open areas, but you will mostly find yourself on trails. It isn't a real big negative though because you don't feel like the game is a linear excursion.  All in all, this game is worth a look, but especially so if you can get it on a sale.
4089	0	a	Dont buy this 'game', not even for 0,99$. Not only is the game an unfinished, bugy piece of trash (even after YEARS), but the devs have shown on so many occasions that they are just in it for the money, and that they are willing to do EVERYTHING in order to milk the last cent out of this horrible 'game'. I could ramble on about how they tricked consumers into buying, but if you are interested just google it yourself you will be slain by articles of fraud claims etc. Total Biscuit reviewd some earlier version of the game, his review is very accurate.
3826	1	a	I've had this game since 2012.   It sucked back then.  Now, it is flarking awesome.  This game only costs $1. That's one less breakfast buritto, and 20hrs. more of entertainment. This game is so much fun with friends, you get to llaugh and cry together as you puch and shoot hordes of raptors and T-rexes.
4569	0	a	A never ending party game
4341	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
4659	1	a	Don't belive metacritic on this one, it deserves atleast a 7/10. If you like killing floor you will probably like this and is well worth picking up on sale.
4132	1	a	at a buck, you gotta own this.
2360	0	a	This Is way more horrible than the metascore suggests. I dont see how anyone in their right mind would play this for fun, aside from laughing at how horrible this game is for a few minutes. There is a reason this game is only up for 99 cents. The paid reviews should be investigated as well.   Buyer beware.
3329	1	a	You should to beat T-Rax its A freaking Hard and that's makes game Realistic   Don't forget you can use Joystick or Dualshock Controller its wroth it bro   And its best game you can play when you get boredddddddddd Enjoy!!!  
5123	1	a	I RECOMMEND THIS GAME! or mybe not? hehe
4393	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.
2064	1	a	fun addicting and imaginative.
5088	1	a	this game is fun and very addicting.
6186	1	a	It's a fun game to play during some down time inbetween activities.
1304	1	a	I needed something to kill time waiting for Fallout 4, so I played this game that had been hanging out in my library for, I don't even know how long. But I wasn't dissapointed.  Pros -Decent Graphics -Fluid Combat -Huge World -Complex crafting system  Cons -No real challenge (On the plus side I wasn't in the mood for a challenge when I started playing) -Crafting creates seriously over-powered gear -Reakoning modes makes Bosses pointless, not that they were tough before -Did I mention the game was really easy  All in all, not a bad game. Everything looks cool, which was all I wanred out of this game, If your looking for a challlenge, I suppose a few small self imposed rules would make the game harder if you wanted to go that route. But honestly I really enjoy taking the time in a game to craft gear that basically makes combat a walk in park.
2841	1	a	Well it's not the best game out there but it really fun to play + it's very cheap bth 0,79 euros is not that much. I think its worth buying it ! :)
5198	1	a	the amazing prelude to Guardians of Orion, this game will give you endless hours of fun with friends online. definetely take advantage of the price, this game is worth well over the dollar you paid for it!
5470	0	a	69
3712	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
3451	1	a	Awesome game, 9/10 only thing i could suggest is more work towards controller work.
4949	0	a	Sure the game is less that a $1. But it's real bad. About an hour of gameplay before you'll get bored of it. I guess you get what you pay for.
32	1	a	Oh No.... It's so addictive... I don't recommend... It makes you loose track of time :)
75	1	a	Puzzle Quest meets Solitaire/Poker... Pretty interesting blend.
2848	1	a	You get to kill dinosaurs with big guns... and it costs less than a beer. So you get the idea.
1145	1	a	Great main story line, the battle/invasion of mel senshire feels like a real invasion filled (unlike ESO's deadra invasion). Three main different type of play style, Might (ignores damage, stuns, and cleaves through everything), Sorcery (fragile yet massive AOEs, and has a friggin chkram), and Fitness (nimble, sneaky, high dps, and utilizes poison). Also from this three main play style you can mix them up to create a might/sorcery, fitness/sorcery. might/fitness, might/fitness/sorcery. Great combat system, hacking and slashing with combos are addictive, and to inhance combos you can switch weapons in the middle of a combo you make your character look flashy.  However the graphics are not the best, but average. Side quests tend to get boring and can not select multiple quests at once. There is a lot of walking involved. Also the auto aim function ruins your fighting style, and the camra angle ,at times, is not the best. Overall this game is a must for RPG lovers... but can have it's moments of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ players off.
3436	1	a	for a 99 cent game i'm suprised at what i got a chance to shoot dinosaurs in the face with my best buddy's  but other then that really don't go expecting the meaning of life  so for just an awsome mulitiplayer-dino-killing game, its worth the 99 cent tag as an evening game to be played with friends
4336	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
5315	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
2759	1	a	Decent FPS to hop into with friends for quick 30minute sessions
2585	1	a	After wading into this game with unceremoniously low expectations and a halfish-hour of actual game time solo (the rest was toying with tweaks to get some enhancements working), I can at least say my expectations were met and there is a decent game underneath this. Disregarding the, um, troubled history that I found out after. Sure, there's no tutorial, motion blur is apparently not working, the trailer is an amateur looking montage of gameplay with quotes from who knows where, the animation is abyssmally 1999 (a F- I'd say), the visuals are some sort of bland thing reminding me of Serious Sam 2 and Halo: Combat Evolved and the gameplay is a mix of older Unreal, current class based affairs and Halo gunplay and vehicular antics, but with DINOSAAAAURS. Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core. The HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game. It's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay. Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.
3046	1	a	I have given this game 2 reviews already but i kept coming back after the updates, the last update did this game justice, Spiral Games finally stepped up and listened to their fans and players. At first i did like the game, nice concept but then after they redid it, the optimization and performance was awful, and when i mean awful. The animations were just sad, i mean the way the raptors *chomped* on you was too odd and sad. It looked like someone eating cereal while having a stroke. But after the recent update this is what i must say.  1. The performance has been hugely improved, i can now play at 60 FPS without my pc tanking it.  2. The visuals have improved greatly, Dynamic Lights have been given a meaning however being annoying sometimes.  3. The animations have improved slightly, they still look clunky, specially the spino's, when theirs too many raptors it starts to breakdance lol, it looks funny but it could be improved.  Overall the game is actually enjoyable now, just becareful on joining a server where the host is from another country, you WILL lagg. This has to be fixed ASAP. Fun gameplay, great weapons (specially the bow, my god that bow is fun) and thank you for listening Spiral Games.   7/10 Fun, Great concept, Killing dinos with a bow while using a jetpack trying to avoid being eating while not dropping to a pool of raptors is enjoyable now.
1600	1	a	Really good Third Person Action RPG. Shame it went unnoticed, I'm really enjoying playing this game with a controller. Vast world, good mechanics, and great combat. I assume the downfall of the game was due to its $60 price tag at release, and being released at the same time as skyrim. Anyways, its a fantastic buy at its current price, and I highly suggest picking it up.
2498	1	a	'Very Great Game indeed' -Quote from ME! :D  I would play this game MORE often if I get a better Pc,Who wouldnt buy a game thats 1$ and great graphics! :D
1080	1	a	Very well built, massive, diverse, at times hard, very enjoyable.
3485	1	a	I reccomend this game simply on the basis that it has guns and dinosaurs without even getting into the fact that it has jetpacks, tanks and lightsabers
5385	1	a	Really,kind of good game
6279	1	a	I only recommend this game if you get it for less than $1. I'd be very unhappy if I paid full price for this game. Quite repetitive, you'll pretty much play through every map a few times in a few hours and get bored.
2586	1	a	Cheap and Good ^^
218	1	a	Really a shame what happened with the devs, this is an extremely good ARPG with only some small issues - narrow field of view and a crafting system that takes a hot second to get used to.  That being said, the game itself has at least 70-80 hours of content outside of DLCs if you explore, and the achievements definitely incentivize exploring. You can switch up your character at will when you find better loot - and better loot you will find - in a ton of different ways, with all kinds of different hybrid playstyles being viable and fun alternatives to ther norm.  The takedowns in Reckoning mode are flashy, the executions from stealth are super satisfying... And for 6$ every other week it's embarrassing not to own a game with this much quality content by now.
1937	1	a	This game is EPIC! It is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL!!!! There are tons of ways characters can be customized and re-customized and specially crafted! I highly recommend this game, and it has a VERY HIGH REPLAY VALUE!!!  The only draw back of this game is the constant respawning of enemies (I tend to just run past the lower level ones when trying to get to a destination), and there is so much to do and so many abilities, the game may seem overwhelming at first.  Overall, I would give this game a very definite 9.5/10.
4362	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
332	1	a	This game is better than Skyrim.
1822	1	a	Buy it. Its Good.
6379	1	a	was 99cents very fun, very addicting, everyone should snatch this game up
243	1	a	I went into this game after being very frustrated by aspects of Divinity 2. Kingdoms of Amalur turned out to be a far more satisfying experience, albeit in unexpected ways.  A major selling point is that it was written by R.A. Salvatore, one of my favourite authors. However, the game's story is very forgettable. I mean that literally - I've played 60 hours, am nearly at the end, and can barely remember anything that's happened. There is a great set piece battle and a few clever side quests, but the rest just blurs together - something something 'fate', something something 'mortal'. There's few choices and little reason to even read the dialogue most of the time - just follow the quest markers and do what the pop-up text tells you to do.  What it really gets right is the gameplay. Combat is varied enough to keep things interesting, despite making up the bulk of the gameplay. Enemies flail around when set on fire, dodge arrows, resist some forms of damage and have some neat skills and spells. The player character can be built in several different ways , and the paths are distinct enough to encourage re-specing (which is quite easy to do). Controls are straightforward, although the camera can be bothersome at times.  The inability to jump, with the resulting unpassable ankle-high obstacles, is irritating at first, but moving around the world is simple enough through a generous fast-travel system, and there's plenty to do as you walk around.  There's no shortage of loot, both from enemy drops and in numerous chests and hidden locations. The inventory fills up annoyingly quickly, with no option to screen items by quality, but there's no shortage of merchants around.  The crafting system is great, allowing all sorts of equipment, potions and gems to be made.  The game loads quickly, and looks lovely even on a mid-range system.  There's certainly plenty of gameplay - expect 60 or more hours to complete most of the sidequests.  It's a shame the game will never be followed up, because there is an excellent core game here.
2089	1	a	Lovely game- beutiful locations, varied enemies and fun story. Voice acting could be better, as could the abilities, but overall I have to reccomend, especially so if its on sale
2538	1	a	Stole the lightsaber sound from star wars 8/8
2458	1	a	It's hard being a support class. Everytime there's a support class, you are expected to heal/support team mates while saving your own skin. If your team mate dies 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT' , if you die 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT', if your whole team dies 'WHERE THE HELL IS THE SUPPORT?'. RIP support class for being too supportive :(
1943	1	a	I love the stories, the additional quests and the fight. The voice also good. But somehow, I feel bored during the midgame untill the endgame and I can't figure it why. Oh don't get me wrong, this is a good game.
2509	1	a	Best game I ever bought
2356	1	a	I don't even own the game but yeah.
1164	1	a	I really enjoy kingdoms of amalur great game, has a fairly decent combat system some abilities could be expanded though. I like the storyline of the game and the amount of sidequests available to boost your levels and coffers. Both the DLC's are good to i have completed the teeth of naros, and almost done the dead kel. Unfortnately was not able to due to a certian glitch and me not saving several (11) hours of gameplay, and do not want to redo all i did. even with that set back id say a solid 8/10
4273	1	a	In other games do you run into people with vehicles and think 'man I wish that was a dinosaur' If so orion dino hoard is for you.' Do you think 'man if I could only hit a tyrannosaurus in the face with a laser sword yelling 'Boink' everytime you hit them? If so Orion Dino Hoard is for you. If you never want to know why in the heck dinosaurs friggin love power generators soo much, then Orion Dino Hoard is for you.  
4976	1	a	I dont even know what to say. It's a first person shooter.......against dinosaurs. Its......brilliant.
1583	1	a	It's a shame the studio was sunk by their failed foray into MMO development. This is a very enjoyable game that does a number of things very well, and I would have loved to see a sequel. If you enjoy RPGs at all, there's a lot to like here (and there's a demo if you just want to test it out). Particularly if you pick it up on sale there's a lot of bang to be had for your buck.   The array of weapons and skills and the mobile combat are quite fun, and I enjoyed playing the various classes, particularly mage/rogue.  I'm going to pick on the flaws, here, however: 1) Dungeon design vs. fast travel - the fast travel system in the open world mostly works well, except for the few places where you can't use it and running back out of a long dungeon or building is quite tedious. To get around this, a lot of dungeons are designed as a one-way loop, and that repeated design eventually wears a bit thin. Though it beats having to run all the way back across a dungeon you just cleared. 2) Combat isn't particularly well balanced. Particularly as the mage, most trash fights were stupid easy after the first 10-15 levels. Likewise, if your Fate is topped out, you can ez-mode almost any fight. But a few of the boss fights seem designed such that they're very hard at low levels if you don't have Fate to unleash, but too easy if you do. The concept of the Fate skill is neat, but it's a bit too powerful. 3) You will reach max level long before you've done all the side quests, and probably before you reach the final boss 4) maxing out the talents (smithing, lockpicking, alchemy) requires knowing where all the trainers are, and carefully leveling and exploration to access them at the right times 5) in that same vein, gold is very tight early in the game compared to what you'd want to spend (when 45,000 to visit a few trainers would be very handy), but you'll likely end the game with millions of gold you have no use for. On my second run through I skipped most looting, particularly chests that needed me to waste time lockpicking/dispelling for what was likely to be vendor trash anyway  Of the DLC, Dead Kel and Naros are both very enjoyable and well designed questing areas and well worth the $3 each if on sale.  
432	1	a	great single player game, would be awsome if there was some kind of multi player in it maybe with just friends but...... overall a fantastic game with AWSOME combat and class choices. the weapons and attacks frikin look bad â¥â¥â¥ and it keeps you hooked. the hardest dicision isnt choosing to buy the game, its choosing your class and weapons. if you like adventure/action/RPG, you will LOVE this game. definate must buy
4690	1	a	Fun game, but suffers from some frame rate issues, and lag when you are not the host, regardless of host's internet connection.
3530	1	a	Got it cause it was only a dollar and im loving it! has replayability because you never know what might happen. Wouldn't say its worth $15 though. More like a $10 game but its still good and you should buy it while its 93% off! played a few hours and been having a blast with my neighbor!!!
1004	1	a	I normally do not care much for the third person style of gameplay, but find myself quite enjoying this one. I would recommend it!
2250	1	a	Really brings back the original essence of the disciples games. Been playing them since the first one and this one feels like a fresh update. Alot more on the same lines as the first two. The first release of the third disciples was terrible and felt like a wanna be heroes of might and magic.  Glad they got it right. Just a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it went on sale for 50% off 12 hours after I bought the damn thing.
2827	1	a	Devs actually fixed it. Game don't suck anymore, guys.
5391	0	a	Ewww...  While this Game may look like fun on first sight it has some serious flaws.  It runs on Unreal Engine 3 utilising Direct3D9 as it's API and is just on default not utilising Hardware Great which only gets strengthened by 3rdparty developers(T-REK 'Industries?') not having heard of Texture Porting and proper VRAM allocation , speaking of the game not even trying to really using those juicy amounts of Virtual Ram your Dedicated GPU has. yea those 4/8 GB lying idle while your frames Keep dipping is how a game is ment to be played.  Second Concern . As above already the game is already not doing too well regarding performance right out of the bat , want to hear a bigger joke. the choice of closed source PhysX as Physics Engine by a 3rdParty Company which already struggles with making peoples hardware work in their game.  Mediocre choice of Graphic options : Oh boy . yea as you launch it you'll find yourself in the Menu with . uhm pardon . A few Options to change. Such as Textures , 'FX Quality'.. the usual.  what it doesn't give you is anything you'd want .: Sound Quality? , cap your FPS at anything else than your monitors refresh rate , half of it or uncapped. set custom Qualitys for Anything included in any setting. Bloodsplatsize, WeatherFX threshold , decal quality , disable Weather FX , lightning , shadowmapsize and so on.   I think as far as this goes we're done with how well the game is ment to be played. pun intended.  Gameplaytime bois.  -Static weaponmodels. -Stiff Animations. -Imported Gametextures are lowresolution and high on performanceloss. -The Charactersounds seem to be recorded in a bathtub with the cheapest ebay mic and directly put into SV and rendered into 192kb/s. -Ai (to be fair even making a semi adequate one is really hard) is outright stupid , gets stuck in defaulted maps which i would ignore if not for the fact that they're made in a fixed loadout and not fully RNG and has weird hitboxes. -Maps are buggy , you can jump seemingly out of bounds , get stuck in random spots , reach spots where you're invisible to the ai , Flat Design , poor detail , and is one large map rendered on launch which explains the poor fps on some machines( Conquest). -Characters and lines are plain and boring , while fun at first you'll get bored of it after a few hours. and maybe annoyed by it after a while longer.  I do not recommend the purchase , it might be fun for an evening or two but it just fails to offer replayablity. in addition to that it runs like Crysis on a post Millenium PC. ( Having no PhysX hardware support that is.) 
6382	1	a	A lot of fun for a $1 game. Basically feels like halo ce mixed with jurassic park.
4216	1	a	Dinosaurs are destroying your generator! Are you a bad enough dude to kill them all?  Dinosaurs/10
6097	1	a	I find this game for the price and for gameplay actually amusing and worth the buck. It's silly but fun at the same time and does bring a few good laughs when playing with friends. You're not meant to take this seriously and that is what makes it even better, graphics are not an issue and slaying millions of dinosaurs by punching them in the face or just blowing their brains out or piercing them with arrows is pretty damn entertaining. I'd say buy it fot you can't really go wrong with a buck you probably gained from selling steam cards anyways and if you just want something to pass the time and/or to relieve stress by killing prehistoric beasts then go right ahead.
2877	1	a	0.99 is a steal for this game. Fun and more fun. Lovin it.
4513	0	a	Should've purchased goat simulator.
5040	0	a	Just, not finished game...
4918	0	a	Oh wow, this is free now?  The optimization is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥, and motion blur is only noticable on dinos, not the camera.
6000	1	a	I played a game with bots, I had fun, killing dinosaurs is surprisingly satisfying. The bots are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ though. And the textures look like they were made in Paint. Then again, I payed 70 cents for this, I don't know what I expected.
3476	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
3919	0	a	Played the game for about 30 minutes. About 2 minutes in I got stuck in the geometry of the world and survived several waves stuck. And then I fell through the world. I really don't understand why anyone would say this is a good game.

Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material.

1653	1	a	Pretty good game. Like a pretenda WoW 
245	1	a	Large, enjoyable, underrated action-rpg. Fun, button-mashy combat that still requires some attention/strategy (esp. on hard); pretty good amount of loot; interesting skill trees and character advancement options; semi-sorta-open-world (new chunks of world unlock as you progress deeper into the game). Gameplay is smooth, responsive, and satisfying, though I recommend using a gamepad for this one. Graphics aren't cutting edge, but they're decent. The world, on the whole, is nicely varied and fun to just roam about and button-mash in.   On the downside, the world is pretty superficial compared to something like a Bethesda game. There's plenty of lore and subquests and dialogue trees and all of that, but none of it is very involving -- just kind of par for the course, more of a console-game feel to the progression and atmosphere. I can't really fault the game much beyond that, though. It's a really solid game, just don't expect quite the level of depth you'd get from a hardcore open-world PC rpg. At the time I'm writing this it's on sale for under $10, and it's a great get for that price.
188	1	a	After playing it so long, i have finnaly decided to put a review in. Now, first off, this is the first game i have ever felt compelled to write a review for, so that means its something special. Now after looking at the reviews that have 180 or so hours on record, that is pretty impresive, but at the same time its not. On The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, i have about 500 hours on record, so doing the math, that would be playing for about 20 days straight without sleep. The reason why that is is the fact that you want to try out all of the different classes and combinations, and this game is very similar. The whole game is centered on fate, and that you are not effected by it (you will see why within 20 minutes of the game). Just like skyrim, you basicly choose your race, then get dropped off in a huge world and your class forges as you play. There are three ability categories: Might, Sorcery, and Finesse. wWhen you level up, you get three points to put into whatever you want. You also have destinies. When you get a certian amount of points in a single ability, or in two abiilities if you are doing a combo, you can select a destiny which will grant you addtional bonuses. You can combine destinies, (Finesse, Finesse/Sorcery, Sorcery/Might, All Three, etc...) into what every you want, and there are 6 levels of destinies for every one. There is a very helpful element to the game, and that is unbinding fate. It basicly (for a cost) resets and refunds all skill points, ability points, and destinies. This lets you make yourself the best mage in the universe to the best warrior in the universe in about 2 minutes. Unfortunatly, at the point in the game when you do this, you will have probably gotten far and there is not as much point (since you done have as much time left to play with it). You can reset your fate within 10 minutes of the game, although i went pure stealthy thief and have not unbound my fate once. I recently beat the game, at 35 hours, and am trying to unlock the last finesse destiny (you will understand when you play the game), and plan to continue with that character until i do. Speaking of the thief class, the game is hard on you closer to the end with it. You are UNSTOPABLE against a single enemy, even the final boss, the semi-final boss, and every other boss like thing was absolutely no trouble, but anytime there is more then one enemy, it gets pretty hard. Alot of the finesse (rouge/thief) class requires you to charge up your attck by holding the button down for a extra second or two, but with more then one enemy, they attck before you can do that. I have yet to play anything else, so i do not know if it is the same for the other classes or not. If you are playing just the story, you could probably beat the game within about 7 hours, but it would be incredibly hard since you would not get to a very high level. Just like other free-roam games like skyrim and far cry 3, you will be lost in the side quests before you know it. I recently showed it two one of my school friends (im in 9th grade), and after about a week of pushing, convinced her to buy it. She is only like level 5, but she said it is amazing. She described it is a skyrim like game, looking like World of Warcraft (in some ways, but i dissagree. The pictures you see above are a little better). Ultimantly, it is an amazing game definetly worth twenty dollars (i would buy it for $60), that you need to play. Even if you just play the demo to see some of the stuff i am talking about, you will probably want to buy it. It has amazing faction quests, some very fun side quests, and probably one of my favorite (if not thee favorite) story questlines. If you are still reading this, that means that this review was interesting enough, which means the game if better. There is alot of the stuff that i left out, that you just need to play to understand. I will defenetly be playing a new game of this again, and possibly even make a walkthrough, just because i love it so much. To close, i am going to say that this is my favorite game i have every played (and i have 167 games on steam, and about 40 more on the xbox) and i really hope that this review convinced you to purchase it. It is a shame that 38 Studios closed down, but i loved the game enough to really dig deep in the internet to see if there is a sequel, and there is a possibility, and buying and promotion the game will definetly increase that chance. I ask that you please buy this, and then write your own review and tell your friends. I have just spent about 1 hour and 45 minutes writing this, and it has not gone to waste. Please, buy this game and tell your friends, your will be glad you did.
3	0	a	Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.
2234	0	a	This game is bad. But it is that cheesy kind of bad which everybody (OK, die-hard fans of Disciples) like. I suppose the guys tried to sort of remake the Disciples II but got short on money halfway through. In Reincarnation you get no playable Dwarves but you get see and play your good ol' undead and demons and humans from DII. Buuut, the units are imbalanced which is topped by a fiendish in-game interface and bugged scripts which render the some missions incompletable. But hey, bugs, interfacece and level scaling (yep, seriously the game expects you to topple 30level enemy during first campaigns mission when you max level is 5) aside, the storyline seems pretty enjoyable so far.
2639	1	a	This game is good for its price but i would like to see offline modes survival etc. 
2114	1	a	This is a criminally underrated game. The story is kinda ok but the combat is some of the best I've played in an rpg.
2456	1	a	Don't let the metacritic review stop you from getting this game. Great buy with good multiplayer and forces you to work together or you won't survive.
3014	1	a	this game is like an arcade game from the mid 90's that you played once and forgot because you played MK2 for so long afterwords and wished you had that quarter back.
5885	0	a	Man there goes 1 buck, that's 1 bag of m&amp;m's...
1808	1	a	This game is highly under rated.
3561	0	a	Back when this game was known as Dino Horde and cost $20 it was actually worth it however with the update to erase their metascore AGAIN they almost reverted back the wonderful interface they had from DH into the garbage beta interface that it is now, the gameplay is the same. Everything is pretty much the same except for the armors which now look even more horrible than how bad â¥â¥â¥ they looked before. Its a good thing its only a dollar, because thats about how much its worth as of now.
880	1	a	
3543	1	a	A great game with dinos.  + Cheap + Many game modes + Nice graphics + Classes + Design style + Many maps + Weapons + You're able to play as a dinosaur.  -/ 
3473	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with. Anyone that enjoys a good fps, whether it be pve or pvp should give this game a shot.
4728	0	a	This is absolute trash. Avoid.
1926	1	a	Really fun and interactive combat system as well as great exploration elements and DLC.
669	1	a	A fairly unsung RPG in its own right, not sure what I haven't heard that much about it. Nabbed it, plus the DLC during a major sale, getting it all for 10$ though it's certainly worth the full price of admission as this will take ~40 hours or more of your time.  The game feels like a mix of Fable and the earlier Bioware games such as Mass Effect, Jade Empire, and Knights of the Old republic, though it's a shinier variant of all of those. It has the aesthetic and music of Fable but with a Bioware-esque RPG mixture.  It's not a complicated game to be sure. The dialog doesn't affect much of what you do and there are no companions to fiddle around with.  I'd certainly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of all the other games listed and have played the rest of them to death. This will be refreshing.
233	1	a	Fantastic RPG set in great fantasy world if you go for all side quests easily play for 100+ hours
3036	1	a	This is a game that cost me $1. Simply the best dollar I've ever spent in my life.
3368	1	a	brilliant game some graphical faults but one of the best games available in my opinion
5292	1	a	there is no blood on the ground, only at walls 
4452	0	a	Wow they made the game worse. Gimme back my dollar!
5818	0	a	A poor game all around by a developer with very questionable practices, I'd avoid it.
1799	1	a	Cute little fantasy RPG, has all the cliche's stiched into it (including the rats in the tutorial level :) ) and the mainstory is very predicable. Pretty brainless gameplay but very amusing none the less. I will probably never play it again after i finish it, but I am enjoying it ATM. Overall not a bad game. I give it 3 cooky's out of 5  sincerely, your old pal...  ...Palantir 
4803	0	a	Do you recommend this game? a big NO
4272	0	a	This game is trash the controlls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the combat is teribad. Humans are favored in this game with more then one attack, unlike a dino. this is by far the worst dino game ever. Prepare to die and lose everytime if your a Dino.
3787	1	a	F.U.N    Orion: Dino Horde is Halo &amp; tribes together with Dinosaurs   Its FUN GET it and join Dolla &amp; me in some dino killing!
21	1	a	Single player poker based fantasy duel game. It's worth a look for the money especially if you are a fan of Puzzle Quest, Spectromancer or Poker Night at the Inventory.
5330	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS CO-OP OMG! CATCH A GAMERA OMG LOVE THIS GAME ^~^ ^3^ ;-; ===================================================================
4040	1	a	thx for my GPU, playing dis game under 30 fps on low-med settings #LoveGrammarNazi
1701	1	a	Quietly one of the better Action/RPGs to come out in a long time. It's like Fable, but for a more hardcore crowd. Well worth picking up.
5424	1	a	Jurassic Simulator with buggy animation. 9/11 would play again
6213	1	a	Excellent idea and design but balence is terrible. If you do not pick the support class you are bad as not only are you the tankiest character but you also have a healing gun. The other two charcters only get a jetpack or a really lame invisiblity power, and anything else that seperates them has a go around.
908	0	a	High production values are offset by a lack of overall depth.   Pros: Nice visuals, good voice acting, fun combat and a deep skill system that almost warrants a replay.  Cons: Mission structure is rarely more than 'run to location, fight enemies, collect item, backtrack'. It wears thin pretty quickly.   You can see where all of the individual influences have made their mark, but the end product is unremarkable due to 30-odd hours of repetitive and shallow missions. I'd recommend it, but not for $60.
3133	1	a	Deserves a lot more love!
2296	1	a	i quickscoped a T-Rex with an explosive arrow while my teammate crashed a V-Tol into its head  10/10 would crash again 
6079	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥! Buy it and derp with friends!
960	1	a	This game is incredible and huge. Still working my way through (there are so many side quests!) I picked it up on the Christmas Steam sale for very cheap so, I wasn't expecting much and I was very happily surprised. I wish I had known about this game when it was new but for some reason it escaped my notice, otherwise I would have supported it. First impression, it had a play feel similar to Skyrim but, it isn't quite that either and this game has endeared me a bit more. The story is to me where this game shines and the voice acting. Kind of like the SWTOR mmo? The writing is great, the voice actors are wonderful - so if you enjoy listening to characters talk and stories with multiple choices and outcomes - this game might be for you. I guess if there are any negatives the battle system may seem a bit simple or repetative, but you can change with fateweavers at any time between different classes so you can spice it up. Would recommend :)
1658	1	a	This is My second play through off this game as I played it back in 2012.. Back then I thought it was a great game... Now in 2014 its even better with the sad state of unfinished, unpolished and generally who cares attitude off Alpha/Beta games. Combats fast, fun and fluent with great RPG elements to boot. The quality of this game shines through from animations and attention to detail. Thanks Curt Schilling :) PS: Download Sweet FX and boot the game through this.. Does a nice job on overhauling the graphics
1128	1	a	If you are unsure of buying this game, maybe i will help you with my review.  This game have one of the best combat I have ever seen in a RPG. There are lot of nice abilities and you can combine them as you please, so there is a lot of variety. Game is huge, so there is a lot of discovering and adventuring. Story is subpar, but I have seen worse, it is still playable. Music gets kind of repetitive, but you can just mute the music and play something on your pc, so thath is not a problem at all. Some quests are repetitive, but that is normal with rpgÂ´s.  8/10 I would recommend this to my friends, this game is worth every penny.
2380	1	a	I got teleported into a Triceratops and my vehicle randomly exploded. 10/10 would play again
603	1	a	A nice game with a great storly line. It's been a while since i've played such a well ''made'' RPG based game. With a lot of customizable content - the game offers users unique ways to make and build a character, upgrade and define a gameplay stile. It laks the all important multiplayer feature, but overall - a good RPG title that i truly recommend.
2164	1	a	This game is great. there is a big well realised world with a lot of lore despite it being Tplkinesque. i spent a lot of time talking to all the characters to learn more about the world. There is a great sence of freedom and exploration. there are a lot of sidequests and you can spend many hours just playing those without doing the main quest. the combat is a great combination of meelee magic and bow and arrows. since there are a lot of differnt weapons that change up the combat whenever you switch them out. this can only work so well because the gameplay is fluid. combined with good sounds designe the combat feels impactfull despite not being overly graphic and bloody. this is also due to the artstyle of the game that is pritty easy on the eyes. the main story itself is a bit chliche despite the fact you ware raised from the dead and thus have no destiny unlike everyone els in the world. this concept is not used very interestingly and the story boils down to go beat the big bad guy. This is not a big problem since the great artstyle gameplay lootgrind and lore will keep you hoked buy this game.
5557	1	a	hello friend this game is um pretty sweet you know what i'm sayin but it's like idk pretty lame so yeah
3903	0	a	The optimisation of this game is horrible. The game itself is very repeditive, some of you may disagree but I guess the $1 it is currently on sale for is the chance for you to try it yourself. Might just be another number to add to your account. I'm not telling you not to buy it but it still may tickle your fancy. It's just not my kind of game.
4478	1	a	I never enjoy buying games. But I got pressured into buying this because of my friends. I was thinking 'It'll probably be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game but it's just a doller.' But holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ was I wrong. This game has a major lack of fun when it's singleplayer but the fun is all in co-op. 10/10 dank meme m8.
5211	1	a	i like the game. i bought this for like 20$ and it came with 3 gift copies. wife and i played it alot had a good time the only complaint i have is that you need a good graphics card to play.
1625	1	a	Get it, its best played on the PC version very smooth.
3486	1	a	This game is much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5607	1	a	for the 1$ i paid(and if you intend to play with friends, even the full price justifies it) i got many hours of fun.  a horde survival-shooter with a large sized map, classes and vehicles tossed in the mix and epic boss fights(well... t-rex counts as a boss, right?)  if you liked killing floor's style of survival, chances are good you'll like this. thats all i can say.
3066	1	a	ok so i bought this game for 99 cents when it was on sale and i will admit it was probably the best 99 cents i have spent recently. the game is pretty fun i mean there are a few small things that i think could be a little better but overal the game is a great time killer and it has the potencial to be really fun if you have a good group of friends to play with. i personally wouldnt spend full price on it though even though it is fun there isnt much content its just another multi-player shooter. but next time it is on a steam sale i say get it for sure
3607	1	a	This has to be one of my favourite games ever. yeah its a bit buggy so who cares. the graphics are not the greatest so what. the game is difficult who cares. You get to mow down the cast of jurassic park. i could make a whole list on why i would recommend this game but i don't really have to play the game and youll see why i think this is a great game
95	1	a	surprisingly nice cards game using poker mechanics. had few hours of fun with it. they just released it on iOS, too.
2413	1	a	Great Game! Best game i have played in a long time, And it is better then some $60+ games! 10/10 would recommand it, Hours of fun!!
1896	1	a	Really nice RPG game, everyone should give it a try! :)
3615	1	a	Cheap and awesome
3945	0	a	this game is total dogshit. don't buy it. the developers are scammy as hell and tried to do some shady â¥â¥â¥â¥ to hide from their terrible reviews. Don't buy it.
4092	1	a	It's Borderlands, but with dinosaurs.
1343	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a standard hack and slash RPG. It is a game developed by Big Huge Gamers (the company name) &amp; 38 Studios.     Pros:    - Gameplay is great, the game involves around leveling up your character and completing quests throughout. There are a lot of sides quests to do, lot of equipment, and a lot of leveling up. The game is open world you can do what you please.  - Graphics itself is very nice too, not outdated for todays standards.  - Combat is pretty good itself, you find new weapons and new equipment to become more powerful throughout.  - Story line is ok, you're this character waking up from a tomb, you discover that evil villians has taken over the land, your job is to save the land from the evil and become the hero.   - There are 3 DLC's to this game, which adds on to the game and makes the game longer, you may buy the whole pack  here.     Cons:     - Camera is terrible, the camera is very sensitive and sometimes uncontrolable. You can assign the controls in the game, however it is very hard to control it when you are in combat.  - No multiplayer, while the game doesn't need multiplayer, the game could have been better with multiplayer in the game. The single player gameplay is good itself.  - Controls are sometimes confusing, however you can assign the controls to assign to your comfort on the keyboard.    Is it worth buying?    If you are a fan of these type of games, go for it. If you are confused whether to buy this game or not for full price, wait until it goes on sale for under $15.00,    I bought this game for $6.   
5753	0	a	Complete crap from a not so savory development studio.
3251	1	a	Worth the money! You can kill dinosaurs while flying with a jetpack and looking at the great rain effects!  10/10
753	1	a	6/10
6341	0	a	Game play was glitchy at best
1621	1	a	Fantastic game , played it for a bit now .  i have only a few cons on that ,  first and most obvious is the jump problem , is such an annoying thing to not be able to jump !@#% next one is the lips of the NPC's , theyr almost not moving at all whilr you can hear them tallking . the camera is another thing , sometime shile tallking with an npc its just moving , which leads me to another cons , if you enter a chat with an npc while attacking ( or a scene ) the sound of the attacks or running is plaing all through the chat or scene , now that's REALLY annoyng ,  but mostly , i enjoy it , you can overcome the cons with thr pros .
3978	1	a	So. This game has a horrible rating from years ago that it's been struggling to recover from, but it's not terrible. It's a fun game to play with friends once in awhile. The main reason I originally had any interest in it was because it wasn't another boring predictable zombie shooter like 90% of other shooters on the market right now.   It's not flawless. There are bugs and glitches and exploits and optimization issues, but overall, it's like a 6.5/10 game, pretty solid. At least where PVE game modes are concerned.   Every single match I've ever played of PVP, lowest ping won. The game seems to just have awful netcode as far as PVP is concerned, and ping makes more difference than skill 100% of the time. There's also a lot of major balancing issues, and a few game-breaking bugs. Like, one of the first times I entered the PVPVE game mode, there was just one guy cloak knifing everyone. There's an awful exploit on the Cryo Knife that allows people to spam knife attacks instantly as fast as they can click their mouse, and it hasn't been fixed over the last several updates, so meh. â¥â¥â¥â¥ anything pvp-related in this game. If you want to have a good experience, stick to survival and/or conquest with friends.
3230	1	a	This game was suprisingly really fun. I'm not really scared of dinosaurs,  but I do scream when I see the stegosaurus running towards me. This is a game where it will sneak behind you and grab you and by  the time you look at the time, while you're trying to survive the next wave,  you will already be 3 hours late for work.  Plus- Jetpacks. This game made me see how well jetpacks and dinosaurs go together.
4038	1	a	good game to play with and a decet amount of people play it but it lacks in weapons.
4326	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
1922	1	a	In short, a mix of Skyrim (open world RPG) and Diablo (Hack'n Slash), with some inspiration from God of War (combat action) ; very well and cleverly done!  I was expecting it to be only average from the trailers, and I stuck 75 hours on it (without DLC). It is just a perfect mix, and you can feel that the team tought about a lot of details; a lot of energy has been put into this game.  A bit easy thought, even on 'hard'. You might want to avoid the crafting skills too for more challenge.   A co-op mode would have been awesome, but does not exist.
3520	1	a	When i saw the meta score for this game i though it was bull dust. But this game has been so underestimated by the score beacuse of early scoring by meta. the Game is the MOST fun to have with freinds . Sure it has glitches But the graphics and the gameplay makeup for it all the way. The guns are all even when in pvp. this game is up there in my books for indie
4742	1	a	The best game you can get for that price :)
4424	0	a	its badly designed,not very good looking, not very fun and not even worth 99 cent, and the metacritic score is misleading it should be under 20 percent 1.5/10
4989	0	a	no server for sea, play at 200 ping
806	1	a	I flipping &lt;3 this game!! ^_^
2850	1	a	If you use the weird hoverthingies you can climb over the heightlimit and go driving around the skybox. Also it had dinosours at some point. But they won't really bother you if you keep driving in circle and just not care about them.  You are a autist who likes dinosours so you will buy it even if I say that this game is worse than Hitler.  9/10 it has dinosaurs.
4517	0	a	Sucks. You get what you pay for.
436	1	a	
4596	1	a	Loved the game it was by far the best dinosaur game ive played i got to do lots of things be dinosaurs, kill dinosaurs, ride vehicels, lots of gamemodes, it was the most fun ive had.
1226	1	a	This game is like Skyrim and Dungeon Siege 3 in one game. I love it!
4592	0	a	download this game  
2797	1	a	After only playing the game for a matter of a half hour I managed to get stuck in a dino, watch as my team mate flew into the sunset carried off by a pterodactyl. I got bumrushed by Compsognathus (tiny rat looking things from Jurrasic park, you know the miniture t-rex's)  Wan2play.net  9/10 gives this game a 9 out of 10 the only thing they need to work on is minor glitches and support for AMD users other then that I think this game is well worth a dollar
6310	1	a	good game if you are interested in just having a bit of fun with friends
4773	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game... -10/10
6288	0	a	A bad Halo knockoff with dinosaurs. Would've been nice to play humans vs dinosaurs with more than four people. 4 suicide bomber pterodactyls /10
4875	1	a	Worth it
4699	1	a	Got It Free Cant Really Run It Got Bad Specs
5061	1	a	This is cool. U did gr8 m8 20/10.
3119	1	a	you get to fly around with jetpacks and shoot dinosaurs. what more could you want in a game? 11/10 would bang
991	1	a	Best game i had right now yeah gonna end it
2461	1	a	I love this game ! :D
5678	0	a	If this game was a cheeseburger it would be a rotten cheeseburger.
2868	1	a	The ratings on this game through youtube and a couple other places are pretty bad but I think this game is amazing. Sure it has a few quirks, as all betas do. But I can't seem to get enough of it. Well done!
3579	1	a	If you have friends, you are going to love this game.  You will need a decent computer to avoid fps loss, however.
5593	0	a	bad graphics, terrible audio and sounds wich give you a headache, badly optimized, massive frame drops, bad animations, bad models, etc, i dont recommend this game at all, the only good thing about this game is the ragdoll physics on the dinosaurs, nuff said
2479	1	a	I've put in a lot of hours into this game and it's better than last two COD games released! I'm looking at you COD Ghosts!!! Anyways, the game is highly adictive and fun and may have some issues if you're playing solo or online! Unless you got a really good gaming computer like Alien or similar, than disable blooming and dynamic lighting! (even though it takes away from the overall awesomeness it brings to the game) And set the game to windowed mode to help out with makeing sure you have a better speed! (May not work for everybody) Overall this game will bring back nostalgia of Turok while adding other styles of games to make a familiar, yet unique, style of gameplay! Hope you guys (and gals) have as much fun as I have with this game!
1389	1	a	The beginning of the game was almost unbearably slow, and I absolutely do NOT enjoy the fact that each area you enter is level locked (wiki this for more info). After some progression and crafting starts to take off it does start to shine, but many game aspects are too simplistic and did not live up to it's potential. Not much replayability value.  In the end, I'd recommend this game as long as you can catch it on-sale. The story is okay and it will definitely keep you occupied for a couple days.
151	1	a	Fun game. Decent storyline. Excellent graphics, an enjoyable game. Has some bugs that were never fixed, but can be easily ignored. For the price I paid, it's a fun game.

5613	1	a	Dino's everywhere.The next viral thing on the internat.
534	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, looks great and colorful, is fluid and responsive. Story is fine, it revolves around player quite much and there are lot of sidequests too. I'ts always fun to come back to this good looking world, good idea when you have some stress.
3802	1	a	This game... i was extremely skeptical at first. But after playing it for a while, i'm in love. Definitely worth a shot. BUY IT!
5282	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
5443	0	a	it gets boring very fast
1075	1	a	This is easily one of my all-time favorite titles. Perhaps in that regard I am easy to please. But the single greatest thing about this game is the combat, hands down. This is, to this day, some of the most tight and fluid combat mechanics you're gonna find in a game like this. Let me put it to you this way. and hopefully I won't have too many crosshairs on my domepiece for saying it...this game makes the combat in Skyrim look robotic and rigid by comparison. Really from a subjective point of view, combat is all this title has going for it. Everything else, beyond a particularly beautifully crafted world, is standard RPG fair. From the class system, to leveling up, to main and side quests, these are all elements we've seen again and again. Its the combat that keeps me coming back for more, and its likely that combat that's gonna hook you too.
1778	1	a	Really good game with beautiful graphics and good story. Nice RPG where you can spend many hours palying.
2857	1	a	It's fun!
6062	0	a	Game is buggy, crashed and DCes during games. One crash caused me to lose my progress. Would not recomend.
2305	1	a	the third person animations on the player models look like deep fried aass other than that it's fun to make these magestic creatures go extinct all over again by brutally blowing their heads off 577/12 - would kill baby raptors again
1699	1	a	The best action-Rpg I have played in my whole life.Never played before a game with so beautiful graphics and generally the landscape of every town you visit.A variety of different type of weapons that will make you very busy trying to find better and better weapons in the very big world of Amalur.But best of all the story is so great that it will keep you busy for 100+ hours,leveling up with an advanced level up system(including the choice of the fate you want).The game is excitting however you play it or the choices you made.If I was a critisian,I would give this game 10 out of 10. :*)
5016	1	a	great idea very simaler to alot of sandbox shooters/consturction games my pc had trouble handeling the screen rate
6183	1	a	Killed a huge â¥â¥â¥â¥ing spinosaurus with a ghetto lightsaber. 11/10
6171	1	a	Its a fun game to play when you need them dino kills :D
3068	1	a	Wow, simply fantastic. I've persoanlly been searching for a good Dinosaur game for a while now, and all have been sub-par. All until now, that is. This game is the most exhilirating, most intense, hardcore dinosaur game I have ever played. I would a hundred dollars for this game, but this game is a fraction of the price, making it a must buy, 11/10 would reccomend
2724	1	a	Running through the cannons shooting up a Raptor when all of a sudden a massive T-rex rears its ugly head from around the corner. I can see it staring deep into my eyes, I watch on as this massive beasts picks up a boulder with its jaws and throws it at me, I had no choice but to take it to the Knee like a real man, I was down. I watch on as the beast walks over to me, fear in my eyes, hate in his. He leans down, smells me then stands on my head. R.I.P  10/10 Will play again, &lt;3
1516	1	a	Its pretty solid so far on hard mode. Lots of action - the combat is tight
3676	0	a	What do you get when you cross rampaging dinosaurs with jetpacks,explosions,sci-fi action and co-op gameplay? An awesome videogame idea.What do you get when you play ORION: Dino Horde? A terrible,terrible experience. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played.Not only is it badly made,poorly executed,ridiculously framed, and badly coded.It's just unplayable game  Donât bother.Save your money.If you want an engaging sci-fi cooperative experience,buy Natural Selection 2 instead !!! :)
790	1	a	First off let me start off by stating that my hours played on Steam doesn't represent my hours played in KoA:R by a long shot. I played at least eighty or more hours on the Origins version back when the game first game out. KoA:R is one of my all time favorite games, also one of the biggest disappointments to me as well in a lot of ways because I had such high hopes on the IP reallly going places and it's offspring becoming a contendter for WoW. Too bad that never happend, however that still doesn't stop the game from being a great RPG by it's own right.  Since I upgraded my main gaming rig to Windows 10 I found that my big screen TV seems to play better with my HDMI out on my laptop now so I decided to fire up KoA:R that I had on Steam and use it to as a gauge big screen preformance. Once of the problems I had with the PC version of KoA:R was FOV settings and luckily playing it on the big screen helps resolve a lot of those problems.    Game wise the game still is a beautiful game. Yes it has that WoW-like comic book feel to it, but I enjoy it personally over the more realistic Elder Scrolls artwork. No the combat isn't as good as TES and yes considering the writers involved the writing is a letdown but still the game is fun for what it is. It is a great lay back on the sofa / gaming chair and just goof off type of third person action RPG. It is overshadowed by other RPGs and yes it failed to live up to the hype and it was done in by legal issues but still years later it is a fun game by its own right.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it change the gaming landscape like I had hoped but still years later it is worth playing. It has me hooked again after a few hours now that I want to do another play though and see what look nooks and crannies I might have missed. All in all I still recommend it. I would recommend it though only on sale, and personally only on sale on Steam. I wouldn't pick it up on Origins.
4401	0	a	This game has some very nice maps though some of the things are too spread out....very nice objectives....and some not too bad models for things. Even the controls are not too bad....  The problems though.....wow....alot of them...going to slowly go down the list here.  Like int he game 'Killing Floor' the enemies simply go in straight lines try to get to things....like for example if you are playing the protect the genrator....they will go to the generator...no matter what like a homiing missile....only good thing is that the developers ont his game improved the engine a little bit...so unlike killing floor the enemies dont ignore up down physics.  If a player gets in a certain radius of any dinosaur....they become the next magnet...all enemies ignor everything else and go after that one player. The only time they lose interest is when the player goes into fight for their life mode.  Weapons....i dont know...they seam sub par.....they do barely any damage.....i was one shot killing by using the standard melee attack and because the AI was so bad.....i just had to stand in one spot....let the line of enemies come at me while i punched them all....didnt take much skill.  Grenades seamed to not work much at all and the grenades and my own gun fire seamed to be able to destroy the generator more then it could the enemies....and when i say grenades didnt work much...out of 20 being thrown, only 3 seamed to detonate...kind of annoying.  Another issue aside from the magnet enemy AI and poor performance weapons...my character always seamed super fragile...and my powers seamed kind of pathetic....like the assualt guy gets a jet pack....which is sort of neat yet any form of fall and you take massive damage....in real life i can jump of a 1 story building no problem...in this game such an act gets me badly hurt....yes i am inthe future with advanced armor and unable to survive very well...the irony does not escape me. The recon character class gets a very short sub-par cloak field....as in everything sees through it.....but then with the way the game auto tracks to you well guess thats just how it is.  Now when you die...you do get a fight for your life....which made me laugh alot....because as soon as you get to that state the dinosaurs ignore you and run off....and weirdly enough your weapons start doing even less damage. I had to melee 3 times instead of 1 time to kill things....that actualy made me laugh on the bad mechanic.  The game mode i played had a genrator i had to defend ala like a tower defense....waves of enemies would hsow up to assault that generator from all over. Each wave made enemies stronger and also would introduce new enemies. Between each wave i was given 60 seconds to spend cash i had recieved for killing enemies.  Ok first off the generators are always far away from the resupply points...you take 20 seconds to get to the those points even while sprinting....bad machanic....they should have made it so you can buy what what you want then maybe activate the generator to start the next wave....but no...the made a stupid way of doing it....ala like killing floor.  now each wave shows how many dinosaurs you have left to kill....these are shown with markers over them.....unfortunately anothe rbug makes more enmies appear inthe game who will randomly appear right be hind you or somewhere else and attack you.....again a flash back of killing floor and its poor game system.  Those random not needed to be killed enemies will appear right behind you...no matter where you are...inthe air...on a cliff....back to a wall.....suddenly you are getting hit....you turn around and see a dinosaur is on top of you and the wall and attacking only you.  I dont like games where they suddenly appear like that....with no defense....doesnt make this exciting...just makes it stupid.  Purchase of weapons requires alot of cash to get them...you wont be able to buy the next pistol untillyou have killed 10 enemies....you cant even by a rifle until you kill 30 of them.  My total time playing was maybe 10 or 15 minutes....why so little time to pass judgement....my game library on steam and raptr, and xbox live, and u-store...and a plethora of places speaks for it self.  I am biased...becasues i have played really good games and played really aweful ones...and this one although its not the worst....its still bottom of the barrel....i am surprised the meta-critic score is not lower. Persoanly i would rate this a 10 or 9 out of 100.  In my opinion the develoeprs failed bad onthe AI and the spawn on top of players mechanic. They failed on the run to the store to buy new stuff in 60 seconds mechanic...and they failed onthe cloak mechanic whihc doesnt seam to work.  Multiplayer death match following these mechanics simply will make the matches un balanced and no point to play...as it will follow the system the winner will get cash to buy new slughtering devices to kill faster and better while a person who is unlucky and loses to much will be left far behind.  I dont recommend this game to anyone in its present state....the being on sale for a dollar....well not sure if its worth the trouble to get it.   Pictures onthe site do a great job of showing its art work...game play though is not getting shown at all...they show movies....but no real game play...and the reason is becasue its not too good at all,
497	1	a	Imagine if Path of Exile met Skyrim and then met Assassins creed. This game is a gamers fantasy, seriusly! Purchase it, I only just got it, but from first impressions it is really fun. Good side quests, fun button mashing (with a lil skill) gameplay, and a diverse story.
289	1	a	So take World of Warcraft and Fable-esque art style and questing but add dynamic combat mechanics akin to Darksiders or Devil May Cry and you get Kingdoms of Amalur. While the story is somewhat lackluster and dull, the open ended exploration of vivid Amalur and it's treasures/loot make up for it shortcomings. The character builds consist of classic dungeon crawling roles of the Warrior, the Mage and the Rogue or combinations of the three classes which offer unique combat approaches. Unlike other open world RPGs ,like Skyrim, you are able to completely respec a character's perk points (for a fee) if you feel you made a bad decision in their allocation or just want a change of pace. Almost 25 hours into this game and I feel I've only scratched the surface. Great buy!
5326	1	a	Really good....but really weird!!!
1511	1	a	Not even an hour into playing this game you can tell that it is a collaboration from the minds of fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, comic book legend and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, and the team behind the Elder Scrolls games. This is a long game set in an immense world. It is so long and has so many side quests that after finishing the main story line and the end credits scroll, the game isn't over and you can continue to explore the world and finish the rest of the side quests.   The style and gameplay seems like a combination of the Fable series and the Darksiders series, but without an emphasis on morality, and a wider array of weapons and armor. The crafting system in the form of blacksmithing and creating socketable gems is useful and easy enough, but seems relatively moot when more powerful items can be found in looted chests or dropped by enemies. The class system is interesting in that you don't have to choose one skill tree over an other and you can mix and match skills as you see fit. This leads to the game's 'Destiny' cards that serve as the game's classes based on how skill points are invested. It is basically different combinations of warrior, mage, and rogue; and even all three.   The game maintained my interest throughout the whole play through, but I will admit that the side quests started feeling tedious and I started to ignore them all together in favor of seeing how the main storyline plays out. If I want, I can still finish the side quests since the game continues after completing the main quests.   I recommend this game if you are a fan of the Darksider or Fable style of action RPGs that are controller friendly and take the time to flesh out a storyline and develop an immersive world.
5994	0	a	This game should not have the single player tag. Game is not intuitive. I see a lot of weapons sitting there, but there is no key to pick them up. I will investigate the forums if I ever decide to try this game again.  There was a response to a question about playing solo in the forums:  'The short answer is: Yes.  You'll not be able to level up and unlock equipment, you won't get achievements, the game is much more fun to play with other people and more difficult to play alone.'
5858	0	a	This game is suck. GGWP
1043	1	a	First part of the game bugged out. A gate would not open for me (The part where you get the bow and need to shoot the soldiers across the room). If anyone got a fix for this issue. please let me know. Love this game and it's kinda sad that I can't even get past the first part.
804	1	a	Basically everything about that is good has already been said. Let me tell you one thing, the camera is great (in my opinion) it is very smooth and doesn't glitch and skip about.
5615	0	a	don't  just don't    Tip: IF YOU SEE A GAME WITH 'MIXED' THE CHANCES OF THAT GAME BEING â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS LIKE 87,25%
6098	1	a	Survive waves of dinos. Different game modes with 3 different classes and a nice variety of enemies. Plenty of guns to choose from. A lil buggy but a solid game for a very cheap price. Such and underrated game.
3720	0	a	Don't waste your time on this one.
5589	1	a	very meme
3827	1	a	For a game that you can buy for less than a dollar, this is the best you could ever hope for.  Yes there are some bugs and it doesn't exactly feel like a complete game, but shooting dinosaurs while flying on a jetpack just feels fun. I highly recommend this.
1222	1	a	This was a surprise hit for me. After countless hours of game play (and I still have loads of side quests remaining) I can say that this game was excellent. I enjoyed the story as much as I enjoyed the mechanics: -hud and interaction don't get in the way of the action, - character progression is detailed but not overwhelming, - maps are huge wth loads to explore with tons of side quests, - storyline is very good and I found the voice acting to be excellent, - grahpics are solid although at times jumpy (but my rig is begining to show its age). All in all this was a good, solid game. Well worth your RPG gaming time. 
5165	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Cant customise jack â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the dinosaurs look like something my cat â¥â¥â¥â¥ out.  -69/100 wouldnt play again.  Even for 99c it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.
2786	1	a	Good game, people naturally knew what needed to be done. Not a single word said and you got a driver with a gunner.
2095	1	a	I love this game. Just re-downloaded it and started playing again. This is my third playthough. Only things I don't like are that it is to short, and I feel like the classes aren't balanced. The Worrior is definatly easier than the other two. This is only a slight drawback as it is single player so you don't have to play as the strongest class, just the one you like the most.
1800	1	a	This feels a bit like someone took (a slightly improved version of) the combat from Fable, the randomized loot from the Diablo series, and crammed it all into a semi-open-world Elder Scrolls-lite. Graphics are cartoonish and dated, even on highest difficulty it's still pretty easy, the story is pretty generic, and crafting amounts to tearing apart all your junk loot into a mountain of spare parts and then cobbling a new item from the few good ones in the heap, but despite all that it somehow manages to be a lot of fun. The combat feels fluid and has a nice element of timing in it for special attacks, blocks, and dodges, the various enemies generally feel distinct and have their own quirks and patterns to learn, the skill tree is varied enough to enjoy fiddling with different builds, some of the boss fights are pretty good, and the different regions and environments are all distinct and have their own feel.   Imagine an over-the-shoulder Diablo with slightly more in-depth combat, no classes, a semi-open world, and crafting, and you've got a pretty good idea of what you're getting with this.  Definitely not a groundbreaking or genre-defining game, but it takes the good bits from a bunch of others and puts them together into a generally entertaining package. If you like carving your way through hordes of enemies while collecting loot and chasing side quests, then it's definitely worth picking up whenever it goes on sale.
3876	1	a	The sky makes me lag. The ground makes me freze. The enemys make me die. I think my computer came from the time of the dinosaurs. plz fix my computer.
2163	1	a	this game is like a fairy-tale. you come here and don't want to leave. interesting stories, beatiful landscapes and more. here you can find everything to relax and enjoy the game
1126	1	a	This game is absolutely badass.   It has compelling quests that actually make me want to do them.   The combat is very fluid and even skill based to a huge degree which is awesome.  It has high replay value given the effects of different races as well as destinies.  If you want an awesome game with depth in combat, lore, story, and even environments, then just buy it.  
5778	0	a	rather slam my â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a car door!
1783	1	a	Great game 
1447	1	a	It is simply vast, but this is a two-edged sword. It is awesome to have so much to do, but it can get overwhelming. It would also have been cool to have some more weapon variety, but it is a simply awesome game, with the best RPG combat I've seen.
5672	0	a	Stolen assets and multiple scandals.
4710	0	a	This game is so bad, it's like watching Louis Smith doing maths and english AT the SAME time.
4154	1	a	Lagged quite a bit when i started but when i put the graphics down it became great and quite a fun game.
3814	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play a video game with state-of-the-art graphics, intuitive controls, and creative multiplayer modes? Neither have I, and the developers of ORION: Dino Horde seemed to understand just that. They have pandered to what is assuredly a golden niche market: true hardcore gamers. Because I am the type of person who can confidently identify 'skrubs' who 'get rekt' because they are indeed CASUALS, I can say without a doubt that this game is not for the faint of heart. To really understand Dino Horde, you've got to have the HARDCORE GAMER attitude. Just remember our mantra: 'Anyone who doesn't enjoy a video game that appeals to a select group of people for any reason- be it the challenge it presents or because THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERING OPINION- is a casual and therefore terribly pathetic.'  I think I speak for millions of elite gamers when I say that ORION: Dino Horde is the next Dark Souls before Dark Souls 2. Some folks just can't get into it because they find it too hard and give up in the early stages of this masterpiece. What these NAIVE FOOLS need to understand is Dino Horde is the type of game where you learn by experience. Once you get the hang of the game and start to understand it for what it really is, it presents you with new challenges that build on knowledge you have acquired by simply playing the game and not giving up. That is the beauty of ORION: Dino Horde.  The controls are FLAWLESS. Anyone who says otherwise clearly has no idea what they are talking about. The HUD and the gameplay do not at all feel like crummy ports of the Halo franchise with dinosaurs. Each gamemode is unique and has an entirely different feel from the last. Everything about Dino Horde is so fresh and invigorating, you will never want to play Call of Duty again, which as we all know is one of the most ever-changing game franchises in existence.  American author and journalist Ernest Hemingway once said: 'Sarcasm is difficult to detect on the internet,' and apparently so is honesty. What do dumb ol' books have to do with ORION: Dino Horde, you ask? You didn't hear it from me, but word around the office is this game is the best of its time, and will be for years to come.  I'll leave you with this final thought: Why buy ORION: Dino Horde? No, really, why?
3691	0	a	The budget for this game must have been $2 :(
3936	0	a	This game is terrible.
3466	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
2912	1	a	Jet pack on top of a mountain to throw nades at dinos, see someone next to me slide off the mountain towards a T-rex, watched him get slaughtered. 10/10 Long live the king.
2584	1	a	Don't trust the Metacritic score. This game is absolutly amazeballs.
3811	0	a	Welcome to the dark side of indie games! Where games have little effort placed into them and we do our very damndest to make Minecraft's money because we can't make anything else but blocks!  'OMFG!!! Peetor! u fokn wot m8?! u oly hav 10 hrs in dis musterpeese!' hold your horses! I'm doing the internet a favor by reviewing this game! I'm surprised I played this for 2 days without drinking acid. Have I played 10 hours? yes, is it enough to review a game with a fair amount of game modes to choose from? no. But, this game is being sold off as a 'Unreal Tournament/Halo/Quake/Star wa-- wait wait wait! What?! Star wars? you mean to tell me a light saber knock off is enough to count this as a Star wars game? who rated this? 12 year old's? I'm sorry but the only thing that makes Orion related to those games are: regenerating health (Halo) and vehicles (Unreal Tournament) As for Quake, I'm not even sure what sticks out as being inspired by Quake...If you're talking about the rocket launcher...Sorry kiddies, but almost every shooter has a rocket launcher, so I guess Halo. Half-life. Unreal Tournament. Dues Ex. Doom. Battle Field. Star Wars: Battle Front, etc. Are   all   Quake clones.  This is a ADS game with   zombies   Dinosaurs and classic PvP. But that does not mean that this game is anything like what I have just listed! Do not f***ing confuse good games with this buggy indie mess!     the gameplay
3057	1	a	Ignore the metascore review, its wrong. This game is stupidly fun and you find yourself playing it over and over again with friends. This game is simply fun, if you're looking deeper into this gane welp, then you're not even trying to have fun. It's simple, it's fun and enjoyable and a good game overall. It's like 10 bucks too, just buy it.
4448	0	a	bad copy of csgo and borderlands 2
5641	0	a	The developer is a scumbag
2791	1	a	Fun game that costs less than $1, what more could you ask for?
1229	1	a	The best combat system ever.
5808	0	a	.
907	0	a	A very boring rpg. Unless you have many free hours to kill, I recommend you stay away from this game. I was able to get 9 hours in before I made the decision to drop it for better games. Everything about the game was just too boring. The combat was super easy, the class system was average and the quests and story just didnât have the right hook to get me interested.  The combat seems fun at first but then you quickly realize just how easy and frustrating it is. Enemies are generally dumb or cheesy. You can either face roll enemies or have no ability to dodge correctly, thanks to the wonderful camera and dodge system. You can try to dodge out of the way of an attack but occasionally the camera will be in such a spot that you instead dodge head first into the enemy, taking the damage and then some that you were trying to avoid. This happens more than enough to be frustrating. The quests and story is what truly killed this game for me. The beginning of the story is very bland and almost feels unoriginal. You come back to life after being dropped onto hundreds of decaying corpses to find out now that you have come back, you now have no fate and can change destinies. It seems like a cool concept but itâs surrounded by so many mediocre and clichÃ© rpg elements that it drowns itself. I looked up the ending to the game to see if it redeems itself but let me tell you no, it does not. The story might have been more exciting if it wasnât consumed by the hundreds of similar rpg quest tropes. Most of the quests turn into looking for a monster to kill, finding a missing person, and picking up items off the map or enemies.   I really wanted to like this game, I was excited for it when it came out but I held off on it hearing that it was just boring repetitive gameplay. Now that I was able to get it off Steam for cheap I have to say, they were right. Donât bother playing this game. If you really have to though wait for a sale and make sure you have 20+ hours to dedicate to it.
4645	0	a	Awful graphics and awful game play. no wonder it's being flogged for 99p this weekend.
5194	0	a	Is boring!
2665	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, thatâs sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just canât see myself recommending it in its current state.   Rawwr!!  4/10  Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the 'improvements', however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.
1720	1	a	Wow meets Skyrim? Close enough and no worries about raid-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ screaming at you when their carefully crafted plans fall apart LOL
2489	1	a	Orion: Prelude is really not a bad game like the price would suggest. It deserves a lot more players in my opinion. Parts of it remind me of the original Halo. The graphics are of course better than the original Halo, but still slightly on the outdated side if you compare it to something like Battlefield 4. ALTHOUGH, atmospheric conditions in the maps are some of the best I've seen. Fog rolling in, sunlight and rain, frost on your visor, day fading to night and then to moonlight; it all looks really beautiful in this game. There is a bit of a cartoonish appearance to the maps but I kind of like that. There's a good amount of weapons to pick from. I suggest playing the Gun Game mode first to figure out the controls and weapons if this is your first time. Start your own Gun Game server if there aren't any, preferably with a friend, and people will usually join. There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.
2711	0	a	I can play horde-based gamemodes for hours upon hours without even getting slightly bored. I've played tons of Black Ops Zombies and Gears of War's Horde Modes back on Xbox 360, and the concept generally kept me entertained and immersed in the game longer than I would have without those Horde Modes.  However, when a Horde Mode isn't all that good in a tripple-A title, there's usually plenty of other content that will keep you busy, like the multiplayer and the co-op campaign and what not; the Horde Mode is simply an addition. Lately developers tend to create more stand-alone Horde games with little to no other content meaning that the value determines how good or how bad the game is. Take Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army for example. It's a great horde experience with lots of fun to be had in the co-op. This is stand-alone horde gone good.  ORION: Dino Horde  is stand-alone horde gone haywire-bad.  The Good: Â· Reasonably large maps with objectives and hordes of dinosaurs. Â· Dinosaurs. Ross approves.  The Bad: (Oh God, where do I start...) Â· Terrible hit reactions from the dinosaurs. You just have to spray and pray that you see some blood squirting from their fugly bodies. Oh, and there are no bullet holes where you hit them, so good luck figuring out IF you've even hit them and which ones you hit and which you didn't. Â· Unorganised and messy, from map layout and design to gameplay. Dinosaurs look like they're moonwalking on an escalator, the maps are unnecessarily large, 'upgrade stations' to buy vehicles, upgrades and weapons are scattered unlogically far from each other and so on. Â· The menu looks okay, but everything else is just so damn aweful: the HUD and chat-window are just large bulky windows that take in unnecessarily huge chunks of your screen. Â· A few 'game modes' that make little to no sense what so ever.  The Ugly: Â· The visuals look just acceptable on screenshot, but ingame it's simply terrible. It feels like a rushed and forgotten product the entire time and it's broken at its very core.  Final Verdict: Save your money (even the 99c for which its being sold lately) and do not waste your time on this mess of a horde-game. Boring, ugly, broken and generally dumb,  ORION: Dino Horde  underdelivers in every sense of the word. You may get a laugh at the terrible overall design of the game when it's on a free weekend and you're drunk as sh*t and high as f*ck munching away a pizza on a overly hot summer evening with some equally bored friends.  1.5/10, and that point and a half is simply for the dinosaurs. Rawr.
5968	0	a	Played it once, uninstalled, no regrets.
1508	1	a	This games story was actually not bad, the main draw to this game is the combat though. The combat was always fun, if you got bored with a certain type of weapon you could just swap. The level up system was also fairly interesting, but there were a few things that were odd with it. Mainly how capping works, as you get gear and finish faction quests(for the twists of fate) you get stuff like +1 all acquired might abilities, however its not until you get to +3 of said ability tree that you see that it caps out at +2(Such as 7of5 or 8of6). Another complaint is that the item effects are never listed anywhere in the menu so its up the the player to infer them(assuming crit chance was addative i guess i had about 65%). The worst part about the game was the side quests(not facation quests), i found myself doing all of them at the start, but they quickly got boring. That said, i never had to grind and i hit max level before going to the last boss, so the pacing was actually pretty good, and the ability to respec at any time made it easy to change my playstyle if i was starting to lose interest(such as fighter to mage). I would say this game is worth playing, just skip the majority of the side quests as they generally have very little to do with the plot.
3626	1	a	The metascore is â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game rules.
1537	1	a	Trust me,you want to play this awesome game.Its full of great challenges and its replay ability is huge.Character building offers many choices and gives you the ability to create a truly unique protagonist (or anti-hero if you really want :D ).Soundtracks and music throught the game is stunning and epic.Absolutely reccomending it to everyone,trust me its worth the money :) 
1227	1	a	I bought this bad boy soon after release for PS3 and beat it soon after that. And I loved it so much I knew I'd have to buy it again for PC so I could give it another play through.  There's not much more I can add that the top reviews haven't already covered. In short, it's just a really, really solid action RPG.  The amazing thing about this game is it does no one thing especially well. But it does a lot and it does a lot pretty darn well. The combat is fun. The classes are awesome (I really enjoyed how they did the progressive skill unlocks based on what you specialized in). The world is pretty gorgeous. The music is good. The lore is pretty cool. And the story is alright.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find this much fun for the price in many other games on steam.
1232	1	a	Excellent story, excellent character development and customization, mid level replay value.  Playing this made me think of Fable 1, Mass Effect and basically any Medieval RPG that won't let you jump.
5373	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a game. The game is alright and the content is pretty solid for what it is, decent weapons and class choices to be made, vehicles and game modes to keep the title fresh. With variations to difficulties and XP to farm for class progression this game has good reason for returns.  Edit: Game is called Prelude becasue dodgy COO types.  Has achievements and badge progress. I like this game, and like what it has to offer, the people behind it though....
923	1	a	WOW solo player with R.A. Salvatore input?  Umm yeah, buy this game.  
1058	1	a	lots of fun
5001	1	a	defenitley worth ninety nine cents. I'd probably still get it for two dollars.
3890	1	a	Honestly for the price you will easily get your money's worth. This game isn't going to way you on graphics necessarily but it has so many game modes and enough jokes and craziness to make it worthwhile.
5550	1	a	its a good games becaus it a rpg game so amzing i rate it 99999/99999 
1366	1	a	Thoroughly enjoyed every last minute of this story and world. Wish there was more to come as was originally planned.
1988	1	a	This game helped to weaken the state of Rhode Island
2158	1	a	1st Playthrough is Magical and is full of fun mechanics 2nd Playthrough is a bit slower as you kinda know what happens and fun of mechanics wearing off 3rd Playthrough your really starting to get bored after just leaving the Forest and you end up dropping it Great for first play, terrible for replay value in my op 7/10
5636	1	a	i bought this and now it's free to play!!!?? i just waste my $1 for this           but the gameplay is good
355	1	a	one of the best rpg's i've played in a long while
5272	0	a	boring chaos
3144	1	a	Its a very good game but at my PC lags. Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3240T CPU 2.90 GHz RAM: 4 GB and on board GPU. Is this normal to happen? I play games with higher system requirtments and they dont lag at low settings.
6232	1	a	Jurassic Park: The Video Game (more or less)
1771	0	a	Was this game supposed to have excellent narrative from some impressive famous author? The first hour or so of dialogue is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in a professionally made computer RPG.
3998	0	a	Not worth it, not even for free.
6399	1	a	Such a great game and yet so simple. Not to mention the low price of 99 cents. This game brought me a few hours of fun and I highly recommend this game to anyone. Playing with friends is great and so is playing by yourself. Buy this game and you will not regret it.
854	0	a	Great game but it keeps on crashing on my machine. The troubleshooting suggestions given by the forum and the support is a waste of time.
1719	1	a	Very good RPG game. I complete this game 3 times with 3 differant classes (mage, warrior, rogue). This game is very interesting, also the expansion packs are worth buying.  What I find unique about this game is the combat system. imo it is very tought trough!  Just check some gameplay videos and I hope you guys enjoy this game just as I did!
6308	1	a	Game is awesome. Highly recommend it especially since the price is so cheap.
3651	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!
5122	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RECAMEND THIS GAME 
5932	0	a	Developer has a bad habit of stealing assets and calling them their own, even defending the stolen assets. Here is the best summary I could find:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
4390	0	a	a whopping 0 playerbase. not even worth a single dollar.   10/10 main menu simulator
2328	1	a	For the price it can't be beat. To be honest i would have paid $10 for this game. It's simple but challenging and fun. it also, if accidentally, has a comedic side to it. Though there are some bugs and the controls of the large dinos can be clunky it's still great. Generally, the flaws are unnoticeable during play. I highly recommend ORION: Prelude.
1267	1	a	Fantastic RPG, only gripe is it went on sale 2 days after i bought it full price.
4176	1	a	First of all. some of the latest haters are a little bit stupid cause they didnt noticed (like some big magazines ) that THIS IS NOT THE GAME WITH THE DMCA PROBLEMS. Most of them played the game for only 0.5 hours. Orion prelude isnt a bad game and ORION (2016) also.  And something i also want to say:'Activision' always have problems with everything and everyone.  I played this game long enough to know that the most haters never played the game more than 10 minutes. This is my second positive review.
6191	1	a	Wow this game is actually really fun. Who knew killing dinosuars is actually really fun xD
0	1	a	Why don't they make more games like this?!  Simple card playing mechanic that's fun and addicting. Then you have a vaguely interesting storyline that your character has to make his way through.  If you like Puzzle Quest (1st one), you'll love this game!   Seriously, they need more games like this!
3934	0	a	This is just horrible.
2215	1	a	A much better and totally improved version of Disciples 3. This is what it should have been from the beginning. It's a shame that the company shut down before this actually became the primary version of the game.   They got a new voice actor to read the scenario information, which is a HUGE improvement. They shrank the battlefields which was a great improvement for combat. They revamped and rebalanced each unit and hero in the game and they rebalanced all of the scenarios in the game. This results in a much more enjoyable experience. Sadly, it may have come too late for the future survival of this series.
4169	0	a	Launched it 2 times. 2 crashes in a row. 10/10 Auto-delete.
2597	1	a	It's like Halo, but with dinosaurs
1170	1	a	Great Game. Tons and I mean TONS of side-quests to keep you entertained.
2173	1	a	Great Game.
437	1	a	At time of writing it is 2:40 a.m. so I'm ranting  BUT WHAT A GAME HOLY ****  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a gigantic map of living, breathing npcs woven together by a glossy art style and quirky, sarcastic tones for every serious moment. It prides itself for having a wide selection of combat and adventuring styles, from a measly peasant to a brutal war-mage. You'll find loot for days and a fighting system that delivers satisfying crunches with every impact. I picked up six different builds before I settled on one that fit a medium-range capacity with all the abilities to deal with enemies of every calibre. The game punishes as much as it rains down riches upon you, the player. Keep your eyes peeled and your hands on your keyboard or controller, 'cause there's plenty of things to do from killing to talking to throwing out junk to getting blown up by that one annoying trap to crafting MORE gems to discovering an ancient ruin of a city to getting rejected by that one hottie of an elf. Don't ever trust the game to hold your hand; take what you get and give nothing back.  Copious praise aside, there were a few factors which tripped over and otherwise pleasant gameplay experience.  There were bugs galore, from broken quests to broken npcs to missing items to items stuck in your inventory. A few of the colour palettes used were neon-nized to the point of frying the rods and cones in your eyeballs. There was so much story in the form of books that if you were to read all that AND read the npc dialogue AND run around looking for treasure, you'd be in the space age before you finished. The skill slotting menu and subsequent settings metres were broken in that they wouldn't move when dragged. Lastly, THERE WERE ONLY 2 DLCS ;_______________;  I first got this game when I saw Youtuber @SSoHpkc playing it and it looked fun as hell  It really was fun as hell.  BUY IT
2785	1	a	When this was released may 2014 it was junk!,now i love this game! with 60+ updates this game is not like the old one!,I recommend buying it its only 0,79$,Better than COD i can say, a mashup with hallo and jurassic park :)
5793	0	a	this game is still â¥â¥â¥â¥ like ages before
2140	1	a	Really enjoying this game. A lot to do and just good clean fun. Loving the graphics also. When did it become 'graphics have to look like real life?' This game remains gamish. For the lack of a better word. Good stuff indeed.
3866	1	a	this is the best game for such money ! some times big ping but still nice , so i can recomend it if you are bored or wanna kill some time!!!
4468	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking, â¥â¥â¥â¥ programming, could have been great
3851	1	a	It's 99 cents. Buy it you cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4155	1	a	BEST GAME EVER GET IT
498	1	a	Similar to Skyrim (and other Elder Scrolls games), but with an 'over-the-shoulder' fixed camera system that makes for highly intense combat situations. There are lots of options regarding weapons and moves; and the skill tree adds a layer of customization and flexibility to make the gaming experience a bit more personal. One of the reasons for the comparison to Skyrim is because, just like in Skyrim, you may buy your own home(s) to use as a sort of 'home base' on your adventures. My only complaint is that I wish there was a High Resolution Texture Pack (or mod) for this game because the graphics, while decent enough, have been directly ported over from the console(s), as far as I know. It would have been nice to have seen some PC-centric graphics options for this game. Overall, an epic adventure worthy of a fantasy lover's time!
6383	1	a	Great game to play when you love to fight dinos!
3637	1	a	Pretty much Halo with dinosaurs.
4746	0	a	Game is ok if you are borring. This culd be Free to play... not worth spending money for this. 
1591	1	a	Fable meets elder scrolls. Since I really like both I recommend this cartoony rpg.
5865	0	a	This game gave me HARDCORE hemroids.
2828	1	a	This is basically the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with fewer bugs and dinosaurs instead of aliens. Definitely worth the purchase, I spent less than five bucks so I can shoot dinosaurs in the face with three friends. Worth every penny.
3560	1	a	This game, after playing it for 8 hours, has shocked me. The gameplay was way over my expectations, as well as the graphics. The game has many different modes to play like rampage, a ctf like game, survival, and many others, making it an all around fun game to play. I mean â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was $0.99
1344	1	a	Amazing game. Absolutely love it! The art style kinda reminds me of Torch Light 2. Huge world to explore as well.
1378	1	a	Not the best game I've ever played, but then again it's not 100% my cup of tea. It is a good game with a so far somewhat expansive history. IT seems to be quite long considering I have played for about 48 hours and I think I'm nowhere near even the middle. All in all it is a game worth playing if you want to spend days emmersed in a world whose people act more real then I have seen in a game for a long time.
2709	1	a	So bad it's actually f'ing hilarious, totally worth 99 cent, would rent. 11/10
6076	1	a	This game, with the right group of friends, provides an amazing return on enjoyment for the cost. It brings back memories of playing Halo 2 co-op on XBox with it's graphics and gameplay, but also the enjoyment and replayability of L4D2. I can play the same maps over and over with friends and always have a different game.  One day I'll get trampled by a Triceratops, but kill it with one hit point left with my pistol, ala Saving Private Ryan. The next day I'll take to the skies in a helicopter and save my medic-playing friend from the hoard of raptors she had missed while fixing the generator. The day after that, I'll track a nasty pteranodon carefully with my sniper rifle and line up an expert shot, only to be picked up by a completely different one, dropped in the middle of the fight, and quickly eaten by a Spinosaurus.  The game's difficulty is easy to control. If you're looking to relax, pop it on Easy and add some ambient dinos in a Conquest map, and spend two whole campaigns blasting T-Rex's with a tank. Or if you want a challange, throw it on Expert and dive into a King of the Hill map with equally skilled opponents. The maps are wide, beautiful, and varied, and there's plenty of details to catch every time you play. There's something to be said about mowing down rapters in the middle of an arctic wasteland only to have your visor freeze up with ice. There's something to be said about wondering where the hell you're taking damage from in a huge rain storm until you finally clue in and punch that nasty ankle-biter to death.  The game is glitchy at times. Some days it wouldn't let me join or host multiplayer maps, and that issue resolved itself without me figuring out why. Changing game settings while the game is active will crash it entirely. However, I've yet to have a single issue once I've actually gotten into a game and just kept playing. I would heavily recommend this game to any group of friends who are looking for a way to casually stay up until 4 in the morning, accidentally. That fun. That well made.
1885	1	a	Its a real shame that this game franchise and the studio went down the drain, as this was one of the best RPG's I've played in recent years and the only major problem with it is that since the studio that made it went bankrupt there are a fair amount of bugs and gliches (that quicksaving and loading normally fixes) that could have easily been rectified if there was a studio to rectify them (the permanent one are annoying but not game breaking - ie. objects that can't ever be taken out of your backpack taking up space and making finding stuff REALLY ANNOYING and time consuming). Another problem i have is the sheer length of it... I'm all for games that give you play time for your money, but with the DLC, doing a 100% run looks like it will take me around 120+ hours for all main and side quests + finding things like lorestones and around the 90 hour mark it starts to feel like a chore, especially since your probably at the max lvl and can wipe out most things in a few seconds...  But seriously, get the game - it's fun
1217	1	a	Simply amazing! Best single player RPG I've played. Great voice acting. Good graphics. Interesting and fun quests with immersive story telling. The combat is awesome. If you love single player fantasy RPG games you won't be disappointed.
428	1	a	The game 'Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning' is one of the best open world games to play. Along with many locations the player must deal with many different enemies in each location. The mechanism's of fighting is really well done. Every time the strategy must be created to survive every single attack. The possibility to dodge and immediately respond with an attack mixed with the use of spells can bring a powerful combo.  Multiple quests makes the game much more interesting. There is no way for players to get bored because there is no break from fights. Each time, if the player decide, a new quest can be started giving a high chance to gain the higher level. Also bosses' fights leave no time to just sit and admire. The faster player fight, the faster the combo can be created with a powerful surprise at the end.
4982	1	a	I actually expected this game not to be good.. Boy was I wrong. I love this game with a passion. It's better than games I've payed 60 dollars for. It's really fun. &lt;3
881	1	a	this villain is in real need of a hug
3744	1	a	This was such a mess after release xD But 3 years later and for a price of 1$ defenetly worth it. This is the best example to change a hughe mess into something decent and fun. See it as a Dino Survial shooter with vehicles and really nice maps. Grab it up for 0.49-1$ you cant do anything wrong for that price.
2363	0	a	 http://www.gatheryourparty.com/2012/05/04/orion-employee-beatdown/   â¥â¥â¥â¥ this dev
2875	1	a	After the update and switch to UDK this game got AMAZING. My whole class in college is full of people who play it and LOVE it. I cant remember a time in my life I have had this much fun outside the tub. I give it 5.4 stars out of 6.
4246	1	a	Imagine Killing Floor...BUT DINOSAURS AND JETPACKS!!!!!! 10/9  A T-Rex eated me and i deaded.  SO MANY LAUGHS with friends. Must get. Especially when it goes on sale for $0.99. Good dollar spent.
3417	1	a	Really cool type of game I have never seen before. A survival wave game... with dinosaurs.
4065	1	a	This game ruined my life and love of video games 0/10 would play again.
2974	1	a	It's not bad, but it's also not good. If you enjoy a buggy dino slaughter, buy this game 
5320	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
3291	1	a	I had to delete my old review, the game is very different now.  My review: it looks like a lot of fun, some good features, good all-round co-op survival game. Except that it has these floating damage numbers that appear every time you hit something and while you can toggle ALL of the HUD, you can't turn that â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. So i won't be getting into it because that 1 flaw ruins the entire immersive value.   tl;dr if youre not an immersion gamer, but arcade or casual, you'll like it I think so I still recommend the game.
2780	1	a	It's cheap and fun. You don't lose anything if you buy it.
4280	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
3510	1	a	For how inexpensive this game is, and for how many free give-a-ways they've done with this game, you'd think it's absolutely terrible, but this game is actually one of the most fun multi-player games out there. Everything is cooperative, the gameplay is fun, the leveling system is okay, the people who play this aren't absolutely toxic, and the game in general isn't that difficult. Also I'm one of the highest level people in this game so I have major streed cred amongst the players on this game which automatically gives this game a 10/10.  8/8 m8 gr8 I r8.
5094	0	a	Eh this game gets boring after 30 minutes when bullet sponging, repetitive layouts, and terrible connections plague your experience.   &gt;inb4 gr8 b8 m8
5804	0	a	I am sure it is a great game but my computer would not hold it and I have a great computer! So I would not recommend it. Waste of $0.49! May aswell give money to homeless! 2/10
4887	1	a	5/10
3217	1	a	Just spent two hours on Survival, got a consistent feel going. That.Was.The.Most.Amazing.Game.I.Have.Ever.Played. This game is INSANE. The dev team is out of their minds to make it $1. Buy it now, buy 4 packs like I have, sell it when it gets popular for like $5 lower, make a profit, have fun with friends, heck, the experience is yours to make. Enjoy.
4711	0	a	The worst game i ever bought! Bad graphics, not at all fun game mode, ugly looking character, not creative weapons and the boring dragons.
892	0	a	For most intents and purposes, this game feels very much like a Skyrim clone. Regardless, it did keep me entertained for a few weeks. IF you haven't played Skyrim, I would recommend playing that instead. If you need an RPG and are bored of anything Bethesda has out, then buy this to keep yourself entertained until a better game comes along. If you do play this, be sure to make multiple save files, like maybe one an hour. I have encountered several bugs that were very close to game-breaking(the Amalur wiki usually explains workarounds). Personally, I would have preferred another Bethesda(Elder Scrolls, Fallout series), or Bioware(Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights) game, but this game made nice filler until the next Dragon Age gets released.
3614	0	a	There is no learning curve or anything. When I started the game, I just got dropped in a menu, which let me connect to a game. I joined a game with the easy difficulty, and found myself dying very often in the 15 minutes I played. Furthermore, the game feels unnatural, and the graphics are weak for the system requirements. Furthermore, I experienced lots of lag when many dino's spawned.
337	1	a	Absolutely Epic
1303	1	a	One of the best single Rpgs i've ever played. Worth a buy
5071	1	a	Too little time played, but I sure did enjoy what I have played. Don't mind any issues in the slightest, other than the disconnection my net caused. gunplay is fun, killing dnos = fun, price? not an issue in the slightest. 'Tis a must play with friends.
1810	1	a	This game has plenty of quests and tasks to do, you won't get bored with this one.
1386	1	a	About a year ago I was introduced by an old friend what this game was and didnt want to play till I watched him play, well I fell in love with just how epic the it looked and how the beginning is. I believe everyone should try this game out and see how it is for themselves they might be obsessed or just feel like they are playing some of their fav games but combined. Atleast that is how I feel, I love this game and always lose track of time from how many possibilities of a storyline that this game has, it definitely keeps you moving and in a storyline.
1383	1	a	JUST PURE AWESOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 
5474	0	a	I can't even turn the res below 1000x32 and i have a bad pc.
4335	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
6007	1	a	orion is the greatest game I've played this year
3941	0	a	Game's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, but as with every game, screwing around with your friends and finding glitches in this game is fun.
1416	1	a	Great Game, remind's me of Skyrim. Very well made, lot of quest to do with all kinds of different stories. A good open world to explore with hidden tresures and stuffs. The levling system seems good, not the best i've seen but good with some path's you can choose. Overall it's a must play game, addicting and fun. If you love RPG, don't miss this one.
3384	1	a	New to the game? You'll love it. It never truly shines, but there is something delightful in equipping a flamethrower and baking crispy dino-treats. Or zooming around in Halo-esque vehicles causing general mayhem while you're being chased. This could be a very, very, very good game and at how cheap it is and it IS a good game. . . for a time.  Then there are the game modes that don't completely work. Game settings that never stick (I'm always having to change the visual settings even though I've saved them EVERY TIME.) A healing gun that sometimes won't heal (because the game doesn't properly show health bars.) Less than stellar UI. Boring and repetitive dinosaur mobs.   Maybe the reason why I recommend this game is because I can see what this game COULD be. At the core, it's a incredibly fun multiplayer game that is easy to pick up. Sadly, though, the game doesn't feel complete. Most people will put this down after a few hours and never pick it back up. . . which is a shame! Add some more customization, make more maps, fix the other game modes! There is really not a game quite like this out there - similar, yes, but not quite.   TL;DR: Buy this game. It's cheap and good for a few hours with friends. But don't keep it out of mind and let's see what the future can bring.
349	1	a	wanna play a really good game, with lots of side quests? God of War meets Skyrim right here....Trust me when i tell you, you can't go wrong picking this one up. 
430	1	a	Bargin from the sale, pumped only five hours into it so far. But i must say it plays very well. Warrior, Thief , or mage as your classes and they also do multi classing when you get higher in the levels , so you can build your own style with in the game. The story is easy to follow , with a strong back story that you can jump right into and feel apart of from the out set. Well done voice acting, on normal ive not died yet but the first play though i dont mind as you can increase that part in another play though.
1191	1	a	Awesome game, quick pace fight, magic, ninja or just run with a giant axe slahing trough 20 beasts, worth the buy
6283	1	a	Decent cheap game for those on a serious budget.
3911	0	a	This sucks dino balls! Literally!! But it was only 99 cents.
3782	0	a	Graphics are crap, but whatever it costs a buck, the community is terrible, but that's to be expected, and it kinda just plops you into a game with no tutorial, at least no tutorial that I could find, and if you have to search for the tutorial you're not doing your game right.
5872	0	a	Free games are better than this, and that's saying something.
221	1	a	A very good rpg with a nice length story and lots of side quests where you died and was reborn with no fate.This allows you to play your favourite class/es.Also when I ever get one of these quests I sigh.Get quest from NPC&gt;Kill x things/get x things&gt;Complete quest&gt;Sigh.
4943	0	a	One playthrough of 4 minutes and I've already been annoyed by buggy â¥â¥â¥ bots, buggy â¥â¥â¥ enemys and poor excuses for maps. I can handle the severely outdated graphics from a half life 1 engine but god damn this isn't fun.   Halloween Map titled 'Hell' is poorly recycled, with ear â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sound effects and music in the startingbase. The map consisted of poorly reused flaming pumpkins littered everywhere. The only game changing feature being a incredibly unfair and seriously stupid looking pumpkin boss. This boss however made the game really frustrated by downing our poorly organised squad in the matter of seconds. Reminder that this all happened barely 4 minutes into our experience of the game and im already sick of this game.  Bad game 3/10
6181	1	a	I liked it Great buy for 1$
2536	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   ITS LIKE HALO. SURVIVE AND THRIVE. And watch to Dactlys.They seem to be annoying trying to swoop down on u but get a couple of buds and u can survive them.Totally worth to buy it.
1598	1	a	Great game, fun. Can't wait to see more of it.
3752	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
1500	1	a	Enormous world to explore
6367	1	a	7/10 i'm no FPS player, but the coop vs dinosaur is pretty cool! Give it a try :P
2022	1	a	Best PC FPS around
3726	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'
3477	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun!
798	1	a	I'm loving this game, I highly recommend. It's worth the full asking price and if it's on a good sale I wouldn't hesitate to get it at all.
5033	1	a	like halo... but with Dinos 8/8
2927	1	a	i think that this is a high quality game, the anti aliasing is really smooth and you don't see any jagged edges(even on low). Also there is a very good campaign that everybody plays, everyone on my friendslist is playing this because it's the new trend. i feel sorry for this kid whos name is listerine that got bullied because he didn't play it a lot. The movement on this game is really realistic which gives a jurassic park feel if you're on acid. Overall: campaign=:) multiplayer=:) graphics=:) movement=:)
542	1	a	its basically what fable 3 should have been..
1314	1	a	Solid gameplay and expansive lore, like Skyrim with an actual combat system.  Only thing is, the button to run and talk on a controller are the same, so when you go to run away from an npc you just talked to...
3304	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs, with futuristic weapons 8/10
1675	1	a	Worth your money.
4334	1	a	Bought this game for about 50 cents, and although its a little glitchy its just a fantastic game. For the money, its definately worth it.
532	1	a	This is an ok game not amazing but not too bad either. For starters this is made by EA and you need to always be online to play which is a pain.  Story:  The story is ok but very bland and not really interesting lots of stuff to do and places to go but very predictable and I pretty much knew what was going to happen to the end.   Content:  Tons of quests (I MEAN TONS)to do hundreds of hours of content but also many are the same and are not interesting I never really wanted to do any side quests because they were boring and just a pain. Also lots of enemy type but very overused in many areas. I personally had a problem with WOLF's are the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worst and a the biggest pain in the â¥â¥â¥ ever. Lots of cool places and seemed very inspirational and just cool too look at even if the game isn't the most graphical intensive game.  Graphics(How it runs): This game is not the most graphical intensive game ever and it is not hard to run and could be played on almost any PC. I have never crashed or had any game breaking glitches. There are some settings and you can rebind all keys. Plays well on keyboard and mouse.   Combat: Combat is the main point of this game or well the best part. I had fun fighting bosses and finishing them off was fun and satisfying as hell.  Misc: -Inventory is well done and you can put items in the junk section to easily sell if uneeded. -Camera is pretty bad and a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to control. -Fateshifts are very fun and i loved finishing off bosses. -I was a Mage with my first play through and many items need you to add points to a warrior and I found this to be a pain and many good items unusable. -Level up system is well done and you can put points into any class. -Voice acting on everyone and is ok but the main character which seems off to me.   Its an ok game and I plan to play through the game again this time taking my time with it as a Warrior After I am done with this play through.  Final Verdict: 7/10 It's ok
4883	1	a	dino's and swag 10/10 would jurassic
4480	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
3278	1	a	Kill a dinosaur  Kill a dinosaur with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends while fighting other teams Kill many dinosaurs without friends while fighting everyone in free for all Kill humans as dinosaurs Kill many humans as dinosaurs Kill humans while being a dinosaur who realizes his enemy is in the wrong time frame and who actually should be working together to find a way back to a safe dinosaurless environment rather than killing each other to have a bigger base  Careful for FaZe Rex BTW, he'll rek you with a rock like it's an illcam trickshot 8/10 for $1 7/10 if it was $10
2659	1	a	Yeah, I have been playing games for years and years, and back in the day, games were fun, games were simple, and most of all games were FUN, specially with friends,this game while simple in its premise, has a lot of heart is fast paced, and is loads of fun, sure the meta critic is low, but that was its previous incarnation, not this one, this is a great article on the game check it out:   http://www.dsogaming.com/editorial/orion-dino-horde-controversy-let-the-battle-begin/   Besides what have you got to loose for a few dollars? this game gives you more bang for your buck than some AAA titles that I own, and even tho It might not be the most polished or graphically amazing game out there, it delivers, and brings home the pizza!  so dont hesitate, you will have fun, you will be surprised at the sheer madness of running around from killer dinos, and then jumping in a jetbike making a last second save, the gameplay has lots of emergent moments of pure madness, and in that you can see that the folks that made it has a vision, and above all know how to make a fun game.  Play it, you will be surprised! oh and it has a 5 star community you cant go wrong!  
5493	1	a	It looked quote promising but its extremely barebones with ZERO community.   Is this game pre-early access or something?
3750	1	a	Played this during the free weekend. Not a good game by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can grab a few friends it quickly becomes a very silly and entertaining game.
595	1	a	very good fantacy rpg, looks are good too. gear and classes and skill points are all great for customizeing your cherector however you want.
5619	0	a	Like Skyrim with Bad Dinosaurs

5834	0	a	It's not as bad as I thought it would be but that does not make it good... It seems like they copied mechanics from every other game ever but failed miseralbly.
3690	0	a	i wanted to throw up
3858	1	a	Great game to burn an hour or spend all day on when you need to! Has great graphics and concept. Cheap and easy to learn
4161	1	a	it is a video game 10/10
2338	0	a	I'm torn. For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there. That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...  No.  The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun. Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc). Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!  That's not to say the game is /bad/. Are there performance issues? Yes. Is the attention to detail lacking? Absolutely. Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while? You betcha. But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends. That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of 'skating' over terrain), and a linear level experience.  For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app. Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing. I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.
939	1	a	It is a nice action-adventure with many possibilities to level-up your character. The story is quite good, the world big and the levels diverse enough to kepp you going. The outstanding thing about this game however is the fun in experimenting with all the equipment and weapons you find. I enjoyed this game for over 100h and hope you do the same.
1991	1	a	Great game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ EA Games, yes, but â¥â¥â¥â¥
651	1	a	Picked this one up on sale back in June for $10 (game + all DLC). If you're looking for blockbuster material, you won't find it here.  The story is excellent and the lore to back it up equally great. So if story driven stuff is what you're after, you should enjoy this. For me, it was the sole reason I went ahead with playing it to completion.  The main problem is the graphics and gameplay drag it down badly. I've been talking about it in passing as though it was a 2006 release because frankly it doesn't look as nice as Oblivion, then just noticed it has a 2012 date on it. OK.  Gameplay is very very MMO-ey, and as it turns out there's a reason for that. It was supposed to be one at one point but got downscaled into a single player game. So yo have lots and lots of combat action and loot grinding going on.  The two DLCs were actually much better than the main game too, though that could be because I'm partial to content that gives me castles and keeps to build and upgrade :P  Over all, worth it when it's on sale. I'd not pay the full $40 for the whole collection though.
1974	1	a	Anyone looking for an easy action RPG, this is my recommendation. It's very long and there are plenty of side missions to keep you entertained for months. Crafting mechanics is one of the best I have experienced, including plenty of games (Skyrim/Dragon Age/Mass Effect etc). Combat is also great. The reason it's not well known or underrated, due to it's unfortunate release time (just when Skyrim appeared) and the developers declared bankruptcy after this game.
5898	0	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bought it for 1 euro AND NOW ITS FREE â¥â¥â¥â¥ OFF
6392	1	a	Well what can I say? For 0.79p this is the most fun I had for awhile. It works and it is fun. Go get it!!!
1575	1	a	A remarkably fun game. It's only failing is it's timing, in that it came out almost at the same time as Skyrim, making it largely overlooked.
2880	1	a	Do you like Science Fiction? Do you like Dinosaurs? Do you have a Dollar? If you answered yes to these questions, get the game!
6333	1	a	Orion prelude is a scifi egoshooter, situated in a time, where dinosaurs exist.  there are 3 main roles, and each role feature unique abilitys. Dinosaurs attack wave after wave, and they get stronger each wave!  the animation of the landscape is one of the best, if not the best I have seen in games. The ammount of different weapons is not that big, but there is something for everyone's taste! ever wanted to drive with a verry fast vehicle under a huge dinosaur?? I was able to :) It is not a game like cs:go which you can play many hours a day, day after day, but it is definitively a realy good game to play while waiting for a teammember cooking his dinner.  I personaly like to play the character,that is able to get invisible, and shoot with the large machine gun.  The game would be worth 7 bucks, so it is way to cheap im my eyes. enjoy
1452	1	a	For anyone who wants an involved RPG with a million NPCs to talk to, a vast and lush landscape to explore, and PLENTY to do (105 hours so far, and while I've finished all main quests, I still have plenty of side quests and several achievements I could still work on), I fail to see how you could possibly pass this one by. I will admit that, since I do tend to do just about every quest there is and, thus, rise in level rather quickly, I was already nearly at the cap (lv40) by the time I did the last of the main quests beginning with the Siege of Mel Senshir, had already found all Lorestones up to that point, and so there was absolutely nothing challenging from that point forward, even if I ran my toon around in nothing but his underwear and boots: he had simply become too powerful for anything thrown at him. The Balor, for example, I defeated in about a minute (if that). But still, it's an awesome game I would highly recommend to anyone who loves RPGs.
4486	0	a	i honestly don't have a clue what is going on
5709	1	a	I downloaded this game just to feel the joy of uninstalling it. 10/10 would uninstall again. #Uninstallsimulator2015
3339	1	a	I wish I could pay more. It's that good.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It's great for solo play, but the coop aspect is really what makes it shine. The AI isn't top notch but watching a triceratops throw vehicles into the air around your campfire base in a lighting storm in the middle of the night while raptors go crazy down on the ground is just a feeling you can't duplicate. AND THIS GAME ISN'T EVEN ALL ABOUT DINOS! There's a ton of PvP maps and modes as well!  Just buy it and contribute to the dedicated developers who made the 'worst game ever made' into one of the greatest and probably least appreciated games of all time.
529	1	a	9.8/10 Gameplay 8.8/10 Audio and Music 9.5/10 Graphics (ENB Boosted) 10/10 Game Duration 8/10 Story Overall Score : 9.0 'Excellent'  Main Story Completion : about 30 hours Completionists Time : 120+hours  Positives: +Decent Story Telling +Side Quests are Decently constructed. +Loot! +Crafting System is very good. +Lore is everywhere. +Skills and Spells are downright fun. +Combat is very fun and Engauging. +Early to End game equipment all looks really good. +DLC extended and expanded the game EXTREMELY WELL.  Negatives: -Will likely never see a sequel. -NPCs were average at best. -DLC can make crafting too easy. -DLC mats are NOT droppable or deletable. (I used CheatEngin to expand my inventory due to this bug) -Not enough End Game Armor and Weapon types to craft.
4830	1	a	A little buggy , glitchy and of course WTF Game , but for 1â¬ its just amazing with lotta game modes , Dinosaurs and that meh things . BUT! yes , There is BUT! If u have a slow Connection DONT BUY THIS GAME !
2355	1	a	Don't let the low MetaScore scare you away, this game is a blast to play! Ridiculous action, a fun mix of vehicles, weapons and enhancements, and cooperative team-based play. Also, freakin' dinosaurs!  It's well worth 99 cents, for sure, so grab it while it's still on sale if you don't already have it.
6390	1	a	this game costs less than a candy bar. buy it and shoot a triceratops right in the face
3374	1	a	Good FPS game in low price.
6290	0	a	crappy game, boring bad graphix
4406	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
3505	1	a	Still learning the game but had a ton of fun with friends playing it and seeing all the features like the mechas and tanks. It's a pretty simple shoot and follow objectives kind of game that's fun in group. It's silly and has a good base but definitely room for improvement. No worries though since the developers have been working on constant fixes to bring it up standard.
1354	1	a	Still a great game. The combat system is still better than most fantasy RPGs being created today.
1374	1	a	One of my favourite games ever made, NPCs and some side quests are boring but everything else is just good fun.
4589	0	a	Why did the name change and re-download. No. I got this because I thought it was funny. It runs poorly.
6313	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the face, and then t-bag it. Buy this game.
4936	1	a	when I saw the game I fought it was bad, but when I started to play it. it was so awesome. Give it a TRY.
5584	1	a	This is one of the best games I have EVER played. It is a fast paced FPS sort of. Basically all you do is upgrade,upgrade, and kill kill. I haven't seen this kind of game in a while, so it is highly recommened. :D P.S: Anyone willing to gift this game to me? Add me on steam if you can.
4895	1	a	Halo+Borderlands+Dinosaurs = The best 80p I have ever spent EVER!
5838	1	a	I bought the game and now its free $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$44
2263	0	a	Have to say, bugs aside (didn't encounter any so far) this game feels very poorly made. The graphics are awfull (at High). The voices are even worse than graphics. It sound's as if someone made the voices for the game while it the toilet. The previous two games were much better evan though they containd a lot of bugs. I am 'Discples' fan and i have played in all of their relises, have to say, this is the worst one so far. I am very disapointed!!!
4534	0	a	Screaming 'Team mate down!' is more fun than actually playing this game. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ in short. Dino chasing you? â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cloak. Bam. You're invincible. There's nothing fun about it. The slow motion is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the dino ai is atrocious. I'm glad I only installed this for free week. There's also some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 'spooky christmas' map or some â¥â¥â¥â¥. There's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ghosts and robo reindeers with lasers. Only buy it if you won't miss a dollar and have friends that have a sense of humour. Like no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke it's hilarious how bad this game is.
4718	0	a	Doesn't work. Thumb down.  Pc specs:  Asus 8GB ram. Intel core i7.  The game doesn't even work on low settings... 
5914	0	a	I feel gyped. Spent 99 cents on this, now it's free to play?? How dare they!!!!
4020	1	a	worst game I ever played, 12 out of 10
4995	0	a	I played 16 minutes of this game and i hated it. The game is very slow and laggy and yet I feel like even though that it is free, I still feel like I want a refund for wasting those 16 minutes of my life. 0/10 would never play again.
4859	1	a	very nice game still better than battlefield 3 :D
1496	1	a	love this game, very addictive
3728	0	a	You are wasting money if you are going to buy this game for 0,99 cents,believe me it's not worth that money. The game is buggy and they are too many glitches,bad gameplay. Anyway it's â¥â¥â¥â¥!
3320	1	a	This game seems to have a pretty bad reputation but after playing it for a few hours it is genuinely entertaining. It is not, however, a polished product by any means. It has plenty of flaws and at times feels like a conversion mod for another game. Overall it's definitely fun and worth $1 though.
1845	1	a	Amazing graphics and a fast enough pace to keep you engaged but not fast enough to make you feel like it is going to just be a hack and slash.
1132	1	a	If you like talking to a NPC with overreact expression when another is whining in a inappropriate way on the background, then this is the game for you. 100/10 - â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWESOME!
2694	0	a	This is not done well. The animations suck, the dinosaur movements are bad, and the guns don't kick enough. There is no tutorial, so you're thrown in with no idea how to play. I like the concept of a survival game based on dinosaurs, but this is not what I want. Besides, fighting dinosaurs as a Halo reject isn't cool. Couldn't we get something like Jurassic Park stlye characters?
5867	1	a	hate for no reason good game to play with friends 
716	1	a	Great, timeless game. highly reccomend if you like fantasy games
4398	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ i buy this game before now it's free
494	1	a	Hey there! Now right off the start I want to mention that although I only hve 26 hours on steam, I did indeed play this game on console for many more hours , and through multiple play throughs. I believe that if you like RPG games and whatnot this is definitely a game for you. And as for someone that beat the game 3 times I have enjoyed it all 3 times. Unfortunately though the 3rd time was actually a drag beating because I had to force myself to play since Ive seen all of the content. But even though that is the case, this game is definitely worth the money considering that it is a singleplayer game and only $20. So yes, I most definitely reccomend this game for anyone that hasnt played this game before because there is a feeling that I have only gotten out of this game. :)
5316	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
4000	1	a	Got both my friends into a car, pressed shift (Turbo Boost) off a cliff, killed them, got an achievement. 10/10 would drive off cliff again.
3433	1	a	bought the game for the cards....   Then I joined a game and had a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blast... This is what happens when unreal has wild S . E. X with jurassic park lol. the combat seems pretty smooth some bugs here and there but what do you expect from a 1 dollar game. Was shocked that the player base is pretty decent with full lobbys in game.   I rate this game a 7/10 best damn dollar i ever spent in my life
6130	1	a	I would recomend this masterpiece :)
898	0	a	Looks and plays great, but something is lacking. Maybe it's what theologists call 'a soul'. Everytime I play i get bored.   If you need a good exploration based ARPG, play any Piranha Bytes game. Even Risen 2 or Gothic 3.
426	1	a	a single 3rd person view player action adventure rpg set in a MMO-style world.  Nuff' said.
4333	1	a	I was triggered by the unrelistic dinosaur physics simulations. But it does have jetpacks.  5/10 Heavily somewhat kindof recommended.
4137	1	a	You definently get more than you pay for with this game!
4492	0	a	If you like broken games that uses about 100% of your GPU and still looks like crap then this is the game   for you.   It's like Goat Simulator, only that this game is unintentionally bad.
5160	0	a	The game is bad. Probably one of the worst games I've played in many years. 0.5/10.
2473	1	a	I really love how immersive this game is, it's like a mix of jurassic park and halo came together and had a brain baby, this game is very fun and I personally recommend it.
3663	1	a	A lot better than Dino Horde, absolutly love this from a open-world/dinomode/co-op perspective
2331	1	a	Surprisingly fun for its price! Feels good to play this.
5445	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4512	1	a	Ran over a herd of velociraptors. 12/10
4634	0	a	crappy graphics not very fun to play. this game is hard to use and the gameplay trailers have probably 10x the amount of graphics than the actual game on ultra
5024	0	a	Definately no similarity to the Carnivores series of dino hunting games. Might be fun with friends, but when playing solo, it's nearly impossible to survive more than a few waves of dinosaurs. I hope developers create something similar to the old Carnivores games...this definately isn't even close to a real dino hunting game.
825	0	a	It's as if there was a guy who had a rediculous amount of money, loved video games and had unlimited amounts of time to do absolutely nothing with got really really stoned in the midst of an incredible acid trip and thought to himself, 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ I could do that.'  Then he sold everything he owned and tried doing exactly that.  He failed of course, but the manner in which he failed was so spectacular that it serves as a lesson to everyone in the industry: Rely on the foundation of money and you will fail.  Bottom line? GUI sucks my balls, story is meh and I was left in total dismay about almost everything in the game. Terrible. If it were free and I was paid $20 an hour to finish this game I would quit before lunchtime.
3756	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
4924	1	a	A pretty awesome game I bought a year or two back, back then it awesomely sucked. You could walk through walls and the textures looked like super mario 64. Today me and my friend (that bought the game too) were bored, we thought about this but it just seemed TOO bad. Now, after I tried it , I can say this game is amazing. Its incredible to see how they developed it from a crappy dumb game to an actual good FPS . I was skeptical at first, but this game is ******* awesome. 
5747	1	a	This game is a little like passing a kidney stone made out of angels.  Space robots fighting dinosaurs is something i only knew about from the ramblings of my drunk uncle when i was but a child, to be able to experience it first hand, brings forth a feeling of pride, honor and dinosaurs to me.    If you like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥, buy this game.  If you don't like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥ please consider sounding with a fire extinguisher.
698	1	a	one of the best rpgs
2141	1	a	KoA:R is a game that I can play for hours and just get lost in the world. I am an player of RPGs and I bought KoA:R on a whim when I wanted a new game to play. The artwork was not a big seller for me. Indeed, my initial reaction was that it was overly 'cartoony' for my liking. It grew on me and now I'm happy to see this world.  You're allowed a fair bit of character customization (beyond the normal aesthetic options). Skill point progression is, at first, odd since you can choose a destiny card to become a fighter, sorcerer, or finesse (thief) character - or a mixture of them. You can 'respec', for a price, via the Fateweaver NPCs throughout the world. Any character race and skill combination will, at higher levels, be totally overpowered. It's not really possible to completely hose your character, especially since you can tweak your character at the Fateweavers. A fighter is a melee machine, a sorcerer can use elemental spells and 'magicky' stuff to devastating effect, and finesse characters are backstabby/archers of doom.  All characters can, via metagame knowledge, gain max skill points in every skill. If you roleplay the character it might be more enjoyable than simply min/maxing, but either playstyle would work.  Although the world is open and allows you to go just about anywhere, there is a bit of 'go this direction' happening. The world is broken down in to smaller map sections and each of these sections is sort of a self-contained adventure. You quest in the zone and move to the next. Nothing prevents you from running three zones over and, assuming you aren't killed outright, you can 'do stuff'. There is a wierd level cap for each zone that sets the level to whatever your character's level is upon initial entry. That zone is forever capped at that level. This can break your adventure when you come back to the zone again. It's not something I really noticed on my first playthrough.  Like many games that offer choice, your choices are only a passing thought in the grand scheme of the world. Some characters will recognize you for certain accomplishments or choices but overall the world remains largely unaware of your existance (apart from the NPCs involved in the the main questline).  There is a great wiki and other online resources for the game if you like to game with the references open during the journey.  Pros:  * generally open world to explore, with a few quest locked areas (especially the second-half of the game) * nice character progression * easy to get into and play and not overly complicated * hard to 'gimp' yourself * nice array of side quests to guide you on your journey * has a nice casual feel about things for relaxed play (if you enjoy that)  Cons:  * some may be put off by the graphics * the controls took a bit of getting comfortable with * the ability to easily reclass/respec your character may limit you on replay value * has a nice casual feel about things for relaxed play (if you're into hardcore) * choices in-game have only minor effect on the world  Overall rating: 8/10  * Definately worth picking up on sale, or at any price if you're a fan of RPGs * I started playing and lost track of time
2647	1	a	I didn't expect it to be so much fun...but it is! It's like Jurassic Park 5: Shooty-shooty fun-times with Dr. Alan Grant
5608	1	a	This is what Jarissic Park should have been about.
1768	1	a	Having spent 100 hours playing this game, completing everything this game has to offer (including DLC), this game is unbelivable. The amount of details and stories within are fantastic, plus the opportunities to change it up when tired of playing as one style are many.  Now, playing this game on a much harder difficulty will increase a playthrough dramtically, however it is worth it.  Only you can decide your fate when it comes to this game, but it well worth investing in.  BUY IT NOW! GO ON! DO IT!
819	0	a	Played this game on a console a year or so ago and I liked it. Now I can't play more than 5 hours of it and I don't know why.                                                                                              hey dad i thought we only play thouchy touch on wednesdays
5527	0	a	Do it only as a joke to annoy whomever recieved it. Do not buy this for yourself as a great game to play.
1569	1	a	lots of stuff to do, much fun.. though the demo was crappy and totally bugged
4105	1	a	Got this game for $0.99 on sale, I would have paid more. This game defiantly deserves another chance, I just played almost 2 hours of it in a row after buying it up and will defiantly be playing more with my friends. It is one of those games that is just much better with friends, so i highly recommend finding friends to play it with.   This game deserves an 8.5/10, and i heard they are still planning even more updates in the future. I would consider it a game that is in Beta stage, but at least they finally got it out of that horrible Alpha stage.  I can see it turning into something amazing once they have finished.
5380	0	a	Worst game ive played in a while what a waste of my life.
2066	1	a	  Thoughts on game:
4189	1	a	Reminds me of Halo back when Halo was fun and had dinosaurs in it.
5547	0	a	It....really is just poorly made. But it is what it is: a humans vs dinosaurs game, and it honestly is nothing else. Don't buy this expecting a solid experience: it's buggy, clunky, audibly empty, and not very pleasing to look at. It's a pre-early-access title, meaning it had the same principle of early access before early access was a thing on Steam. Don't buy it unless it's on sale for like, 99 cents, which often times happens with this game.  Fun fact: this game had a different title when I first bought it years ago, which really says something about its development.
769	0	a	Graphics: ok Gameplay: to slow for Hack &amp; Slay Camera: extrem poor :( Inventar and Menue: poor Interface: ok Cinematic: to many and poor Spelling: ok  Quality: poor

34	1	a	It's a solitare... poker... type game IN MIDIEVAL WITH MAGIC AND SPELLS AND ALL THAT CRAZY WIZARDY â¥â¥â¥â¥ which I'm horrible at.
5222	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
5454	0	a	paid 15 bucks for this and now its only a dollar. and the servers are quite laggy
4870	1	a	Love this,not the best but it's really god :D
5434	0	a	Im removing this from my account, check steam support to do that. No refund was possible, besides therea a reason its a dollar game. Don't buy this.  Also awful company, they steal other peoples work.
124	1	a	this is a good game , i have played for more than 300 hrs . and its still fun
3104	1	a	10/10
1060	1	a	This Game is actually really really fun, Combat, Weapons and Armor are too dope! Sucks it didnt do so well its a good game!
1266	1	a	I love this game, it's the RPG I have wanted for sooo long. Everything about the story, the characters and the world are just lovely, not to metion the level progetion, stats, and questing all just feel so right if i had a complaint it would be that the lockpicking is boring and not worth putting any points into because there r only 3 possible locations to put your pick to unlock it, item crafting could have been more polished and the items needed to craft could have been more plentiful in the world because when you buy the parts you end up spending more on the parts than the worth of the item crafted, and a person problem i had was with the dispelling where i could not even do an easy one so i pumped most of my points into it so i could just auto dispell. over i love this game
3688	0	a	I know why it's 99 cents. 'MICRO TRANSACTIONS'
1081	1	a	Been a year or so since I played but thought I would do a review seeing it on sale. It's a decent action RPG with a fun combat system. Art direction is really well done; environments and monsters are all fairly original and very pretty. Story (from what I remember) is OK, better than the typical Elder Scrolls offering but not coming close to something like Planescape: Torment. Overall, I would recommend this game as long as you can pick it up on sale, currently less than Â£10 for the collection which is reasonable, for that price it's a good entertainment investment.
6009	1	a	I remember buying this for like $3.00. Now it's not even a buck. I feel ripped off. 10/10
6118	1	a	You won't get a better game for this price. Its not a bad FPS, Now with the workshop it'll have an entire community of people working to create maps, textures, weapons, missions. for Â£2 or $3 for a four pack, you really should buy this and get your buddies in on the insanity. You won't regret it for this price. Its almost criminal not to buy it.
702	1	a	This Game actually got me away from afghanistan for 50(+) hours... Yea while we had downtime i spent away logged roughly 50 hours of steam recorded gametime. (I played alot more offline) While this deployment was in 2014 and it is now 2016 i figured i'd give it a review. Though the game seemed slow at first when i first bought it. It was colorful. It reminded me of the old days of world of warcraft. Well the colors the graphics and thats about it. Set in a diffirent fantasy world this game help revive my love for RPG's. The game had an interesting story line. You actually died? hmm interesting. I was hoping i'd get to stay my zombie self for eternity but eventually you just become more and more human again it seemed. With some awesome powers to change peoples Fate. Overall the game is good but had a lot of bugs and wierd boss fights which were enjoyable. Wish there was faster combat but there wasnt. And how to end this review on a good note... well i guess it was more like a story a story of a fate of a man who got lost in tablet screen playing this game on his downtime in afghanistan. (Yes i played this game on a windows surface pro.) 
2548	1	a	One of the best games I have out of my almost 100 game steam library! The Metacritic is wrong. Other than connection problems, the game has no problems. It gets better with time. The Devs really deserve for this game to be played. GET THIS GAME ALREADY!
6144	1	a	it's a fun game with cool weapons and etc
3696	1	a	This game is like halo and dinosaurs combined into one! I would reccomend it to anyone even if your new to the game. 
3618	1	a	i havent played it but from markipliers video on it i would have found it pretty enjoyable. my pc was too much crap to run it.
695	1	a	***** Highly recommended. Spent a riduculous amount of time in this game (think Fallout)
2373	1	a	It isn't great but you'll get 10-20 hours out of it for next to no money (less than Â£1 is a fair price for what you get).  Make sure to bring a few friends and try and save for the flying tank thing.
5034	0	a	it doesn't seem to be running properly. i'm not sure if that's because of my system or an internet related problem, but its too frustrating to hold my attention.
247	1	a	It is a good game with its gameplay, story, and such; it just gets a bit boring over time.
5131	1	a	Drove off a cliff with a bunch of people       10/10 would drive off a cliff again
387	1	a	An amazingly immersive bit of storytelling that tied together with an excellent, fluid combat system and an intuitive skill tree with tangible gameplay effects where nothing feels supurfluous. Whole-heartedly recommend. Make sure you pick up the DLC as they're built more like expansion packs than most modern DLC.
6245	0	a	This game may look fun however it is not. My friends and I played it and it was very boring and the graphics were really bad. Please don't even spend one dollar on this game its not worth it.
1553	1	a	The biggest plus of this game is the combat. Smooth, fast paced combat in a fantasy RPG is rare. Though I was a bit let down by the skilltree abilities. Another great feature are the Chakram weapons, a weapon type missed in most other RPGs.  The downside is the lack of an inspiring world and story. It's all very colorful but feels very generic. Because of this, quests soon felt like chores and I skipped most of the dialogue.
5967	1	a	what did you expect when you paid a dollar for a game. that being said its a good way to kill time with freinds. 10/10
139	1	a	I got this game from my girlfriend because she wanted me to try it out, I was complaining about games not meeting my standards/expectations and that I got bored of them so quickly. All I can say is that it was the right choice from her, gifting me this awesome game!  Graphics might look 'outdated' compared to many new games coming, but it has the charm that so many games lack. I continue to hop into it and not even to follow the story line - I enjoy all the things you can do, been doing so many side quests that I was in a whole completely different place than where my main story line played.  I have an emotional connection with the game, which almost no game has been able to give me besides 'Jade Empire'. KoA has the same combat style as Jade Empire, really fastpaced the only difference being KoA is way more brutal. I love the sneak take downs, always different and always very rogue-like. I remember sneaking up on this enemy and actually patiently waiting for him to turn around for 5ish minutes, sneaked up right behind him and executed a sneak attack. My character covered the mouth of the enemy, stabbed him three times in the chest while pulling him back downwards, layed him softly down on the ground while crouching, slit his throat and then looked around to observe the surroundings - if her attack was noticed by the other mobs in the area.   This game has so high immersion that I completely forget to check the time, it isn't the easiest when you are trying to fix your sleeping pattern, haha!    Pros:   - Immersive gameplay - Story rich, the story grabs a hold of you from the start and it has a high sense of importance (we all know those games trying to force you to do stuff for the 'story' and you hate it because it is so tedious and you are not interested in it, because poorly written/executed/makes no sense/makes little sense or it is just plain stupid and boring, this game has no such thing as any of the above, the story is rich and interesting) - Your character looks badass! - Fastpaced combat, it gives satisfaction with killing blows, sneak attacks, random badassery with any other weapons than daggers for example. - Brutal combat! - Awesome cutscenes, I have watched every single one! - Good/evil choice settings (gotta love that!) - Big world - not huge, not tiny! - Unique characters/enemies, even talking to random NPCs is satisfying!     Cons:    - No romance almost (every RPG needs a romance option, even if you will not play it). There are like three minor options for romance and it feels like the concept is very overlooked - Spiders (not as much as a con as it is a personal problem). Imagine running freely towards any destination, then suddenly you hear a loud rumbling, your camera spans out and out comes a huge spider! While the minor cinematic goes on, spiders have surrounded you... it isn't a dealbreaker, the loud noise makes me jump everytime.   That was a small list for cons, I know!
791	1	a	Simply AMAZING!
2712	0	a	Probably the worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing, seriously not even worth 0.99 cents.
1463	1	a	This is a superb single player RPG. Excellent storyline and brilliantly done visuals combine that with a very nice skill and combat system. Runs very well even on fairly low spec PC's.
5624	0	a	Firstly, all respect to the developers.  This is a game that started out bad. Like, really bad. One of those bad games you remember, yeah, you know the ones.  It's only that this time around the developers said 'Hey, we made the game, let's like, fix it and stuff.' Then they did. Then they added billions of loads worth of content. So much so they renamed the game about 2 (or 3) times based on how much they updated.  There are tons of maps, modes, weapons, and just variety in general that should make this game a jurassic clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of nonsensical fun. Why 'should' ? Because beyond all of what they have added, all of what they have continued to put into the game, I canno't for the life of me enjoy it.  Why? Well it's probably gonna seem stupid, but I personally think it makes a big difference.  Every single weapon is simply not enjoyable to use and makes the game feel boring and bleak.  Everything feels like a pop gun with the volume put to 2. I swear to god that sometimes the guns make literally no noise at all. They designed these huge awesome looking assortments of weapons, but they all feel so static and weak it's a joke, and aside from that there is very little feeling of actual impact when shooting anything.  This is seriously a big problem that hinders the entire game unenjoyable, or at least for me. I mean come on, this is supposed to be a giant battle for survival against huge, glorious dinosaurs, but there is nothing-- NOTHING about doing anything in this game that's at all fun to do.  This should be so easy to fix, and I hope to christ they make an update to the game that completly reworks weapon animations, sounds, and effects, because as of now it's loads more satisfying to fling rubber bands at a picture of Jeff Goldblum.  Also the occasional heavy lag and frame drops don't exactly help out.   Is the game worth a doller? Well to you and some others it might be, but there is nothing here that can bring me back unless they just update the guns to make them feel like actual, powerful guns.
4514	1	a	This is the most underrated game on steam.
3224	1	a	whether you're flying a wangus or shooting a t-rex in the â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is hella fun with friends
2661	0	a	Don't trust the minimum system specs listed. My system meets all of them and even with all settings dropped to lowest, I only get around 3 FPS, making the game completely unplayable. This comes despite marginal polygon counts and no exceptionally heavy eye candy that I could see. There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game. Audio stuttering on SFX is one thing, but this was BGM stuttering, completely ruining immersion. Needs heavy work before I'd call it a success of any sort.
2633	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that had such a low price that I had no idea if it was actually going to be a quality product. Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.  ORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.  The game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.  The sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things.   In total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time. Somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10.
4537	0	a	This game would be amazing if I could actually start it up. All my friends love the game, they bought it for me... I can't even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play it. Fix your game please. I did everything this is the 5th hour I've tried to get this thing working. Please fix it. Steam support doesnt help me at all, someone please help me.
4331	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
5944	0	a	It's on sale for .49 cents. That should tell you all you need to know without someone explaining it to you.
4855	1	a	IT LAGS LIKE CRAZY BUT THE CONCEPT IS REALY COOL SO PLAY THE GAME AND SUPPORT THE DEVS
583	1	a	This game offers interesting combat, customization both in terms of equipment and skills, with basic traits and abilities split and a world which is fun to explore with its multitude of colors. The game production values shine with some excellent voice acting, amazing environments and art, a rich story and lore, and a fitting soundtrack. The sheer magnitude of content in-game is astonishing, and worthy of praise. The world is huge, there are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The fast travel system is handy and the world map very helpful and easy to navigate. There are so many things the game does right like the faction storylines, item management, combat, great looking world to explore, dungeon sizes, two world style re-skilling, etc. It does feel like they took the best western fantasy rpg ideas and put them together in one. There's also a day-night cycle that impacts NPC/enemy activity as well as adding some pretty environmental effects to the lush environments. You can buy houses to store your junk, restore your health, and allow makeover options, and these residences can be upgraded in a variety of ways. Theirs a lot of crafting in the game, whether it be blacksmithing, sagecrafting, or alchemy with sagecrafting being the most unique and interesting. The combat is well suited for this type of game and is ever changing, with every level and power you gain, and it allows you to learn different moves with each particular weapon, allowing you to essentially create your own combos when you mix in spells as well. The hybrid skill trees allow you to combine the classic mage/warrior/rogue combat styles with one another to your liking. The classes are well executed and each allows a different gameplay. This is one of the strengths of Reckoning: the experience is flawlessly fluent whatever you want to do as the controls remain simple yet effective. This is an excellent game for those who enjoy a well done story, and pretty good combat.
1543	1	a	A classic RPG single player game. Lots of fun with quests that keep getting larger as you do each part.
2656	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
6403	0	a	Possibly worse than 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' 10/10 would play games worse than WarZ again
1741	1	a	A really fun timesink. I'm 70+ hours in and I've barely scratched the surface. Fun game.
3895	1	a	  Karate chopped a T-Rex to death, roleplayed as Daisy Buchanan by running over a crowd of raptors, and then played as a dinosaur suicide bomber. 10/10
6049	1	a	The game is fun and it pays itself with trading cards. 10/10 would sell cards again.
1458	1	a	Fun game. Would recommend, but it has its flaws.  It's tempting to compare it to Skyrim, and I've seen many reviews do so. There's a big open world to explore, lots of locations, NPCs to talk to, fast travel, the ability to smack around some townsfolk if you're into that, etc. But Skyrim is a game about freedom -- you can go anywhere, do what you like, and there will be level-apropriate challenges waiting for you. Meanwhile, Kingdoms of Amalur is a very linear game. You go to area 1, complete the quests for the NPCs with exclamation marks above their head, and by the time you're done, you have outlevelled the random mooks in the area and you should move on to area 2. Lather, rinse, repeat. The main story quests take you through each area in succession, helping to reinforce the 'I should be in this specific area right now, and nowhere else' feeling. You are free to go anywhere else, but there's never any real reason to do so.  About halfway through the game, it starts feeling extremely samey, and it feels like you're just going through the motions. By the time you reach the last area, it starts to feel like the game should have ended a couple of hours ago. There's a lot of running around involved in the game, with some stretches of the map having no enemies for 2 or 3 minutes. This, combined with the fast paced combat, can make the non-combat part of the game feel very tedious.  The combat is fun and extremely well done. Your hits have a lot of weight to them, and allow for a lot of free-form comboing. It is fast paced, and visceral, and you feel like a powerful character.  The story kind of fell flat for me. I never really got into the game all that much, and didn't care about any of the characters. One thing that really bothered me is how the story is about how you are an agent free from fate, and how you can change the fate of anyone you come into contact with. This was extremely contrasted with the actual game story, which was incredibly linear and didn't give you any options, and saw you slave to the game's story. In different hands, I'm sure this could have been raised as a point of discussion, and could have been woven into the story -- If you are free from fate, was that just part of a different fate? However, here it just felt like bad writing, and like no one stopped to think about it.
978	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. I can't rate it high enough.
3328	1	a	Thsi gaem is fun if your a meme HA PRANKED!!! 4 heil hitlers outta 5 heil hitlers it was one helluva schnitzel
3592	1	a	I was hiding on top of a cliff I accessed with my jetpack wielding a rapid firing grenade launcher since everyone knows dinosaurs only hurt when they bite. T-rex proceeds to pick up rock with his mouth, throw it, and instakill me.  10/10 would Michael Bay Jurassic Park again
2542	1	a	The Metascore given by critics to this game is very misleading as this game deserves somewhere between 80-90 score. Good gameplay - almost the same if you combine Halo and Jurassic Park together. Makes you nervous everytime you queue solo for the game. Best to play it in multiplayer. Slight bugs on the dinosaurs but its a great game to have.
4395	0	a	This game was completely broken at release months later it was just as bad.. hoorible rip off steam should hide thier face in shame for even selling it and not refunding peoples money
2171	1	a	Beautiful game that can show you how free will can work (to a point) has a in-depth story that can surprise you at parts.
362	1	a	Excellent game and mechanics. Graphics are very nice.
1663	0	a	Starts off strong but quickly loses its allure. The combat is fun and unique at first, but the inability to switch weapons mid-combo removes absolutely any level of depth. The combat wants to be Devil May Cry, but it's like they forgot to finish programming the combat half-way through.   The characters are entirely unlikeable, and the game tries to force-feed you lore through them at any moment that it possibly can. The story's forgettable, especially when you stop and think, 'Why am I helping these people again? I don't like them.'  The world is technically 'open', but the leveled mobs may as well make it entirely linear on that front. As well, there's really no point in the world being open, since past the vistas that they front-load into every new area, the world feels completely dead and drab.   The game also lacks a deal good deal of polish in certain areas. As an example, if you're using a ranged weapon and fighting an enemy who is uphill from you, you will attack the ground in front of you instead of attacking towards the enemy that you're targeting. Often, when this happens, your attacks will fly through the ground and clip out of bounds until the animation finishes.   Ultimately, Kingdoms of Amalur, falls short everywhere that it had potential to shine. If you can get it cheap(and I mean really cheap) and you're willing to overlook a good deal of flaws, it may be worth your time.
5023	0	a	should be a free game
560	1	a	Alright
5889	0	a	I'd rather watch paint dry than play this
2642	0	a	I was not aware this game had stolen assets before purchasing. For 50 cents, it's a great game to mindlessly kill some time on, but after hearing about the theft, I regret supporting this developer with my purchase.  
4627	1	a	Very good game overall. It has great graphics and a huge variety of game modes and playable characters. You can get levels, encouraging you to get higher and higher levels to get better. I think personally the music is great too. I'd have to say a 10/10.
508	1	a	The combination of rich lore inspired by Celtic and Gaelic mythology and the varied and engaging combat, I loved my experience in this game. I like the idea behind MMORPG games, but the execution falls short for me and the social component is more of a liability than an asset. Kingdoms of Amalur delivers on the promise of the MMO setting, and the ability to rebuild/respec your character from scratch was a great way to keep the experience fresh and engaging. While it doesn't warrant multiple playthroughs, once through gave me dozens of hours of fun and exploration. I just wish the player races had greater consequences.
3567	1	a	Awesome game! one of the best in this genre!! just try it. 10/10
588	1	a	I adore this game. Ive been playing RPG's for years. I think aiming for 5 million sales for a first game is a little overreaching , even if its good, their aim should of been a million or so and then make then ext one even bigger. Elder Scrolls didnt get hugely successful in its first games. The expectations were just to high for this for a first game of an unknown franchise.  I enjoy the fun of the combat, i enoy the story archs, the wonderful IRISH flavour of the universe. The Winter and Summer Fae are a fantastic concept and all the villages and towns and cities in the game are beautifully realized, that still leave a little to the imagination.  If you are seeking a fun , action rpg, that has a wonderful in-depth fictional Irish fairy tale type story, to sink your teeth into , this is great.
3589	1	a	Do you love COD zombies? Do you love to kill mobs of Dinosaurs? Do u love guns?  Then this game is great and very fun for you and friends.  Worth the price! Enjoy!
2139	1	a	If you're looking for a wonderful story set in a fantasy RPG world, then you're out of luck. On the other hand, If incredible combat is what you desire then this game is definately for you.  Either way, it's a nice game.
5012	1	a	halo x jurassic park= best game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ever! make sure u got some friends to play with or skype and have a great time 
2556	1	a	I'm bad at writing reviews, but this game deserves another thumbs up, so here you go. Easily worth 10 to 15 bucks. Pure madness they are selling it this cheap.  Also, these devs deserve way more attention and praise. They kept working on their game, kept releasing free patches and updates for years. In a world where abandoned Early Access games and bug-ridden triple A titles are daily routine, these devs are showing exceptional dedication both towards their game and their customers.
2340	1	a	Really fun and fast-paced co-op game!  +focus on teamwork +decent graphics +plenty of game modes -sometimes lags when a lot of dinosaurs are in the area
1173	1	a	One of the most satisfying combat systems I've seen in a long time, but I can't imagine playing it without a controller.
505	1	a	It's like a linear version of Elder Scrolls if you've ever played one of them. Fully voiced, lots of lore, decent story, quests occasionally have options to alter the outcome, graphics are crisp, animations are mostly clean, there's detail in level design, lootz, crafting (optional) and a 'double layered' level up system (able to tech into multiple trees and choose one passive perk). In a nutshell it's a dungeon crawler in 3rd person instead of top-down.  Perhaps my favorite part about Amalur aside from above is the feeling of not being tethered to the game in order to notice progression. I can play for just 15 minutes and actually accomplish something.  On a minor negative note, Amalur does not give the full freedom other games allow. The player can not jump and the player can not decide to step off a cliff on whim; there are set locations to allow dropping into water or down a cliff-side. Fortunately these limitations do not or hinder gameplay.  Combat is straight forward and fairly rewarding. Left click to continue swinging, instill a pause or hold the click to start a special attack. The player can also mix in magic or swap weapons on the fly to make some interesting combos and setups. Though combat may seem too basic the AI does its job in finding those holes in defenses and can manage to really take a chunk of health. While left clicking is easy, positioning amongst groups of enemies is where the player needs to maintain control even though the AI isn't the smartest.  I would recommend Amalur to anybody who likes leveling up and combining classes. The game actually feels like a dungeon crawler but from a behind the shoulder perspective.  I would also highly recommend downloading the YSA mod which balances the game to make Hard mode actually hard and Normal not such an cakewalk.  Additional Thought: It would be nice if Amalur was coop multiplayer though it does a great job as a singleplayer game. If War in the North mixed with Amalur...
5469	0	a	i got it for free and its saying i need to buy it even if you got it free
4758	1	a	Such a fun addicting game worth 100x the price I bought it. Deserves GOTY. What. A. Game.
209	1	a	A very good action RPG. No stunning story included or great dialogues, but the combat system is really fun.
3849	1	a	Halo, with dinosaurs.
1572	1	a	On a scale from 1-10 I enjoy this game.
1444	1	a	far better than most sandbox style games. tons of fun.
2393	1	a	ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.  This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.  To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.  Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.  Pros and Cons.  Pros:  *The game is fairly cheap. *The community is not dead for now. *The developers may fix all the issues at some point. *The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts. *The graphics are quite nice for the price *You get a cute little shooter for 99 cents  Cons: *Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever. *The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows. *The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen *The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars. *The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater. *Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard. *combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.   I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following.   My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming
129	1	a	Kingdoms Of Amalur:Reckoning Is An Fantasy RPG Game Worth Spending Time On..The Combat System is Great..Also it Has Massive Maps and Locations...Unlike Skyrim you Can Go to Many Places that you never Saw Before...The Most immersive part is when you Engage in Great Battles.. *Spoiler*: such as in Mel Senshir if you keep progressing Main Misisons...but what's Bad About (KOA) (My Opinion): is the Atmosphere of the game...and the Camera...it Sticks to you as if you triggered Third Person View.other than that it's an cool Game Worth playing and Paying For..i Recommend it for every RPG Fan
227	1	a	What an amazing game! It's so weird it's not mentioned often when talking about RPGs. This game should be in top 3 atleast!  The game is huge, there's tons and tons and tons of things to do. The storylines are fun and easy to follow (even for me, who usually doesn't care about stories too much). The scenery is simply stunning, there's so many different areas and regions and each with a different style. The combat is fantastic, so many different paths to follow and builds to make. I'm sure there's something out there for all of you.  The only downside is that it's abit easy but then again, I'm not a fan of games that get so hard that makes me want to throw my pc out the window.  Would I recommend this? Yes, absolutely. 10/10
4886	1	a	super fun game but it needs work it has stability issues with random crashes and im geting 40 45 FPS but wan it works super fun i hope they add more guns maps and dinos
5309	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
5819	0	a	Devs blatantly stole models from Activision.  Activision isnt my favorite. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Call of Duty.  Content stealing is wrong.  Pretending to be the victim and misleading people when the person you stole from calls you out is even worse.  I'll never buy from this company again, they're only a small step above those plagiarism riddled mobile games. 
4790	1	a	$1. $1 $1 $1. ...... it's still better than advanced warfare 
4992	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. The first thing you see in the game is the main menu. Everything normal right? Well it isn't. As soon as I launched it and saw the main menu I witnessed my graphics card's temperature ramp up from 40Âº to 75ÂºCelsius. I changed my graphics settings to the minimum possible and I saw no difference. My framerate was still locked to 60 and my GPU was still running hot.  That's just one issue: Optimization. Let's get to the next part: Gameplay I haven't tested any gamemodes other than survival so I can't really vote on this one but I got bored almost immediately, using every class and playing in different ways. The weapon system is lacking and sure needs work.  Just don't buy this. Even for 70 cents it's not playable. Don't kill your gpu for a 70cents game.
4332	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
1863	1	a	This game is really good! Highly recommend it. 10/10. Love the combat and the story line.
14	1	a	It's like playing poker and classic RPG at the same time. Challenging gameplay and good spells to help you through dozens of quests. Strong allies to unlock with fantastic artwork will make you want to summon them again and again. 
737	1	a	Great Story, Great gameplay! Best combat in a RPG I've Ever Experinced!  (Pitty the company went under, they had an amazingly looking MMO comming out)  If... you can get it to run for longer than 30 mins with out a Hardlock! (Just to clarify, i was having GfX issues)   Really Really fun game! 9.5/10!
99	1	a	Oh boy, this game.  Well, it's fun, the combat is very fast paced and fun, you can do a lot of moves with you skills and magic and abilities, you can combine them or charge them for a more powerful attack.   This game is HUGE, the map is VERY HUGE, there is a lot of dungeons and there is like 300 or 400 side quests to be done, but it is very unlikely that you will want to do every single one, you see, some of them, some of the quests are like the generic MMO quests (grab question with NPC &gt; kill x things &gt; collect x things &gt; go back to NPC), but there is a lot of side quests very well done and with a nice story.   Play this game on HARD, because even on HARD it will be kinda easy, seriously, you will only face a challenge if you decide to fight more than 6 enemies (of your LVL - the ones with the name in YELLOW) at once or an enemy with an ORANGE or RED name.  There is a lot of things to say about this game, but let me give you some tips that won't ruin your fun.  If you want to kill enemies with one or two hits, pick BLACKSMITH and JEWELCRAFTING skill to level up, you will be able to craft your own gear, but you can make some GODLY gear, like, you can gain +60% DMG with FIRE DMG and LIFE LEECH and a insane amount of ARMOR, you will never die, really, it will look like GOD MODE. If you wanna some challenge in the fights and if you wanna use the nice sets and unique gear that you will find in the game (the uniques and set items are way more nice than the crafted ones, they are very stylish and have some nice stats and their own lore/description, but they don't have stats so powerful like the crafted gear), don't level up BLACKSMITHING, go for JEWELCRAFTING (to sell the jewels) and MERCANTILE so you can make a lot of money (i end up with 12 millions GOLD and wasn't even in the end of the game, i had like 25 hours or more till the final boss).  Try to acquire the DLCs, Ded Kel and Teeth of Naros, they are very nice and the Ded Kel can grant you some nice things, like, you can acquire the best items for crafting (the FLAWLESS components, they grant insane stats for crafted gear) and a lot of uniques and set items (set gear) for FREE (the components are not free, but the gear that one NPC search for you is free), a NPC will get them for you.  Choose well the color of the eye of your character, you won't be able to change this after, only hair and jewels and tattoos once you gain your own house (there is like 3 or 4 houses only for your character in the game).  Try to do all the faction quests, they give you nice rewards and you end up meeting new NPCs and enjoying the stories.  Try to level up the DETECT HIDDEN skill, it will help you a lot. Don't bother, seriously, don't bother with LOCKPICKING and PERSUASION (PERSUASION can be nice if you really want some more dialogues, but it is not necessary), LOCKPICKING is useless, really, you will find some hard chests to lockpick, but after 3 or 4 lockpicks (and you will find and will be able to afford a lot of those lockpicks) you will end up opening the chests without problem. Try to level up DISPELLING, it will help you on magic chests and will prevent you for being cursed (curses can't be removed without a HEALER, and you will be forced to travel to a city or village to lift the curse, otherwise you can continue exploring, but some curses can make your character very vulnerable, very weak).  Try to read all the books you find, really, they can give you a nice understanding of the lore and they have some very interesting information, also, some of them are hilarious.  ***If you want more challenge, you can try to use the YSA mod, it is a mod to be used with the Cheat Engine program, it changes the game to be way more challenging, i've never used but a lot of people said that it is very well done and you can choose what to use (like, you can disable the way your character receives damage [with the mod your character receives 2x or 3x more damage from the enemies] or the XP gain [experience is reduced by default with the mod]). ***   There is lot of more i would like to say, but i don't remember everything now. I hope this review help you.  Thanks for reading.
2960	1	a	I got $.99 and I spent it on this game!
4630	1	a	It will change your life for ever.
6153	1	a	  This game is not important for the gaming world ^^    The graphic is ok...   The fun that you have in the game is 65% :D   
1559	1	a	Really awesome and under appreciated game, since it was released around the same time as Skyrim it didnt sell as much as it could have.  The combat is one of the best I've ever played and the lore is very immersive.  It's definately worth it's value and I highly recommend it.
4721	0	a	Nearly reached 1hr of gameplay i played 59mins in fact it was so awersome that i decided to delete it right away By the way devs i enjoyed best uninstall simulator evur gg iluminati out of 10
325	1	a	I purchased Kingdoms of Amalur on Steam as a complete package for $11.99 which included all of the DLC and finished the main story in 53 hours. As with most games I play, I finished all the side quests I came across.   Graphics â Great  I loved the graphics in KOA. There is a strong a vivid use of color and the world is filled with detail. Animations are fluid and my PC never once stuttered the frame rate from a constant 60 fps. The environments could have used a little more variety as by endgame you will grow tired of the same recycled assets.   Music â Fair  The music in KOA is well orchestrated but the songs lack depth and variety. More songs would have been a plus as a large amount of time is spent in each area before going to the next and this can have you listening to the same loop for many hours at a time.   Cinematics â Good  Picture the same dialogue cutscenes as KOTOR or Mass Effect. The dialogue itself is very well written but unlike the Mass Effect series, you may not find yourself delving into the various conversation options. The characters and their backgrounds just werenât interesting enough for me. The choices during conversations also lacked the Mass Effect style feeling of autonomy. You could make good or evil choices but it never mattered much. âQuick Timeâ events in combat are a cool sight to see.   Story â Good  As RPGs go, this story is original and kept me interested enough to finish the game to see what happens. I did not grow attached to any of the side characters or find them interesting. This game is really all about you. The main villain(s) were menacing but far from the kind of evil we love to hate.   Control â Great  I had no issues with the controls. They are very simple and easy to learn. The UI was easy enough to use. The awkward camera may startle you at first but you quickly get used to it.   Gameplay â Fair  I played as a melee class so your experience may vary. Combat in the beginning is fun but quickly grows stale. All I really had to do was click mouse 1 until everything died. Even on the hard setting, combat becomes too easy as you gain better weapons and armor. You completely overpower everything and I did not die once the entire game. I also never needed any of the consumable items with the exception of a very rare healing potion.   Content â Good  There is plenty to do here and the gameâs zones adjust to your level so you are free to do as little or as much as you want to for side quests. The loot you find is very rewarding in the beginning of the game but by the middle, I was scrapping everything I found for parts. I had over five million gold with nothing to spend it on.   Value â Great  For $12 I had 53 hours of fun. The game is huge and kept me playing until I finished. I did not feel inclined to play through the DLC quest lines. In my opinion, they werenât worth it.   Recommended â Yes  I recommend this game for the price I paid. In my opinion, this game is worth $20 or less. It is currently $19.99 on Steam without the DLC.
1020	1	a	This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Highly underrated. It is as good as Skyrim in its own way. I love the combat system and the story is engaging.
5799	0	a	why
4064	1	a	As of right now, the game isn't highly polished. Nut it works, and that's what matters. Fun game, low price.
172	1	a	Why have I waited so long to recommend this game? Why? I know why, because I thought, 'When I get to the end of the game, I'll have a true appreciation of it, thereby writing something from my extensive knowledge.' Yeah, sure. At level eighteen and about sixty some odd hours in, I'm no where close to finishing. So onto my actual review:  This game is actually really good and I feel it's been overlooked. I honestly feel it is a diamond in the rough. It -is- similar to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but let me tell you something fascinating. I bought ES:Skyrim before I bought KOAR (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) and when I bought it and played it, I did -not- care for it. I was lambasted, cast out and disowned but there it is. I didn't like it. Now flash forward to spending time in Reckoning, I want to go back and play Skyrim. That's how much enjoyment I've gotten from this game. It takes me back to a place when I started playing World of Warcraft. There were these amazing characters, this fascinating storyline, beautiful artwork. This, that and the other. Eventually I fell out of love with World of Warcraft, but this game takes me back to that feeling of rolling my first character.   The combat is very user friendly. I would akin it to hack and slash, but I feel that simplifies it far too much. You have abilities, the way you unravel the fate of a foe is cinematic and enjoyable, somehow savagely satisfying. The talent trees are easy enough to navigate. Much in the spirit of Skyrim, you can choose what you want to be and whether you want to go, might, finesse or mage, or all three or two or...you get where I'm going.  The skills are pretty neat, you have options on alchemy, a sort of jewelcrafting, blacksmithing, lockpicking, dispelling...and on and on. I wouldn't recommend lockpicking as the lockpicks are cheap, cheap and even the 'hard' chests are done simply enough.  The quests are pretty fascinating, especially the main quests. There are some side quests that will have you fetch and step bear butts but its to be expected with any sort of RPG, in my opinion. Character creation is neat, not overly detailed but enough where you get your input in. If you're expecting to spend 3 hours lost in faces, noses, ears and hair style, you will be let down. This game is not linear. You can put off the main quest indefinitely if you so wish, there are factions to join and quest for, increasing your reputations with them. There are choices to be made to decide the moral ambitions of your character, there are persuasions to attempt, assassinations to be had and endless monsters to slay until your heart is bursting with contentment.  TL;DR? Does it revolutionize the RPG genre with it's intuitive and mind-blowing format? Not so much. Does it bring out some of the -best- of what we love in RPG's? I firmly say, yes. Is it worth purchasing? Absolutely. I think if you're a fan of RPG's you will find hours and hours worth of enjoyment, plus replayablitiy.   8/10
5059	1	a	Despite the metacritic's score, I found myself coming back to this game over and over. While I still use the same strategy and class, it hasn't stopped the game from being fun yet. My only complain at this point is the difficulty in hitting flying dinousaurs, as they sometimes get stuck in strange places.  Apart from that, it's a really fun game to play with friends, or with others online.
435	1	a	MMORPG in solo. Great graphic, great DLC. Lots of place to discover, and fun skill system.
276	1	a	this is the best game once you get the hage of it and i think its bettter then Elder schrols
3185	1	a	please make it for free because it is a very awesome game plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
6102	1	a	played one game, got picked up by a birdosaur 10/10
3822	1	a	Love this game, basically The most fun i have had playing a firstperson shooter against players that arent the same as you, 'dino VS Human' you really need to get this game :)
4775	1	a	Love it, but dunno why cause i'm bad at â¥â¥â¥â¥ like this.
4725	1	a	ORION: Prelude is the best buck I've ever spent on Steam. That single dollar got me a game that's half Turok half Killing Floor with awesome weapons, fun perks, expansive maps, nearly ten different game modes, and offline bots. Admittedly there are still some glitches to mend and polish to apply, but for the dirt cheap price of the game, you get what you paid for and more! So what are you waiting for?  Purchase the game Download the game Launch the game Open the door Get on the floor Everybody kill the dinosaur
3158	1	a	Your character spouts nonsense about pizza while your friend shoots dinos while in a giant mech. Out of room in the truck? Just run into your friend and take him along with you.  10/10 Bring me some pizza
2566	1	a	Like killing Dinousaurs? Want a first person shooter? Do you want to drive tanks, fly helicopters and control mechas? Or what if you want to be the Dinousaur and kill the other players? Now imagine you can do all this in one game. Welcome to ORION: Prelude :P
3501	1	a	Fists are more effective than guns on dinosaurs, who knew? 11/10
2929	1	a	like halo with more dinosaurs
615	1	a	This game is incredible. I have over 80 logged hours playing this and more when I was offline. I don't often replay games but this is one that I do all the time. It was hard to stop playing it until I beat it. But with so many achievements there is always something to do even when you complete the main quest.
1659	1	a	Awesome game, must play...loved every bit of it.. PC controller would help.! :)
2135	1	a	An extremely fun game. There is the occasional camera issue and the absence of a jumping ability does give the game the feeling that it's lacking something, especially when you can't jump off cliffs unless you're standing on a specific location. Some of the locations can also feel generic and some of the enemies attacks just feel like they're hacking away at your health, which can ruin any sense of strategy.   All of those are minor flaws, though. The biggest flaw of the game is when you're fighting multiple enemies at once. You'll be hacking away at an enemy, then another enemy will injure you and you'll automatically lock onto that new enemy. This can get frustrating when you're facing off with a boss and they summon a swarm of monsters. You're character will keep getting hit, hack at that enemy, get hit again, turn around and hack at that enemy, then get hit again and hack at that enemy. This can cause the fight to last forever because you're not locked on to one enemy long enough to actually kill them.  This may seem like a lot of complaints, but I've gotta admit that I still really like the game. The story is interesting, with a deep lore, and you can usually either work around or suffer through the enemy locking problem. The bottom line is that, despite its flaws, this game is very entertaining.
4351	0	a	A great concept with poor fit and finish, Dino Horde/Prelude has come a long way but has farther to go before securing a lasting place on my hard drive. Score 6.0
2746	0	a	Okay, simply put...I hate this game. Horrible framerate. Bad controls. Annoying music.  Good thing I only bought this game from someone for 20 trading cards. I wouldn't have paid $15 for it.   I would rather play TF2 or Section 8 instead of this game.
4669	1	a	One of the best dinosaur games I have played in a long while. I would have happily paid around $5 for a game like this.  Pros -It is a steal for 99 cents! Far better than any 99 cent iphone game - It has dinosaurs! -Every battle take part in seems unique, anything can happen! -It is moderately open world -Contols are easy to use -those particle effects! -any multiplayer game mode you can think of -Hats, hats and more hats -it can run on anything if you know how to adjust your system settings and the game initialization file  Cons -the game can be a bit buggy and has lots of random FPS drops even on my gaming rig - The Ai dinosaurs can be a little goofy at times. - No single player campaign (I got over that since the game was apparently made by 2 people and I don't want to put to much pressure on the devs,) -The maps are all very similar in style and design. -the 3D characters, guns, props and textures are not as high quality as i would like. (still very good though!) -its not as realistic as crysis 3 (Get over it) -I felt that the devs could have taken this game just a little bit further to make it trully amazing  Awesome dinosaur game,  good multiplayer indie game   Rating: 8.7/10  
2881	1	a	The first game I play where the butt of a gun hurts more than the gun itself.
3220	1	a	It's a terrifically fun game that's one dollar and people still feel entitled enough to complain about it on metacritic.  10/10
273	1	a	Would I recommend this game?  THAT'S A BIG YES, thumbs up!  The graphics: 10/10 The story: 10/10 Side quests: 8/10 DLC: 9/10   The story is awesome. No words for that! For the sidequests: I am talking about EVERY FREAKIN' SIDE QUEST THERE IS IN THIS GAME: there are A LOT!  Some quest are big, you can earn houses for them. Some are small, get this - bring it to me - you get money,  kill him - tell me he's dead - you get money. Still, they send you to beautiful places and each sidequest has is own little story and that can be really fun too, right?   This game makes you feel like a God!   For the DLC: buy them except for the Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle. They'll be good in the begin of the game, somewhat in the middle of the game you will find better and stronger armor and weapons. I don't think it's worth the â¬4,99  The Legend of Dead Kel includes a brand new quest line, multiple side quests, three Twists of Fate, previously unseen armor and weapons, and a new player home.   Teeth of Naros opens up a new unique quest line, a new floating city to explore, and multitudes of unlockables.    Skyrim was my favorite game before I started my adventure in Kingdoms of Amalur.  This became my favorite game and it still is! I hope this review was helpful!  Have a nice day! :)
1290	1	a	Has a bit of a linear feel to it like most games. Very unique combat system and while the story isnt too interesting the fact you can take off safety mode and slaughter entire villages is pretty awesome.
152	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a western rpg, meaning when you get out of the tutorial area, the game goes 'okay, the main plot is over there, sidequests are over here... go nuts.'  Overall, the game starts out with you dying, and you're brought back by the Well of Souls, an experimental form of resurrection. So far, you're the only success. You have no knowledge of your past life, and you seem to be unbound from the threads of Fate, meaning all your actions will have unknown effects on everyone else, for good or ill. People destined to fail may succeed, those who were supposed to live may die, etc.  The game has a fair number of good points for it - you get a good range of emotions from quests and character dialog; even minor characters have been fleshed out and given personality. The combat system is fairly simple but engaging, so it doesn't take too long to learn, but for the most part remains interesting throughout the game. Most enemies who die in motion will drop a treasure bag, so if the body falls off the edge of a cliff or becomes inaccessible, you can still get the loot. There are a number of quests which your decisions will actually have an overall effect on the area, as well. More than once, someone you're sent after will go 'uh hey, I have no beef with you, just those guys. How about you leave me alone?' and you can actually work for them instead, or leave them alone. Most of the escort quests aren't too much of a pain in the â¥â¥â¥, either. The graphics are quite nice as well; the game is very beautiful, and the character models are done well.  The game definitely has its flaws, however. A number of fluff items are tagged as essential, meaning if you pick them up, you cannot get rid of them or even leave them in your stash. A number of quest items also remain after their use is expended, making them clog up your inventory list (or in rare cases, take up actual carrying space ). There's no way to drop quests, and some quests are repeatable, so you'll always have their markers on your map after you've stopped caring about it. The questflow is a bit odd as well - one branch of the main questline, and all of the faction questlines (along with a fair number of regular quests) point you to a city called Rathir fairly early (a place which marked somewhere around two-thirds to three-quarters of the game through for me), while only the other branch of the main questline went to an area called Detyre, which is much lower level than Rathir. This wouldn't be as much of a problem is you received the Detyre quest first, but you receive it the same time as the one pointing you to Rathir, and if you've been working on any of the faction quests, you're going to be getting a huge push to go there as well. The crafting and skill system could have used some more work as well; the lockpicking is a joke as most of the time you don't even need to move the pick, money becomes a nonissue quickly, making mercantile pointless; sagecrafting, alchemy, and blacksmithing all feel kinda useless until you max out their points. Also, after a certain point in the game, all of the health and mana potions seem to drop back to lesser for some reason, even though the others are at the correct level... until even later in the game, when any non-health or mana potion drops are all just greater damaging.  Sadly, given what... happened to the company, most of the bugs will never be patched, and no sequels will be made, which is a shame 'cause despite its flaws it really is a good game. It's definitely worth $20, and any sale price it goes to is an absolute steal.
1804	1	a	For the record, I got this game for 66% off.  This game is awesome. If I had to compare it to another game, it would be Fable. I'm not going to say its better or worse than fable.  This game isn't worth $20? But goat simulator was totally worth it huh? What a joke. Its worth the $20. And if it goes on sale, you would be foolish to not give it a chance. 
648	1	a	Fantastic RPG. Its like a cartoonish Elder Scrolls game with a better fighting system. Very easy game to get into.
1615	1	a	A lot of damage types like bleeding piercing poison fire lightning ice. All of these are useable in forging your own weapons and armour.
2706	1	a	Fun to spend time, interesting game liking so far. There should be more players almost no servers
544	1	a	its basically what fable 3 should have been..
3887	1	a	One of the best dollars I ever spent on a video game. Take on waves of Dinosaurs in Survival modes, using a wide array of weapons, skills, vehicles and classes. Customize your character with hats, capes, Armour colors and more if you are willing to spend an extra couple bucks. If you a PVP player their is a wide variety of Deathmatch and objective modes as well although this game really shines in its survival mode in my opinion. Something adrenaline rushing about fighting against waves of Raptors, Pteradactyls, Stego, Rex's, Spinosaurs and a lot more.  Game Showcase-    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5-0QSalIis 
5629	1	a	Best dollar I've spent on steam.
3369	1	a	I don't really know how bad this was at launch, but right now? It's quite fun. It's essentially Killing Floor with a touch of Halo. Worth giving it a shot considering how deeply discounted it tends to be. Ignore the Metacritic score if you can, and ignore all the people who tease you for playing 'such a bad game' because â¥â¥â¥â¥ them, you're a grown up who can make judgment calls for yourself and are capable of enjoying life without worrying what other people think.
5455	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.
3836	1	a	!
4009	0	a	tired of seeing this damn game in my library as free or in a deal. this game is trsah hence why its 1 dollar and they keep making this deals.dont get anddont waste your time.
1673	1	a	This game reminds me a lot of skyrim, mixed with torchlight. Although i had a couple of issues with the gameplay (such as the one dimensional npcs and the lack of choices in dialogue, the world has been very cool and the lore engaging.
1205	1	a	Excellent open-world action RPG with a fast-paced and visceral combat system. The world is vibrant and colorful while the characters and storyline are well-developed and interesting. It essentially combines Skyrim's open-world with Fable's joyful graphics and God of War's action-oriented combat. Highly recommended!
4945	0	a	This game seemed good, but the graphics suck and it doesn't tell you how to do anything, such as buying new weapons. Also, the dinos horde around you after like 2 rounds and its pretty much impossible to escape that. DO NOT waste you 49 cents on this trash.
5929	0	a	This game says it can be \'used\' on windows 10 that is a lie it is also to laggy
368	1	a	So I bought this game a few months ago, not expecting much. Honestly, I was expecting it to be one of those games I play for a couple of days and then lose interest in. I was very wrong on that account. This is actually one of the best, if not the best, RPGs that I have ever played. There were a few cons of course, but I will get to that in a little bit.   Because The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the last RPG I played before this game, I could not help but to make comparisons during my entire time playing this. In terms of graphics, I found Amalur to be far superior than Oblivion. When you are walking in caves and you see all of the flora just come to life as you walk past, it is just captivating.   In terms of story line, I would say that they are about equal, but then again, I have not gotten all that far in Oblivion's storyline (I spend most of my time doing the side quests, build my character up some for the really tough bosses). If I compared Amalur to Morrowind however, I would pick Amalur's storyline anytime. Because unlike Morrowind, in which the storyline has you do all of these tasks to the point that it feels crazy, Amalur is fairly straightforward.   Voice-acting, I don't really care for. But from what I can tell, the voice of the characters in Amalur tends to have this almost...ghostly quality? Almost like you are hearing someone in another room rather than them talking right next to you. I guess you will either love it or hate, but for me? I was indifferent.   There are plenty of side quests to take part in, just like in Oblivion. Like Oblivion, you can take part in faction quests. Like if you want to be the head of a Mage's guild in Oblivion, then you can do the same for Amalur. However, while it it can take a few days or so to finish a faction quest in Oblivion, you can knock them out in Amalur in like, a day because the quests are so much easier and there are fewer actual quests to complete for the faction.   There is a huge variety of character customization. Do you want to play a male or female character? Go ahead. Do you want to play as an Elf or a Human? Go ahead. If memory serves me right, then I think there are four races to select in Amalur, but the building of the skill-set does not occur until you actually start game play. Like you do not decide immediately if you want to make your character a mage. You can decide where you want to place your character's skill alignment later on and even then, you are fully able to go back and change your character's style whenever you want. If you decide you want a hammer wielding mage, but decide later that you want to have a magic wielding thief or warrior, then you can do that.   I guess now I can get into the overall pro's and con's.  Pro's  -Absolutely amazing graphics - Wide skill-set available -You can change your skill-set whenever you want with no consequences other than what your character can or cannot wear or what they can do in combat. -Game play tends to be fluid and smooth, particularly with the combat. You can dodge-roll or teleport out of the way of an attack and the game is not in first-person so you can see more. I will get to con's later -Once the main storyline is complete, you can still continue on side-quests -Items will not weigh more than others. While some weapons will impact attack speed, they will still only occupy one item slot in your backpack. For example, your hammer, while slower in combat than your daggers, will still occupy the same space in your backpack as the daggers.  -There is a hide-helmet option so that even if your character wears a hood or helmet, you will not see it in game play yet you will still have the effects. I personally loved this feature. -Easier than Oblivion, but the boss fights can still crush you if you are not ready -Good enough that it deserves a sequel -My overall verdict? I enjoy this game way more than Oblivion.  Con's  -Camera angles tend to lag every once in a while, to the point where you might have difficulty seeing an enemy -Character may freeze while running. As in your character will just stop moving while running. This can be overcome by rolling or teleporting, but it can be troublesome to freeze in the middle of a fight. Also, this freezing will occur A LOT, and as such you will be rolling or teleporting almost all the time. It took a couple of days for this to occur to me though. -Voice-acting is so-so.  -From what I have heard, you can only reach level 41. That is it. But you can still reset your skill points later on. Keep in mind though that this means you will not be able to completely max out all skills and abilities.  -I have had difficulty completing a side-quest because every time I try, the game shuts down. I do need to give it another try though. -Last I checked, the company that developed this game went bankrupt. So do not expect a sequel or any patches.  Overall, I say check this out. I got it for $9.99 and this game was most definitely worth the price. It is fun, beautiful, and the ability to change your skill-set helps to take away the pressure of having to stick with one field.  
6117	1	a	It is really fun. I don't see why everybody is rating it badly, it never crashes and is really fun to play. totally buy it.
484	1	a	Played the game for 6 hours so far, and it's really good. The gameplay is interactive and fun, storyline seems solid so far, with manny side quests (so far). The game is not super hard so far, but not easy to the degree where it's ruining the experience.   8/10
510	1	a	Best game ive ever played so far in my life cant wait till Bethesda make new games hopefully like this one 
773	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players. Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests? Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers? How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance? Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter. The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world. After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts. That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing. This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me.   Pros: Frequently on sale, Combat Cons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs.  
3157	1	a	When I first got it, I thought this game was crap. Then I realised that my computer was crap. The game was too pretty for me and my computer wasn't happy about it. So really, that's good. But survival wasn't doing it for me. AI weren't all that great, and I didn't know what to do. Then I played rampage mode. DANG. I'm a human. And some guy playing just ate me. LOL. I mix things up and play as a Spinosaurus. And I ate people. And it was AWESOME. Then I finally got somewhere in survival and I found a tank. And shot a Stegosaurus. And a T-Rex. And I wrecked dino-face. So glorious. Bought a 4-pack, and I'm looking forward to eating my friends while they try to kill me with puny guns. Not a great game, but it's great fun. I'd recommend this for $15 dollars. All the way. IT GOT BETTER.
2057	1	a	very awesome game!  pros: you are freaking GOD in this game. effekts are amazing. grafik are good too. you have alot of choises on how to play your hero.  cones: there are invisible barriers, I mean com on, we are in 2015 (or later if you read it later). quests does not punish you if you do not follow the instructions. there are nothing left after last boss. game ends!
5372	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that I recommend because: - it is a method to banish boredom - it has a good price - it is indie - it has dinosaurs - it has adventure - it has co-op mode - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
4405	0	a	I used to play it with my bro but now the addded an update which for us ruined our fun i loved how you could be the dinosuar but now its not the same,thank you
5798	0	a	Bought this game back when it was 'Dino Beatdown' and still Early Access. It cost me 20$ at the time and it was so worth it. There were no microtransactions that I could remember, people actually played the game, and it ran better. I'm glad it's one dollar because if it cost any more, it wouldn't be worth it.  Full of microtansactions and bad graphics, it was better 4 years ago.
2274	0	a	Mouse pointer doesn't move in game makes it unable to play. Disappointed.
1063	1	a	Good graphics, and so far a pretty good character building system. See the opportunity to play it a number of different ways. Been going pretty solid warrior (big surprise I know), but the lure to dual class is pretty strong. 
3295	1	a	This game has gone from one of the worst games to the most fun time waster on steam. This is proof that there is no such thing as a bad game, just developers who don't care.  10/10 best fun:cost game on steam
4157	1	a	Dinosaurs. Jetpacks. Rocket launchers. Currently 0,75â¬. Totally worth it.
5695	0	a	My friend bought this for me. Thank God I didn't waste any money, because this is literally â¥â¥â¥â¥. Constant lag, horrible graphics and gameplay, and more combined to make a literal pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that came from the developer's â¥â¥â¥. Oh wait, there was more than ONE developer? Jesus Christ, they must've gone and got the most autistic people they could find on the street, because this game sure seems like it.
4521	1	a	wtf is this game? It`s so funny, that i slapped my mother so hart in the face, that she started laughing too.  10/10 would slap my mother again for this game!
201	1	a	Impression after an hour: Wow, why hadn't I heard about this? It kidna has a stupid name. At least, it's not catchy. Apparently it didnt' sell well enough and the companies involved went under.   Controller friendly, interesting art style, polished, good lore, kinda action combat that seems fun so far.   I got it on sale. Looking forward to finishing it.  FIVE HOURS: I still like it. I'll see how much staying power it has, still like the art style and the combat. Aside from the stupid name, I'm thinking what killed the company is it's not an exceptional game. It's standard high fantasty, but it's not gritty or enthalling in a way like the Witcher or Dragon Age is. The writing is a big part of those, this does feel more like FedEx quests. But I paid about a tenth fo this of what I paid for Dragon Age. So far I still think I got my money's worth, and it doesn't have the addictive quality of some othe rgames it's still fun so far.
4371	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
1844	1	a	this jame is good
3448	1	a	this game awesome! after update for conquest mode and world map this game jump from garbage (3/10) to nearly perfect game (8-9/10) share the games with your friends and survive this primal world!
4130	1	a	epic, addictive what more could you ask? everyone is concerned about graphics and detail games are ment to be games and fun and stuff
5173	1	a	This game has everything. Amazing glitches, laser rifles, and dinasaurs!  MUST BUY!  IGN - 10/5! GameReviews - 11/10! FunHaus - 9/11
5612	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.
5745	1	a	pteroerdactelyeyl scooped me up whil i was dancing 4 da ladiez  
2484	1	a	This game is ridiculous. But it's worth a shot, if you play with your friends. For only a buck it's a decent experience. There's something about this game that gets people playing it, I guess, it's the mindless run-shoot-upgrade model. This game has its fun, but you have to give it a time. I enjoyed this shooter much more than L4D2 for instance. Also, it has one of the most easiest-to-acquire achievement system, I have encountered on Steam. My overall rating â 6/10, because, after all, this game is shallow and with lots of bugs.
6273	0	a	it looks like it could be a fun game but the dino controls are kinda really bad
871	0	a	I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.  Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.  If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.
4902	0	a	it is so bad i can even think anymore
3947	0	a	Just no.
4354	0	a	It says that I own this game so I am reviewing it. It is not a good game. I have not played the game, but I have read what people are saying about the game. They don't like it. Plus, how good can a game be if it was released for $15 but now is routinely sold for $1?  I also think that the developers may hate dinosaurs. Don't support saurian prejudice.
4766	1	a	this is a great game. even if you dont play it you should buy it just because of what these guys have achieved here. to take an absolutely terrible game and turn it into this is just magical!
4591	1	a	It has dinosaurs. What else can be said.
3992	1	a	Very fun game.  Also, â¥â¥â¥â¥ Activision.
1657	1	a	ifgu love skyrim get this its skyrim with a bettere combat system
3030	1	a	It's almost so bad it's good. I wouldn't recommend for solo play, fun with a friend. 10/10 would get stuck in a rock again.
1480	1	a	This is an amazing game. One of the first games where i actually enjoyed the crafting system. Story is amazing and the side quests are not repetetive. 10/10
3553	1	a	got stuck into the body of a dinosaur  best experince of my life 10/10
5653	0	a	Noooope.  Do not buy, horribly optimized, EXTREMELY bad gunplay that makes nerf guns feel like weapons of mass destruction. Animations are laughable and it's massively boring. I saw the reviews here and thought it might've changed - it hasn't. It's still as appalling as when I first saw it on a TotalHalibut/Biscuit video, and it feels exactly the same as it looked - and it was shoddy.  Even for 99p, which was how much it was on sale... no, don't get it. It's depressingly bland, boring and has such a bad feel to it, and it'll make you ashamed to see it on your steam library.  
5953	0	a	Its really fun. Recommended
6258	0	a	i played it a little bit didnt really like it. i think it needs some more work
4313	1	a	Why can't you hear a Pterodactyl going to the bathroom? Because the P is silent.. thank you this game sucks.
4811	0	a	I'm not going to rate Orion Prelude positively, as I found it to be lacking in different aspects such as soundtrack, regular updates, optimization, animation, ai, balance, etc. I will however say that you may as well give it a try with friends now that it is free
3686	0	a	tHIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!tHERE IS SO MUCH LAG AND IT IS LOW quality. 1/10
3993	0	a	Now I haven't played this game in a few months, but it's still safe to say for me that this game might not be what you are looking for. Now some might say that for the low price, it is not that bad, but I think it is actually pretty dull and boring. The gameplay gets repedetive after only a few hours and there is almost no variety. For one there is a pretty big set of weapons, combined with multiple (I think 4) Perks, but they are just soooo boring, and there is almost no sense of progression to be seen anywhere, what is especially disappointing for me. The graphics aren't to bad, but just like everything else in the game, pretty dull. The dinosaur models are alright, and interesting, but again, the playing just gets repetetive quickly.
1125	1	a	This is a must get game, especially when it is on sale, you could not get more for the silly prices Steam sells it for
974	1	a	Nice relaxing game. Lots of options to explore and many enviroments and characters to see!
962	1	a	Addictive combat system, lost of quests. Solid RPG, it's sucked me in.
4059	1	a	Really great game. Worth the price you pay.   Bought the 4 pack and it was the best. I recommend you buy it to.
667	1	a	Pretty amusing game, moderate replay value.
433	1	a	 This is what I wished Fable II and III were
3260	1	a	This game is hilariously bad. The raptors will spawn right next to you and you can kill hordes of them with one clip. It's awkward to shoot because your gun doesn't recoil most of the time and for what ever reason the boss dinosaurs always attacked me. I can say the best part about this game was being grabed by the pteradons.
4261	0	a	When you paid to get f2play game that feeling is priceless...
6053	1	a	This game is really fun. I've only played it a bit but its really addicting.
2723	1	a	i brought this game because it was on offer and it may be cheap but its fun to play with you and your mates you can set up a server or join one so ill give it 9.5/10
1337	1	a	I dont really have anything helpful to say except that I loved it so much Ive played it through 3 times!!!
565	1	a	It's a simple fun ARPG that was unfortunatly overlooked due to release timing
4657	0	a	Sure am glad the specs keep changing
1632	1	a	This game is One of the best Rpgs I have ever played. In my opinion it's better than Skyrim because of one thing, Amalur's amamzing combat. The combat is so fast and fluid it's not even funny.
5910	0	a	Plagiarism is no joke. Do not buy this game. The developers stole art from many other studios and do not deserve your money.
5401	0	a	I honestly really like this game, its fun, fast paced and easy to get into.  Its actually really fun but the reason why I made this review a bad one, is that the community of this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage. I have died in the past because I got crushed by my own CAR! So you know what this tard does, he doesn't revive me, he grabs my car and drives away and leaves me. Mind you, this is not the only time this had happened. There have been many times where I sometimes got crushed by my own vehicles. Now I understand if you are against a T-Rex at point blank range and you can't revive me, but sometimes, there are like 4 people attacking the same damn dinosaur and while I'm dying at the back, they will ignore you and leave you to die and lose all your gear. Another problem is the vehicles. Let's say for example I go do the objective, and once I finish it, I get a helicopter or a jeep as a reward, but then some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ charges in while I'm killing dinosaurs, preparing to get into my car and this guy just takes it and drives away and leaves me a with a T-Rex while I'm heavily wounded.  So here is my overview of the review. The gameplay is awesome and really fun and the graphics are pretty good for a one euro game but the community is absolutely terrible, they will leave you even when they are in no harm at all, people who done nothing for the team will charge and steal all your vehicles.  5/10
3662	1	a	0/10 would not buy again

4432	0	a	Concept is great, but all I got while playing it was a game designed for human characters, with poor handling on the dinosaurs and other reptiles. Difficult to navigate and figure out how to play in the first place.
300	1	a	A great single player mmo rpg, wonderful story written by Salvatore. Good graphic and characteristic world. Vote: 8.5/10
3715	1	a	This game doesn't deserve as bad a meta-score as it has been given. I can honestly say, I was happy to purchase five copies. And everyone I know who took a chance and bought this game on a whim have all been excitedly surprised and have maybe even had as much fun as I have. The survival (which is all I can speak for) game-mode is really satisfying and definitely scratches that itch the original 'Zombies' console shooter infected me with. As far as I'm concerned, all the other game modes are just extra fun icing on a really yummy dino-blasted cake. If you were expecting Halo6Doom128 with the super epic plot twist bulletquicktime minigames...please resume playing the other shooters. But if you wanna try somethin' a little different and you enjoy shooter games that have 'vending machines' and waves of enemies to eliminate give Orion:Dino Horde a try, you'll probably really have fun with it if you give it a real chance.
1613	1	a	Buy this freaking game so they can make a second one. Do it as a personal favor to me.
4195	0	a	The thing is about this game, it is poorly made, bad shooting mechanics, bad AI, driving vehicles handle worse than GTA IV, and the slow motion is annoying (but can be disabled upon further discovery). Orion: Dino Horde is the re-release of ORION: Dino Beatdown. Just a copy/paste of the game to get a new score on Metacritic, but still recieves its old score of 36. You can't really customize your character, that part is microtransactions. You want to be red? Too bad! Have pitch black instead. Trust me, it doesn't really look good either.  But, there is a few good things Fun co-op Hilarious ragdoll physics A great game to make fun of.  I only got the game because it is 1$, as this game isn't worth 15$ in my book.
320	1	a	The RPG format is one where you have fairly clear expectations. Despite this, most of them get it wrong. But KOA Reckoning is the first one I've found in a long time that has actually had me telling myself I needed to go to bed (and then ignored my own advice).   The storyline is rich, which a lot of developers forget is important when you're supposed to be *playing* a role in a virtual world, and the gameplay is fun and flexible. As much as I love games like The Witcher, the user interface and controls can be awkward and clumsy; this game overcomes those problems and is genuinely enjoyable from start to finish - where you'll actually *want* to spend dozens of hours off on lore-related side quests instead of begrudgingly doing them out of necessity.   Overall one of the best RPGs that I've ever played. I haven't checked out the DLC yet, but it's definitely something I'll be doing and not just considering.
2015	0	a	I'd advice people not to buy this game. It's just not up to par at all with other RPGs.  It feels like everything's just a shell... I've played F2P MMO's with much more oomf to hitting things and doing things.  Games like these would REALLY need the combat to make you feel awesome, but here it feels kinda bland and superficial. Your hits don't feel like they're doing much. 
4840	1	a	Super Random game that kicks â¥â¥â¥
224	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning delivers exactly what it promises: a pitch-perfect fantasy RPG, with visceral, intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up, difficult to master, wildly flexible and just plain fun, in a way that has yet to be seen in the genre. The world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.
2281	1	a	Seriously, if you were paying 0.99$ for it, then why are you expecting a 29.99$ game ?  As lots of you may have known that there are some bugs and immature 3D imaging issues, including shooting delay and broken graphics, but I actually have had a lot of fun in it.  Killing dinos with friends is simply fun, with various choices of maps and gameplay mode. If you don't see it as a dedicated gun game, you'll probably make it easier to enjoy.  In short, personally, paying 0.99$ for a 200-hrs+ game, that was just worth enough to me. Would like to see how this game improve in the future.  ORION: Prelude [7/10]
1792	1	a	This game's all that Fable 3 tried to be and much more! EXCELLENT! /Mr. Burns on
1504	1	a	This game is packed to the gills with content and has to be one of the best open world RPGs I have ever played.
3027	1	a	Game of the year! 10/10 It bearly works. amazing to record!! It's awesome butt ses so it doesn't work so good.
5036	0	a	this game is very annoying everytime i try to play theres a computer type person who circles me the entire time i try to play. very annoying!!!
4609	0	a	dont bother with it, its crap.
366	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the best RPG games I've played in a long time. Skyrim didn't really catch me, but Amalur has. I don't know if it's the combat style or the atmosphere or just the storytelling that makes this game great or if it's the great combinations of these. Anyway, this is a great RPG and most likely a candidate to 'Best Game of the Year 2012'.
1975	1	a	Really, really fun game in general, though it's a bit short for an open world rpg. I have logged about fifty hours into it now and finished the main questline, plus two side quest lines and all the DLC. That being said, aside from some slightly wonky camera work and a not always perfectly responsive combat system, I would highly reccomend this game for a casual enjoyer of RPGs. 
76	1	a	This game is addictive as hell. (For a card game)
742	1	a	On sale, this game is a steal. An interesting RPG and great for the WOW player that likes to do thier own thing instead of waiting on others.
4831	1	a	really good game.. the rate of this game is not updated.. really fun worth the 1$
3657	0	a	Not even worth the dollar I paid for it. The dinosaurs always charge straight in on you. You have 60 seconds to run halfwya across them map to restock and back again which is unecessarily short. Most of the time I have no idea what's going on or why.
4752	1	a	This is Halo of Jurassic Duty 2 or Call of Jurassic Halo 2. This game is so cool and very fun to play
5845	0	a	paid for this game now its free nothing special for what i paid nothing at all while every one els gets it free devs suck lol
4826	0	a	Buy it only on sale.
3914	0	a	I would like to start my review, with the utmost important point i'm trying to make here:  It's not worth your money, not even one euro ! Aah do not let yourself get fooled by their enticing videos in which the metascore is told to be a lie,  for this metascore is very much correct.   Let me now continue with disecting this horrible game, as one would do with a dead frog (very respectlessy and relentess). This is best chewed-out, overhyped (i dare say if you only glare once, on the videos provided in the store), piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can buy with money.  The models are truly horrible, quake live has more detailed models, than this game. The dinosuars are really stiff and inanimate, they appear the be dead before you shoot them. Never in my life have i seen such pixelate artwork being used in a game, for instance the loadout screen in which you select what class you want to play, it's so pixalated i would dare to say it's resolution is 256*256 and no more. Also the matchmaking system is realy buggy to say the least, also in the 20 minutes or less that i 've tried this game i couldn't play with my friend since this game wouldn't allow us, the lobby screen is so underdeveloped it's laughable.  But hey if you want some braindead dino killing action without even taking the slightest notice of the actaul game and the playability of it, this game may be very much for you.  Probably all these things added up makes the price 1 euro and no more, money spent on a bread is better spent money. If you are thinking to buy this game you might aswell donate one euro (or whatever currency you may use) to a charity.  Please do so for the sake of humanity.  After paying for this game, i felt so much shame that i was disgusting and thus as a result of it i automatically was inclined to donate a euro to a charity. as if it were to pay of for the sin that i had commited by buying this.  Do not bego the same mistake as i did. For your humanity ! 
611	1	a	I loved this game. The battle system is fun and i liked the story.   It has A LOT of sidequests (but thats a positive to me). I explored every dungeon, every city and did every quest i could find. The key to enjoying it is to take your time exploring the world.   If you try to rush through the game, you wont like the experience and will probably get bored long before the end.   
2390	0	a	When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.  Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.  The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.  Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped. I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.  On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.
185	1	a	Kingdoms is one of those hidden gem games. With gameplay and a questing system similar to World of Warcraft, an incredibly rich and detailed lore and an absolutely massive world to explore, Kingdoms should have enough in it to keep you occupied for hours. Unfortunately, the company behind the game has since collapsed, so don't expect any support or future DLCs.  Still, overall an 8/10.
1442	1	a	It's like an MMORPG for people that hate people. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love it.
1670	1	a	Nice game:)
3499	1	a	Best played with friends for a stupid good time. I got mauled by a knee high ankle biter.
5916	0	a	thieving dev
5365	0	a	The Metascore is misleading? This game got a user score of 3.9, yeah, misleading; sure;)
6374	1	a	best game ever have you been a flying dinosour and pick someone up 
1730	1	a	I am completely rewriting my review. After about 20 hours in this game my initial impression was that the game world lacked depth, the combat felt stilted and too easy, and the crafting system was made pointless by the gear given to you in the first town by the DLC. However, after completing one of the faction quest, and leveling out of the starter gear, this game has become nearly an equal to oblivion for me, and in some ways beats skyrim, though Skyrim's world is more complete, and the combat is more challenging, KoA's combat is fun and the crafting allows a lot of customization. I also really like the fateweaver resets, so you can, for a cost, completely change your character. This probably limits replayability a bit, but with all the side and faction quests, as well as the straight forward way that the main quest fits into them, there may be quite a bit of replayability.   Where KoA beats Skyrim:  - Combat is fun and feels action packed, and not so much thought is required. - Side and faction quests are much longer in general, and once completed fit into the story. - The consequences of your sidequests and twists of fate that happen once they are completed feel more weighty. - Less glitchy, but I like TES glitches, they give the world character, and make for fun stories.  - Far less essential NPC's: You can hit H and kill nearly anyone. Not that I did.    Where Skyrim is better:  - Skyrim's graphics feel less like a console game. View distance is poor on KoA and there is a bit too much pop in.  - The combat on KoA is pure console style, which is fun in short bursts, but little stratedgy is required. - KoA has people sleeping and waking BUT NO DAY NIGHT CYCLE and no weather. - Skyrim's character customization beats KoA hands down. In KoA armor options are limited in style, and crafting doesn't allow for very much choice in appearance. faces are all perfect, exfoliated, and glowing with health. Characters are all buff and tall, whether you are a mage or a warrior.   I still feel like the interface on KoA and a lot of the features are better suited to a MMO than a MSPRpg, and it is kind of annoying to have a hotbar that is locked to only changing the spell active, but you can get used to it. If there was a touch more customization, and a modding community, this game would be equal to skyrim in my mind.
3534	1	a	Personally, I think this game is one of the best co-op games I have seen..., even though the price is incredibly cheap.
970	1	a	A criminally overlooked game. For the first game os a studio, it's amazing and I'm sad they drowned in debt shortly after it. But, at the very least, we got this lovely thing. I wouldn't put it too high on your list, but it's one of the better action RPG's you'll find. A refreshing world that at least seems to try to weave some new dwarves/elves, and feels quite fantastic. It's also very colourful. Skyrim looks better, but this game FEELS better. (though they're both still 'alright/good') And... uhm... look up sometimes. There's more to those trunks than you think!
1716	1	a	Great Game! feels like fable and elderscrolls at the same time.
1671	1	a	This game is too pro, just like me in League of legends or me in general within gaming. It's like fabley. Such gameplay Much time.  Wow
4504	0	a	Steam says I own this â¥â¥â¥â¥... I DON'T
52	1	a	Pretty cool solitaire with RPG elements. The story isn't the most outstanding fantasy, but it did remind me of reading a Forgotten Realms book, a bit. It doesn't help that the story ends halfway through its overall telling, implying that there's a sequel which remains to be seen, though supposedly the studio is working on a new poker-rpg title for release this year. Whether or not that's a sequel to Overture, I do not know.
5943	0	a	It's not worth it
2029	1	a	If i could sell my soul for this game agin...
957	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played.
559	1	a	Sadly Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning kinda flew under the radar for allot of people until the reviews started popping up. This was mainly because of the terrible advertising that made this brilliant game come across as mediocre. To put KOAR simply itâs a Fable-like MMO style action RPG with rich lore, unique creature designs, an interesting story &amp; faction stories &amp; a brilliant character development system that encourages multi-classing. A little FYI a Ranger type Rouge with defensive &amp; buff Mage skills is pretty much unbeatable. Itâs a very colourful game which is a nice change from the very dull &amp; dark designs of most games today &amp; if you are OCD about exploration &amp; completing every side quest this is a game thatâll take quite a while to complete, I have not even finished it yet &amp; as of this recommendation I have stacked up about 103 hours of game time. I recommend this to all fans of RPGs, exploration &amp; a good story &amp; I hope to see more from this franchise in time to come.
473	1	a	For 2 hours played.. I'm quite impressed.
5648	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
3695	1	a	Rode a T-Rex then got eaten - 9/10
3970	1	a	To be honest the gfx arent the best and there are a few glitches in the animation but for the price you cant go wrong... its great fun and well worth it!
933	1	a	First off I'd like to say I had no preconceptions before playing this game and I bought it on sale for $5 and I am going to keep this review short.  Good: -Neat story -Variety of classes is nice and encouraged -Variety of enemies  Okay/Bad: -Combat can be boring -Graphics are...like world of warcraft ish if you played that...if not they're not super detailed, not skyrim at all -Gear is varied but I always wanted more named stuff/good loot  This game is like if skyrim and world of warcraft had a (single player) child, if you get it on sale (less than $10 I'd say) it's worth it. It took me 50 hours for a playthrough (did most things that I could)
3205	1	a	Orion: Prelude. Where do I start with this game?  Orion: Prelude is an extremely fun experience, especially with friends. Having bought it in the early-ish stages of Orion: Dino Horde (what it was formerly called). I can say this along with everyone else: This game has improved loads since its initial release.  Let's start with the gameplay. Orion: Prelude feels alot like other wave-based survival games, but with dinosaurs. Pretty self explanatory. (There are also PvP gamemodes, but I haven't played them, I just bought this game for the co-op). However, the variety of maps and settings keep this game fresh, especially the fully customizable 'prehistoric' difficulty setting. The open world game mode (conquest) is great, and I still haven't fully explored the open world maps.  The visuals, simply put, are good. It's no Crysis 3, but everything looks really nice. The tasteful lighting and particle effects add to the atmosphere and overall feel of Orion: Prelude. However, the environments and such sometimes clash with the player models (the player models being the ones doing most of the clashing), making the game's graphics look imbalanced at times. Some of the animations are slightly mistimed. None of these are major issues though, and don't really affect the feel of Orion: Prelude. For the price, you just can't get visuals this good.  The soundtrack is excellent. My only complaint in this department is sometimes a song won't play all the way through before switching to another song, and the song-changing seems unrelated to what you are doing in the game.  Orion: Prelude is a great game. It's not without flaws, but I can definitely recommend it. For the price, this is probably the best game you can buy on Steam.
3664	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
2818	1	a	Non scoped a T-Rex with a Sniper for 0.49â¬... 11/10 Best game...
3667	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1136	1	a	Super Generic Game but it is Really Fun
2525	1	a	its like battlefield and borderlands 2 had a dino baby
3134	1	a	great game for a low price, although animations and graphics are a bit low quaility
338	1	a	loved this game when it first came out. A veey underrated game if your a fan of rpg you should definatly pick this up
5564	1	a	Got a couple hours into it. ha the first halo feel to it, i think it has alot of potential but it needs to be heavily optimized in the sense of LAG. hope to see what it grows into and for .99 cents whats to lose. 
5661	1	a	Jurrasic World (Gone Sexual!) (Gone Wrong!) (In The Hood!) (Gun Pulled!) (Cops Called!)              (Spoiler alert) You're the f**Kin cops.  All in all the, the games pretty good. There are a lot of reviews saying it's a crap game, but honestly it's quite good for a dollar. Enjoyed fooling around with my friends.
5070	1	a	Game is actually really good. Would buy again.
65	1	a	Its pretty much like Puzzle Quest, but with poker replacing bejeweled. Pretty fun. Its a good game to play while half-focused on something else
4001	1	a	Run, gun, fly and drive just don't let the dinos wreck your reactor or eat your â¥â¥â¥.   $1 game can't go wrong.
1013	1	a	One of the best combats in any action RPG.  The quest are a bit repetitive but the combat is just amazing.
1718	1	a	I am actually pleasantly surprised by this game. I had heard pretty good things about this game a while ago, but never got around to picking it up. The one thing that turned me off was that I felt it was too generic. But I'm glad I decided to pick this up regardless. It's not the most original setting, nor is the gameplay too different, but the combat is still satisfying, characters speak with pretty convincing accents and voices, and it looks really quite nice graphically. Plus, the third-person view really brings you into the world and it feels great. The combat here is exactly what I thought I would get with Dragon Age, and I was sad when that wasn't the case. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is worth it.
1717	1	a	A fantastic game it has so many missions around 60 or more very good color alot better than Skyrim which is more Black and White. The only problem with the game is the monstera are every where it gets old after awhile. But the missions are fun and there is a Cheat code for the game. Thai game is a real steal at this price and the 100 hours or more to play it. One of my favorite games.
3319	1	a	You can quickscope trexs and ride Choppers while running around with a lightsaber.  You get a game that's better than battlefront. All for 99 cents.
239	1	a	R.A. Salvatore and Todd Macfarlene, and Oblivion creator have outdone themselves with this one. I have no words that can fully express how amazing this game is. It is a mix of Fable, meets Darksiders, meets god of war and open world. There is so much to do in this game and the possibilites of how to play it are endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of a great story and so many things to explore with the add-ons it just makes it bigger. Think Skyrim map x 3. I hope you all enjoy.
1593	1	a	This game does not do anything amazing new to the genre. However, it takes the best of any other game of the genre: Graphics of World of Warcraft, huge world and travelling system of modern Elder Scrolls, fighting system of Fable 2, item system from Dragon Age and the quest system of about any western RPG. But this not a bad thing, because this means that even though the formula is not experimented with, it's well executed. The game contains loads of quests, monsters, an intriguiging lore and a very open world just inviting you to explore.  The only new element of gameplay is the Fate system, something I quite welcome. It allows you to re-arrange your character entirely, reset every skill and ability. For someone that likes to experiment with play styles, this is great. The fighting system is very fluid, the weapons feel different and the moves allow for many different strategies. Whatever your preferred fighting tatic, Reckoning has you covered.  The game's story line is good in two regards: If you follow it, it leads you into a completely new worlds of Fae, Fate and War. Though it suffers a bit from the 'Our Elves Are Named Differently'-Syndrome, the world has an unique lore that often makes you think about event in different lights. However, if you are the kind of player that doesn't care much for lore, the game's quest system always gives you enough information that you can skip any dialog without missing much.  However, no game is entirely perfect. The biggest gripe with Reckoning is the menu system. It seems to come from the late 90's, not a modern game. Menus seem tedious and uninspired, but they work. Skyrim does a much better job here. Switching from map to quests takes a long time. Other problems are about the lockpicking system. While the game uses a similar system to Skyrim, you often just leave locked chests alone. They never contain anything interesting and lock picking is just a waste of items, as there's not skill improvement from trying it. Same goes for the cursed chests, which have to be opened by a reaction minigame, which just always seems to tedious and brings no reward.  Also, it is quite an easy game. There's not really a challenge here, I must admit. I finished the game on the XBox, and when I can finish a game, it's definitely a very easy game. However, casual gamers will like it. I recommend playing the game on Hard mode at least, because anything lower just allows you to breeze through it.  But I would say this game is an absolute must for every fantasy RPG fan. The game is all in all well executed. No bugs, good graphics in HD, you simply cannot go wrong. Though it brings nothing new to the table, it just combines everything you like about the genre. Plus the world is huge, together with the DLC you can have hours and hours of gameplay ahead of you.
5193	1	a	I saw the meta-score. It was 36. I get demo. I fight T-Rex in a Tank. I buy :)  Tbh i have never seen a game transform so well. other than cod. ghosts was amazing am i right jk im go die now  9 out of 11 would crash jet into twin baracks
5006	1	a	I think it really is worth more than its cost. Good game
4023	1	a	Great Game. Played with some friends. Some Guns are a lot mor powerful than others so if you pick and choose right you will dominate!
1852	1	a	Great game! It is like God of War, Skyrim and WoW had a mutant baby. Overall game is like Skyrim, but in third person like God Of War, also has the same battle system as God of War, but has skills like WoW.
2063	1	a	Let me put it this way as far as RPGs go;  I've played it for 20 hours straight, no afking or what not and just started the main campaign. After getting this for 10 bucks on a steam sale.  It's a solid rpg.
1931	1	a	Enjoyed this game and the RPG aspects. Could ahve been better but still recommending it.
3265	1	a	For the price, you get a lot more than you pay for, ignoring the awkward animations and weird looking players, a bug here and there, it's a quite fun game specially with friends.
5974	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. They didn't even try to pretend it wasn't.
4301	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
3942	0	a	This game is tragically bad. The creators should drink bleach.
4314	1	a	Imba gameplay and gFx  A must for all Jurrasic Park Lover's &lt;3  Unlimted fun !!!!!  Just go for it
6346	0	a	I changed my mind about this game, the soldiers are perfect but the dinosaurs on the other hand get stuck on any bush it hits and it is impossible to kill any soldiers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
990	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is an interesting game. It seems like the developers of this game wanted to make their own Elder Scrolls game and built it from there. Rudimentary, shallowly implemented elements are present: theft, crime with the bounty system, personal homes you can upgrade and the like. However when it comes down to it the game focuses more on the combat and it does it pretty well.  Considering how much combat makes up these open world types of RPGs that's enough to buoy it to a tentative recommend. Much of the shortcoming of Skyrim and the like is the lackluster combat and this game certainly delivers. Everything else is just good enough to keep the game engaging. It's a fun game, although you can quickly grow overpowered. Worth a look when it's on sale, but I can see why it didn't meet its sales goal by a longshot.
5428	0	a	I dont... I dont even know wtf is going on anymore.
5224	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
4897	1	a	For $1 it has better graphics than call of duty and less glitches than battlefield.
4767	1	a	For 99p you really need to be scummy to give this a bad review. (I'm surprised halo hasn't sued)
2996	1	a	I absoloutly love this game. 10/10    
874	1	a	90/100 in my opinion...
423	1	a	I've owned this game before, but couldn't hold myself back from the steam sale.  The one thing about this game that just wins me over is the fluidity of combat. Pair that with the huge world, lovely graphics, fully voice acted story and great character progession and balancing and you get an amazing game like this. At every point in the game you feel OP but still wanting more 9.5/10
768	1	a	It's a lot of fun, too bad there will not be any sequels. It's a unique game with moderate repeatability
958	1	a	The game needs some polishing the diolouge and be a little wonky at times, and the vast number of quests get a little repetative. but the world is huge, open ended and fun to explore. the character building is amazing and adictive. The story could be a little more well explainged in the begining but it all makes sense after a bit of play and really picks you up and sweeps you along after a while. highly recomend
4693	1	a	Just great !!!!
6139	1	a	A cool combination of star wars and dinasours. you can play survival mode, team deathmatch and lots of other modes, but i mostly recomend the survival mode. It is a fun game to play with friends. I thimk it can get pretty boring after a while, but for the ridiculous price, it's totaly worth it! The game runs pretty very well onmostly computers, and has good framerate. You don't need a very powerful computer to run the game in high quality. It has a few bugs with the motion of dinosours, but it is not so much that it makes the game worse. I rate this game 8/10
5490	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1526	1	a	First off, if you look at my hours played that included just letting it sit. I probably played more like 50-55 hours. The game started out strong but within the first 5 hours or so I started listening to podcasts instead of the game dialog or music, because it was super repetitive. In fact that is the story of the game, repetition. It isnât a bad game, but I wouldnât say it is good. I would only suggest playing it if you have played something like Skyrim or Dragon Age.
5300	1	a	I wasn't expecting much  I am very happy I bought this, and in fact purchased a copy for my buddy in Mexico! I ried Dino D Day and it left a bad taste in my mouth, so I checked this one out and I LOVE IT! Yes it's a bit low budget, but it's not a bad game by any means. It has elements of a good RPGFPS that has some obvious influence, and a lot of dinosaurs to shoot in the face. Getting in a tank and blowing a trex out of the sky is awesome, but the cool part was that the tank wasn't over powered in defense and was quickly blown to pieces by a triceratops, which I was sad and satisfied at the same time with.  Overall there are enough guns to make some choices for, the classes are cool, and has a great value to it as well. I had to tweak some settings due to slow mouse tracking, seemed kind of laggy/choppy in the way the aim moved but tweaking some things, it's now working fine. I've not tried the PVP out yet but overall found this to be worth the dollar, and then some.  I'd love to see the devs add more to this game, and for the community to keep it strong. Loads of rooms online, very active, very fun!
3348	1	a	Way more fun than I thought it was going to be. Playing this with some friends is a total blast. I see myself playing this for a very long time and I won't regret a damn thing.
3266	1	a	9/11 would bang
3332	1	a	For a dollar its a must buy. I would suggest getting a copy for a friend as this game should is quite fun when you are playing with friends.   Pros ----------- -Lots of weapons -Vehicles -Dinos (what more can I say) ----------- Cons ----------- -Animations are derpy -Graphics are meh -Some maps are retextured and passed off for new one -Glitchy dinos (sometimes) ---------- This is your typical wave surival game. Kill enemies get credits spend them for weapons/upgrades. Die. For a dollar its worth the laughs  7/10
1044	1	a	It's kind of a cheap The Elder Scrolls title, considering the RPG elements they have borrowed. But: not so open world as much. For a few bucks it's recommendable though.
781	0	a	This game has one of the best action mechanics i've played, but it's just too long and it starts to get very boring and repetitive, I've played this a lot and didn't gt to end it yet
5286	1	a	It's cheap, runs smoothly, has servers running, some always populated, can play alone with bots to learn the game, LOTS of game modes, looks pretty awesome, sounds are good to okay, BIG maps, everything is customizable, has full X360 for Windows pad support, you can remap all controls on mouse+KB, or controller, did I meantion it's cheap??? A very under-rated game IMO, if more people played it, it could become popular, these guys did a good job with this game, My only gripe is 'some of the dinos are SO tiny/hard to shoot, but mele works okay on them (maybe they're baby dinos)'... everything else about this game save a few sound effects is awesome!
6077	1	a	Best FPS I have ever played. Easy to access servers, and sooooo addicting. The only downside, is you have to deal with graphics easily just as good as GTA III. Honestly, I dont care about graphics in a game, so it does'nt bother me, but if you are addicted to COD, then you'll most likly not enjoy this game, but you have to remember, it's only $0.99. Best game I have played in a LOOOOONNG time.
1879	1	a	A lesson on what action RPG's (and RPG's in general) should be.  A beautiful, enthralling world, that beckons you to explore it. A fun and balanced skill system and an incredibly fun crafting and resource system are just the tip of the iceberg.   The story is deep, and is given to you with just the right timing. The factions, the struggles among the different races and kinds of living beings, is just so intense and you get to play a huge and interesting part on it all. You are special, and the game makes sure that you know it and that you act accordingly, for good or bad. It lets you take part in your own fate, in a way I've only ever seen in Elder Scrolls games.  Anyway, if you love RPG's like I do, you should play this game. Period.
4076	0	a	Someone has found a way to make dinosaurs not awesome.
2802	1	a	Despite some negative feedback, this game realley deserves to be praised for its ingenuity and fun gameplay. Over all I really do recommend this game and I give it a solid 8/10.
6404	1	a	oh this one is fun!! DIE DINO SKUM!!!!!
1382	1	a	Immersive, open-world action RPG that's well worth the money. The combat, skill tree and crafting mechanics do enough for you to overlook the story's shortcomings.
1654	1	a	Great RPG; beautiful and sophisticated.
1399	1	a	Even for the short time I've played the game I got all the DLC and base game for $9.99 via amazon. But doing the research and finding reviews about the game from the community there is nothing to go wrong with this game!. A mix of skyrim gameplay with some action/adeventure/rpg style makes this game amazing! Not to mention how long of replayability this game has to over makes this one of the best action/rpg's out there to offer and the price was a plus! 2 thumbs up! *HIGH REC*
5052	1	a	only when its on sale
3990	1	a	Okay, a few months ago, this review would've ended up being pretty negative to say the least. But I must admit, these guys don't give up and keep updating and improving the game - to a degree, where it has not much to do with the initially released bugfest you might have laughed at or being so mad of, that you've refunded your money on Steam. Right now, the game is at a point, where it is stable, runs (finally) fluid, has a decent gunplay and most importantly: it's fun. Yes, with jetpacks and dinosaurs and mechs and that stuff, it is rather cheesy, but it doesn't take itself too serious, which feels kinda refreshing. They've also polished the look and added quite some content. I think, this one deserves a second chance. When there is a free weekend or a sale, go check it out.
417	1	a	After 80 hours of pure joy i finished this awesome game.  This Rpg-Game did evrything right: epic story, lovely sidequests, big area and lot of dungeons to explore , nice soundtrack, a lot of creapy creatures; but what i liked most was the awesome fightsystem and the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing best art design in an rpg i have ever seen.  You can feel that this game is made with a lot of love and patience.  For me it's the best RPG i have ever played and i wasnt expecting that because i'm a big elder scrolls fan. I would recomend it to everyone who loves RPG-games (and ofc has a lot of time to play ^^)!
3804	0	a	I cannot put into words how painfully bad this game is.
1088	1	a	This is one of my favorite games! If you like Fable 1 and 2, this is the game for you! Open world Hack n Slash RPG, free to make your class with the skills that you choose. Solid game play and mechanics, the lore is nice as well! Playd as Full Knight and Knight Mage hybrid. Its awsome to see how many combinations you can do!  If this game were online RPG i would have no life! Hoping that someday a second one will be released!
1040	1	a	I enjoyed this game immensely. It has smooth &amp; fun combat, beautiful graphics, lots of quests and lore. You can craft and even buy houses. It is a very time-consuming game though, since the world is very big. The main storyline is pretty linear and because of that, I'd only play through it once. But I can definitely recommend it, if you have time on your hands. 9/10
1755	1	a	A bizarre mix of Skyrim, World of Warcraft and Bastion - but somehow it works. I would give this game a 8 out of 10.   The best about this game is the combat, which heavily smacks of Batman Arkham Asylum.  The bad is the generic high fantasy story and the limited possibilities of actually exploring. Nonetheless a fun game, though a bit steeply priced at 59 dollars.
3702	1	a	This game fondled me greately. With such beautiful graphics and a compelling storyline how can you not have fun with it?  Definately worth the Â£1 i spent on it and I would go as far as to say I feel like I ripped off the creators! 10/9 what a steal indeed
326	1	a	got the game yesterday and i have the feeling i play Fable, nice fast gameplay and many choices, runs very smooth specialy for older computers like mine with not the dual cores required ( thumbs up )
4190	1	a	The true CoD killer has arrived. For only $0.99 you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ up coloured blobs that are vaguely reminscent of dinosaurs.  Beyond that this game will give you crazy dino-fighting instincts. No reptile will escape your righteous fury. A Geko was crawling across my roof the other day and I just point blank shot it down with my trusty m16 assault rifle. No mercy.   Buy Oreo: Prenoodle for your children and watch as they turn from mewling baby into a roaring dinosaur poacher who will bring about a level 5 extinction event before they are even in preschool.  16.7/10
1836	1	a	Fun RPG with aspects of other RPG games, as well as the standard classes 'warrior, mage and rogue' there are muixed classes that combine the base ones together for some interesting gameplay.
1238	1	a	If you like God of War you'll love this game! Buy it!
2148	1	a	Buying this game may not bring its devs back from the dead but it's 100% worth it, most of my hours elsewhere.
5142	1	a	Best Graphics ever. Possibly the greatest dinosaur shooter ever. - 1/10
5184	0	a	No wonder this game didn't cost more than a dollar.
528	1	a	Fantastic game that is overlooked by many. It's a simple game to play with responsive controls, quick combat and easy to grasp story. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I hope you do to.
5839	0	a	I deem this a fat L
5293	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
5180	1	a	My friend got picked up by a pterodactyl. Then the pterodactyl dropped him and he got headbutted by a triceratops. 11/10
1651	1	a	This is obviously the best game I've ever seen before. Too bad it was released right after Skyrim so nobody ever heard of it, or if they did the title was too generic sounding to remember. It's also too bad they went with EA as a publisher so it never recieved the attention it deserved. Now the MMORPG version they were working on is scrapped as the company went under. Such a shame.
5144	1	a	Bought a lightsaber went to play Star Was with dinosaur  Dinousaur didnt like Star Wars Killed dinousar 10/10 will fight over Star Wars again  P.S RIP Dinosaur 2015-2015
3306	1	a	Now Right Off The Bat This Game Is Realy Laggy And Bad Quality Do Not Waste Your Money...UNLESS You Want An Amazing Game That Is Amazingly Entertaining If You Can Look Around The Lag Bugs And Bad game Quality (Now I Know That Sounds Pretty Bad But Im Going To Finish What I was Saying Just Trust Me) Then You Get An Amazing Time With Your Friends So If You Can Do All That Get This Game...Its Worth 1 Dollar And Just Remember 'Games Cannot Fail Only Developers Can'
5989	1	a	Honestly, at first I thought this game might be total crap since I played the alpha and that blew. As I've spent the last few nights playing this game I've come to love it. Survival mode is where its at.
469	1	a	7 bucks for a much better, more beautiful, pleasing single player WoW with the combat never getting old somehow? thats this. definitley pick it up.
3991	1	a	I really like this game. It has dinozavers inside. I mean - dinozaveri. THE TRUE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE.   U kill the dinozaveri and u look like a cool robot. Robots will zavladeqt the world, if they are rabbits, ofc.   i recommend this game. PLAY IT, FEEL IT, DONT GET DED AND REKT !    With alll my love, PeikaPLS
2886	1	a	Its a nice little game that you can enjoy for a some time. especially with friends and stuff. it is a bit bad here and there but overall its a pretty good experience.
2563	1	a	one dollar is well fukken cheap for good game... but then THEY DISCOUNT IT INTO HALF.  I mean, even it's cheaper than I buy coffee without the cup and sugar!  10/10 good game, best price.  np: even now I feel guilty when buying this at halved price.
2343	1	a	It woths more than $9 but on sale with $0.49 tag. 100% WORTH. You don't need to spend much extra money , just head into a survival mode server and take out guns in the weaponary shop , bambambam , fun. It has potential to grow bigger.
60	1	a	The mix of poker and MTG is fun! Plus, I worked on this game!
1479	1	a	Superb chill-out RPG for the couch and a gamepad.
4402	0	a	needs to be optimized for amd graphic cards
4075	0	a	The metacritic might reflect a previous version, but it isn't that far off. Graphics are decent, flying around with a jetpack or the hoverbike is entertaining, but that's about where the good news dies off.  -Guns jerk around like the player is inside a paint mixer every time they pull the trigger. Using anything but a pistol is a waste against all but the largest of targets, sheerly because the odds of you hitting them while spazzing out is increased. -Tanks will get stuck or flip around if you get too close to anything. Anything. Even inside one, large mobs virtually one-shot you as they charge and gnash. The slam move they perform seems to have a 200 yard radius. Flying a heli late in the game is more about shooting down other flying enemies chasing you than helping your team directly with rockets. -Shooting lacks 'feeling' and there is a noticeable disconnect while firing. The enemies don't react to it, so combining those issues you more-or-less spam fire and wait until you see an enemy flop to the ground like a water balloon and aim at the next one.  -Guns sometimes don't even animate. You'll fire and see a flash but your avatar's hand doesn't jerk back, the gun remains frozen on screen. -Barring fliers and spitters, enemies cannot react to players on a cliff or anything other than a flat plane. Using a jetpack to reach something off the ground lets you fire at fish in a barrel as they pace around trying to find a way to reach you. -To limit this, flying mobs sometimes grab a player and lift them into the air. Shooting them drops you, which can easily be jetpack'd right back to where you were. Better yet, slowly strafe a foot left and right to avoid being picked up by them in the first place. -You can punt small enemies in the hoverbike, though speed doesn't seem to matter. Flying at max speed usually drops them, lightly tapping them usually punts them up or away a huge distance. My only guess is Aliens. -Did I mention this has an in-game cash shop, too? For only $50 you can get 75,000 coins to get skins, hats, and only the best priced bundles this side of Jurassic Park. -When you log in right now, you are promptly reminded that not only can you get this masterpiece on sale, but they also have a Kickstarter campaign starting in just over a day from right NOW! What are the odds of that? What luck!   End result: Thumbs emphatically -down-. If you like dinosaurs and cannot resist the urge, feel free to get it now while it is a dollar. Heck, get the four-pack so if any of your friends in the future, even long-term future, decide to want to get this, trade it to them for a TF2 hat or something. Spare them, anonymous review reader.   Spare them.
5597	1	a	It is a funny game to lose time, for him price is ok. 3&gt;
22	0	a	As a avid player of Match-3 games, and appreciator of the Puzzle Quest saga, I convinced myself to give Runespell: Overture a shot, intrigued by the fact you play with a standard deck of cards instead of coloured gems.  The first battles were interesting, the poker-like combos felt novel. Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.  Unfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).  From that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.  These kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game.   Maybe they lost faith in this game at some point. No wonder this happened to me too.
887	1	a	J I Z Z EVERYTIME pam/10 would c u m again
1364	1	a	fun game needs more hype
1062	1	a	For it being such a nice game, it loads incredibly fast! (About 2 second load screens on my pc.)
3850	1	a	Imagine if someone made a fantastic game that was a fusion of Jurassic Park, Halo, and Planetside 2.   This is not that game.  This will never be that game. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥. That being said, it's very fun with friends.
1097	1	a	Game Score 9/10 So much gameplay! So much fun! I play it with an Xbox 360 controller and it's just perfect. GET THIS GAME! Best Action RPG I've ever played!
6410	0	a	lol trust its not even worth the 0.79p. basicly a complete rip off of killing floor but sooo bad.
53	1	a	Combines a poker-style card game with Puzzle Quest battles. There's a quest, but you can skip all the dialogue and just get on with the game. It's not that challenging, but it's entertaining.
1556	1	a	it is a really fun game worth playing if you run out of bethesda's RPGs but after you beat main questline and are over level 40 it becomes near unplayable still a great game though try to buy when on sale I wouldn't bother full price, just not enough stuff to do some may disagree since it claims 200hour of gameplay but more like 45hours for me. 6/10
2122	1	a	Good game, worth 20 bucks without hesitation. Reminds me of the Fable franchise for the design and gameplay. Very fairy game tho, if you like dark fantasy this might not be for you
502	1	a	It's like a linear version of Elder Scrolls if you've ever played one of them. Fully voiced, lots of lore, decent story, quests occasionally have options to alter the outcome, graphics are crisp, animations are mostly clean, there's detail in level design, lootz, crafting (optional) and a 'double layered' level up system (able to tech into multiple trees and choose one passive perk). In a nutshell it's a dungeon crawler in 3rd person instead of top-down.  Perhaps my favorite part about Amalur aside from above is the feeling of not being tethered to the game in order to notice progression. I can play for just 15 minutes and actually accomplish something.  On a minor negative note, Amalur does not give the full freedom other games allow. The player can not jump and the player can not decide to step off a cliff on whim; there are set locations to allow dropping into water or down a cliff-side. Fortunately these limitations do not or hinder gameplay.  Combat is straight forward and fairly rewarding. Left click to continue swinging, instill a pause or hold the click to start a special attack. The player can also mix in magic or swap weapons on the fly to make some interesting combos and setups. Though combat may seem too basic the AI does its job in finding those holes in defenses and can manage to really take a chunk of health. While left clicking is easy, positioning amongst groups of enemies is where the player needs to maintain control even though the AI isn't the smartest.  I would recommend Amalur to anybody who likes leveling up and combining classes. The game actually feels like a dungeon crawler but from a behind the shoulder perspective.  I would also highly recommend downloading the YSA mod which balances the game to make Hard mode actually hard and Normal not such an cakewalk.  Additional Thought: It would be nice if Amalur was coop multiplayer though it does a great job as a singleplayer game. If War in the North mixed with Amalur...
253	1	a	It's big. Too big even. After about 40 hours of questing I got tired of doing practically the same quests over and over again. I even skipped through the conversations, and I normally read/listen all dialogues, mind you.   KoA is basically a MMO game in single-player form. Is it a bad game ? Not by any means. It's just that it loses focus about halfway through, giving you too many quests to deal with. This game can easily take 100+ hours to complete.  The active combat system works great; you're not just pushing buttons and waiting for your character to finish off an enemy. YOU do the actual combat. It's fresh until you have unlocked most of your skills though, then it can grow a bit stale.  My biggest gripe with the game was the inventory system, which was awkward to use. Having to pause, select a category and (un)equip items that way is cumbersome and frustrating. It's an area that could definitely use some work.  For an action RPG it's pretty cool, but don't expect another Skyrim.  [Rating: 84/100]
920	1	a	it was fun but i ended up not being bothered to keep going.
4964	1	a	Got this game i dont know why steam counts hours wrongly i've played it for 900hours its worth the price its loads of fun even though it has some glitches i bought this 4pack 30times to support the developers :)
5983	0	a	When the T-Rex roars your ears will bleed, no matter your sound settings.  12/10
2097	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a great RPG that satisfies with hours upon hours of playtime. Replayability is good but not so much necessary. The game is perfectly suited to match any playstyle. Want to be an assassin? No problem. Want to be a battlepriest? Sure, can do. Mix&amp;match your skills to make the most use of this great game with uncommon weapons and skills. The fighting still is enjoyable and the game works really well with the Steam Controller.   8/10  
369	1	a	As for KoA:Reckoning it is by no means a bad game. The game's problems lie in its large vision, where for various reasons was left only half fulfilled. It had the frameworks for a great game, but just that, the frameworks.  The mechanics were there, but as a new IP they shot big, aimed wide, but in the end it was all just superficial and lacked depth. There wasn't any wonder in exploration and the lack of trully likable/charming characters comes off as a sore point. Had it been an indie title it would have been best indie wRPG ever, but sadly it was marketed as a AAA game from the get-go and as-such was set to fail by the buisnessmen in suits who weren't brave enough to aim smaller.  Maybe if the development didn't start-stop so many times, if BigHugeGames didn't get passed between 3 different owners, and Ken Rolston (former Lead Designer of both Oblivion and Morrrowind) was able to complete his original vision we may have had one of the greatest wRPGs in recent memory... alas that is not the case and what we got was KoA:R. Not a bad game, but one that shows the makings of a trully great one but is never able to go all the way.
3508	1	a	This game is a awsome first person shooter with a great survival tatics. teamwork is one of the most importent thing in this game. Love it
2849	1	a	Fun game especially when you play with your friends . Lots of fun and laughs. Many interesting weapons and vehicles , although the mechanisms are pretty difficult. Nice graphics too. Definately worth my 0.39 euro.
2891	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is a wonderful 'MURDER EVERYTHING' game, with great graphics, gameplay, and content. It has a variety of weapons, vehicles, and gamemodes. You could be shooting dinosaurs with energy lasers, or alternatively shooting players with energy lasers. Now, for most of the review there'll be content on Dinosurvival. This is because it's the main point of Prelude, but there are other games too. CTF is almost never played. If you want to play CTF, you might want to go somewhere else. Not saying CTF is bad on Prelude, just that nobody ever opens a server for it. You'll usually find the official servers are all Dinosurvival, with a few unofficial ones sportying different gamemodes, such as Gun Game or Team Deathmatch. I, myself, have never played TDM or Gun Game on Prelude, prefering the Dinosaur Shooting Madness known as Dinosurvival, in which you murder dinosaurs with Gatling Guns, Flamethrowing Turrets, and Helicopters.  Most of the time, the players are nice, friendly, and concentrated on the game. But once in about every 50 games, you'll get someone who hoards all the good vehicles without doing anything to help murder all dinosaurs you see. It's also very good for a cheap game, coming in at a CS:GO case key for 4 copies. (Â£1.69) Think of how much more content you and your friends are getting for your money when you bought a 4-Pack of this game instead of a case key for CS:GO. TLDR: A MURDER EVERYTHING game with a good playerbase and populated servers but some servers overlook gamemodes that probably would be good. 9.8/10
175	1	a	one of the must unknow and underrated RPG games, i bought it for 360, LOVED it...was free on PS3...loved it more...saw it on PC with all DLCs...yes it is a must get. great story and great game play. just wish they would make a 2nd one but never will.
3923	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
1956	1	a	Hey.....hey...... ya like Spawn? What about Legend Of Drizzt's?  Well you might like this then.   First bought this game for my PS3 waaaaay back when. loved it! and well lost it. not the love, but the game...yea.  Anyway! This is a great game. all an all.   Graphics = Awesome Story = Awesome Gameplay = Awsome Camera = i hate it! ( Mainly when encountering more then one enemy)  I think the only other thing then that is the sprint buttuon is a bit too far away. But its not like you couldent fix that.  Other then that its great. dont have many complaints.   
2653	1	a	its not necessarily a good game by any means, but oh my god is it a good time. Its not one of those games thats so bad it's fun it just has a bit of charm to it. I do recommend this especially for only $0.99 
5781	1	a	It's gud
1760	1	a	This is the RPG you have been waiting for. Graphically similar to Fable, without the annoying Disney-esque character dialogue, deeper statistics and abilities, with exciting loot and crafting trees. If you like RPG's GET THIS GAME!
3231	1	a	Pretty good game Pros Weapons Difficulties Gamemodes Dinos Cons Bad graphics  8.3/10
343	1	a	Fun game that's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a good action RPG. The DLC is fun, though maybe a bit short if purchased at full price. The graphics (especially for an older game) and story are solid, though not as good as something like Witcher. One of the biggest things that I like about the game are that the combat, while not necessarily the most complex, is fun and customizable depending on your preferred style of play. The other biggest pro for me is the amount of character progression, in terms of the look of your character, the gear that you get, and the talents/abilities that unlock over time.
1086	0	a	It's fun for a while, but it gets powerfully repetitive. It just becomes the same thing over and over as the game goes on. It's pretty, but in an 'MMO' sort of way, where every model just comes in different colors, and divided up into zones with one or two distincitve features. It feels like a really well done single-player mod for an MMO. It's not bad, but I've tried four times to finish it, and I get bored every time.
6100	1	a	A T-Rex crushed me while I tried to punch it to death. 8/8 would lag again
2391	0	a	this game was a dollar and I still feel like it wasn't worth it  that's like an entire twix bar man
1567	1	a	This game has diverse and immersive landscapes, a creative assortment of factions, and a top notch combat system. I have been playing this game almost continuously since I've picked it up. There is a lot of character customization, a plethora of quests to do, and thus far I've thoroughly enjoyed the quests. The character speaking animations are sort of hit and miss, but that's the worst I can say about the game in my experiences thus far.
476	1	a	its like al the sord n magic game i ever play in one but rely gud and fun 2 play
2050	1	a	Reckoning is amazing game worth a play or two. The story is well put together and the voice acting is great imo. My only issue with the entire game is that the uniques are garbage and if you dont play on hard you will destroy the game. I have done 3 plays of this game on easy, normal, and hard with no deaths.
2198	1	a	This game is what you could call the 'definitive' version of Disciples 3. It takes a lot from the first two iteration of D3 and revamps it to make something that is actually enjoyable to play.  The biggest problem with original D3 is that it tried to be as close as possible to Disciples 2 in some parts and something completely different (mostly a HoMM clone) in others. The result was an inconsistent, bipolar mess that was neither a proper successor to D2 nor a good rival to Heroes franchise. Not to mention buggy.  D3:Reincarnation tries to reconcile the two dysfunctional aspects of the earlier D3 games, and, in my opinion, succeeds in doing so.  For those who never played Disciples 3 before: this is turn-based strategy game in the vein of Heroes of Might and Magic. You start with a capital city and a hero, and your job is to recruit an army, explore the map, gather resources, capture new cities, level up yourself and your army, and eventually defeat whatever is the boss of that map particular map.  What sets this game apart from HoMM, Eador and similar games is the fact that your 'army' consist of only a few characters (the actual number is determined by your hero's leadership skill, but caps at six), each of whom gains experience and levels up independently. For that reason it feels more like leading a party of characters in an RPG, than leading an army in a strategy game.  This impression is enforced even further by the inventory/equipment system for heroes.  Characters don't die permanently unless your entire army gets wiped and can be revived by potions, spells or by paying money in a controlled towns. After gaining three levels, a character 'upgrades' to a more powerful class, granted you built the appropriate building in your capital. Some characters have mutually exclusive upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your army composition to better suit your play style.  When playing single player campaign, your hero retains the levels and equipment from the previous map, but the army starts from square one.   This version of D3 includes 4 playable factions and a campaign for each of them. Campaign themselves were redesigned from the earlier versions and now include water traveling. Character stats were also changed substantially to better fit the new hex-based combat (earlier versions just took the stats system from D2 and tried to make it work in a completely new combat system, with not so stellar results).  Overall, this version of D3 takes all that was good in previous versions and reworks the rest. If you have an interest in this genre, and weren't irreversibly scarred by earlier D3 versions, you should find this to be a very enjoyable game. It may not be Disciples 2, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
2558	1	a	This is a great game, it's has alot of playibility due to workshop. Multiplayer is great and graphics are good
5044	0	a	I expected a lot after watching the trailer for this game, but they still havenÂ´t fixed a LOT of bugs, they shouldÂ´ve started development of this game from the bottom. There is missing full controller support and itÂ´s just not as good as I thought it would be.  4,5/10
1309	1	a	The game has a great storyline, a big world, and a lot of quests. Good combat, nice unique wapons and armor.
6241	1	a	this game is a great game and you should totally buy it
5170	1	a	its bad, you should try it
2054	1	a	The graphics, story and combat style is outstanding. Great game. I loved it so much that I had to buy all the DLC for this game.
6031	1	a	gotta pewpew those dinos
5988	1	a	This game is one of the best fps I've ever played, I've seen games worth way, way less then this and they cost about $30.00 to $60.00 and this is only $1.00
5310	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game!
1438	1	a	Good game! Mixture between Fable and Dragon Age: Origins.  Pretty epic ! Try it out !
6096	1	a	Good game to play with friends.
1237	1	a	with a fun and quiet friendly color palette this is a great way to kill a few days :)
5671	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ OUTTA THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND GET THE GAME!
4182	0	a	NO, this game sucks, look at the old players from 1 year ago have to pay 6euro, now just 1 dollar, just not worth it, this game's developer should do something about it, because just changing the price over night ain't change the fact 1 year ago it was 10 euro!  Edit and add: the game became positive for some reason let me see what people see in the pros?  Pros: Memeing every possible way of killing a t-rex Memeing every possible way of bugging out Memeing every possible way of the potential nazi t-rex invasion  Cons that i see for myself: -Sluggish animation that is even worse than Ride to hell -Guns work like free FPS browser game -Dinosaur bugging the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of u if u are in a vehicle  1st the Aligator will bug out in the water with the rest of the dinosaur if u are in a jeep that face backward to them at the begining of the round 2nd T-rex are sometimes invisible  3rd Flying dinosaurs are the worst thing to kill cause they â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bugging out at the top of the skybox 4th Helicopter is the worst maybe worse in some case as it cant shoot flying dinosaurs without flipping out 5th Tanks will fly  - Map design are too big , making an attempt for (open world) . And there is a mode called open world but it is just a bigger map with some random crate that have the same modes of other maps in various part of it
2972	1	a	I'm not sure why this game received such low reviews. I hear it used to be not the caliber it is, but I just played it for a solid hour and it was a blast. Seriously the most fun I've had in a long time. 8/10, would recommend.
1891	1	a	WHY THE F*** Arn't there any mods for this game?
5942	0	a	Watch as this review gets stolen and get put into the game.
3340	1	a	Just buy it.You won't regret it!
3054	1	a	Really fun, especially when played with friends
951	1	a	Not perfect, but does so many things right. Combat is the right mix of strategy, tactics, and button-mashing, tons of quests, huge bright vibrant world, nice character building system with unlimited (but not free) respecs. This is a really good RPG that breaks from the mold in a lot of ways. Can't believe I waited this long to try it.  My biggest complaint is that this game is too long. I'm about 100 hours in and have started skipping all side quests, running through zones ignoring enemies, and will probably skip one of the two large DLC's entirely, just because I have other games to play (and I know if I leave this for more than a week I may never actually finish it).
812	0	a	It's a fun game to start, but could be much shorter. So many of the quests are 'fetch 10 of this' or 'kill 10 of that'. It gets boring quickly. I feel as though they made a massive world, put the main story in, then realized it was still mostly empty.  I outleveled every zone quickly before finishing most of the faction and side quests, forcing me to increase the difficulty just for a sense of fun.   You can respec at any time, so there is no reason to play through more than once.  I haven't quite finished all the DLC, and I don't plan to do so.  It's a decent game and the world had potential, but I think it missed the mark. I'd recommend something else for your fantasy-rpg fix.

6271	1	a	Great game to play with friends, survival game against dinosaurs? what more could you want
1649	1	a	It's a mix of Fable 3, and Skyrim. I â¥ both of those games, and so far this is pretty fun.
2301	0	a	what is this the fourth time this game's been 'released' to wipe off all the negetive reviews? if stolen art assests and the fact your money is going to a scum bag don't bother you, give it a try the games alright for $1  some history if you're intrested.   http://www.gatheryourparty.com/2012/05/04/orion-employee-beatdown/   theres plenty more if you google a bit, these guys have a track record   
1679	1	a	ive been playing this game a big ive just scratched the surface of the game really so far im liking the mage skill the best lol i give it the highest raiting possable
281	1	a	If you like RPG's then this one is worth a look. When it comes on special, grab it and all the DLC's.  The good: Nice graphics. Large open world. Entertaining story lines across most quests. I enjoyed the combat system pairing both physical and magic attacks.  The bad: As the dev house ran out of money / time, some of the quests and cut scenes are buggy but this does not detract from the overall experience. The entertainment value outwieghed the few minor bugs. I did encounter one major bug that resulted in an incomplete quest. The quest dialog says that you should pick pocket one of the NPC's, which I did. However, the quest did not progress. I then discovered, in the quests menu, that you should kill the NPC and then recover the items.  All in all, a good game and worth it when it comes on special.
4389	0	a	Orion: Dino Hoard is an extremely bad game. I also think it's pretty cheesy. It's just a wave defense game featuring dinosaurs with bad servers and a dead community.  Bad gameplay, bad online multiplayer, bad story (it's non-existent), bad production value, bad developers, bad time.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  **Do not buy Orion: Dino Horde!!!!!**  And this ignoring the fiasco of how bad it was when it was Orion: Dino Beatdown and then having the developers change the name to get rid of the negative stigma (and reviews) surrounding the original game - this is a review of the current game on the market! It's terrible.  Don't take my word for it though:  Reviews:  Impulse Gamer - 4.5 / 10 - 'Dino Horde is not the improvement Dino Beatdown needed...it never feels like a finished product...this goes deeper than just a lack of polish...rudderless.'  NZ Gamer - 3.0 / 10 - 'Shoot in the back of the head and bury it. Awful. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Unplayable. Abomination. Broken.'  Gamespy - 1.5 / 5 - 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs in the same game? How could this possibly fail?...the same way as if Jurassic Park had used sockpuppets for the dinosaurs and someone had accidentally set fire to the final reel mid-way through the premiere.'  IGN - 2 / 10 - 'Painful. You probably deserve a beatdown if you waste your money on this disaster.'  I cannot recommend this game in any way, shape, or form - it's not even a worthwhile gag gift for a friend. Don't even buy it for your mortal enemies as the developers are shady. ORION Dino Horde is a stain on my Steam Library and if I could remove it I would. It is easily the worst game in recent memory that I've EVER played and I have no problem giving it an F
4819	1	a	its cooh 
536	1	a	I love the world in this game and the combat is loads of fun. I recommend checking it out when you get the chance.
6116	1	a	I bought this game for my friends and I as a joke yet it turned into most of our favorites. Great graphics, controls, and gameplay made this an amazing buy for a dollar. It's sad that there aren't that many players because this game deservers a lot more players than it haves.
1359	1	a	Ok. So this game has its issues, however who doesn't?  It has a nace graphical outlook and great large spaced environments, althout a little restricted on exploration compared to sandbox games. However it compensates this with a great and deeply thought out storry that just drags you in and before you know it, the strange names of people and places have become a second nature. Even the side quest, of whic there are plenty and in a way toooo much, feel as a part of the grand story arch. Mechanic wise it has an interesting battle system that allows you to make the aproach you want and the role/class is only restricted in words. On the more negative side, it is made too easy. Even the hardest difficulty is a slight challange. You are littery burried with loot, crafting matterials, etc. Leveling initially is way too fast and before you know it, you are overpowered for the area of which you have explored about 50% and done about the same amout of the quests.
5037	1	a	fun PURE FUN the objetive is survive dinos or fight in team death matchs super fun glitchy yet fun i have ther way to say it 7/10 somtimes youll get fusterrated but thats ok just keep killing enemys i recomend survivle for people that like fight a horde of what evers but you survive grab objectives and rune back or even drive back cant wait to play some more :D
6266	0	a	I bought this game when it was $0.99 and I want every cent back. It's borderline unplayable. I don't understand why this game has any positive reviews. I'm pretty sure my review will be deleted shortly. If you can see this, don't buy this unholy mess of a game.
5405	0	a	This game is a terrible joke.
4295	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs
2733	1	a	Get this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you pass it up. I'm not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kidding get it.
5518	0	a	fun cool game. but my computer wont run it so i have to give it a thumbs down
1485	1	a	I've played this game on 360 and I have to say, I absolutely loved it. The graphics are gorgeous and the game play is -very- user friendly. It's got a great storyline, customizable features, enough looting for any avid gamer and the armor upgrades make me drool. When I saw Reckoning was on steam (and on sale), I knew I had to have it!
5847	0	a	These graphics are so garbage that it isn't even worth 1 mere cent. Let alone one dollar. 2012 game my â¥â¥â¥.
6026	0	a	While there is nothing actually wrong with this game, there is just no reason why I would want to play it over left 4 dead, killing floor, or TF2's MVM. It's OK but if you're in the mood for horde killing there are better games out there.
1269	1	a	This game is filled with exciting missions and combat and is sure to entertain one such as myself for many an hour!
6173	1	a	awesome game for 1 dollar. Why is this game 1 dollar? not because its crap but because the devs are crazy. be warned though if your using a basic work PC this games not for you.  8.5/10
1443	1	a	For those who try to compare it to Skyrim.....don't. If you can do that, you will probably enjoy playing this game. And for those that say it's a bad port.....it's not. I played with and keyboard and with a controller.....it plays better on the keyboard. They've create a nice fantasy world.......Give it a try.
4298	1	a	More fun than porridge. Also dinosaurs.
5343	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ old dino shooter. cheap but gets boring quick
5939	0	a	id never though i'd see am fps lower than batman
4381	0	a	Avoid this game. Broken beyond repair and it's just no fun this way. Had some hopes for this game as a fun survivor shooter, but broken mechanics, overwhelming amount of bugs make this game unplayable
1517	1	a	One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. If you like games like Skyrim then this is definitely worth the $.
155	1	a	This is a really well-done game.   I never got into Oblivion or Skyrim, because they were just too big and chaotic for me. I happily sank 100 hours into this game because the leveling and quest systems are very intuitive. The graphics are pretty (like a very nice World of Warcraft) and the story was intriguing enough.   The combat was the best part, though. I never felt like I was flailing around, I felt like something of a beast all the way from level 1.
5051	1	a	:)
833	0	a	I'd give this game a 6 out of 10, don't pick it up unless you can get it at a deep discount. A poor man's Skyrim, where the terrain is full of invisible walls. I thought having RA Salvator's name attached to it would guarrantee a dessent story line. I was proven wrong, game plays like an MMO or old school RPG. None of the quests seem to have any baring on the story line, and even though you become head of the society of mages or a king, you are still treated as a serf. Gameplay is enjoyable, I played as a mage and once you had meteor the combat became monotonous.
3109	1	a	I've had this game for a while and I don't see how it got better... At all... I read reviews that hype it up and saying it got better since it changed its name to Prelude, and I see no change... I only recommend this game because I do still like it, I liked it before and like it now, but I was expecting that it did get better lol.
5822	0	a	I never really liked ORION but now that the devs are trying to rally people against Activision for taking down their game when they stole assets makes me actively hate it. Do bot give these awful devs your time or your money.
3363	1	a	Gets more updates then Day Z Standalone.
6106	1	a	Best $1 I've ever spent! Good graphics, good co op, a lot of game modes and maps... and a fantastic price
5341	0	a	This game has a potentially fun concept, but confusing graphics, awkward maps, stuttering dinos, and a host of other issues leave much to be desired. Perhaps future updates will change this review, but as of now, I can think of way better ways to spend time shooting stuff.
5850	0	a	The only game I know where you can lose connection to the host while soloing.
4686	0	a	the graffic's ar HORRIBLE AND TO MUCH LAG
6127	0	a	by far the worst halo simulator ive ever seen. i mean my god! it violated me. it lured me inside with the promise of eye candy, why, just why!  (only took a few minutes to realise it was just awful)
1141	1	a	One of the best games I have invested in. 11/10 :D
1835	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of my favourite RPGs of the last few years. It has everything what a good and solid role-play-game needs: Interesting and complex story, nice graphics and there's even a housing system! It is definitely worth its price - buy it, play it, keep it and play it again.
6275	0	a	Microtransactions and a pricetag, it's fun, but not my cup of tea.
3734	1	a	This game is the reason Ebola struck back. Let me explain:  Ebola was having a nice day on Steam playing a bit of DayZ. He went onto the store page and there it was, for the 7th time that month - Orion: Prelude was on sale for dirt again. Ebola wept for humanity as he clicked the 'purchase' button and supplied Gabe with a 79p donut.   Ebola joined a game with his friend Aids and started playing this badly ported Xbox original indie game. Ebola said 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥' , went out of his mudhut and infected the West Africans.  The end.   INCASE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, THIS GAME SUCKS.
6359	1	a	A surprisingly fun title with more than what you bargained for.
5325	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
1994	1	a	Awesome quick successive AI, gameplay &amp; creatively designed environment. Story is a bit lack on depth.
710	1	a	It is a world like no other, where you can lose your way but find your destiny. As rivals face off, kingdoms will rage war. Paths will be chosen, new fates will rise. Choose your destiny.
40	0	a	The old iPhone game  Sword &amp; Poker 2  (NOT the awful freemium remake!) does everything right that Runespell does wrong.  In S&amp;P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun. In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.  In S&amp;P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker. In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)  In S&amp;P2, the story is 'Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again' In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.  In S&amp;P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do  well  - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle. In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.
5179	1	a	Halo + COD + Destiny + Battlefield + Dino Day = Orion: Prelude  This game is AWESOME and I'm wondering why is so cheap?
5807	1	a	I just got this game and I like it ALOT.   The main goal is to keep your generator on as long as possable. I WOULD RECOMEND Pros:  Easy to learn Can play with friends Basic yet hard Cheap but worth it  Cons:  Low Graghics The Dinos that fly are to hard to kill for the lower levels It will lag when turning to fast. The Dinos movment is not realistic  
6269	1	a	Great game, love the multiplayer mode. You can enjoy it for hours at once.
1724	1	a	Why cann't I stop playing this game? I mean, the graphics are not amazing - and the game play is rather simplistic - and the quests are average though vastly numerous - and the mobs are standard - so if all of these items are 'average' why can't I put this game down?   For the 5 dollar price - I feel like I helped bankrupt Studio 38.  
2675	0	a	This game just sucks, its the kind of game that a 10 yo would play, if he didnt have any other thing to play with.
5815	0	a	Why support lazy developers who have show a penchant for stifling user criticism...  Spend the .99 on a McDonald's coffee and enjoy it.
78	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Puzzle Quest but the computer cheats significantly less. Pretty fun little time killer, a cool take on RPG battles, but luck is a pretty heavy component so be prepared to lose because there are no card to chain sometimes. If you can get it for cheap then why not, it's more engaging than Solitaire for christ sakes.
750	1	a	Much recommended
3697	1	a	It has potential.  First Game - My ping was way too high, I couldn't communicate with my teammate, nor hit a computer controlled dinosaur. (I disconnected) Second Game - I hosted it myself, FPS was SO bad, said game in question isn't even close to being optimized for any gaming computer known to man. I lower all my settings which did nothing, so I decided I need to restart the game for this to take effect. (I disconnected) Third Game - I join another matchmaking game in progress, my FPS is fine with the graphics settings all at plebian tier levels, ping is fine, I have no clue what I am doing, the game is telling me to go from this point to that point. YELLING out commands. Host has left the server. (I am forced to disconnect) (I exit the game in disgust) 
2138	1	a	Pros Gorgeous, colorful art direction Almost an entirly original setting. Smooth God of War-esque combat Enough lore to do an Elder Scrolls title pround Tons of content. With DLC you can easily pull 100+ hours if you take your time and do everything Great crafting system that lets you tune your gear to your needs  Cons Too easy. Even on hard the enemies will easily fall to a well built character Crafting system makes unique and set items worthless 38 Studios financially mismanaged itself into oblivion  KoA:R is by no means a ground braking title. However it is a very polished and well put together title that any RPG fan should check out. Sadly this will probably be the only title we see in this setting. Hopefully someone like Obsidian or Bethesda will get their hands on the IP and turn out another title.
5991	1	a	Fun with friends
464	1	a	I cannot rate this game high enough; totally overshadowed by Skyrim, this is a piece of roleplaying mastery. Not only is it visually stunning, the story is epic and draws you in to shaping the fate of an entire world - you feel like you make a difference! The combat is absolutely amazing, and really excels when using a gamepad; it's fluid and massively customisable - changing weapons and moves on the fly to produce dynamically open combos. One of my favourites of all time!
1283	1	a	Game is fun if you like a hack and slash. Somewhat repetative but enjoyable. Lots of quests and will take a while to finish.
348	1	a	Excellent game. Severely underrated. Good storyline, large world and lots to do.
2016	1	a	I originally played this on the xbox when it came out, was a fun game, have moved to PC, and its still just as fun. IMO its a mix of fable and skyrim, leaning towards fable. With bright colors and details worked into every facet of the game its a fun time waster.
953	1	a	Story is ok. Items and fighting styles are ok. Graphics are descent and fluid. Overall its a bit generic as far as an rpg's go, but its still worth playing. Don't expect a whole lot of original concepts and you'll probably enjoy it.
2086	1	a	I got this game as part of the Steam Summer Sale. I don't get to play my games all that often, but I do not regret picking up this title. It's a little wonky at first due to the lack of PC optimization with the controls, but once you get used to the weird quirks of having to use the keyboard to go through menus, it's a great game to play. The story is pretty well fleshed out as far as I can tell, the world looks fantastic, albeit a little cartoony, and the fact that you can re-spec your character for a different playstyle without having to start a new game is really nice. The crafting system is quite nice, it's simple to use, and stays relevant from early-mid game all the way to late game. Combat can be a bit clicky/spammy, but with different combos and skill moves, you can fight however you want.  tl;dr  A fun game that has some quirks, plays slightly like an MMO, and has a lot of depth and customizability. Totally worth buying.
6051	0	a	I thought 'What the hell its 50 cents I can probably get an hour of fun out of it.' Boy was I wrong. I think that I'd get more enjoyment out of a 50 cent piece of bubble gum from the grocery store. It's that staggeringly bad. I decided to do a little research and found out that this game changes its name whenever reviews get bad.. Also, the only reason that it is as highly voted as it is is due to the fact that the developers spam the steam reviews with bots. Man this is just a pathetic excuse for a game. I don't even know where to start; so I won't... just trust me, you don't want this piece of sh*t anywhere near your computer. Go buy a piece of freaking bubble gum.
4379	0	a	Awful game, waste of 99p
1620	1	a	Really enjoyed this game and the expansions.. Wish someone would take over and start the next one / more expansions. Only issue I ever had was with my assasin-ish char. Went to dead-kel and got the cave bug. No biggie just re-roll. Love the replay ability as well.
988	1	a	Highly recommended, hours of fun guaranteed. +++
4812	0	a	Literally only 10 people are allways online
3074	1	a	Love this game!
5633	0	a	Things I didnt like about the game:  Played for the trading cards, which are dirt poor in value. No anime No anime â¥â¥â¥â¥ No anime butts No anime   -Gibus Sniper
1944	1	a	Great game intense battles!
1265	1	a	This game is very good. Graphics are amazing and runs very smooth. Music is so-so. I liked the every dialogue is fully voiced. Plot is quite interesting. Game works great with x360 gamepad. It's nice you can have 2 weapons equipped and reset your skill trees. The best in this game is combat. I liked the reckoning mode with cool violent finishers that gives an exp bonus. 
6163	0	a	A nice concept, but fails on execution. So-so graphics, unbalanced gameplay, nothing to help you learn the game, empty servers and super repetitive music. Feels more like an alpha or beta rather than a finished game.
5047	1	a	Trash publishers; good game though
3095	1	a	Best $0.99 I've spent on Steam 10/10 would quickscope a T-Rex again
612	1	a	A highly underrated game, in my opinion. I honestly wish I could find more RPGs like this one.
1169	1	a	This is what happens when fable, god of war, and wow have a child.
4166	0	a	I tried playing this game, but not even the slightest indication of how to play or what you are doing is given. 0 out of 5 stars.
2819	0	a	From a 100% honest reviewer:  Hi guys, this game wasn't too bad! The graphics were definately a bit underwhelming, especially the way the dinosaurs moved. However the gameplay was fun and easy to learn. I picked up pretty quickly and was able to play some fun rounds. However, it was slightly repetitve, and for me, it didn't really have any replay value. I wouldn't really play this game a lot.
6349	0	a	The graphics are out dated, most of the servers don't work. Lack of support for new players make the game unbalanced. Don't waste your money
4961	0	a	black screen at launch:(
3799	1	a	L4D2 meets Borderlands... but with Dinosaurs. 10/10.  Also, Santa is a total Jackass in this game.
3737	1	a	The Customer base is relativly small, but this game has come leaps and bounds from when it was released. It is a satisfying experience upgradding your favorite class and taking down a T-Rex 1 on 1 or maybe even a spinosaurusl. So give it a chance and you wont be disappointed.
1514	1	a	It's a good game. It has it's faults such as glitches and the graphics, but on the other hand the combat system is awesome, between the ability to choose how you play in fights to reckoning mode it's too much fun. Overall it's a imperfect game that's still fun if you want to have some fun combate and a rather interesting world.
6093	1	a	good game dino killing fun with head blasting hilarousnes trex and pterdactyle probobly the harder ones but thats whats good it adds variety and challenge thats whats good but its got its bads like a glitch where i hit a rock flying my jetpack i got downed and i fell into there and for about a minute i was coming back down and i already before i hit the grownd but thats me its really good try it
4785	0	a	Even free it's not worth it. Don't waste your time.
6339	1	a	Game is a lot of fun, but the only problem I had seem to have was that there was lag when having a second player join. It wasn't impossible to play, but it was a mild annoyance.
596	1	a	AMAZING Action RPG. Combat is satisfying, story is interesting and everything is far as heck away from everything else.  Don't get me wrong, i love this game. BUT everything is a LONG hike away. There are also only certain points you can use to drop from higher levels to lower ones (AND NOT BACK UP). Everything feels unnecesarilly far away, so be prepared to stare at scenery bc you'll be doing lots of it. STILL worth playing the fun parts though!
3342	1	a	Got a giant Mech to ride on top of a helicopter, 10/10.
2926	1	a	s'alright.
2838	1	a	IS GUT GUT GAIM YIS
5796	0	a	Do you like to be; disappointed by a game?,thinking it was something like ARK?,then finding out it sucks balls?  THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU
6250	1	a	Pretty fun for cheap
5481	0	a	Its cool if you have so much lag and cant tell whats going on and just laught with your friends but when the lag is gone...
5767	0	a	I purchased this and was gifted ORION project and at first thought Activisions DMCA takedown was unfair, since then I understand that the asset theft is fairly clear and this is the shadiest â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game developer I've seen, the game has been renamed multiple times to avoid negative reviews on steam (Previously ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde) as well as a complete rename of the developer and publisher in an attempt to avoid other DMCA takedowns, do not buy any ORION game, it really isn't worth supporting
1133	1	a	This game is like the Fable series but without the fart jokes and done right. Also, it is now property of Rhode Island due to some wacked-out legal battle nonsense, so that's weird.
1142	1	a	It's like a MMO without the thing that makes a lot of MMOs horrible to play, the people.  They took one bit of dialogue from Terminator 2 and made a whole game based on that.  10/10 would run around as Commander Shepard again.
3536	1	a	So I had no idea about this game just that someone called it Killing Floor with Dinosaurs in past. Got surprised by it's low Meta score so went on YT to check review of Cynical Brit which was full of rage and hate. Followed by this I went ingame to actually try the game ready to experience utter garbage product but...  .. after understanding beginner's confusement (mechanics, level system, classes, perks and weapons) the game actually became a fun o.0  It IS Killing Floor with dinosaurs.. and vehicles (Woo). There is more modes (including one where you play as Dinosaurs against players) but the most common is Survival -&gt; 10 waves of defending, where every 3 waves you need to go to secure the outer outpost for better vehicles/choppers, healing/reviving team mates and repairing vehicles while being swarmed by tons of meat-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Simply if you have so low expectation of this game it can surprise you (hopefully) + only for 2,7 Euros.. bah.
2017	1	a	I offer a tepid recommendation for this game. Pros: fun combat, involved crafting systems, epic OP meteor spell, beautiful environments Cons: awkward menus, cruddy inventory, questbreaking bugs, relatively shallow Mixed: lots of forgettable sidequests, several underwhelming guild questlines, stilted boss battles  The main quest is long and will take you across the world, which is disturbingly MMOish in it's linear zone-y design. The world and it's lore is present and interesting - if not the pinnacle of originality. Most of the DLC is pretty good and adds some new little areas. The weapon and armor bundle is garbage though, it adds a chest in the first town with several sets of magic armor and weapons that you will replace almost instantly with better equipment - which is a shame as the items do look much cooler than other early game equipment.  I don't think it's a gem as many people claim, but it does have some good fun gameplay. Building up a character and exploring the world is actually quite fun. But the experience gets bogged down with some poor design decisions as well as a few limitations which make it feel like a stunted port that didn't take full advantage of pc capabilities and controls.
262	1	a	This game certainly is one of the best RPGs i know.   The world to explorer is huge. There are a lot of nice quests with long stories. Combat is better then in most other RPGs (not for the camera zoom..) A high difference of weapons and attacks  The only thing I'm still missing in this game is the option for multiplayer :(
6216	1	a	It is what it says it is; You, Bullets, Robots, Dinos
1294	1	a	What a great game! It may have its flaws, but what an well done main quest and fantastic characters. Pity is would have been a fantastic 40 hour game, the last couple of areas really dragged the entire thing down. Think of this game as a single player MMO.
4770	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphics and Textures and Really boring
5208	1	a	bought it at full price GIVE ME SPECIAL STUFF
1291	1	a	I know this is an older game but I just wanted to let everyone know who may not have the pleasant expirience of playing this game yet that it is AMAZING. They did exactly what every single player rpg should do. They have a MASSIVE story line that does manage to keep you interested in it if you dont mind some reading. They have a great leveling system thats comparitive to other major titles. They also did great with the overall feel of the game whether its fighting one of the many different enimies in the game or trading with merchants or even the side quest usually nobody cares about they managed to keep things clean and fun. There are A LARGE amount of different weapons you can choose from depending on whivh suits your fighting style better not to mention the custom weapons you can create. I would really recommend this game to anyone even though its 'an older game' it still has things that rpg's just seem to be a bit lackluster with, Try it out I promise you wont regret this gem.
23	1	a	Really cool game.
1408	1	a	Plays like a single-player MMO. There's frankly a lot one could complain about - but the game itself is pretty solid. Sure, the story is forgettable, but the combat is fun and very involved. When I was playing it, I couldn't help but compare it to Torchlight 2 - both are action RPGs with cartoonish graphics and engaging tactical combat. Compared to Torchlight, your hero is a lot more customizable - the ability trees in this game (and destinies) are pretty neat and provide a variety of colourful ways to beat generic monsters up without locking you into following the same specialization/class. Not a whole lot of depth beyond that.  Probably worth it if there's a steam sale going, definitely not worth 20 bux. Maybe if they bundled all the DLCs together...
1239	1	a	a great game. It stole my life, but I don't want it back.
1579	1	a	I bought this by recomendation from another player. It has been an exciting purchase. RPG, FPS all in one. Who could ask for more?
6368	1	a	I don't own this game so I am giving it a thumbs up for letting me review it without having bought it.
111	1	a	A very underated RPG that is often forgotton about with one of the best combat systems in any fantasy RPG,while not a true open world it is still extremely expansive with loads of content and a must play for fans of Fantasy RPGs.
1148	1	a	Slightly repetitive, but the game is polished and rewarding enough to keep you playing. Interesting lore helps build the atmosphere, along with a nice soundtrack and art direction. Voiced dialog is well done, and there are always topics to ask about for more information, or personal perspectives. Player character's not voiced, though. Skill trees are modest but they can be combined for specialized play styles.   Worth a look if you're itching for an action-RPG fix.
2559	1	a	It cost me less than two dollars. And I can shoot dinosaurs.
3446	1	a	A good survival game featuring defending a base against a wave of dinosaurs, capturing outposts, using vehicles to explore, buy different guns and much more. There are many different game modes to play and many different maps, my favorites are the conquest ones.  The graphics are good and the game runs smooth. The Level system looks pretty cool where you edit your loadouts but I'm not sure on how it works yet so I can't really review that.  All you need to know is you can shoot dinosaurs in the face...  7/10
5972	1	a	Dinosaurs. Lightsabers. Cheap. Fun. What more could you ask for?
5317	1	a	10/10 like work  thanks :yay: good! all Rush buy  all -off summer sale
3862	1	a	its like call of duty if you replace the word call with dinosaur the word of with killing and duty with simulator. 10/10 IGN
3631	1	a	One time I was killin a trex and then out came a mother flippin jet and I was like ahhhhh yeah.
1710	1	a	The game has great gameplay mechanics and it's alot of fun to play. Cool fantasy/magic/goblins story.  One of those games you can play for 100+ hours. I played it on PS3 when it came out and loved it. I'm starting it back up but this time on PC. After a couple of hours on PC I think I prefer the keyboard/mouse play. You have better control of the camera and your character.  Purchase it if you like action games, fhantasy themes, and games that you can put lots of hours into.
864	0	a	Good game,   but need keyboard+mouse or 360 pad instead of a third party controller like x360ce.

4104	1	a	Technically terrible. Could get you some fun if you can get over that.
3242	1	a	9/10 would be 10/10 if it was called orion dino beatdown again
1130	1	a	Very nice combination of action and RPG forms gameplay that you should try and master all skills and special moves. This is NOT 'just another RPG'. I put it on the same shelf with WOW and Skyrim.
5155	1	a	Halo 2 meets dinosaur survival.  One of the trailers quotes this game is a mix of Halo, Jurassic Park, and Killing floor, Id say thats spot on. I think this is the most fun game Ive played in a while. I reccomend everybody play this game for a few hours. Its just pure joy, and its not to intensive. Im playing on a laptop and it still runs very smoothly.  10/10 play this game
2127	1	a	This game is great for those who have enjoyed fable, there is a lot of content in the game and it will keep you entertained for a long time, but there is too much boring diolog.
4034	0	a	Unless you are mentally ill, and or a masochist, who like to torture yourself, I cannot recommend this game. Its just a reskin of the older game, Orion: Dino Horde, still has the same bugs, broken mechanics and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ balance.
304	1	a	I feel this game is under rated. I actually enjoy it much more than Dragon Age or Skyrim. The others I didn't get nearly as engrossed in as I did KoAR.
5333	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
1678	1	a	Great game
4861	1	a	ITS AWESOME YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT 
251	1	a	Fable III and Skyrim, Watch out! This game combines detailed graphics with superb combat. There are many upgrades to choose from, and all the weapons you could dream of. Dont listen to people saying This game is horrible im gonna return it, because its not. Very sad and in a way wrong for the maker of this great game to go bankrupt. The best feautre in this game is to build of 'fate' to Slow-mo assasinate enimies. recommend this game to everyone! Happy Playings!
3395	1	a	Who doesn't love blowing up dino brains with their friends? 10/10 hands down one the best co-op games ever!
4808	1	a	I love this game, mostly because it's simply dinosaurs and futuristic guns/stuff. Also, I recommend the prelude to ITSELF, Guardians of Orion. 10/10.
2100	1	a	the game play in not complex but the story and art is amazing. the design is very fantisy(colorful and detailed) not like Skyrim (i'm not saying that skyrim isn't amazing). when attacking you aren't so much building your character in the sense of stats as you are building his/her fighting combos.
5513	1	a	Its free weekend and I think im gonna buy it. Surely its not that much of a good game but its not bad either, especially for only 1â¬. For just 1â¬ im fine with what the game offers me and I really like the effects of the maps. However, im not that much of a multiplayer person so I stay with bots until friends (that I dont have) want to play it with me so I dont think I will enjoy this game much for long but anyway I am satisfied for 1â¬. Only think I dislike are the balance issues. Gunship costs 40k and is not as good as I expected it to be. I think I can take down Dinos faster with my sniper than with the gunship. Maybe more players have to enter it, I dont know but whenever I tried to swap the 'seat' it did not worked so I guess it only has 1 spot and is in comparison rather weak. I only found that one aircraft as well sadly...I would really like it if there would be more vehicles or aircrafts but what to expect, its 1â¬ and what the game currently offers is really fine for 1â¬. +
1350	1	a	This is a good game to try at least one time in a life.   Cool scenario, cool design and great costumasation of your caracters.  :) Great deal when in special.
553	1	a	This game needed more knowing that it got. Its a sad story what happened the the game devolpers...  This game is creative, and has combat that feels good.   If you like fantasy RPGs, try it. Seriously.  10/10
274	1	a	An enjoyable A-RPG. It's not the best, has a few quirks here and there, but for the price you can fetch it for, it's definitely worth it.
4268	1	a	Best piece of plagarised content you'll ever regret spending 50 cents on!
1834	1	a	If you like TESV this is an amazing game. Very much lkes Skyrim but more steamlined combat....
563	1	a	Since I am bored at work And I'm tired of viewing screenshots from my friends, I decided to just review pretty much all the games I own ;D Yes... I am that bored...  Alright then, Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning is an RPG single player only, while you play you will get the feeling that since the world is so expansive, filled with life and Npc's it should have had an online mode or it should have been a FREE Online game.  To Describe this game in few words they would be: Immersive World, Quests, Magic, Fate, Medieval Style, Monsters and Hitting deers into space.  Ok, with that being sed you can picture what the game is like!  Let's start with the story, I was hyped about this game I remember seeing the trailers, how it had a guy who worked on the story of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, so the game showed great promise.  The game starts with the Story of the World, what's going on and HOW YOU DIED in the War the people of Amalur fought. You wake up in a pile of decaying corpses and make your way up from underground to the Tower, you then realize that the tower is under attack by the Tuatha Dehon ( The bad guys) who are immortal. As you go along you discover that you were revived by the well of souls and hence forth you are sent from quest to quest to find out what's going on.  The story telling in this game is average, the story itself is also average but the best by far in this game is the Combat System, fighting multiple units at once, with a fast paced system ranging from Bow, Hammer, Sword, Great Swords, Wands and the longer Wands XD. One of the best features in this game is The Fate power you get early on, which allows you to slow down Time and beat the crap out of your enemies and finish them off with an Epic and Awesome animations.  Since you died and were revived, you can now change your fate and that of those around you. Example: By killing the Monster X they will not have the children X they were supposed to have. That enables to player to change the world around him.  The Side quests are repetitive and meh, The Devs sed that to complete the game fully it would take about 300 hours. I object to that! I am 50 something hours in and and I have done every boring and repetitive side quest there is to do, and I'm almost done with it. :)  There are also interesting and vast Faction Quest Lines with alternate endings but in the End they just get repetitive as the side quests do. I get the feeling that this game could have been more than what it was, too bad the company went broke from debt but there is still hope for the KOA Trade mark!!   Also a pretty huge part in this game is that, IT IS TOO EASY!! you'll realize this like 2-3 hours in, you destroy everything in your way pretty much without dying. I can even challenge myself into Not even dying once while playing through this entire game. Thanks to the modding community there is a mod out there that makes the game harder to beat.  You can also craft armor, The skill system is quite vast, and there should have been Mounts in this game, I got tired of walking after a while.  And there you have it, my review for Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning if you are a person that loves RPG like I do you'll get over the fact that it's single player online and immerse yourself in the mythos like I did. 
5580	0	a	Can I have my money back?
351	1	a	 Here's the tl;dr at the top of the post: Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is absolutely worth your time.   Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG created by the unfortunately defunct 38 Strudios. After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a  lot  of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that  feel  like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.    Let's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:   - Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.   This bullet is not exaggerating with the 'hundreds of hours' bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.  One of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.    Okay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:   - Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.   Kingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.  If you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.    Lots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:   - Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.   - Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.   The combat system is a hybrid of  God Of War  and the  Fable  series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.  Combat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say 'softly' is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.  Spells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.  The 'Fateshift' mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!    Alright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:   - Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.   - Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.   When it comes to character classes, there are three main choices:  Might  (Warrior),  Finesse  (Rogue), and  Sorcery  (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.  Also, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.    There you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters. Good luck in Amalur!   http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1403.msg22646#msg22646 
3088	1	a	When dinosuars existed they shot guns at them just like this.
3378	1	a	This game proves why critic scores are pretty much useless for judging the value of a game. Play as dino or man, hunter or hunter. Eat or shoot your prey. Drive your friends off a cliff. Eat raptors for health.   Buy this and play it with your mates. Solo is fun but co-op is insanely fun.
3373	1	a	Despite being pretty unpolished and seems like it was made by a band of chimps; it's still very fun.
3548	0	a	Eh you have to have a really good powerful PC to play this game and this game is terrible.
3431	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rad. you get to BE dinosaurs!!1 and then you get to KILL dinosaurs!!!1 how sick is that?! direct ripoff of halo by the way.
3735	1	a	this game is so cool i love it 
4966	0	a	For 99p this game is well... it's 99p so it's not a waste of money.  But for anything more then Â£2.99 let alone it's original Â£11.99 price tag.  --Cons -Bad graphics -Terrible game machinics -SUPER repetitive -Simply the fact that it's normal price is Â£11.99 is stupid in all -SUPER loud sounds for no reason -Nothing is explained and nothing seems to works correctly -No good sounds for guns or hit markers sounds -Not satisfying in anyway to actually shoot the dino's -Terrible model detail -Lacks FOV slider from what i could see -Buggy (Terrible dino clipping and pretty unbalanced and random)  -Pro's It really was only 99p on SALE. It had good game option
3670	1	a	Very few developers keep in mind what makes games fun but these folks are on the right track. Yeah, sure there are things needing improvement here and there but overall this game is F-U-N. It's old skool, it's ridiculous and cool at the same time. I've paid 60 bucks for games not even nearly as fun as this. My gaming buds and I find this title very pleasing to play and doesn't look half bad either :)
813	0	a	15 hours into the game and I encountered a bug which makes it impossible for me to progress further into the game. Apparently I have to restart to get it to work.  No thank you.
2980	1	a	For $1 you would be insane not to enjoy this. After playing it, I would say it even deserves its $15 price tag. But they cant get my money back NO SIR E  But seriously, just try it with a friend. Multiplayer is a must.
3529	1	a	Rather fun game when you play this game with friends plus it was only 1 dollar yeah.
827	0	a	Early doors yet but this is trying to be Skyrim but Skyrim on drugs. Sadly the drugs have given you a bad trip and everything is so scary and disjointed.
844	1	a	This is an amazing game. It is too bad the company went under. I am super happy to finally see a sale for this game!
1424	1	a	I've been playing this game like an hour, can't believe this game is awesome! Although many of them of is running.
5640	0	a	I promoted this developer and their games for quite a while, including buying several copies for friends. In light of their years of employee abuse and stolen assets, coupled with their playing the victim card each time, I can no longer recommend this company or their games. Considering how much information is available, and not knowing what sources you personally trust, I recommend googling 'ORION stolen assets' or 'ORION employee abuse' and deciding for yourself which side you believe.
187	1	a	This game is a hidden gem! Got this game during a weekend sale and boy was i amazed!  Great gameplay, beautiful visuals, huge number of quests, nice dialogs, it gives you a feeling of progression as you keep discovering new upgrades for your weapons/armors. The world map is absolutely huge (skyrim style), each area has it's own specific mobs. At the moment i'm writing this i have around 35 hours of gameplay and i'm not even in half of the game with over 100quests finished, and around 100 more started. This game is a must play for any RPG fan, and you might find it even better than Skyrim. For sure i do.
2502	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was ninety nine cents.
4726	0	a	Very confusing for someone who rarely games, and even my brother who games a lot said it was very confusing. In at least the demo there were absolutely no instructions at all on how to play/what the controls are. I had to search a bit online for some help, even then I didn't figure out all the controls(I just started pressing random buttons to see what happened). Glad I didn't buy this game to be honest.
2253	0	a	I like the old disciples better. Game pace has became is too slow for my taste &amp; high level mobs in the first level, really?
3687	0	a	A game of the year contender for 1492. A great pile of dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game. I love the lag and how poorly optimized this is. I got for the price of free. My 'special' friend gave it to me. The multiplayer is just as great* i was a laggy T-Rex munching on wannabe Spartans from Halo. Of course the object of this game is to survive the world's laggiest envirments and cute Dino puppys. Overall this game is the aborted child of Jurassic Park and Halo. Its a gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 jk i h8 this game and id rather masturb8 to german dungeon porn. A book of the year and a gr8 contender for the Grammys. In the end this game gets 0/0 would not rate again.   * Great=Bad Kids if you buy this game full price play russian roulete with a RPG. I am not liable for any injuries from activities i have suggested in this review.
2020	1	a	This game is simply a must-have for the RPG fan. I don't normally get addicted to video games (I even stopped playing Arkham City after 10 hours) but I sank 40 hours into this game and played it through to the end without getting bored. That's saying something.  The combat is fun and interesting with some neat timing mechanics that subtract from atypical dodging without subtracting from the challenge. There are tons of quests to do in a huge, lush world. You can say that Elder Scrolls games are bigger, but Amalur has much more detail. There's also tons of quests to do, whether side or faction, and with fast traveling you'll chew through them quickly. Fortunately, the sheer number of them will keep you occupied for some time.  The graphics in Amalur are gorgeous. Not because it uses the latest and greatest tech (although it might have for 2012, who knows), but because the art direction and detail are not lacking at all. There's no such thing as a dull environment and there are loot caches and reagents scattered everywhere.  If there's anything to complain about, it's that the XBox One controller isn't compatible (sure it works but it causes massive frame drops for some unknown reason) and the camera isn't perfect, but in this genre it's really hard to get the camera right and at least it functions well enough here.  The music and dialogue are just okay, nothing really stands out, but at least it doesn't detract from the experience. And I never gave two hoots about the story and lore.  Bottom line: Amalur is a fast-paced adventure RPG with gorgeous graphics and fun combat. You can't do much better than that and it appeals to a wide variety of gamers. It also goes on sale about once a quarter, so look out for that.  Check out my full review here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI7qw0EVQA0 
1849	1	a	Fantastic game i only wish there was a sequal, Always in my thoughts 38 Studios you guys could have been big and a major competitor to Bethesda game studios. Anyway back to the game beautiful cartoony graphics but not too cartoony,tons of side quests,fantastic gameplay, but what shines the most about this game is the combat its awesome especialy when you enter reckoning mode.You can also choose any race you can think of do you want to be a rougesage a battlemage battlerouge you can and lets not forget the huge open world its simply beautiful. Final thoughts this game is confident flashy and beautiful pick this game up if you want a solid alternative to TES4 Oblivion, great game solid 10/10 from me.
673	1	a	This seems not to be your typical hack &amp; slash, i very much like the senerie (graphics). It is definatly giving my fingers a work out trying to remember the key map but i find it very fun.

5452	0	a	Being a dinosuar in this game is cancer... I couldnt even damage the enemy. Mega thumbs down from smeagol.
4685	0	a	It's alright for like 20 minutes at a time but gets boring pretty quick and it's hard to look past the gleaming flaws to actually enjoy it. Needs lots of work.   The price of a game is irrelevant, the fact that it's less than $1 doesn't excuse a broken game, too many lazy devs these days seem to think so though.
4167	1	a	Decent game, good with friends
1848	1	a	Not as pretty as Skyim - But still pretty LOL Just as immersive but with better combat moves (Than Skyrim) Lore is very extensive as well  An absolute steal at the price  Suitable for Skyrim junkies like me -har
2997	1	a	This game can't be compared to Dino Beatdown. Yes! It's created by the same developer, but once you play ORION: Dino Horde you'll get to see that Spiral Game Studios really took the negative reviews directly to the chin and practiced what the community demanded from Dino Beatdown - Put that into consideration. Also people that purchased Dino Beatdown received this game for free.  More and more free content has been added to this game, so it's pretty clear that Spiral Game Studios is working on it.  So how's this game? Well first off you need some people you can rely on playing with, I mean proper teammates. They should be able to revive you when you're incapacitated. Since there are big dinosaurs you'll trying to avoid them with your jetpack and you'll freak out for a moment since you don't know whether the Spinosaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex can reach you or not when you're in the air!  If Spiral Game Studio is reading this - Please consider supporting Steam Workshop!  Peace.
4817	1	a	A friend gifted this game to me. Though I'm not a big fan of these types of games (in fact, I suck at most shooting games), I decided to give it a try. At first I wasn't expecting much from a game that was a buck, but boy did we have a blast.There's a ton of crazy shenanigans you can pull off. Sure, the game has its own share of flaws, but the point of a game is to have fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more T-Rexs to clobber.
5723	1	a	It is awsome when you play with friends
3277	1	a	Absolute bute game.Ever since the major update buying a 4 pack for $2.99 was a complete steal
5305	1	a	really fun free game. i enjoy just slaughtering all those helpless dinosaurs. enjoyed this game over full priced games.
2646	0	a	Whats orion mean?!
1961	1	a	underrated rpg that is worth trying. give it atleast some hours
466	1	a	Tons of fun!   Great main story and includes many fun side stories. The combat is very enjoyable, and has satisfying finishing moves.   Also included is plenty of customization options to define your character, race, gender, and fine tuned featurs.  The classes include your standard, rogue, warrior and mage, each with different moves and skills. Notefully, you can change your class at any time within the game.  This game pairs well with an Xbox 360 controller   
1723	1	a	Great Game
5237	1	a	Savage Dino and Reptile killing simulator 2016    Best game..
4748	1	a	I have this game from 2013. This is my review. -2 million copies sold becouse game is good and only cost 0.79â¬ (for me idk for dollars) -good snipers -while being downed don't need player to get you up.just kill dinosaur! :D -skins for pistol? i perfer golden one. :D or magma -Customizing charachter and showing middle finger as taunt :D -Can be Fps and third person -i didn't play 2 weeks game and i accidently got 12k. Was that helpful to buy game? Maybe
6387	1	a	this game is hard to get .-.
4165	0	a	Probably one of the worst games ever made.
3507	1	a	Honestly, This game is actually kinda ok. People put down you pitchforks! Almost reminds me of killing floor in terms of gameplay (of course jetpacks now included) and a lot of fun can be had from this game, just not shinny sparkly graphics fun and can be repettitive at times. But seriously, this game is basicaly F2P now with its new price and the updates have seroiusly boosted my score of the game, For the price of a Yourkie at a corner shop, at least try this beacuse you kinda-maybe-hopefully wont regret it...maybe.
890	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has the same pitfalls as most modern day RPGs. There is a massive player world with dozens and dozens of side quests, but the immersion factor is sorely missing. I ended up with the same problem I had when I played most of the Elder Scrolls series. My character became too powerful from pursuing all of the side quests, and nothing in the game was a challenge anymore. Add to that the fact that I reached a roadblock in the main quest which involved a dungeon that took more than five minutes to walk back through because of a missing item that I could not find, and there was not enough enjoyment here to keep me happy. The game seems more like work than play. It was very unenjoyable.   I put in over 40 hours, and I am done. I think my save is bugged, and I'm not willing to start over. Suffice it to say that I won't be completing this one. I can't recommend it for the same reasons that I can't recommend any of the Elder Scrolls games. It's too ambitious with no grounding. The story isn't interesting, and the levelling is lacks excitement. I give this one about a 3 on a 10 scale.
4485	1	a	Good, but a bit hard.
3693	1	a	This game has some serious future. Only read new reviews, old ones are from the Beatdown period.  Ingame purchases aren't needed because you can get as much points just by playing.  Graphics are amazing, and if you put low-number-of-bugs besides, this is a hell of a game.  9/10, would recommend to everyone.
1369	1	a	The best game ever that failed due to consultant greed,(skyrim developer) It's just the soundover for the elves should of been done by English actors in English not English actors putting on a fake Irish accent. Like we do when we are taking the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the Irish.
2319	1	a	Long story short ORION: Prelude (Competitive PvP) was the original game announced in 2010, a spiritual successor to the ORION: Source Beta. It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel).   With the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles). Comparison:  Original Prelude / Modern Prelude 3 Modes / 15 Modes 5 Dinosaurs / 10 Dinosaurs (All Playable) 30 Weapons&amp;Gear / 50 Weapons&amp;Gear 5 Multiplayer Maps / 20+ Multiplayer Maps &amp; SDK  It is now called ORION: Prelude because it *finally* is ORION: Prelude.

2209	1	a	Being a huge fan of Disciples 1 and 2, I tried the demo of Disciples 3: Ressurection and hated it... When I saw that they went back and made the Reincarnation version I thought that I would try it... I must say that I truly enjoy this version (despite the awkward map scrolling and camera rotation)... In Reincarnation are many of the things that I felt could have improved Disciples 2 and I am happy that the spirit of Reincarnation carries the franchise forward in such a beautifully crafted manner... The sheer beauty of this game coupled with challenging gameplay should please any true fan of turnbased strategy RPGs and I am hopeful that someone will work to make this version modable in the near future... I will admirably give this game an 8 out of 10 score...
4495	0	a	paid 99 cent... then it was free :(
3429	1	a	This game is quite good. I know that it got downvotet into oblivion by IGN and CO but this game is not quite good. Give it a try, you won't be dissaponted
3487	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
4208	0	a	Since it got free to play for a few days I decided to give it a go. I'm not a real fan of shooter games but if they're interesting I play them. From the videos I thought I should give it a go.   After installing the game started and I was scurrying trough the options (I always do). Out of the blue I got my first achievement, yay! Anyways, after that I decide to 'Play Game' apparently you first have to FIND a game so I did that. However the room list doesn't update and it takes forever if you make one by yourself (because it doesn't update for anyone)...   So I went solo. I don't like solo. But hey I tried! Apparently the goal is to steal eggs and drop them off somewhere, while you keep shooting like a madman on the dinos. However the game wasn't very smooth for me so aiming was not an option, and you can't shoot while carrying eggs. I tried many, many times to do this game and when I finally put down the T-Rex, IT RESPAWNED. Yay! So you can't even really finish this game anyways because you get â¥â¥â¥-raped the whole time -.-  Sorry to say but, personally I absolutely hated it.
4900	1	a	This is a great shoot the dinos game and a lot of fun :)
2693	1	a	Best transformation of a game I've ever seen. It was, honestly, very buggy and broken when it was first released. Since then there was a massive overhaul and more (content) updates than any AAA game ever had. The devs didn't charge any money for any new content they released while the in-game content increased by extreme amounts. It is a really enjoyable and good game now and will get another big update (for free of course).  http://spiralgamestudios.com/post/77018495383/a-prelude-within-coming-2014  It's definitely worth the money and because of the current sale you can even get it for only 1â¬
6324	1	a	earrape dinos and halo 10/10
271	1	a	 Great Game,Its like Fable Mixed with a MMORPG and maybe a little Elder Scrolls

MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU! :)ï»¿' - KALIA CIRELLE JOHNSON   iz gud gam
3808	1	a	Its still after all this drama a good game!
2562	1	a	Soooooooooo This game finished downloading; so I decided to sit down and play it at (around) 12:15 AM Eastern time. When I look around or just stand still the screen tears and graphical errors seem to occur. Combine this sleeping and tired eyes and you can either   A. Get yourself a headache B. Go Blind C. Get an EXTREME seziure  Or the common effect D. All of the above!  4.5/5
204	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I spent 200 hours playing it on X360 when it released. I plan on 100% this game again, and it is still fun in a second playthrough.
6347	0	a	I am just dissapointed with Overkill. This is game is just bad. I loved the days of Dino Horde, but prelude is virtual trash. You downgraded us! Orion: Dino Horde was worth $15! Prelude isn't even worth $1. Also, I had 2 copies of Orion: Dino Horde in my inventory, and when it updated us to Prelude, they dissapeared. A sad, sad dissapointment.
2112	1	a	This game is awesome.I used to play it on PS3 but when I purchased my computer it was one of the first I bought to play all over again.It wasn't a success when it first came out and not many copies sold and the company was disatisfatied but this game worths both my money and my time.
982	1	a	Love this game! can play it over again and enjoy it as much as the first time. Enjoyed the story the characters, the variety of weapons are fun. Everything in the game is beautiful, i havnt tried playing with the keyboard and mouse but it works perfectly with the xbox controller.   The only thing i found annoying at times is the angle of which you play at. I feel as though it should have been more zoomed out. Sometimes whilst fighting multiple enemies i couldnt see the ones behind me. Oh and the ending of the story, not sure if i was expecting better that made it seem bad or because i was quessing the story line when it came close to the end.   But i still love it!!!
5546	0	a	This is my first review ever. It's unfortunate it has to be a negative one. I installed this game when it was still 15$... Played it.... enjoyed it... 1 year later or so i reinstall it (today) and it wont run. Very upsetting seeing as how it is 79 cents now.. Dont feel like i am getting my moneys worth.  
5390	0	a	Less fun than drowning.
3797	1	a	hey look this game is awesome man i really think this game is worth 15 dollars man
3142	1	a	Shootin dinos is fun. Nuff said.
3738	1	a	It is fun :)
6126	1	a	Excellent game would definetly recommend. Vehicles, Purchase system, Jetpack, Dinosaurs, Co-operative play, and a great price of Â£0.79.
1581	1	a	Great game if you like a game that crashes constantly. Ive put in a lot of hours but be warned this game doesnt work well with all kinds of computers.
1860	1	a	A really good game, with a somewhat similar feeling to Fable 1. Features a simple but very nice character creation (Gender and race options included), with a levelling system which relies on skills rather than raw stat numbers, and allows you to go with the three regular play styles (Warrior, Rogue, Mage), mixing them up or just focusing on what you want.  Only downside is the game requires an EA account.
3874	1	a	Dis game? Best 0,99â¬ I've spent, EVER. That hooker I bought to give me a rimjob last week? Comes nothing near to the satisfaction I get from this game. This isn't what you would expect form a 0,99â¬ game.   10/10, would fly around on a helicopter with a MECH again.
4444	0	a	The only game I ever regretted buying for 99 cents.
4243	1	a	The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥, the mechanics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. they only good thing about it is the hour i spent laughing at how â¥â¥â¥â¥ it is
4898	1	a	its trash 
3300	1	a	For a 1.09, You need to own this game. The gameplay is addictive and fast paced, and Big ups to the Dev's for not giving up!
4090	1	a	+1
2514	1	a	Dinosaur shapes , chef boyardee ~ DINOSAURS! ~
2899	1	a	I have been playing this game for a couple of hours now and I've got to say, this is probably one of the best dinosaur survival games that I have ever seen! The gameplay is so smooth and the graphics are amazing! The action in this game is unreal and you're always up to the task of finishing the objective. The only thing that bugs me are the pterodactyl's, they're always flying at you picking off your health, but the only way to stop them is with a shotgun! I recommend this game for everyone to play if you like a dinosaur survival, open-world, action, and multiplayer/solo experience!
2520	1	a	I played this game a little while ago and it wasn't terrible but it had things in the game that just were not done well. But now it seems the Developers actually saw this and unlike other game devs they actually fixed â¥â¥â¥â¥. NIce job
2587	1	a	There's dinosaurs?! That was scary as all hell!
1843	1	a	Huge, rich open-world RPG whose aesthetic masks nuanced storytelling.  Pros: Deep, original world Great suplots/faction quests Flexible leveling options  Cons: Disconnect between R.A. Salvatore's writing and art design Loot system Overabundance of 'meh' quests  It's a shame that 38 Studios fell to pieces, as this IP could have taken off with tighter direction. The setting is much more fresh than it appears at first blush, and the world is littered with great moments and locations, with a few quest series that on their own would have made for the entirety of lesser action-RPGs (House of Ballads, I'm looking at you). The leveling system is more robust than seems typical of the genre, and it isn't difficult to reset and reallocate skills as equipment and playstyle preferences shift.  The biggest problem for me was also a completely subjective one: that the art style didn't fit the content--it was way too colorful for how often the writing explored gray areas. I could understand if this was intentional, but it sometimes felt like watching Papa Smurf support relative morality. The more objective issues were the annoying loot system (they had to give away good stuff at the start of the game via DLC to make up for it) and the massive volume of filler quests. In theory, these solutions should work: (1) don't micromanage your gear; (2) ignore inconvenient side quests. Of course, I can't quite get the knack of either of them.  Overall, the game is a steal in terms of $/hr. It's like going to an estate sale and buying a plaid recliner for peanuts to fix up, and then finding out it's got a built-in massager no one noticed till they tried to lift it to your car.
6010	0	a	fun, but could be alot better
3736	1	a	This game gets a lot of bad reviews that are very true but what did they think the game was gunna be? its about Storm Troopers killing T-rex's and it cost way too much but if you by it on sale and want a fun lan party game its very good becuase of how bad it is like a lot of old movies. Artemis the space ship simulator game is a amazing lan game that i would recommend before this and is worth the large price tag but is as of now not avalible through steam. 
1562	1	a	I bought this game and all of the DLC today for $12... Couldn't be happier, it's got a skyrim feel to it, but feels more compact (less running around aimlessly). I've already logged 6 hours and will be logging plenty more in the future. I would/ and have already recommended it. Well worth the $12, and if you're thinking of buying it when it's back to full price ($40) still worth it, I paid $60 for skyrim and although I don't know yet if this game would be worth a full $60 I do believe it's worth $40! The combat is super cool and it just feels like there's so many fun different quests.

3258	1	a	as good as my last joint
5817	0	a	I made the mistake of purchasing this game when it was first released and before I knew about the stolen assets. This game has been released multiple times in order to wipe out all of the massively negative reviews in the past.  This developer steals content from other games and then tries to play the victim when legal action is taken against them.  Don't support â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ business practices.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q77rg/psa_the_developers_behind_the_orion_project_have/ 
850	0	a	This game works about as well as one would expect from a developer that released the game then promptly went out of business. 
298	1	a	Picked this game up when it came out on the 360 back in 2012 and loved it from the moment it started. Now that I have moved on from the dieing console world and back to my PC roots this was a MUST for repurchasing. With a team made up of R.A. Salvatore, Todd McFarlane and Ken Rolston you get a world that is insanely vibrant that has depth and a fantastic story to take you through it all.    Bottom line is buy this game!  
5724	1	a	Enourmous mouth wide open, slobbering, as much as it roars, arcs downwards towards you at lightning speed, and yet in a painfully slow motion form of your worst nightmare ! The only thing bigger than those horrible blobs of bloody slobber burtsing on your face like perverse water balloons out of a killer clowns darkets fantasy, are those TEETH, those razor sharp 75MM talons lining that whole huge terrible mouth ! BUT YOUR IN COMPLETE CONTROL BUDDY... YES SIREE ! You have the power here, and the choice is all yours !!! You can stand still, and be SLAM SWALLOWED RIGHT DOWN THAT BLOODY THROAT into a waiting vat of a delightfully strong solution of sulfuric acid, amound the other assorted gastric juices of the day, or for the more or less resilient amound you out there, you can move left or right a little tiny bit, before the inevitable snapping shut of those guillotine like teeth and jaws, and win the DAILY DOUBLE !!! YES SIREE, for no extra cost you will be treated to a two part journey, just as GOD parted the seas for Moses, those jaws will divide your mortal coil into two (2) somewhat equal parts, each of which is gauranteed to experience the same fun filled journey to exactly the same destination, that everyone else in your squadron just opted into...
1102	1	a	Great game!

3264	1	a	Surprisingly fun game for next to nothing
3677	1	a	Simply Outstanding, the game co-produced by Peter Jackson really emits a sense of feeling and character to the player. The narrative is excellent, one in which all games should follow. The scenes have so much depth to them and when jimmie was molested by a pterodactyle i may of even shed a tear. The attachments that you grow with the players is like no other game i've ever experienced. The title of this game is extremly misleading, i thought it was going to be a wrestling game but i found out it was no other than a RSPCA animal saving simulator. The crew is incharge of rescueing the remaining dinosaurs of southern uzbekistan. One of the standout scenes of this game was when the raptor had recieved a splinter in his foot. You could see that the team were really doing their job, helping out with the local wildlife. Not only is this game compelling in both its narrative and its gameplay it also manages to be one of the must humour-filled experiences of my life. I couldnt help emitting into a cacophony of laughter clawing my eyes out in hysterics, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ uncontrollably. There was even one stage when me and my friends where laughing so hard we liquified and proceeded to melt into a puddle together amongst feces, urine and blood. Samuel L Blackson also makes a cameo aswell as amanda todd, trying to join the crew. I still cant believe this was only 10 dollars, aswell as the extremly raving metascore it recieved. This is definataly my GOTY for 2012, and i have already logged over 2,300 hours. This game has shifted me as a person into a new form, and provided me with enjoyment of monumental levels. Im very grateful that the developers removed dino pubes in patch 3 or this game wouldnt be as enjoyable. With a trilogy in the makes and a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, aswell as its extraordinarily amazing soundtrack produced in studio by mozart and beethoven and snoop dogg (snoop lion). Aswell it is now sponsored by burger king, with their new Onion-Rings-In-Oil-Now item and Mountain dew's patented Dino Dew. This Is As Good As It Gets. 100/100
3766	1	a	This game has improved a lot. Honestly, it's worth the $15. I have played it at a friends house quite a lot, and on my own PC here. I stopped playing when ti first came out, because to be honest, it sucked.  It doesn't suck now. It is suprisingly fun.   I think if you're on the fence because of the old reviews, you should go to youtube and find some newer gameplay, or ask some people here about the state it is currently in. I reccomend it.
1487	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a game the like of which we don't see often. With more lore, backstory, quests and tales than we have seen today. If you are an RPG fan, who doesn't want to finish a game after 4 hours, forget COD or BF. Kindoms of Amalur is your game to play! This is what a game is supposed to look like.
838	0	a	Very Bad Game!   Gameplay repetitive, story very bad, ONLY WORTH BUYING IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY OTHERS RPGs TO PLAY
6149	1	a	I saw this game when it was brand new, Orion: Dino Beatdown. It was cheap and the videos and pictures I saw made the game look like one of those b-rate jewels that was so bad, it was good. By bad, I do not mean that it's a horrible game, broken and unplayable. Rather, 'bad' in a way that one would eat nutritionally void foods because they are 'good'. If you want arcade type fun and mindlessly wasting hoards of dinosaurs, then this is the game for you. It's best played with a group of friends on voice chat so you can losely communicate tactics as what to do and laugh your â¥â¥â¥ off at how awesomely 'bad' this game is. Lots of connection issues, my ping is always through the roof (400+) Changing maps kicks you. Best to host a game yourself.  Breakdown: Graphics 7/10 Story 6/10 Gameplay 6/10 Reliability 5/10 Fun 9/10  Overview: Fun dinosaur shootem-up that is best played with friends and a couple drinks!
3648	1	a	literally the best game of all time  â¥â¥â¥â¥ dilos tho  11/10 buy now
5743	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS.  Or play the free week.  Then you'll know not to play it.
3169	1	a	I felt like Boba Fett, but except for rebel scum, I was killing dino scum 10/10
3816	0	a	How the heck did you mess up a game about Dinosaurs and Jet Packs?! Between the horrid control scheme, barren environments, and things don't even make sense, this game is horrid. Not worth a dollar.
855	1	a	All in all an underrated game. On the plus side:  - a very complex game world with a huge main quest and many, many side quests  - the writing is above mainstream  - a fluid, flexible combat system,  - a complex crafting system - an interesting skill tree which allows you to tailor your char to your wishes  - some good voice acting (the female lead character for example)  On the other hand it has some flaws: - the itemization is strange, probably you will find the best weapon or armor after 2/3 of the game and very mediocre gear after boss fights rather late down the story line.  - the crafting system is something for people who like spreadsheets - if you are doing most of the side quests you will be very overpowered after about 1/3 of the game and combat will become boring (for me as a wizard) - game controls: the game wants to be played with a controller, (well, you can do it with the keyboard, but it feels strange) - graphics shows the limits of the playstation 3 generation   All in all if you are into RPG with action then you should give this game a try! Certainly one of the better ones (metacritic of 81 seems about right to me)
1152	1	a	I like this game for its game play. There is a richness in the depth, both linial and lateral, of terrain and buildings. There are the usual class of characters that you would find in a RPG. That is a bonus if you want to learn the basics of the roles before stepping up to harder RPG's. In saying that I found it difficult to follow my character in battle when the camera is hidden behind bushes/rocka etc. I would highly recomend this game to anyone.
6024	1	a	This game is like Killing Floor,but for autistic halo spartans with the aim control of a stormtrooper.   Its like bad,but not the good type of bad  Its like Halo,but not Halo  Its like Dota 2,but without the Dota and the 2  Its like Call of Duty,but more teamwork  Its like watching cartoons,but all of it is Hebrew dubbed  Imagine a world,where anything you do makes u go into The Matrix  Think of a really good cupcake,then later during the digestive process it gives u AIDS  Think of a newborn,cute baby girl,and it dies when it sees your face  Imagine if a Holocaust documentary,was funny as all hell  And last,think about moshing at a Wiggles Concert  Its that hardcore...... 9 chopped of Dino-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ outa/10
1643	1	a	beautiful game but a bit easy on finding good armour and weapons
4756	0	a	it sucks  
2957	1	a	Game sorts problems out for you: 10 year old kid was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around not doing anything and spamming down the mic so a Pterodactyl swooped down, grabbed him and flew off with him into the sunset whilst he was screaming down the mic for us to get him down. 10/10 would watch 10 year old be abducted by prehistoric bird/dinosaur again.

3908	0	a	Very basic shooter, I got... Well 0.3 hrs in according to the game timer. And the game client crashed. And I've seen more than enough. This is another game I suppose could be fun in a lan party or something like that... but it might be worth the 99 cents they're asking for it while it's on sale this week... If you're bored....
5087	1	a	THIS IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME ON SURFACE OF EARTH 
3308	1	a	I paid $.99 for this game and look how many hours I have on record. Need I say more?
6046	1	a	The game is bland, and not too interesting, though it has nice graphics. Would I recommend it to people? Well, it's cheap! Especially if you get it on sale. At the time of this writing, it was only 49 cents. That's less that the cost of a candy bar...Yea, it's worth that! Regular price? I wouldn't bother with it.
6138	1	a	My first play on orion prelude: &gt;enter the game &gt;take a weapon &gt;be taken by a pterodactyl &gt;dies 10/10 would fly with pterodactyl express again.
5004	1	a	Were the devs on an acid trip when making this game? 10/10 would have a good time with my best friends again.
1887	1	a	An excellent game, kind of a fusion between Fable and Skyrim. The world itself is massive, and there's a nonlinear progression built into everything, from questing to character build.  Only issue seems to be a relatively low level cap, I've only cleared about a quarter of the game world and I'm about 10 levels from max.
3468	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing and the fact that they are letting you buy it for 99 cents right now is an unheard of deal in itself for a game that is this much fun. Definite must have and it's the only one type of game that you can kill waves of dinosaurs for hours on end.
4681	1	a	The best 79 cents I've ever spent.
4455	0	a	I paid for this game and now it is free to play !! WTF ?   Game is not that bad btw...
2120	1	a	Great game if you get into it :) if you spend some time into the game you will get used to the camera (whitch is pretty close for my comfort) but once you put time into the game it will get a great one! ;)
586	1	a	MMO fantasy experience for people that have no friends.
1248	1	a	i dunno, but i think i should buy skyrim :(  *edit June 2015 Well, i'm trying to re play it again. Afterall, not soo bad.
3310	1	a	Dion is a motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥.
314	1	a	This is actually a really fun game with engaging combat, tons of stuff to do, and a lot of replayability. Its a shame the studio went under.
6280	1	a	Good for the first 3 hours, gets old though, repetitive gameplay. Just my opinion
5955	0	a	I payed $1 for this game then it became free
1245	1	a	I say this game is great, took me awhile to beat but still great. Some bugs like some annoying bugs, but not game breaking. The DLCs are worth it except the items, not worth getting they suck. 8/10 for items stuck in my inventory forever bug.
3825	1	a	This game is awesome! It's just $1, but this game is just a gift! Anyway it's cool! Buy it now!  EPIC GAME!
2702	1	a	I haven't had this much fun eating someone as a giant monster, since the original Natural Selection's Onos.
4579	0	a	WORST GAME IN THE WORLD IT SUCKS DONT WASTE A DOLLAR ITS A STUPID GAME
2987	1	a	Fun with friends, but not that great of a game overall. graphics are old and bad, game is poorly optimized, but the gunplay is fun. Unless you havve a fairly large group of friends with Orion, I do not reccomend.
4	1	a	The core combat of making poker hands to fight enemies is pretty fun. The game is very shallow and has a very lackluster story with choices that impact absolutely nothing.  Get it on a sale or from a bundle.
5332	1	a	uhh i got this for free but now it's gone why?
2772	1	a	This game is amazing, the guns are great and it's so many choices, they have tanks and flying stuff D: AND Its the best multiplayer game i've ever played
5189	0	a	I read some reviews of this game and heard it was really bad, so of course I bought a 4-pack to play it with some friends and laugh at the badness of it. I wish I didn't waste â¬ 2.24 on it, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrendous, don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, it's not worth it even with the 51% discount right now.
1960	1	a	The game has a very good story. The combat system is also quite good it is fun to play troughout the whole game. However, there is the constant risk to overpower your character. Even on the hardest diffivulty level it becomes quite easy to play. Nevertheless, with a mod this negative site can be minimized. Fruthermore, the graphic is nice and the atmosphere of the game is good. I would recommed to play this game.
51	1	a	Surprisingly addictive; like Puzzle Quest, but with poker
2982	1	a	Great game!
4649	0	a	No thanks.
2543	1	a	For a dollar, this was one of the craziest and most enjoyable games I've purchased. The fast-paced hordes of velociraptors, pterodactyls, and eventual T-rex is absolutely amazing with 4 of your friends, if not complete strangers. Not to mention the insane abailities and vehicles, like jetpacks and health stealing, or tanks and mech suits.   Buy this game for a buck, and kill dinos without giving a ****.
3867	1	a	Knife OP! Dinosaur stabbing simulator!   IGN: 11/10 worth the price.
5175	1	a	Very good action-fps game, with motion blur and all that â¥â¥â¥â¥'s.
398	1	a	This is a great RPG. A huge world, great items, and cool art.
6146	1	a	Well, I got to play this game for free on a weekend deal before the update... it was less than mediocre. But now after the patching and stuff i'd say it is fairly decent.     7/10
917	0	a	It was too late for a refund when I realized it's a repetitive game with no detail work at all. It's very casual if you ask me(no one asks me but you know). There are much better games of this genre, I suggest you stay away from this one.
5712	0	a	This game costs real money...
2493	1	a	this game is sp00ky, 10/10 would bang
1797	1	a	really fun game, lots of differnt choices to make with talents
3280	1	a	This game is not the best, not the worst, it may look like an unfinished game, but actually good enough for the price, the metascore is being unfair.  I did not played hardcore enough to make a perfect review, so go check other reviews.  This review is actually neutral, but steam doesn't have that option
2226	1	a	I just want to play this with someone :kattyface:
1000	1	a	SMMORPGBNRAMMOGBISSPATBOTA: Singleplayer massively multiplayer online role playing game but not really a massivly multiplayer online game because it says singleplayer at the beginning of this acronymn. But seriously I played just the campagin with no side quests and my total play time so far clocks out at 27 hours. I played this in offline mode though so it dosent show up in the review.
4491	0	a	Orion : Prelude is a step back from Orion Dino Horde. More lag, crappy gameplay made for controllers and a ingame cash shop ...... blargh!
1349	1	a	I had this titile in my library for a long time and finally got around to trying it out. This game is FANTASTIC! The combat system takes a little getting used to and I'm still trying to get acclimated, but I am thoroughly impressed. The story is engaging. The graphics look great maxed out on my gtx 970.  How did this game manage to fly under the radar for so long?  I recommend rpg fans give it a look
3273	1	a	I love it. Sadly we have to have a kickstarter for the Open World versioin and Im broke &gt;.&gt;
4039	0	a	when i seen partial controller support i didnt think it was this bad... there isnt even a button for E so i have to put down my controller as a dinosour throws me through the air and get glitched into a wall. lol im getting off topic anyways when in wepons and adjustments menu i have to go to my mouse... the assignments of the buttons are so bad that some of the same buttons do differnt things   W8 M8. 'August 10 F2P Is Live! ORION: Prelude is Free-2-Play!  Dinosaurs, Jetpacks &amp; Mechs  PvP, Co-Op,&amp; Dueling' they been had all of this
4356	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
3140	1	a	It's cheap, decent and almost always on sale. If you've got a dollor to spare have fun.
4642	0	a	crappy graphics not very fun to play. this game is hard to use and the gameplay trailers have probably 10x the amount of graphics than the actual game on ultra
4631	0	a	i cant even launch game it constantly crashes what do I do?
2682	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
2206	0	a	Don't buy this,  They promised to fix the original and make the story and gameplay better. They didn't, the story is now very weak, and the gameplay is wonky. you now need to level up 3 times before a unite goes to the next stage, the avarage length of a campaign mission is roughly 900 turns now.  then there are the things that made the original so broken (the crashing, the freezing, the savegames dissapearing) Those are still there. all in all they Broke what didn't need to be fixed, and they didn't fix what was broken.  GG DIII, GG...
5099	0	a	Very buggy, alot of glitches, fun for 10 mins... 
5479	0	a	Game has great potential but it's spoiled by the mass amounts of lag and uncomfortable experience.
869	0	a	Sorry, but I can not reccomend this. While it has potentaial, ultimately it was too much like on offline MMO, just tons of fetch quests. Also there are TONS of bugs that will never get fixed since the studio went bankrupy.
2293	0	a	 TREK Industries:  Hi, Activision!  Activision:  What's up TREK?  TREK Industries:  Can I use your assets?  Activision:  NO!  TREK Industries: Well....I will use them anyway!  Activision:  Come back here!   TREK Industries:  HELP! Activision maliciously attacks Indie Dev!!!   For the record Activision is trash, but David Prassel is a blatant liar and a thief.

2805	1	a	This game is great fun, I dont think it gets as much appreciation or attention as it probably should.
42	0	a	This game gave me AIDS,Herpes,Hepatitis,Cancer,Syphilis,Erectile Dysfunction and Tourettes. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game and it's preferred soft drink brand, I would rather have sex with the letter 69 then play another second of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing abysmal game. 10/10
6013	1	a	TEAMATE DOWN AREHREWBHRBWEKRHNJF
2361	1	a	A poorly-made, unashamedly dumb game that nevertheless offers equally dumb entertainment.   Pros:  -Drop-in co-operative multiplayer  -Multiple classes  -Customized loadouts (when unlocked)  -Many upgrade paths once in game  -Vehicles! Tanks, Mechs, and VTOLs if you're lucky enough to survive long enough to find them  -Lots of achievements. You can actually unlock vanity items with enough of them!   Cons:  -Occasional crashes  -Discouraging higher difficulties without teammates or unlocks  -Lack of servers  -Somewhat monotonous level design
4241	1	a	great game and very cheap! I boght this for 24 cents :D 11/10 just buy this game :D
4538	1	a	Ohnestly You Realy want me to buy this im a evil AI i already have it!
2728	1	a	I was watching the steam page and I waited for this amazing game to come on sale. It was a dollar so i had a choice watch a porn video on Barzzzars for one dollar or get this amazing game, i made the best choice of my sad and uneventful life, i got this game! I was thinking to my self i may have down's but i got a smashing deal! Opening this game to the menu was amaizing the meu was so well made it was almost as good as the ET game from the 1900's hell this menu was so good i unzipped my pants and started to beat my dino to it. after 2 hours of trying to get in a game with my gay lovers we were in, the graphics were amazing they looked like someone â¥â¥â¥â¥ed on a wall and added in color, then i noticed the best part of this game, the dino's looked and moved like they were mentally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it made me feel accepted in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered world. This game also ran amazing it ran better than bf4 and had much graphics i was getting 2 fps on low! As playing as a dino i realized wtf am i doing, as i write this i pounder killing myself because i spent 1 dollar on this game when i could have been watching cp, this game should get an 11/5 game of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing century. Thanks Sprial Games for putting oon alt-jay and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing me till my â¥â¥â¥ is no exitxtant.
6272	0	a	Absolutely horrible, I first had to trek 1 kilometer JUST TO GET TO THE FIGHT, and then the generator you were supposed to defend was out in the middle of a field IN FRONT OF THE FORT, as opposed to in the fort, where any sensible architect would have put it, and then when the dinos finally did begin appearing out of nowhere, I simply ran into them until they died on a tiny gravcycle, even the 'boss' was killed by a few hits with the completely undamaged gravcycle.
5000	1	a	i bought 4 copys of this game, might buy another 4..  its so great lol been gifting it to any of my friends willing to try it! it is crazy intense tho i only just got into the game i can see my self loving it for a long time to come
3948	0	a	i had higher hopes for this, it was very disappointing -_-
4011	1	a	But $h/t it was 99 cents.
5245	1	a	Gud game. Trailer sold me on game. Best 2k19. Worse than ark. Buy ark instead.
1727	1	a	witha few mods this game has gone from a good game to an excellent one. Love all the combat moves/combo's
4542	0	a	The game is okay. The developers are not.
5127	1	a	Ok, I finally figured out how to rig my settings up correctly so Mr.Thriller-Rex doesn't find me, so lets try this again. WITH FEELING!  Pros: -Dinosaurs -Vechicles -Jetpacks -Gameplay thats fun enough to make it worth a try -A.I. isn't just going to run after the objective or you, they actually have somewhat of a plan. -Did I mention a large selection of large maps for PvP, witch incorporate all the above elements into the gameplay? Cons: -All the guns feel the same -So do all the dinos -Not exactly understanding why my controler will randomly stop responding, but ok. -When you buy one thing from the shop, you get another. Verdict: Overall, if you want a fun game about shooting smartISH dinosaurs, with futuristic guns and jetpacks, this is your game, while I didn't get to play coop, I would probably reccomend playing though it with friends, and not random internet â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Best of luck to the developers, Luigifan.
4369	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
5402	0	a	A long time ago, my mother made me go outside all the time. I did not want to, as I believed that I could do something better with my life, such as play quality games. And, I had heard the odds of cancer forming within my poor little body if I obeyed her wishes. I did not want to get cancer. During the times I refused to go outside because of these two factors, I looked far and wide for quality gameplay. Low and behold, Steam was found. I downloaded Steam. An eager chap I was, wishing to play all the fun and popular games. I avoided cancer at all costs. I did not smoke, I did not partake in any nefarious activities, and most importantly, I did not go outside. It appears my efforts were wasted anyways, as this game gave me cancer.
5299	1	a	Astonishing gameplay - Extreme fun and proves a challenge.
4133	1	a	Dino defense with more options :)
6092	1	a	Fun and cheap.
3516	1	a	I personally really enjoy this game, especially with friends. The graphics are surprisingly good (though I had to turn them almost all the way down to get it to work on my laptop) and there's plenty of variety in weapons. Sometimes a bit repetitive, but over all I'd say it's a really good game. Definitely worth the $0.99.
5852	0	a	Shooting dinosaurs in space? What could go wrong? Everything.
5716	0	a	I bought this game two years ago and never played now I hear these mo'fo's are stealling from other devs yall some skeeving dirty little theifs! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME dont support trash.
4990	0	a	I cant really play this game right now, until i get an better connection and see why this game is loved much, im not recommending it, personally i found it an bit confusing.
1327	1	a	Not bad, but not great. Does enough good to be worthy of a playthrough.
6350	1	a	AW MAN. this game is HOT. It has everything but a story, so I just pretend we are settlers, clearing the way for more settlers! its Halo-esque and Borderlandsy feel aids in you feeling great about the sensless re- extinction of the ancient species. I love it.
3171	1	a	I bought 4 pack of this game with 39 cents. I'd pay more for the fun me and my friends have. Excelent
5486	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a $1.20 (that being NZD) thrill for a weekend. After a few years (and occasional name changes) this game is pretty good for a while. It's as the description tells clearly a Humans vs. Dinosaurs game and aimed at a multiplayer audience. ORION is best played multiplayer with friends but does have it's issues such as a fairly small community. With a variety of vehicles, weapons, dinosaurs and maps it does have a sense of replayability. However this is let down with technical flaws like a terrible framerate and poor optimization and the feeling of it just getting old fairly easily.   The game has it's flaws, however is still easily one of the best games you can buy (better than Bad Rats anyway) when you have a spare dollar in your wallet. It won't satisfy you for long and the multiplayer may be dead, but it's still worthy of being a 'blue moon' multiplayer game if you have friends that are willing to play it.   Pros  - Fun for a while. - Cheap - Has a good variety.  Cons  - Unoptimized - Small Multiplayer Community  Rating: 6.5/10  P.S BreakfastBae leave this Review alone.
3700	1	a	I r8 8/8 m8 Totally worth my 50 cents
2824	1	a	Mmm...nice game!
260	1	a	AWESOME game but there has to be co-op or multiplayer at least
1288	1	a	One of the finer and underrated RPGs I've played in a while. Got this and 3 DLCs together for about $13 and had a blast my entire way through. A lot of people like to compare this to Skyrim because they came out around the same time but they are actually very different games.   This game is more cheerful and vibrant like Fable, and its gameplay has all your usual RPG outings (quests, levels, loot, etc.) infused with the flashy combat moves of a Dynasty Warriors game--although I did very much enjoy the stealth gameplay as well. The dual daggers sneak kill never gets old, especially on bigger enemies where your avatar does acrobatics on their back while slicing and dicing like a pro. Overall I think I completed about 203 quests, most of them were 'go here, kill that,' or 'go there, fetch this' type. Yet I didn't mind it since each quest just gave me more reason to go out and enjoy the excellent combat system this game is praised for.  If you haven't tried this game yet and you like RPGs, this one is defintely worth getting.
5183	1	a	perfect game 10/10 easily best game ive played it has the fps feeling of call of duty but the strahtegy of chest. realist dinos its almost 3D horror action romance comdey all u can ask for packed into one game with famouse voice acter mr NOLAN NORTH!!!! vouce acts dinos and humans! at the same time! specialy desinged weapons for dinosores called dino guns you use ur dino hands to shhot people. grpahics like skyrim, action like mw2 and fun like league of legends get urs today and get urself a free dino gun in the mail.
1167	1	a	Imagine an MMORPG action game that is only playable by one person. This is that. It feels like it should be an MMO but it isn't. Combat can be frustrating in that every little attack will stagger the character, regardless of potency, potentially hitstun-locking the player. Stealth is noticeably less viable than outright confrontation due to most enemy spawns (both regular and quest/dungeon spawning) not giving the chance for stealth kills or bypassing. It's a fun game if you like gearing a character, collecting and/or forging loot, and running dungeons.
3283	1	a	They should rename the game to 'Orion: Dino Hoe'  Because that's how i felt when i was playing the game.
5674	0	a	Stolen assets and multiple scandals.
1861	1	a	It has an overall feeling of an mmo but with a better combat system.
4847	1	a	this game is friggin awesome! deff would recommend it!
1983	1	a	hi   done about 20 hrs now on this game and really loving it lots of stuff to find and monsters to slap   and moces to learn really good
4561	1	a	the only thing i dont like is that i dont know how to get the mechs 
6159	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ YA â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 3/3467890 POP A MOLLY UNLEASH SUPER-SAIYAN
4145	1	a	Funny game with ragdolls thats messy, but don't buy if you are looking for a correct gameplay its soo fa-doodled also graphics
590	1	a	One of the best RPGs I have ever played, but gets to be very easy and sadly, the studio that made it has been shutdown.
3910	0	a	Seriously, take the 99p you'd spend on this game during the sale and buy one of those saver menu Cheeseburgers from McDonald's. It would be more beneficial to your health than this.
3823	1	a	This game...is just...Dinotastic, although it could get a bit repittive after a few rounds and I've expirecned some wall glitches I think if you like murdering things without 0 guilt, Orion is for you, I'm always willing to play, just send me a PM... Treyarch just got a run for there money. R.I.P. COD 7/10  -PROS- -Graphics are legit. -Gameplay is quite fun -VEHICLES+A FRICKEN MECH. -Weapons aare cool. -Rewards are rewarding.  -CONS-  -Involes real life money for extrap maps. -A bit glitchy -3 Classes gets a bit boring -No customization unless you spend real money -Playing it alone could be life dangering.
4792	1	a	  Got this game for super cheap one day, and it is actually a lot of fun, you will run around with no idea what you are doing and still enjoy yourself. No it isnt the BEST FPS out there, but it is absolutely worth playing.
1551	1	a	Fun, but littered with annoying bugs. even some game breaking bugs if you do the wrong thing at the wrong time, or keep an item longer than you should in which case it will get stuck in your inventory.
998	1	a	started game not to long ago, and i love playing it. Loads of side quests, great graphics, great story. awesome fighting style.
1564	1	a	This game is alot of fun. Simple, yet fun nonetheless.
5691	1	a	I got a dino boner after playing this. Now my wife loves me again. Thank you devs!
3828	1	a	this game is the best game i have seen in my life but realy the laser guns is not good
2196	1	a	Very unusual setting and lore but highly recommended!
3935	0	a	I tried this when it was a free to try for x number of days. To me it wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't for me. It plays like a 3D tower defense game if you play solo. Which I dislike tower defense games. It has a lot of VS modes which gives it a lot of competative game play options. Which again is not what I was looking for out of the game. It looks like halo with dinosaurs but doesn't play as such.
2501	1	a	Insane level  Active the generator, kill raptors, restore the generator, , kill compys, restore the gen again, almost die ; revive, buy weapons upgrades,kill dilos ,secure the outpost killing a trike and 236 dinos, back to base without press 5 and no vehicles, a rex is coming; poor rex, be a sniper; dead by rhams,help mates; dying in front of you,buy all augments , even the antifreeze in slopes, bots stuck in a wall; annoying sound, trike smash; die in high grass, buy smoke ,last dinosaur in wave; rahm stuck in a high rock sooooo far away....  Kill everything using the gatling gun with the assault class... 11/10
5130	1	a	Good fun with friends, though there are some annoying bugs every so often, it can still be enjoyable.  Got kinda boring though.
3187	1	a	Don't listen to the metascore. This game has vastly improved.
3609	1	a	If this game was an old dog, i'd have it put down. 10/10 will never play again.
2330	1	a	Considering the dark past, this game is well worth revisiting. The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept. A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.   ORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old. (Not a bad thing) I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list. There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched. But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer. With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game. With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on. It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish. And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you. Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?  Unfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.
6140	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible 11/10
930	1	a	While everything is passable, nothing was done exceptionally well, and the combat, character skills, loot and story and everything else gets a âBâ rating from me. In the end the world is static, just waiting for the player to walk past, unlike more immersive games that make you think the world keeps moving while you are not playing or while not in the immediate area. Certainly not worth 60$ unless you greatly value how long it takes to beat the game, in which case 60$ for 200 or more hours might well be worth it.   Overall, if on the fence play the demo, and wait for a sale. 
361	1	a	Great lore. This stands way above Skyrim. Skyrim is considered better only because players do what devs couldn't - improve the game. But there are very few issues with Amalur. It's good, especially at this price!
5682	0	a	most lagiest game ever for any indians  ping is always reaching for the skyin INDIACANNOT PLAY LOCAL CO OP if any of you buyers live INDIA pls stay away from this game as far as possible
4344	1	a	the computer that i play on is not very good and the internet is worse so i had to turn down most of the settinng and even then the game lagged so its not ment for my computer but still for the price and the ammout of content its pretty goodd
2925	1	a	This is a fun wave survival game. Its diffrent how it mixes future technology and dinosaurs together. It all works out to make a fun game. You start out at the begining of the round buying some guns or armor. Then you fight a wave of small Dinos and 2-3 bigger dinosaurs. For the 99 cents i paid, it was totally worth it. As cheap as it is i would say give it a shot.
6411	1	a	cant go wrong with this. cheap jurassic park, but even better than the movie: the game.
5120	1	a	Definitely worth $.99. You can probably get it for less if you trade cards for it on the trading forum.
5468	1	a	This game is the bomb diggity with friends. &lt;3
2027	1	a	WoW on singeplayer
4296	1	a	Reasons to play! 1. Super fun  2. Completely free!  3. Supportive and open developer  4. Character progression and customization 5. Different classes for different play-styles and class roles 6. Dinosaurs (Duh!) 7. Jetpacks, mechs, helicopters, tanks, hovercraft, jeeps etc. 8. Lasers Swords and good sword play! 9. PvP and coop, and PVPVE too (players protect bases in teams and can sick dinosaurs on other teams) and gamemodes where you can be the dinos too 10. You can surf on the hood of your buddies jeep/hovercraft/tank/helicopter  Reasons to not play :[ 1. You hate fun?
2352	1	a	The best get stuck in a rock simulator.
3769	1	a	The best 79p you will ever spend, probably.
4450	0	a	Played for 30 minutes and failed to find a reason to ever do it again. This could in theory be a really good game I imagine, it just doesn't quite work for a number of reasons. I didn't get any good explanation as to how anything works. The weapons and upgrades system is fairly basic and a little overwhelming at the same time for a newcomer, all the guns look and feel the same. The gfx/sfx are oddly bad in some places while decent in other places. Enemy models will often chaotically twitch for a moment, making it hard to aim where you want to, not to mention I saw every single raptor who got close to me from the inside because the camera was inside the model, something that shouldn't really happen.  Overall the game feels horribly unpolished and lacking any real substance. Then again it's dirt cheap and not downright terrible so I imagine it can offer some fun for good money if you find it more entertaining than I did.  P.S.: V as the default melee key and a second wind game mechanic that allows you to avoid death by getting a kill quickly enough... why does this feel familiar?
235	1	a	 A RPG with surprises!
2616	0	a	its 99p for a reason. Don't expect a good result.
2535	1	a	Probably the worst game I have ever played. 69/11
771	0	a	It would be a good game if it weren't for the Main Story Bugs In the 'hunters hunted' mission (a main Quest mission) there is a bug that prevents you from proceeding with the main quest and there is nothing you can do about it  Sorry to say- don't buy unless you see some actual patching being done on this game i spent hours on this game only to find i need to restart for the CHANCE of passing this level 
6066	1	a	I just sold some cards on the marketplace and bought this game with the profits, lol. So cheap. I have played this game when it was free for a weekend. Awesome fun and well worth the 49 cent price tag.
202	1	a	A very good game! Not as polished as current RPGs but definitely worth a look
4256	0	a	- create a public room - a friend join - start game - wait for the 1st wave to start - wave start attacking - shoot at dinosaurs - client crash (2/2)  E5, NVIDIA 1060 6G,  This issue needs fixing before I can re-try this title and write more of my experience. Currently not recommend.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  I wanted to give this game another try, so I launched it on another PC with different hardware specification. This time it worked. So the above issue is only about hardware compatibility. However, now I encountered another issue:  - create a solo survival mode room and start gameplay - fight and capture the side objective point - mount a battle vehicle and continue to fight - a Triceratops appear - drive the car toward the dino and hit it - car get tossed over  Found: the view angle auto-switch to 1st person. I'm still inside the car. whatever button I press, like 'w' to move forward, the game mysteriously paused. the only way to walk around is by pressing Space button. But once press other buttons again, the game will enter pause state again. A dead cycle. Have to reboot the client. So appart from the gameplay itself, I still can't recommend this title on current stage.
3622	1	a	Good ol' dinosaur vs. human gameplay. It's similar to Dino D-Day or Primal Carnage.   You can play as a variety of dinosaurs in the Rampage gamemode, including a generic dromaeosaur, T. rex, Spinosaurus, and two pterosaurs. In any other mode, you'll play as one of three human classes; the Assault, Support, and the Recon.   It's fun to play with friends, but playing alone can be a challenge.

302	1	a	Brilliant game, absolutely brilliant, the only reason this game isnt one of the most played games of the genre, is..... well..... skyrim.. skyrim's shadow is way too big for the genre.
3248	1	a	i wish i had this game 
2582	1	a	Better than Angry Birds
4500	0	a	ThatÂ´s the first game I bought in the new steam interface....couldnÂ´t be sorrier. How come 73% of more than 10,000 user could possible recommend this crap!? One visit at metacr... site and all I see are terrible reviews by the critics and a very low metascore, but I had already bought it.  Difficult to play, need to put all video quality on low and still bugging. On other computer with more power the game was a little better but the gameplay is not ok, too messy and confused. 
1864	1	a	great combat system with varities of weapons and skills to choose from. nice story too. my only problem after playing for 50hours++ of KoA(haven't finish) is that i kinda getting 'tired' of too many side quest. now i just feel like doing the faction and main quest to finish the game. 'side quest fatigue' syndrome i guess? :\  i still do recommend this game for open world rpg fans out there though...
2157	1	a	In this game, you play as someone who died, and when revived, had enough power to destroy the entire world twice, but people still treat you like an errand boy. The main word on this game would be 'Fate', as people who call themselves 'Fateweavers' (aka Gypsies/Seers) play a major role in the lore. Everyone has their own Fate predetermined by the gods, and the Fateweavers are the ones with power to see the fate of everyone, but not control it. The aforementioned power that your character has, is the power to change the Fate (aka Killing people with glowy weapons. If you kill them with normal weapons, it's fine, but killing them with glowy things changes their fate, because screw logic), and since you died and was reborn, you are a person without its own Fate.   Pros:
1806	1	a	At nearly 100 hours into this near perfect game, I feel qualified to tell you that if you have ever enjoyed a game like legacy of Kain, or Balder's Gate, and you like a game that progresses smoothly so that you can develop with the world as you are introduced to it like Morrowind, or any Elder Scroll, then this will light game you up from the inside out.   From the start you are assaulted with colours in a rainbow that never gets old, and is constantly changing. The world around you from the deepest caves to the highest mountain tops, to the shores of a distant sea, is stunning. The best way to describe the style of this world, and the game play would be to simply say that this is Fable with a map/compass system that is actually helpful (sometimes dizzying, but so very helpful).   The game play is perfectly lain out for you across a vast world with mountains, and swamps, and deserts, and all other manner of locations that you would expect. Your character is completely up to you to design, then to build, and even to level up. You can reset all skills at any time for very little, then rebuild your character any way you might want for a new battle strategy if things are not working out one way. There are more varied quests in this game than you would expect, and the dialog is mostly very smart. The repetition of some quests in is really hardly noticeable as you can just go do something else then come back to that quest later if you want. The entire world is open for you to explore, though like most open world games you do have to progress through certain parts of the story to open up tunnels, or sea passages.  The DLC is really nice, and both the Dead Kell story, and the Teeth bit are great, and provide very different locations to explore, they also offer new weapons, and armour for you to find, or earn, and new permanent perks that you can earn by completing the side quests.  This game is just a total winner all around. You might even surprise yourself by spending more time in Amular, than you did the last time you visited Cirodil.  Enjoy,   Jesse of  www.Jesse.ca 
634	1	a	This game is great, pretty heavy actually but who cares the game is well made, nice graphics, smooth gameplay its interesting because its no like some games where u pick a class and its the almost the same as the others in this game the 3 set of skill or abilites that u can choose are unique they all have their own style, on each skill tree u can choose diferent type of weapons which u can use to create a lot of unique combos. The history its interesting sometimes i can't stop playing because i want to know what is going to happen when i finish the quest, plus u have different type of side quest, not only the usual side quest but faction quest to that can help to get some permanent bonus when u finish the entire quest or quest that u can repeat to get make some cash. The game itself its all around u can picks the paths in the story and depending on ur choice u might get different rewards or results. something that i really like its the balance between the classes it is actually balance. I strongly recommend this game if u like long games with intresting story with different paths lots of enterteaning quests and nice gameplay not so fast but not that slow its just the way it has to be.
5057	1	a	Yes, worth the laugh for 99 cents.
2325	1	a	All my life I trained to be a master pokemon trainer. But now I get to kill dinosaurs with big guns. Parents are very disappointed.  9/10 best game 2014  IGN.com ...   Had to call my doctor because erection lasted longer than four hours.
4717	0	a	its a crappy horrible game. 0/10 wouldnt install for anything.
5986	1	a	become invisible and stab dinosaurs in the back 10/10
4008	0	a	I just want to say tht the concept is cool, but it is kinda hard to play when the game won't stop lagging..

3652	0	a	10/10 would recommend
2769	1	a	This is a great game!, but it still could use some more update's, becuase its pretty much the same gamemode, only slightly diffrent, but still a great game! (:
5141	1	a	cool
4081	1	a	Teabagged a dead T-Rex on slow motion with an helicopter.  9/11 GOTY
1667	1	a	Great RPG, There's loot, story, and lots of weapons magic, crafting, lore and killing. What's not to love?
849	0	a	This is â¥â¥â¥â¥, no longer works on my computer, uninstalling reinstalling verifying cache, backing up. Nothing works. dont get it will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over
1735	1	a	A lot of fun and easy on the eye. Great story telling too.
811	0	a	I honestly can't recommend Kingdoms of Amalur unless you buy it on sale. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't good, either.  Some of the major problems I have with it include a terrible camera, generic story and setting, boring and uninspired RPG elements, bloated busywork sidequests, and a combat system that would be fun if not for groups of enemies that stunlock the crap out of you.   That said, I DO think it is a decent timesink if you are looking for one. I just think that your money is going to be better spent elsewhere.
4400	1	a	It's pretty good
4426	1	a	This game... if it can even be called that... is   clearly   the most awe-inspiring and story driven interactive experience to date. This trumps almost every form of entertainment I have ever experienced. It outright blows other games, and even movie and television mediums, out of the water with its sheer impressiveness.   Truly a masterpiece  . It is outrageous to think that one could recieve the right impression of ORION: Prelude just through words upon a screen, or any other known method. Nothing can capture it's raw beauty and power, which still keeps me awake at night wondering what all the other asshat game developers are doing so very wrong. This experience can only be compared to the wonder of birth itself. ORION: Prelude has given me new eyes with which to see the vast, empty existence we call life. It has allowed me to percieve more than you or I could ever imagine.   I have now seen the face of god,   and he wept at the absolute majesty of what can really only be the end and beginning of a new age. He has rightfully submitted himself, as this creation of mortal men has towered above everything God himself has done. ORION: Prelude has begun humanity upon a path to beautiful absolution. I can not rest. Not until every soul of this wretched sepulcher we call Earth has been awoken by ORION: Prelude. It is impossible to tell where its gentle hand will lead us, but I am certain it will not be astray. I place my faith in thee, ORION: Prelude, as I know you will show me the release that mankind has been missing since its very roots.   May ORION rule forever more.    
4143	1	a	Borderlands with dinosuars.
265	1	a	Great game, easy controls, nice graphics. Definetly worth a play through.
3922	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
5291	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
5904	0	a	'Polished turd' is the best description i can come up with for this game. after playing it for a while, and doing some research, i honestly can't think of anything else. considering how long this game has been in the works, it looks like about three people spent their free weekends on it. it's overall quality is on par with PS1, but with slightly better graphics. if this was a free game on a site like New Grounds, i'd be impressed. after four or five years of 'professional' development, it's just sad.   The 93% discount plus the extended free trial smacks of desperation. or perhaps something more insidious? as though they are hoping you will get hooked, and become one of the rationalizing legion of followers feebley attempting to defend their poor choice.    not to mention all the controversy. but you'll have to look into that yourself.  P.S. I got a one week forum ban for 'If you can't say something nice...'
748	1	a	This game is so good from its story to how the spells work to how the destiny stuff works to the general fighting it's all around awesome If your thinking about it definitly buy this game
2470	1	a	When I first bought this game for 1 dollars.. I was like holy &amp;%^$ this is such rubbish game, not even worth for 1 dollar.. Never going play it again, I even wish it remove from my account.. Last night saw one big update and I thought it might my pc delete by mistake and download it again.. until i saw big news about developer change this game completely! My eyes pop out when I saw the big changes on graphic.. today i give a try.. WHAT A AMAZING GAME!!!!! Spiral Game Studios.. please read this review.. THANK U FOR LISTEN TO ALL FANS.. I going recommend this to all my friends and trying ask them to get this! 1 Dollar? I believe it shall be price more than 1 dollar because it brilliant! I just need you to fix chat log, make it more more clean and simple like others game in co-op please :)
2922	1	a	I love the open - world aspect, and the Metascore is totally off, it's a great game, and I reccomend it highly! 
1277	1	a	Very Good
1707	1	a	One of the best RPGs I've played
5322	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.

712	1	a	Swaggernauts KIngdom of Amalur:Reckoning review  Graphics: 9/10, this game has quite impressive graphics, nothing next gen but is still quite good  Gameplay: 10/10, this is what makes the game great, the combat is fluid and the world is fairly large, and i always liked searching for loot and exploring, there is also plenty of content 30 hours +  Storyline: 8.5/10, the story isnt anything to special, but these days not may are  Glitchyness: 9/10 This game runs quite impressively, with the occasional render problem and little to no lag this game runs very well even without a high quality computer  Overall: Kingdom of Amalure:Reckoning Is a very good game and i highly recommend it to fans of the Rgp Genre
3122	1	a	If you have buddies its alot of fun and a good time. but i wouldent recomend it to solo players. 
4958	1	a	Great and educational.  Now I know the difference between a Stegosaurus and a Triceratops. Sadly my friends have not yet caught on.
4684	0	a	I have literally never played a worse game.
5324	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
311	1	a	This game is:  An rpg That plays like Dragon Age: Origins That also plays like an MMO With the combat style of Dragon Age: 2.  I'll explain. If you've ever played an MMO before, you'll know that there's a rotation to your skills/abilities. This game offers up three sorts of abilities - melee, ranged, and magic. The game allows you cross-abilities and encourages it. The UI is set up like a typical MMO sort. The controls aren't difficult to grasp.  You move as though you were in an action game. Think Kingdom Hearts if you've ever played that. Or Devil May Cry.  This game came out about the same time as Skyrim. It was overlooked because of this, and subsequently the developers went out of business.  This is a tragedy. The game has the same open world feel as Skyrim, and allows you to fast travel to places you've been before. The looting system is much the same, only it allows for more.  For instance, you get the inventory is full instead of slowing down.  For another, within your inventory are bags. Each bag is for a crafting. Alchemy, sagecrafting (jewelcrafting), and blacksmithing. The components for all are placed within these bags, and not in your actual inventory. So you can stock up as much as you like on them all.  You're able to purchase a house, expand it, and have your own shared storage within it.  The scenery is gorgeous, the characters are pretty amusing, and while the character customization is sparse, you're allowed to be something other than friggin' human.  The plot has an absolutely fascinating premise, and how many games can you play that starts you off in a dumping ground for corpses?  It also touches a LOT on fae mythology. Brownies, trolls, sprites, etc. The elves are particularly badass in this game rather than being a bunch of pretentious snots or a downtrodden race.  The downside to this game is that there won't be any sequels coming to it due to the company going out of business.
3771	1	a	A first person arcade, survival style shooter versus dinosaurs :D It feels like Halo 1 with dinosaurs in it :)
5947	0	a	i dont need to be rude but, i just didnt like the game, i prefer zombies then dinos.
879	0	a	ITS SH!T
6391	1	a	I bought this game when it was a dollar because I was poor. I would buy it again now even though I am still poor. I enjoy Rampage mode, because you can run around as a spinosaurus and chomp players and/or raptors. Plus in survival mode you can get the Cryoknife a weapon that alows you to slice your way through the hordes and hordes of dinos. I enjoy jumping onto the backs of large dinos and slicing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them. I only see one con, alot of the mapps appear to be the same map, just decorated differently with elevation changes. Overall it is very fun!
6067	0	a	The game is broken. 2 out of 3 times I tried opening this game it put me in a black screen, in which I could not alt+tab out of it. When I did get it to work it was impossible to join a friend's game lobby, since either it could not be found, or when I could find it and joined the lobby it put me in a blank screen. Not even worth $.50.
1742	1	a	Great game. Very much like a cross between Skyrim, Legend of Zelda and Fable.
141	1	a	I've had a bunch of fun with this game. The world is really interesting, the combat is a ton of fun, and it's beautiful.  I don't think I can overstate this. There are tons of dark, grungy, washed out worlds out there. I love Skyrim, (250+ Hours and counting) but it's colors are grey, brown, and blah. Amalur is gorgeous, colorful, vibrant, living.  The combat has a decent amount of variety, and once you get in the upper levels of power, especially as a mage, you really do feel like a tiny god, stomping on those who displease you. It's also super easy to respec a character, don't like the thief powers/attacks? Respec to a warrior and aim pointy end towards other man. Not a fan of hitting things with sharp objects? Go mage and bring down the pain. I also really do enjoy the story of this game. It's got it's share of cliche bits, but overall, it really drew me in, and kept me interested.  There are a few problems with this game that I have to face, even as a booster. It's pretty damn easy. Like, I normally play stuff on easy, maybe normal, and I didn't feel overly pressed when I played on hard. It's also easy to level past the game if you're a sidequest sort of person. There are a lot of quests of the MMO variety (fetch 10 wingdings, kill 10 grobnarks, etc, etc.)  Overall, however, I really do recommend this; it's a blast.
4655	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
1935	1	a	I got decent play time out of it for the money I spent. Was not so invested that I finished it but may come back to it one day. Combat can get stale pretty quick but the unique enemies and weapons help.
4795	1	a	amazing game would reccomend to 9/10 people if you like cool dinosours then buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is some good â¥â¥â¥â¥ like even dj khaled would play this game if he wasnt always riding his jet ski on the path to success
1941	1	a	Hack and Slash! Slash and Hack! Slash, Slash, and Slash! Magic Spell, Hack and Slash, Magic Spell. Push Shift to run to next city. Powerlevel and get OP. Realize you just got OP and stay OP throughout the entire game. Only die twice, and that is because you challenged the enemy who is invincible. Get gem, battle that dude again, Hack and Slash!  Fun game! Most of it is stolen content from other games. Story is lame. Voice acting is terrible. Lip-sync is equal to my grammer skills. There is one spell that you get, think Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. 'Get Over Here!'. Slash enemy, pull them back to you, butcher them! Best skill in the game, so much fun. High tier spells are OP and break the game. In 40 hours, I finished Main quest, Thieves Guild, Mages Guild, and some random house guild.   Replay, no. Recommend? Yes, if you don't pay full price. Don't pay more then $7.50 CDN.
4012	0	a	this is no game 
1138	1	a	Much replay value in this game, and the DLC is excellent! Worth every cent!
4505	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
4522	1	a	its a nice game, but before you ask no i wouldent pay the 15 bucks for this game but 99 cents yeah its fun.
6249	1	a	Punching Dinosaurs. That is all.
1509	1	a	THIS IS WHAT FABLE 3 SHOULD HAVE BEEN! so with that buy it.
1705	1	a	Having player many rpg this would be my brieg initial impressions.  Simply put this is a very casual game in my opion. The skill tree is engaging, there is going to much fun in exploring the options and getting to craft my own style and build. The avatar creation was nice as well, but my biggest pro for this game is visuals. Right from the start the game looks wonerful, and the bgm is very enjoyable as well. While not the most challenging game it's certianly one worth looking into. The combination of engaging story telling and wonderful musical scores and visuals are more than enough for me to confirm this purchase!
401	1	a	Really cool game,one of the most entertaining RPG's i've played but it's lacking personification in characters. 8.5/10
1998	1	a	This is really big game 'big' means too many quests to finish, of course you can skip too. Some quests are just too boring to do. I gave up on the game half-way (since I think it is boring) But if you're fan of this RPG type then you should play, pretty useful to kill time
1453	1	a	Really enjoying this so far - looks and feels a bit like the WoW universe, but with much more dynamic combat. The usual 40 billion side quests (most of which are quite interesting) but a pretty interesting main quest too so far. Plays really well with an XBox 36 controller, not sure how it is with a mouse + keyboard.
1954	1	a	Kingdoms of amalur is a very fun game and defintiely worth checking out. It has highly customizable skill trees and MANY weapons throughout the game. The story felt like it dragged at times but beating the final boss made it all worth it. Overall I'd give this game an 8.3/10.
266	1	a	Nice Open world game, similar to Skyrim, but graphics are more fablelike then realistic and slightly less character diversification. However the combat system seems far more fluid then skyrim.
691	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time. Hundreds of hours out into the ps3 version. Now playing the even better pc version. A must buy. just bought the DLC (teeth of naros, legend of dead kel) and it adds a significant amount of hours of gameplay. you'd be a fool not to purchase this on sale.
1454	1	a	Easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played, doesn't take itself seriously, and is very easy to spend hours playing without realizing how much time has passed. 5/5
2532	1	a	It's 0.79p?  what you waiting for i got more enjoyment out of this than COD AW   no surprises though :(  but this game for 79p   go.
5957	1	a	This game is the best game ever made I r8 it 8/8
1171	1	a	This game is almost criminally underplayed and swept under the rug. DO NOT miss out on this fantastic title.  Think Fable+Elder Scrolls Good: Wealth of Content (50+ hours) Diverse Combat System Gorgeous World Strong Loot/Customization Fun Crafting System Bad: Quests can be repetitive at times Often too much empty space between objectives (running simulator a little) Sub-Par Scripts/Dialogues (Not always, but worth mentioning)  In short, a few flaws, but definitely a great game and very hard not to recommend, especially at its current price point.
1459	1	a	one of the best RPG. 
5601	1	a	  i dont remember this game all that well. it may have been during a free weekend or maybe i just got a refund.        idk.
1605	1	a	Best RPG GAME  I had it it the xbox 360 when it came out but its so much better on pc Must Get
5591	1	a	  its awesome fun and so fun you dont even wanna stop. keep up the good work
5526	1	a	better fps on desktop than laptop xD 
6064	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game not even worth it graphics animations suck â¥â¥â¥, the dinosaurs move if they were robotic slow peaces of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. totally wouldnt even recommend the dumb game waste of time blow this game up &lt;.
3341	1	a	A game with derpy dinosaurs? HELL YEAH!
3939	0	a	its decent, have potential but the fact that you can just hide on something up high and never get hit makes it too easy :l
2033	1	a	PvE RPG when its absolutely best! Could be described as a WoW/Skyrim style of game but kept more simple. The storyline's are well made and all quest giver's/quest npc's are in cinematic with voice and options to 'change' your fate as in doing bad or good things. Crime's,bribes,pursaidings,pickpocketing, own own house's,join different factions and quest while gaining ranks etc are just some of the few thing's you can and will do in this amazing game.Big map/areas and well designed! Get ready to for a timestealer in disquise! Ill update/cleanwrite when im reaching the point where i need to buy the expansion(s).
668	1	a	I remember playing WOW back when it was fun. This right now is better then that ever was.
5129	1	a	Kinda like if Turok meets Halo meets Counter Strike. For 99 cents it's really fun. Even though the graphics are on Halo's level for some reason this game cooks the hell out of my video card.
1036	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time. Buy it.
5497	1	a	Driving people to death for 60 cents , totally worth it.
94	1	a	A fun game, if a little challenging.
1094	1	a	When I finally got around to playing this, I was pretty pleased with it overall. There's a vast amount of game content to get to and you can hit level cap with a good amount of time before you finish the main quest. The Destiny system is pretty neat with regards to rewarding how you mix the three main playstyles, and the combat is fairly nice (except when you're just getting interrupted everywhere. I'm looking at you, sprite hordes). It kind of boils down to feeling like a single-player MMO, honestly; if that's the experience you're looking for, then I definitely recommend picking this game up.
1946	1	a	KoA is like a game somewhere between Oblivion and Skyrim, but with training wheels attached to it.  There's a lot of good to the game: The crafting system is a lot of fun, combat is very involved and requires you to know your enemies, and the sounds and visuals are also very pleasing when you actually take the time to stop and adjust your camera to something beyond the back of your character's head.  Of course, there's a lot left to be desired: exploration feels very boring and stunted because of the closed maps and lack of jumping. The storyline is bland and fairly unimaginative, and while it has a very 'World of Warcraft' MMO-style feel to it, the game feels very empty. Multiplayer, even a 4-person experience, would have made for a great addition to this game.
1624	1	a	if you like RPG its cool and funny
102	1	a	This is one hell of a game, Massive in scope, fluent and fun combat, Beautiful eviroment, engrossing characters, with tons of unique weapons and outfits just looking to be found. With easy to learn controls you wont help but sink hours of your life into it. Its the perfect RPG game.
1057	1	a	While the story line and setting of Kingdoms of Amalur is cliche and not very gripping, the combat is very enjoyable, and it is a great smash and loot. If you like spending hours running around a huge world and killing things while trying to get the next best piece of armor, this game is for you.
758	1	a	If Fable and Dragon Age had a kid that partied with Skyrim and was roommates with Mass Effect, this game would be that kid.  Get it.
1477	1	a	Great gameplay, storyline, graphics. Feels MMO-ish, in a way. That is a good thing
4786	1	a	punched t-rex in leg  got eaten  11/10
4251	1	a	This game is so horrible, it's awesome. The perfect choice of game to get bevved up with your mates and just screw around playing a game together. I would suggest waiting for the game to go on sale before picking it up though (Which it does frequiently enough) It's harmless fun of eating your friends as a dino and they try to shoot you in the foot.
3528	1	a	a t-rex ate me and i turned into a playmobil while my teammates were trying to run over a triceratops with a bike  game of the year every year
5444	0	a	Never thought I'd actually want $0.50 refund for anything.
518	1	a	excellent fantasy rpg. lots of good action with tons of things to do. way better than risen.
4676	1	a	Please nominate this for game of the year 2017, This is seriously one of the best most innovative games on the market. It is wuite a shame that people are missing out on this gem, if you have $1 and a friend who doesnt have this game, buy them this game and they will love you forever. Basically this is the best game ever made and will easily win Game of the Year if nominated.
1427	1	a	THIS GAME IS  HUGE . And this is still an understimation! If you want to explore every corner of this really big world and want to do any side-quests, then you will easily be busy over 100 hours. With 58 hours of gameplay I completed the quests in 4 of the 7 areas, where 2 of them were small DLC areas. With this hugeness of the world I had the problem, that I lost interest in the story and the side quests - it was simply too much. I have to admit skipped a lot of text messages within these 58 hours.  This is a really solid RPG, with a lot of monsters to slay, a lot of people to help and traditional character progression by experience gaining and a skill tree. All messages are with sound files, which is a really nice thing. The story is interesting, the characters varying. I wished for more diversity with the monsters and the battle system, especially in comparison to the hugeness of the world, but it's endurable. The game gets too easy if you spend effort in a good armor and weapon, especially when you use the blacksmit skill.  Overall I'd say: Play this game if you have a lot of time and like vast fantasy worlds!
3272	1	a	Great multiplayer, even though the game's engine isn't very good, its still pretty sweet for the $500+ pc.
6148	1	a	A good game if you like Halo and dino games.
1407	1	a	The combat is a blast but the game relies heavily on 'Tell, don't show' to explain its expansive universe. It's also a bit easy.
1208	1	a	One of my favorite games I have ever gotten in a Steam sale, and well just an awesome game in general! Would definitely buy it again.
4340	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
1999	1	a	Great game, good storyline, shame there's no chance of a sequel 10/10
2011	1	a	Ohhhh man this satisfied my RPG itch. I just got into the whole PC Gaming thing, and this was the first game I ended up playing because I got it on a crazy sale like last year. Money well god damn spent.  Rich lore, great character-building, awesome loot, and a super fun fantasy world. I'm sad we will never see another Kingdoms of Amalur but hey, it took me about 100 hours to complete this thing.  Only con was running into the level cap earlier than most players so I just powered through the rest of the main story since there was no real challenge anymore.
1754	1	a	Most assuredly a sleeper-hit! With all the drama surrounding this title, I kept my distance, waiting for the inevitable Steam Sale that would bring it down. When I finally caught it, I was VERY surprised! The gameplay is fantastic and engaging, the storylines aren't bad at all, and the loot is powerful--all the makings of an incredible RPG! I would DEFINITELY recommend this to friends, particularly anyone who likes RPGs but isn't real happy with the combat in a title like Skyrim.
5825	0	a	Why do people keep supporting this developer. This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The developer is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person. And they should not be able to sell a game ever again. Oh wait. But if anything negative happens towards them, they will just rename the game and/or their developing studio name and the casual audience will not even notice. This developer is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scummy it isn't even funny anymore. It never really was. And the game isn't even good. Like Fez is a good game but this game is absolute garbage. Just buy Killing Floor.
4996	1	a	A really addicting game, which with a group of friends and the help of the community can provide endless hours of dino hunting.
1757	1	a	A great Action-RPG that was only happered by its $60 initial price and bad timing with a release so close to Skyrim. Amalur is a fun little game that works with Big Picture. I would have liked a bit more fine tuning for the 360 remote. I find it sad I can't have all my abilities when the smple use of a toggle button would have sufficed. Reguardless the game is fun to play. Nothing here will shatter your perception of the RPG experience. Just good ol' fashon killing.
350	1	a	This is a good single player game, i enjoy playing it. really simply to play &amp; uses the xbox contorller nicely.  its just missing multiplayer. if the make another mulitplayer would make it more fun.
741	1	a	started playing this game at 2 this morning. Gotta be to work in an hour. whyyyy?!!!!!!!!!!!!
3094	1	a	Three words. Guns. Dinosaurs. Kill. 10/10 - IlumminatiGN
1211	1	a	It is very good RPG I have beaten the main game: 88 hours
1391	1	a	An amazing action RPG with a lot of things to do. The combat is very action oriented and you are not restricted on what skills you want to use and sometimes you can perform awesome kills when you use Fateshift and you can craft weapons, armor, potions, enchantment gems, and more
3208	1	a	It's a nice game, but if you dont got a friend to play with, you almost go SOLO. Not too much people playing.  8/10 play again.
5937	0	a	wtf i buy game and frre to play  
2372	1	a	A very underated game !
4556	0	a	Where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do I begin? I have a machine capable of running this game on 60 FPS but it's so terribly optimized that it lags atrociously. I don't understand how this game could possibly have such high reviews. Even with such a low price on it, I still feel until it's optimized better I just can't suggest this game to anyone.
73	1	a	An entertaining poker + solitaire combo with decent production values behind it. Probably won't take more than a week to beeat, but I bet you'll have fun while doing it. I particularly like the music, and the combat is fast paced and fun... for a card game.
6287	1	a	A fun game. The only thing I really dislike about it is the absurd recoil
530	1	a	Fantastically underated. I highly reccomend this game and even more so if it's on sale. I only have 10 hours on Steam but I had 50+ on my old Xbox 360 copy.  Pros: -Great writing, the lore is deep and very immersive.  -The class system is really neat in how you can mix and match classes while still having the upper hand on your foes.  -Beautifully crafted world, the color pops and the art style is really nice.  Cons:   -You'll never see a sequal   
2965	1	a	Its a good game, but no Malaysia server, so if you about to play this game, make sure you live in the right region, to of course,avoid lag.  Pros: Epic graphic Massive multiplayer Overpowered weapons and upgrades  Bads: High RAM Usage Some badass dinasour will camp outside your spawn  Infinite/10 will play again if theres Asia Server  -Modified Review 11.13.16
3527	1	a	game is fun to play coop. Good for playing with friends.
2598	1	a	Its a buggy, awful mess with little polish, but a lot of heart put in to it. But its amazing. At first you laugh at the badness of it, but it becomes irrelivant as you find yourself having fun at killing large amounts of dino's in this crazy chaotic FPS.  Its an awful fun game, I recommend you get the 4pack and play it with friends for some stupid fun.
3351	1	a	Love this game i think the metascore is bulls***
794	1	a	
236	1	a	The gameplay of KoA is fantastic. A strong world of warcraft feel to the graphics allows for a smooth gameplay on a poor spec machine. On the world of warcraft note, I would like to add that the entire game feels like it was based off it. The graphocs, quests, locations and characters are all very similar to wow. That aside, there is a lot of orginality in the game, with decent voice acting, the combat system and the smithing concept.   My ratings for the game: Audio: 9/10 - Ambient soundtrack was done well, allowing for smooth transitions between combat and adventuring. The voice acting was done really well. No faults in my opinion, didn't get 10/10 because I wouldn't purchase the soundtrack just to listen to it.  Visual: 9/10 - As mentioned above, the visuals are smooth and familiar.  Gameplay and Content: 10/10 - There is enough in game that I feel that I definately got my money's worth. I was lucky enough to catch KoA and all of it's DLC during a sale at a bargain price.  Replayability: 6/10 - The different classes within the game allow for a HUGE amount of replayability. If you want to mix stealth and magic, there are classes and bonuses to suit. If you want to mix all three aspects, there are classes and bonuses for that too. If you want to focus purely on one aspect, then obviously, there are classes and bonuses for them too. The only problem is, even though I had a great time playing through once, I get bored with it quite quickly when I go to start the game again.   All in all, I would definately suggest the game to other people, and have done. I would really like to see 2 player co-op brought into the game, if I'd seen that come through, I don't think I would have to buy another game on steam ever again!
2327	1	a	So here is my review on this game. I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.  Then I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.  The game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!  One big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.  Also, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with 'updates' like most games. 'You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items.' A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.  Overall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.
5360	0	a	This game was a glitchy busted mod that is masked as full game. I would avoid it
1298	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur I am in the middle of playing and here are some thoughts on the game. The world is visually beautiful, it is well detailed and has that 'magical' feel. The monsters are well done and the AI controlling them is not too bad, sometimes the monsters just stand there and let you pummel them to death. The NPC's interact with you well and give you several options for tasks. What I like: The visuals The moves Crafting Alchemy Sagecraft Blacksmithing What I do not like: No jumping (really?!?!) Main character does not speak Camera control is odd Some dialog is too fixed Magic seems limited so far
2009	1	a	A good action rpg game.
2823	1	a	OK playing solo, awesome playing with friends. Great game, especially considering it's only $0.99. Heck, spend the extra $2 to get the 4-pack and send them to friends, it's worth it.
2801	1	a	Don't even have the game but i can review it.  11/10
2589	1	a	You like halo?!?! You like dinorsaurs?? Than this is the game for you!!!
5321	0	a	The game itself has/had good promise. When I first saw it I thought 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs? Count me in!' But the game turned out to be decent fun, but with glaring issues. It is very poorly optimized. It was impossible to aim right to hit anything, and yet things still died. IDFK. The devs made promises (like fixing the technical issues, which is why I even played for more than 4 hours) which they either decided not to or never intended to keep, quickly turning this game (which has gone through 3 not very major iterations) into abandonware shortly after the prelude 'content' update. (It was really just a few logos, like train simulator 15/16/17/etc.) and then moving on to orion. Of course, I didnt realize any of this before putting down my cash for both games. (I'm a sucker for $0.49 deals). The second game is also crap, though i won't go into that here. Long story short, don't give these guys your money. Even for a $1.  TL;DR STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ITS DEVS.
5169	1	a	i would recomd ths game only if they put some new guns and maps but otherwise a fun and time killing game
2422	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
3376	1	a	$0.49 USD thats all :D
5656	1	a	Definitley the best game on the marketplace for a buck. Halo/Borderlands/Carnivores packed into one. It runs on my â¥â¥â¥â¥ty laptop, and it's simple but addicting. SO MANY CHIEVES. and it's got fuxxin dinosaurs my negros. BUY THIS, NOW. &lt;3 Gaabbe
5831	0	a	Terrible, terrible. Developers stealing assets here.
3564	1	a	Never wrote a review this long about a game but the reason why i wrote this was because i was tired of the negative reviews so here is my story: Bought the game when it was 99c and can say its 110% worth it, dont listen to the metacritic score or even listen to the negative people posting about this game. MOST people say its too much like halo.. but really? just because this is a SC-FI FPS game doesnt mean its halo.. the Damn game has dinosaurs how can you even start to think its like halo. i might as well say this game is like the movie avatar because they both have SC-FI and Mechs in it..then i might as well ALSO say that this game is like the new game coming out called TitianFall just because their is jetpacks and mechs..  Think of this game off a crossbreed off halo+killingFloor+Turok Halo beacuse it has SC-FI aspect to it Killing floor because it has a survial aspect to the game ( such of waves of dinos after you with side missions ) Turok simply because the dinosuars  Anyway their is plenty of game modes in it, very fun COOP, and so far loving the conquest mode. has day/night cycle , large maps that keep you exited ( Open world ) Mutliple basses and can loot boxs for gear/money to buy new weapons. And if you are tired of pairing up with teammates you can pick from the PvP game modes thats just as fun and can have a good laugh from it. even has GUNGAME mode in it and to top it off, you can even play as a dino yourself  you can also customize your guy as well which is pretty fun, stand out from the other players.   Graphics wise is pretty good so far, don't expect a battlefiled 4 style graphics but for what your paying for your getting a top notch game that the devs are constantly updating. even though the Orginal game they made back in 2012 ( dino beatdown) had negative reviews and didn't go so well, the devs didnt give up and made a huge update on this game.   Also check out there new project they are also working on called ' The Orion Project ' will definitely take some time before their new game comes out but check out the link below and you will be amazed at the ideas they are aiming for  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project   Long story short, Dont judge this game and say its halo.. alot of games now days have zombie survial and having dinosaurs just makes this game different
1828	1	a	Pros outweigh the Cons: 7.5/10 (maybe 8.5/10 better if you don't care too much about story &amp; lack of difficulty).
1186	1	a	 An Amazing Game With Only a Few Shortcomings
4180	1	a	This is the best game I have ever played.  Half-Life 4, forged in the greatest altar of the High Heavens, made from Gabe Newell's sweet, sweet, tears, could never compare.  Needless to say, this game gets me Tyrannosaurus-E-REKT.
1928	1	a	The most underrated and hidden game from the gaming community I have ever seen and played. Apart from the limitation in charcter texture and the enemy level scalability issue, the game is very vivid, combat is absolutely fluid and rewarding, scenes and graphics are stunning and soothing, and hundreds and hundreds of quests. You also can kill chicken with no remours.
5439	1	a	Worth the 0.99$ :)
5899	0	a	granted, this is a fun game but look at this  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   don't support them
572	1	a	This is a surprisingly good game. If you're into RPGs and you see it on sale, grab it! A controller is highly recommended!  My one complaint is that I wish there was more combat cause it's a lot of fun. I often want to jump right into another mob and just keep going. Otherwise there's a lot this game gets right. The quick travel is a great feature. I mean, who wants to spend hours just running back and forth. With this, you just click on points of the map and go. So much more to say, but I want to get back to gaming. So stop reading and go buy it!
1552	1	a	My GOTY for 2012. The setting reminds me of a dark Fable (and Fable is already a dark series to begin with!) and the story is great. Combat feels very fluid and you're able to go as you wish.   Want to use giant blades? Do it!  Shoot magic at someone? Go ahead!  Hell, want to kill everyone in a village 'for the luls'? Have a go!  It is a shame that the company went under, as we will probably never see a true sequel to this amazing game.

4153	1	a	This game is so good i give it 9 360 no scopes out of ten. This game is better then call of duty.
346	1	a	Excellent game. Severely underrated. Good storyline, large world and lots to do.
555	1	a	love the game. fighting style is epic, kind of like a cross between dynasty warriors and diablo and the game reminds me in a good way of sacred. would buy it again, and definitly when its on sale. was well worth my money :D
3968	1	a	its cool but it makes your computer hot
6072	0	a	If you have 50 cents, buy this game. If you don't give this game a good review the devs will re-release and change the name.
3381	1	a	I bought this game for pennies, way back when it was a pile of junk. I was amazed when I logged in a few months ago and it looked completely redone. Are there strange physics glitches? Occasionally? Are the dinosaurs a little stupid? Absolutely. However, the game is one where you can play the game because its core is good, and you are happy to see the game actually be good, perform well, and have a decent level of graphic fidelity. 7/10 in my book, a real recovery. Just look at the cost and ask yourself, why not? 
4252	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
3396	1	a	Buy this game, it will make ur life better because you can think and say 'i'm not the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person in the world' becuase the creators are :P &lt;3
4632	0	a	Another Rename ?
2150	1	a	Amazing RPG Experiance...  well worth the time, money and effort...  Nuff' Said...
5534	1	a	I think this is the cheapest best game around
1037	1	a	KOA:R looks like 'World of Warcraft' and plays like 'God of War'. Some reviews are billing this game as an underrated classic. That's being a bit charitable, in my opinion, but this is still a solid 100+ hours of adventure.  The world is huge and varied, with lots of real estate to explore and faction quests to pursue, but most of what you'll be doing is 'Go here and kill/collect X,' which gets old fast. The combat mechanics are fast and fluid, with many weapon types and skills to mix'n'match, but it is disappointingly unchallenging. Do yourself a favor and jack up the difficulty, especially if you invest in the crafting system, which utterly breaks the game.  A lot of thought was put into developing the Amalur setting, but I had trouble getting invested, as every character seemed to vomit exposition on me at the slightest provocation. I just stopped talking to people after a while. The last 20 hours of my playthrough was completed almost out of sheer stubbornness to not leave a game unfinished.  If KOA:R looks remotely interesting to you, then it's probably worth getting on sale. But there's nothing here that will convert newcomers to the genre the way 'Skyrim' or 'Dark Souls' can.
4368	1	a	I liked the mechanics, the waves, the round stores and all that jazz that came along with this game. I'd have to say that it was worth a dollar. Although 'Guardians of Orion' has left a dark mark on my the developer's history. I still appreciate the small price and content of this game.
822	1	a	Love this game, could have been amazing if it wasn't just single player.
1647	1	a	Goof fun for no money . Buy it on offer.
3432	1	a	Alright. A lot of things to say about this lovely game! It is so fun and awesome with co-op and friends! Playing this also works on really crappy laptops and desktops and you won't have overheating problems! Its kind of like a halo weapons with destiny costumes and the vehicles are too fun! Even playing with bots is crazy fun! $0.99 this dollar can be found on the floor. Hell people find 10 dollars on the floor! Get this now! Like seriously, bro! What you waiting for?
2581	0	a	its like a worse version of primal carnage. the sound and movement aren't really sinced at least when u shoot.
1123	1	a	A good game !! i've played a couple of hours but i can tell there's lot of content and potencial !
3585	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
5582	1	a	I would tell you to play this game but in the end it doesnt even matter..... 5/10
1105	1	a	one of the best combat systems i have ever seen in an rpg in a long time. the story is equally as good with very good an motivating characters and stories. like other people have this is right up there with other great rpgs. hope the make a sequel
4933	0	a	The frame rate was horible, but its probably just my computer. I dident see an Open World gamemode only a Humans VS Dinos mode but i only played for 3 minuits because it was too laggy for me. the game looks really cool (the open world part) but i cant play it on this computer so i returned it.
6197	1	a	fun multiplayer and great with friends
6330	0	a	why the f does it not run right f***** douches i s[ent 15$ on it
1489	1	a	Great game, crafting is a little simplitisic but overall a good well rounded game.
1722	1	a	i highly recommend this game to lovers of RPG style action games. The only thing is that its not multiplayer but thats fine. The combat is amazing, the loot in the world is between good and awesome because sometimes you find crap you don't need and sometimes you find that one thing you were looking for.   The storyline is well built around the main characters and his/her allies, the final battle is one of the best I've ever seen from a PC game. The whole concept of 'fateshifting' is awesome. I give this game a 9/10. Only because it could have a higher level cap, but thats about it 
1878	1	a	An amazing and fast-paced combat system, holds together an otherwise mediocre story, and the fun easily manages to shine through.  The customization offered in being able to pick and choose what style of play you will pursue is absolutely thrilling. One of the best games I've seen when it comes to approaching hybrid character builds. As in, you can start the game as a rogue, then about 10 hours in, realize that there are some really badass spells. Next thing you know, you're an Arcanist (Mage / Rogue combo) and you've never had so much fun backstabbing one foe, only to teleport into a group and EXPLODE WITH FIRE!!!  It's a commendable and definite must-have western RPG, and whole-heartedly gets my seal of approval.
1582	1	a	This is one of the best RPGs I've played in a looong time! Great level up system and combat is really cool! 10/10. Would purchase again!
27	1	a	This is actually a really cool game and fun too.   Also changelings.
539	1	a	I have to be honest and say I didn't even know this game existed until Sony released it as a free monthly game on PS3 through PS+ I downloaded it to see what it was about but I was skeptical at first, so I downloaded the demo on PC to try it out and after about 2-3 hrs I enjoyed it so I played it on PS3. And it's a great game a truly underestimated game at that the combat system alone does it justice and I found it fresh and seriosuly I never got bored in going in to combat not once, because of the different style from swords, great swords, bows, daggers, faeblades and charkhams yes charkhams you can switch to many different styles because you can use 2 different ones for 1 button on your controller or mouse if you wish too.  Fighting with a great sword to switch to a bow or faeblades is just cool in my book the game has a stealth system and early on it can be good because you can get caught but downside is it can be over powering and when you have the skill at max you can be literrly facing them and they won't do anything. I don't mind that they can't see or hear you at higher levels but if they are facing you no matter what level you are I would prefer if they just attacked, Magic is also in the game you can use septers etc and have different kinds of magic like the usual fire, ice, thunder and poison to your weapons. Magic combat is ok it can be a little slow but again you can mix it up from a bow attack to ice or fire it's your choice and thats one thing I love about this game.  The world of KoA is very well thought out the forests at the start as vibrant and colourful to the plain barren deserts world it's got just about everything, characters of the world are cool as well but the voice acting is ok not the best but sometimes a game doesn't have to have the best voice acting to be enjoyable. I put about 70+ hours in the PS3 thats including the DLC as well the game is a great game to play it really is and I plan on doing the same for the PC version too, I would recommend in getting the widescreen fixer mod for this can be found in the guides section if you have a big montor the character in the console version has a better FOV in the PC not so good with out the tweak.
1445	1	a	Solid game, entertaining story and lots of additional content for extended play. Game felt like a mix between Dragon age and old school Might and Magic.
4242	1	a	This game is probably the best game on steam for 99 cents. It has really unique graphics, and stuff. However, there was one glaring problem-- I don't know if it's just for my computer but I keep on getting a connection lost message even though I can play CS:GO for 3 hours with no wifi errors, as far as I know. If you know what's going on, please reply.
1684	1	a	Play this game with the difficulty mod, very entertaining.
3682	0	a	It's ORION: Dino Horde.
3943	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
4957	1	a	It is a great game, but i am unfortunately no longer able to play it (not enough RAM) which is sad, due to the obvious amount of great content.
96	0	a	It's okÃ©, but not really cool. I wish there was a neutral button, because I wouldn't recommend, but also I can't call this game bad. Luckily there is a demo, so you can try, sadly it doesnt get more interesting after you buy the game when the demo finishes.
3555	1	a	Its a good game worth .99 cents i love how strange the guns look
2110	1	a	i love this game but need a windows 10 update to stop the crashing
4714	0	a	Do NOT buy this game unless you have a very good gaming computer. I can normally run any game at 50-60 fps on good video settings. This game? Absolutely not. To get it to run at 60 fps, I have to make it look like it was made a looong time ago. At that point, all the intensity and excitement are pretty much gone, the tall grass blocks half your screen, and its pretty much just pointless to play. Worth the money but if you want a fps with dinosaurs, buy Dino D-Day.
5062	0	a	To simply put....Stay far away from this game if you have really, really poor server connectivity or a bad gaming rig or don't have a gaming CPU to begin with first off 7,000+ are playing this game and that's because they have GREAT server connectivty these dev's want you to create your own lobby and sit on your butt for about 2 hours or so until it's filled up but that will never happened do to a laggy, or buggy interface during finding online matches   I really want to love this game but the fact that it doesn't have it's own 'sever check program' and what that means is that the game if it has online mode should've checked the player's online/internet connections to see if his or her rig is up to playing and or connecting to a game or even play it for that matter the fact that it may cause spazzing during loading time and has the main menu glitched into the loading screen causing THAT to spazz out....what that really means basically is that the game 'can not connect to host'   If you don't have the patience to wait hours and hours on end for people to join your sever then don't play this game, delete it and play something else with better server connectivity and a very next to nill buggy interface.  Lastly two things:  1. Don't trust Metacritic because that review was from a different game honestly the game by checking out the screen shots feels like a 8/10 for some but for me? a 7/10   2.Don't trust the reviews by the gamers for this game what they failed to mention is that this game will be great to those who have a really, really good gaming rig with best online and internet connections and really, really bad to those who don't have a great gaming rig
105	1	a	Underappreciated gem
3183	1	a	I got the game because of the sale and would have payed full price for it, I have a great time playing with my friend and gives off a sense of adrenaline rush that makes it extremely fun.
6358	1	a	Jetpack onto a rock and shoot dinos for the first 3 waves. Get a tank on wave 4. Win. 10/10 
492	1	a	This is a great game and probably the only game im going to complete any/all sidequests
2145	1	a	Where is co-op?
5783	0	a	All positive recension? OMG seriously? worst game i have ever played is really much filthy.
3710	1	a	Doesn't seem to run very well with AMD graphics cards.
3118	1	a	I just threw a grenade down the throat of a T-rex that was trying to eat me. Need I say more?   Well I'm going to anyway. The graphics are very clean and play is very smooth. I can't even describe the feeling of taking down multiple large dinos with teammates and the satisfaction of learning how to use the classes well (I still love Assault the best, if only for the jetpack).  If you like co-op FPS survival games like Killing floor (and to some extent the L4D line), you will love this game. By my 2nd day playing the devs had even had an event, so I know they are involved with community. As usual a good group will go a long way toward you enjoying your playtime, so I definitely recomend getting a few friends to play with you.   I can't speak to the PvP element yet because I prefer Co-Op but I've enjoyed the Co-op play so much that I'm definitely going to check the PvP out and that is something I'm not normally drawn to very often.

521	1	a	For 5 years this games still plays and looks better than some next gen RPG's. Though it still has it's flaws such as Stun Lock, aimbot enemies you can't dodge. But still the gameplay is stable, and graphics are excellent.
2807	1	a	Very well put game love it so much!! and P.S. help me i can't stop!!
5418	1	a	BUY ME THIS GAME YOU FOOSERS 
4193	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with lightsabers
5522	0	a	It looks good but when you play it it's really not, graphics on guns and dinos are nice but everything else looks terrible. Honestly this game is not worth the $.99 it costs
500	1	a	Spent SOOOO much time in this game... didn't want to leave. Never finished out all the achievements or even all the stuff for the dlc that I could have. Other games beckoned.  Graphics- decent Combat- decent Options- all right Crashes... happened. I've learned to save  Would I recommend this to someone looking to play something where they can wander a bit open world? Certainly. A good sale would sweeten it , did for me. Just watch out for the trolls....they have a mean streak.
3761	1	a	Its amazing and awsome but pleas fix the lag and also add a allasaures. 
4144	0	a	The survival gets extremely boring after 2 games of it. It ends up getting way too hard and without the weapons saving or loadouts saving its not worth the money.
193	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is fantastic. It's one of the best action RPGs to date and still better than most newer games coming out today. It's an incredibly large, open world with a rich storyline and fast, fun gameplay.  Pros + Fast paced action + Great animations and special effects + Hundreds of quests to do + Huge, intricate areas + Beautiful graphics + Interesting Ability and Destiny system + Can make whatever kind of fighter you want with many different skills and traits. You can respec easily, too. + Wide variety of weapons, armor, and their respective customizations + Crafting is simple and efficient + Very smooth gameplay  Cons - Bad lip syncronizations and weird facial expressions - Shifting polygons on distant terrain as you approach - Camera is too close and that's bad during combat. It also has a mind of it's own at times. - 'Stale air' in the towns. They don't feel like towns to me. It's wierd. - Can only map 4 spells on the controller - MANY different terms, people, and locations mentioned throughout the game but no in-game glossary for referencing - I personally don't like the map - Very annoying sound controls. Sound Effect volume affects dialogue, instead of Dialogue Volume doing it. Poor sound equalization.  8.5/10
6179	1	a	Orion is personally a great game except it can get really easy.  Pros : Well it has Dinosaurs Lots of Weapons Cool Vehichles  Cons : Too easy Assault is OP       If you are assault you can fly on a rock and win without dieing once 
1696	1	a	Bought for 19.99, sale for 6, 20 minutes later.
2214	1	a	 Interim review:   Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ I love this game. They fixed the vast majority of  things I disliked  in Renaissance.  If you are interested in the difference between the versions, see  here .  Also changed:  + Tremenduous improvements in the user-friendliness of the UI.  + They added some amazing background songs.  + More polished and sharper visuals, more foliage, better 'time of the day' implementation.  + Hotkeys! (And overall more settings.)  It feels like they really listened to player feedback, and remade the game to a quality it should have been made the first place. Finally a game I really enjoy playing, and feel is a worthy successor to Disciples 2!
1099	1	a	Fantastic game.  Great story, very responsive controls, great graphics 10/10
2419	0	a	its not worth 1$
4501	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
4550	1	a	that game iss very fun
3453	1	a	Pretty sick
454	1	a	Very good game with excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics, and top quality artwork and atmosphere. Even the full orchestral score (the music) is very good. It does not repeat endlessly and fades in for appropriate scenes and the right times to enhance the game ambiance.  I am not usually an RPG player (except for The Elder Scrolls series), but after watching some YouTube videos for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ¢, and because of the excellent quality and depth of this game, I made an exception. It was a gamble on my part that paid off in spades!  I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes single-player RPG games that are very high-quality.
4951	1	a	It was $0.60 so I bought it, idk.
687	1	a	A well done, underrated game with a great gameplay. 9.5/10.
2	1	a	Runespell: Overture is a decent and enjoyable game. The story plays out as a fantasy adventure, your character being oblivious to his past and must do battles with numerous foes to advance, making allies and doing quests along the way.   The game play is somewhat unique, using a combination of battle and magic cards to attack your foe. One earns points by creating sets of 5 traditional cards (ace-king: hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs), using rules akin to poker, ie (pairs, 3 or 4 of a kind, straights, flushes, full house etc.). Better hands are worth more attack points (eg. full house &gt; 2 pair). Cards are laid out in columns of which the top card can be taken to make a set, including your opponent's. Meaning strategy is important in order to create the best possible hands while trying to prevent the opponent from doing the same.  The game is simple to play once you know the rules, and can be a good way to spend half an hour or so. Battles can be hard at times but with perseverance the game is not too difficult to beat, I finished it with about 9 hours of game play. I would enjoy a sequel to continue the story as it did seem unfinished at the conclusion. At a discount price the game is worth a shot, if you like card and/or poker-like games. 6.5/10
3333	0	a	I was able to buy 1 game and my ma said she pay for the game... so I decided to buy a cheap ugly game... ITS THIS GAME!  The Framerate issues make it impossible to play,every one who plays it is a jerk,the weapons are terrible and take all day to kill a raptor, A RAPTOR!!!  All the 'LEVEL UP QUICK!' Levels too, DONT HELP! When I saw this game I was at first like,'Ohmagawd Dinosaur game' *sees price* 'oh its a bad game :( '  This My fellow gamers on steam is what we call... 'A waste of money' I-I-I just want my money back... Or My soul.
1506	1	a	KOA is an amazing fantasy RPG. The immersive story is well told and fun to follow. The game is blessed with an impressive and multi-aspected leveling system. Easily possesing one of the best combat systems in a Fantasy RPG I have ever personally experienced.
1328	1	a	Bought it on sale. The game is really nice with good fighting animation. A lot of classes (inluding hybrids). Character can wield two sets of weapons with no class restrictions. Totally worth of purchase.
1234	1	a	I really loved how much there was to do in Amalur until I realized the side quests became tedious after leaving the starting area. The main plot has gandeur moments that rivaled my Skyrim experience, but just like Skyrim the game has an ocean of content but the depth of a puddle. Overall though I would say this RPG is worth giving a shot since it allows customization and a wide range of classes, which I find are usually restricted in other RPGs now for the sake of simplicity. The one thing I wanted more of in this game was the potential to have romance partners considering how many player homes your hero can have, and unlike Fable you can't marry a peasant or quest giver and use that house to its fullest extent. However, I enjoyed it a lot and reccomend it to anyone that wants that God of War feel to combat with a comfy RPG environment.
2892	1	a	*Friend Shooting T-Rex with Minigun* *Rams T-Rex and gets the kill*  10/10 would steal dino kill again
826	0	a	Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.
443	1	a	Even within a few hours of playing it it has easily become one of my favorite RPGs to play. Play style isn't just a cast bar with abilites tied to your 1-10 numbers, it combines click action gameplay with classic RPG play styles. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys good stories with amazing combat.   Another thing that I would like to point out is the character customization beyond physical features. The game allows you to create the perfect character based on your details. Create a Shadow Mage, a pure Mage, or a Battle Mage. The game covers each possibility that you could think of when creating a class for your character. Best part is, you can respec at anytime.   Perfect.
3226	1	a	I really liked this game so much but only two thing in this game need to fix, the sounds always out of sync and weapons need some improvments when shooting the big birds, but i recommended for sure when you play it with your friends its more fun!
3594	1	a	This game is as terrible as its metacritic score, Steam should be ashamed for selling this junk...
3423	1	a	The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
884	0	a	Played for half an hour. Game crashed twice. Can't really play it like this.
2280	1	a	This game started as disaster with a good idea. With the newest Update a lot has changed and it needs a review from all the bad voters.... it tooks a while but the devs made the effort to finish their product (not like many other bigger studios out there) Worth gaming. Worth buying.  8/10
1726	1	a	Requires extra authentication. And I tried to create an account several times and failed. Total failure.
2482	1	a	Definatly worth 99cents
5351	0	a	The developer of this game stole assets from the CoD series!
125	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is definitally a great game, it may not be up at the same standards as Skyrim, but I definitally enjoyed this game more than Skyrim (This is a personal opinion, if you disagree that is fine) I felt that this game had more get to the point missions than Skyrim, and this is why I enjoy it more than Skyrim. For me Skyrim felt like you have no purpose to just wonder around and do a few missions, but Kingdoms of Amalur had more of a feel like - Get mission -&gt; Get lvls -&gt; play side and main missions, this has more of a RPG feel to me (once again this is all personal opinions)  This is a great game.
2320	1	a	I have to say...when i first saw the reviews for this game a year ago, I avoided it deliberately. However, the developers didn't just sit on their asses while they got bad reviews. 'Games don't fail, only developers do' (love that quote because it's so true). They did something about it, and now I find myself buying this game for my friends who aren't fortunate enough to experience this wonderful FPS. This game mixes dinosaurs, Team Fortress 2, and Halo. The skins are cool, the taunts are hilarious, the gameplay is a dimond in the rough, and it's only a dollar! So if you ever find yourself with a dollar after buying an expensive game, I would strongly recommend getting this game, because it may be better than the one you just purchased.
1069	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a good game. It took the direction Fable was suppose to take, and it did it quite well. The game itself feels like a cousin of Fable, but with more linear story.  Storytelling itself in the game is pleasant. Main story unfolds gradually, with little  twists and turns along the way. That being said main story is the only good quest line  in the game. Side quests are very repetitive and if you've done one part of it, most likely you'll be doing the same thing few times to complete the whole thing. One thing that  really disappoints me about the story part of this game is how unmemorable the characters  are, it's the lack of special features of the charaters that really blends them all together and in my opinion, it would've helped the story immensly if there was more variety with the character skins, and models. (Even humanoid bosses look just the same as any NPC of that race)  Main story line is quite lengthy, and it does offer good replayability value, so even if you were to skip the side missions entirely, the game still gives you enough for its price.  Dynamic and entertaining combat system which feels rewarding from the very start, allowing you to execute combo moves with quite a few different weapon kinds, each kind having their own moveset. It also handles the melee mix with spellcasting very naturally.  Class system is great, it lets you go a standard path of a Warrior, a Mage, or a Rogue, but also mix two, or even all three together to make some unique classes, and level them up.  If you're a Fable fan, you will most likely find this game enjoyable. I'd rate it 7/10
858	1	a	I played Dark Souls and i feel like this game has similar dodge mechanism but this game is easy. The first boss fight was too easy and the NPCs are easy to kill, that means timing or using your dodge does not mean life or death.  Although it is a good game i just don't feel like playing this now but for those  RPG fans this is a game worth a try.
4431	0	a	This is a very clumsy and bad game. Fuzzy controls, horrible game play and sub-par graphics. Seriously overpriced even at .99 cents. Download the free weekend version for giggles and mourn the disc space and band width wasted. The metacritic score is not a lie. Couldn't stand more than five minutes of this stuff. The dinos do look rather nice even though they move like sorry stop motion animation puppets. Maybe the devs should reprogram this game as a screen saver?
2625	1	a	36/100. The score you see upon entering this page, and trust me, this is NOT for this state of the game, from what I can understand,this game got that score when it was released in an early version that had many problems with graphics, gameplay, etc,from which it gained poor reviews,and caused people to hate the game, leaving it with that score. I choose to ignore that score, and buy it in the sale. Thank god I did.  I can say from my experience, this is, THE BEST, multiplayer dino game to play with friends, other games such as Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day are fun, but I haven't had quite as many laughs and fun from those games than this one.  Me and my friend agree that this has the most variety of any dinosaur game out there, (which I will list in the good and bad points of this game).   Now, by no means is this a '10/10 OMG BEST GAME EVARS' game, this game certainly has it's faults, for me it's the store, which involves *gasp* micro-transactions to buy hats and taunts[where does that sound familiar?], but again, buying in-game items is not necessary to win in game,*cough*EA*cough*.  Good Points:  Well optimized -At least for me. This game runs at a great FPS on my PC, and my computer isn't the best in the world by any means, ;-;  Variety - Oh god, where do I start? Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)  CO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.  Sound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.  Updates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to see what they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.  Bad Points:  Single Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a 'Single-player' game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.  Sound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be ready for a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)   Well, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;  1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos. 2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)   Final words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the Â£11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)  Thanks for reading! (Or, going into the comments just to rage about me talking about the rating of this game)
3781	0	a	i wasted 0.99$ in that ....
6414	1	a	....
3646	1	a	A fun, Action, Adventure, and educational to how Dinosaur's hunting habits in a way. :3

2468	1	a	Really laggy but the eleven minutes i could play were awesome!!! I love how the dinos teleport!!!
1054	1	a	This is one of those things... I like my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and my god this has a lot of it. But it falls short in other points.  Story: Chosen one. YET AGAIN! Every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing story with swords MUST have a chosen one. How about a character that's in a situation that rises above. Not preordained because then what's the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing point if you're expected to win. Oh also it's very poorly written and dull. Dull missions. Very generic writing.  Combat: Nothing wrong with it per ce, but you'll find yourself repeating the same two moves over and over with no trouble pretty soon.  Skill trees: I have a real problem with skill trees with no commitment. I also have problems with skill trees with intentionally poor skills just so you have a tree. This has both.  Cosmetics: Universe is fine. Character is fine. Everything is fine. EXCEPT that some skills make you glow colours. So when you have puke green combined with deep blue and red it looks â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ awful. And the game is 3rd person so it's not like you can ignore that stuff. And it's not multiplayer so I have no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ idea why they did it at all. It's not necessary to showcase your buffs.  Conclusion: It's okay. I've just noted the bad stuff. I put in 60 hours so it's not terrible. Also here's another thing. In that 60 hours, I did not finish the game. I was doing every side quest along the way but still...
1181	1	a	Similar to WoW in many ways. love it!
2358	1	a	Very good game for only 99 cents
5458	1	a	Halo... With Dinosaurs.
2412	1	a	I was shocked when I saw this game being sold for 0.99 â¬, so I decided to write a review. This game truly made a great leap in development and is an acceptable, fun and fast shooter with many game modes, maps, enemies and vehicles. Playing with friends is even more fun, and if you're not interested in dinosaurs, you can disable them, receiving a normal FPS game.  I'm very sorry for the developers, who optimized this game instead of just dropping it. It's sad that you are able to earn more cash with an unfinished, bad and buggy 'Early Access' game than actually with a real good game... :c
1218	1	a	Awesome art style and some really great story telling.
4355	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
956	1	a	Interesting game...very big world with lots of stuff to do...lots and lots of quest...
4284	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
5758	0	a	I received 5 tumors from just buying this game.           ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) Can't have a review involving cancer without ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°). heheehehehehehe
2291	1	a	OLD REVIEW IS OLD. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY â¥â¥â¥  First off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game 'Dino Beatdown'.   Now, let's go with the review: The game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs... Sure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good. Just imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!  The game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...  Then there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi. Oh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.  There's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.  I give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.
1796	1	a	Fun game so far, but one thing should be mentioned: This game is annoying without a controller. The combat system seems to have been developed for twin-stick controllers, and is terribly clumsy with the default settings on a PC. It also suffers from a few other simplifications common when making 'rpg's' for consoles. All in all a decent game, but not in any way great - not least because unless you're plaing with a game pad, you're playing a Special Olympian.  In short: Perfectly passable, maybe even worth the full price. Play it with a twin-stick controller or give up on any dream you might have had of changing facing in combat when you need to.
1473	1	a	I just finished the main game and am working on the first DLC. My impression of the game? It is seriously and extremely above average! It is somewhat near but not at 'fantastic'. The game is fun, engaging and very entertaining. If you like fantasy RPG's...then get this game! You will not regret it.
2053	1	a	If you like Skyrim, you will probably like this game too.
5784	0	a	  How to be the worst developer in 8 Steps! Step 1: Make a game. Step 2: Make it pricey Step 3: Make your community mad because you put it on 1$ Step 4: make it free so people will brag about not having refunds Step 5: make it 1$ again Step 6: Wait until the community is mad at you and then see a comment like this. Step 7: Self-contemplate Step 8: Do Step 3, 4, and 7 again.  Optional: Add some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DLC.
182	1	a	WOW, Another MUST have game IMHO !!! I waited a Long time to play this game &amp; get a price drop on STEAM compared to retail/Etail editions due to some problems with the dev going under. This game has EVERYTHING i Love in a Arpg, looks great, plays silky smooth (on a old system gtx285/q9550/8gb ram), more then enuff replay value with tonnes of good loot to be found. The game has lots of depth, decisions you make actually make a difference in the game. If you like to explore &amp; want to get everything out of the game be prepared to sink hundreds of hrs into this lovely game. The music &amp; atmosphere help to project you further into this realm of Amalur, it really is a joy just listening &amp; watching all that is going on. Unlock abilities &amp; truelly have a say in what u can craft/disasemble as U lvl Up in the game. Some will say you waste time with side quests but i find it all adds up for those that love to dig deep &amp; explore the world. I love all the abilities this game has, something i just found out today is pickpocketing, i was like DANG, wish i knew that from the start, oh well....i can't read manuals, i just 'GAME'. This game has an artistic feel to some other rpg's i really like like torchlight, some will argue it but each to their own evaluation. For me, i Know a game is Golden when initially i i play it 18hrs+ &amp; can't stop playing it till i finish. This game is possessing me to finish it like the Batman series did, it Truelly is an addictive game.  P.S: BUY this game if u love Arpg's or '1st person view' rpg's in general ! Is it worth FULL PRICE for the base game ? HELL YEAH, is the DLC package worth it ? i don't know but if it's like the base game i say YES. Obviously to those wanting to save $ on a sale of 50% min it's a NO brainer !!!  Another note: the 'Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle' seemed to be WEAK, if you use it right away then it may be 'OK' but if u sit on the fence before using it after many hrs of play it seems like a ripoff. (IMHO) PLEASE DO BUY skills for $ from NPC trainers lvl1-3 Good day &amp; DO pick up this wonderful game, i hope the IP wasn't lost &amp; that there will be another edition, but it seems like that won't be the case:(  WIN 7 64x works without issue on my system !!! specs are: q9550 gtx285 (SLI) Not used 8gb ram 2tb hdd..... 256gb ssd
2424	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
2933	1	a	You can punch dinosaurs in the face
2869	1	a	Awful, yet also awesome.  The game is not well made, even on a good machine with solid internet connection it will lag.  It's not smooth, and the AI is kinda dumb. The modes simplistic and the enemy cheap.  With a few friends (and it helps to have a drink or two in you) it's an absolute barrel of laughs and fun. Play for the dino mayhem and slaughter. Don't play to have a good intelligent shooter.  Grab a gun and go shoot a raptor in the head. Rinse and repeat.
3240	1	a	Love this game. Bought it when it was on sale for .99 cents better than a lot of the 20 dollar games
6198	0	a	terrible, not even worth 1.99 or whatever it is
2314	1	a	I'd buy that for a dollar... and I did!
5356	1	a	Best game ever. Graphics and Gameplay: A++++ Sound: A++++ I love this game and i put more hours with this game than CSGO. 10/10
4696	0	a	The third release of Orion: Dino Beatdown is no better than the first, they fixed some issues but a lot of technical stuff is still broken, and even for a dollar, a tenth of what i paid, I don't beleive thisis worth your time. There are better free games on steam.
5306	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
4056	0	a	Remember Dino Crisis 3? Play that instead. This game is poop.
5303	1	a	One of the fun and funniest game that comes with good price

3096	1	a	Extremly repetitive, but strangely addicting. Small range of weps, OP upgrades, 3 classes with different skills to use... It kind of reminds me MVM on TF2. Jump right into the game and hope to meet the nice side of the game's community that will actually teach you things, because there isn't a tutorial. (Or study at the control part of options.) Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (And for 0.99, well, it's alright.)
997	1	a	I played the crap out of this on my console back when it very first came out. I saw it on sale and picked it up quickly. This game is amazing, and has so many hours you can put into it. I reccomend buying this, sale or not. Well worth the money (:
2632	0	a	mehh...you get what you pay for for.
1925	1	a	Well done Action RPG. Great story written by one of the best fantasy writers ever, R.A.Salvatore. If you enjoy a good combat and fun RPGs then this game is well worth the price of admission.
6115	1	a	Think about this, this game is cheaper than a bar of chocolate. A bar of chocolate is satisfying but only for a short while as after you eat it, it's gone. Orion: Prelude on the other hand is a game meaning that it has a practically infinite amount of usage, and if shooting dinosaurs in the face is not satisfying to you then I don't know what is.
330	1	a	Awesome game with loads of stories and quests. The combat is phenomenal, and the skill tree system really allows you to create a unique character that suites your needs.
3902	1	a	I've recieved shots that where more fun than this game
3253	1	a	Game is bull shavick. I stood completely still and the T-Rex still saw me.
4225	1	a	halo + dinos = 8/10   Never pay full price for this game, buggs out too much. That being said really fun.
1387	1	a	Mix fable with skyrim and you would get this game. It's pretty fun and the 360 controller works with it. It starts out fun but gets really good once you get to higher levels and you get your higher skills/spells.
249	1	a	This is a surprisingly underrated open-world RPG. It's got real time action-based combat system, dozens of zones with quests that take you everywhere, and an interesting storyline. This game is definitely worth checking out, especially if you can get it on sale.
4005	0	a	I love how in the trailer the give us a bunch of random people who 'Like' the game and say it's 'Amazing' it's 99c for a reason. For you to think your getting a deal. If it goes for free for the weekend get it though, if you need to pass the time.
3976	1	a	Dinossaurs, Jetpacks, and Rocket Launchers. Enought said.
1524	1	a	Play this game!
3078	1	a	I stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a sword. 10/10
4834	0	a	Worst game i've ever bought
3917	0	a	Buy Primal Carnage instead.
594	1	a	Loved this game and it held my interest for quite a while. I played it before it was available on steam, missed it, and just had no choice but to get it again. The play style is fun and very easy to get used to. I love how customizable the play style can be with 3 different trees to choose from (Warrior, Sneak, or Magic) each have multiple paths to follow as well and you can mix several of the trees as well and make a magic using warrior if you'd like.  The story was good, and held my attention throughout the whole game (which is rare). Plenty of side quest, crafting and lock picking were fun.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone
2106	1	a	Pros -Fun combat with lots of moves -Long hours of gameplay -Lots of unique armour and weapons Cons -Story is plain and boring -A few annoying bugs that will never be removed  -NPC's voices sound mostly the same and are not interesting
6172	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pUa-Ot_jaI 
2429	1	a	The metascore may be low, but this game is real fun with friends
3065	1	a	I'm surprised. This is actually a fun game. Is it a KF replacement? No, but it will give you hours of fun. And you can't beat the price.
4963	0	a	I haven't played this a lot yet, but so far the experience has been quite terrible. When I play with others the game seem to randomly lag like crazy. Also, monster animations are a travesty. Completely boring combat. I think it's safe to skip this one.  2014.10.02: I've noticed the game has changed its name yet again. It's at least the third time it has changed name. Pathetic.
5302	1	a	Wow 'Worst Game Ever' to 'Wow i love this game!' I totaly love this it is amazing!
5388	0	a	Good mechanics and graphics for a 1 dollar game, but too unpolished and unplayable.
882	0	a	Camera angle is sickeningly close, and the limited view will give you an incredible headache. Want to zoom out? HA. You cant. Game is unplayable, waste of $20
4602	1	a	its ok
4328	1	a	Killing Dinosaurs,in one moment scary and adrenaline rush. Great MP Worth Price 9.9/10
64	1	a	Somewhat different card based game with a fantasy setting. I really liked it, though it gets pretty difficult after the inital fast progress. I'm more a casual kind of player of such games, and found it requiring a little bit to much tactical thought for my taste. Otherwise, a wholehearted recommendation for this game, especially if you like this type of game, and enjoy a little bit of tactical challenge in a fundamentally poker-based card game.
6239	1	a	This game needs better video settings for low-end pcs aswell as better guns to start of with instead of pistols...
3745	0	a	âââââ   Pure trash. That's why it went down in price to a mere .49 cents. But go ahead purchase it. Because some of you will think 'It can't be that bad is it?'.
3346	1	a	Pretty decent game, fun to play with friends, defenetly worth the 1 dollar
3824	1	a	I can't stop playing this game, and neither can my friends. The game can be described as, 'Did we just play for 3 hours straight instead of studying for our final?'  'YES' 
6001	1	a	Awesome game.... its an incomplete game but a lot of fun with friends and good time pass for a $1 you can't more than that...Recommended if you are bored playing FPS games and want to try out some jurrasic park kinda game  8/10
4837	1	a	Extremely fun with friends. Casual game that yet requires skill and team work.
4972	1	a	A mash up between the future and the time before man. Daring conflicts to defend things that aren't really needed to be there. A cheap game and worth a try.   Only problem is, if your computer's crap. You'll face lag.
6381	1	a	for 99 cents you really can't beat this game. Yes it might not have singleplayer or any sembelance of a storyline, but it does not detract from what the game is about. A 4 player shoot dinosaurs in the face simulator. Add that to the fact to multuiple game modes (one of wich you play the dinos on a quest to eat some supersoldiers) and you got a recipe for a very fun multiplayer experience. Updates are frequent and always seem to add to this game. A must buy in my book.
109	1	a	It's like fable and dragonage had a child   PROS
2116	1	a	Highly recommended 10/10  More detailed review to come.
5213	0	a	Horrid.  You are much better off with Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day.   1/10
4042	0	a	I unknowingly killed a dev and insulted the game in their face. I felt pretty guilty but then I thought, 'this game is so terrible adding Bubsy into it would make it better.'
2038	1	a	Love the gameplay, graphics and storyline.
5718	0	a	wtf y u uninstal bish
1026	1	a	It's great, my favorite game. Massive open world with loads of quest and a huge amount of gameplay available. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit of money on this amazing game.
211	1	a	I will openly admit that I had absolutely no intention originally of ever picking this game up... until it went on sale majorly discounted (Thank you, Steam!) and a friend told me to just give it a shot. I have to say, I rather enjoy it very much and I am kicking myself for not giving it a shot before.   The artstyle for this is what hit me first. It has such a bright and colorful atmosphere while still being able to be dark when it needs to be. I find myself looking around each and every new area I visit rather thuroughly and not being disappointed in the least. The designs of the characters, items and equipment are also very unique and the fact that Todd McFarlane had his hands in it really shows.  It has a story that really draws you in and it has such an ambiguous morality meter that you really feel your impacts on the world. the gameplay is just as fun and addictive as well adding a unique combo and weapon swap ability that just works and the magic use itself is spectacular. It is not without it's faults though as I found the quests themselves rather repetative. Other than that, it is definitely worth the full price that it is. :) 8.5/10
5065	1	a	i love every thing in this game i givce it a rate of 19/10
4809	1	a	I honestly thought this game looked awful at first. Then i played it! Its a freaking fantastic little game, its fun, its different and it has dinosours! what more could one ask for?! The meta critic reviewers are just pompus ignorant $#*!'s who rate CoD:ghosts 73 for christ sake! Ignore the professional reviews and look to the actual gamer reviews that are mostly positive. The game is best played with a group of friends as playing with randoms can get a little iritating but over all its a good game. For its price, its un-beatable!
876	1	a	This game is actually really fun. As a massive Skyrim fan, I found myself looking for more games like it. I bought this game a couple months ago and have played it off and on since. Let me tell you something: this game is not skyrim. No game is skyrim except for skyrim. Keep that in mind as you play this game. For $6 this game is a no-brainer. Buy it and you will not be disappointed.
3467	1	a	I nominate this game for: I only had 50 cents left award, cause you know ......MOAR GAMES
5996	1	a	Honestly, this game is really good. The gameplay isn't too bad, albeit a bit buggy. However, one thing to keep in mind. Yes, this game is buggy, but so was Dead Island. The difference is, Dead Island is $20.00, and this is $0.99. It has decent multiplayer, and replayability. So, I have to say, for being under a dollar, this game is incredible.
6055	1	a	Everything I wanted and more
4248	1	a	Actually reason it lagged due to video settings my bad turn them down if you don't have a very good pc.
4467	0	a	all comments in trailer are lies. this game is not worth to 1 dollar... lets just end it there...
5232	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
4292	1	a	Good game, couple of bugs, but you can get used to live along with it, great gameplay
1183	1	a	Just brilliant. 8.2 / 10  I have played this pre-steam and purchased again out of a little bit of nostalgia. I dont remember anything bad about Kingdoms at all, and it is nice to see that I can still pick it up and feel like I never put it down. Great character setup, inventory setup, crafting and magic array. The graphics are still a little on the 'cartoony' side in comparison to Skyrim for example, but honestly I prefer that. Its nice, pretty, but a well-polished beast of a game. Get it got.
5078	1	a	Punched a rude T-Rex then a Pterodactyl tried to show me this really cool cloud and he dropped me, overall a very good looking and feeling game. A solid title worth picking up.
1832	1	a	A lot of fun if you're looking for a hack and slash. Highly customizable classes... for example, you can do a hybrid rogue/mage, etc.
4910	1	a	This game's best quality (its price) is also its worst. Nobody knows how to play. Nobody seems to have their sound/monitors on to hear/see the giant 'Objective: 0%' sign in front of their faces. Nor can anyone hear 'protect the generator'. Its fascinating, really. Its like I'm playing this game on Xbox Live.
1933	1	a	A quick message to say I spend time on this game. I did not finish it, I take time to explore, try all the game mechanichs...  For now, I can say:  Pros: ====  * Good game mechanics  * Interesting story  * Great NPCs (some are a bit lame, thought)  * Looting...  * Crafting...  * ... -&gt; Great RPG  Cons: ====  * Walking...  * Some uninteresting quests  * Not so much cons...  If you like RPGs, open worlds, this game can make you happy :)
6120	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun game, with friends or with the bots. Sure there are more problems with the game than I would wish, but for $0.99 there isn't anything to complain about.
1258	1	a	This is a great action RPG game. It sort of feels like an evolution to Fable. I love the extra missions and the story line, there is quite a lot of weapon and magic variety and the interactions with the people are great, a lot of dialog and text for those that enjoy reading a game's lore.  I think they did a great job with the voices and the overall feel of the game play. It never becomes dull, you tired of playing warrior style? go switch to wizard for some gold. How about some Thief sneaky action today? Mix them for more fun.  Too many things to explore, many side missions, all of them adding some background story, more lore, more jokes. All of them very enjoyable (and yes, I did ALL of them)  Its a shame the studio went bankrupt I would have loved this to be a series of games.  10/10
2463	0	a	Despite having a relatively good computer, I found it really hard to play this game. Many of the reviews had good things to say, though, and I wish I was able to experience all that it is capable of.  Maybe I'll try again at another date!
4715	1	a	Its okay, it could use ALOT of work.  The Good Multiplayer/singleplayer Tons of weapons Tons of vehicles Customization Gamemodes  The Bad Weird Animations Being unable to connect to the servers  Buying outfits (Really Trek -_-) Glitchs/bugs Able to get to spots and survive for insane amounts of time TEH LAG!  Thats about all I can think of. No game is perfect, I like how Trek is stil working on this game and updating it.  My opinion: Would play 6.5/10
3950	0	a	1 of the worthless games i ever played too bad i cant get my mony back
5561	1	a	Have endless fun fighting dinosaurs in ORION: prelude. 3 main classes with lots of variations, woth the buy.
5828	0	a	I bought this game as 'Orion: DIno Horde'. Now, the dev has re-released it under yet a new name, and before I got it the game was Orion:Dino Beatdown. The good: A wave based survival game you can play with friends co-op. The bad: Most of the vehicles seem lifted from Halo, the dev keeps pulling and re-uploading the game to make negative reviews vanish, and now for their latest game they wholesale lifted assets from other developers and got caught, and are throwing a fit. Avoid this game to now reward them for their behavior, avoid the dev. I regre that I cannot refund it at this time due to getting too many hours into it.
1739	1	a	This game easily earns its place among the best fantasy RPGs ever made!
474	1	a	A.W.E.S.O.M.E .... Just awesome.
5971	1	a	Worth every single penny, Great time waster, Awesome multiplayer fun, and the most amazing level and weapons system ive seen in a game so cheap!
6004	1	a	I don't understand why most people hate this game.  -Dinosaurs -Jetpacks -Guns, vehicles, perks -&lt;Â£1 -Oh and did I mention dinosaurs and jetpacks?  WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
2303	1	a	Killed everyone with only a knife and 200 ping. Amazing.  21/10
3587	1	a	Don't trust in the Metascore rating, they're still upgrading the game. Best dino-killing game ever, give it a try!
4993	0	a	Your bullets teleport to the target, this game sucks.
2264	0	a	Terrible game. There's absolutely no skill involved in playing this. Don't waste your time with this terrible rendition of the classical Disciples.
359	1	a	âââââ  When i was playing mass effect 2 on xbox 360, I had chance to play kingdoms of amalur (as KOA) demo version. And this demo game gave me a good time. So i bought this one.   Anyway that's personal history. :) Return to the subject, 'KOA' presents the new fantasy world about 'Rule of Cycle', 'Immortal Fea', 'Crystal War', 'Fateless One'... and so on. And these things are showed with beautiful graphic (not mean good quality).  Also this game contains many thing to do. After tutorial, you will be faced a lot of quests. Even sometimes these quests make me confusing. You can collect regents or shards to create potions or gems. And you can breakdown equipment and salvage gears to make weapons or armors.  And battle system is good. Even this is a RPG game. You can against your enemy by combo, air combo, combat ability and reckoning mode. Various weapons, skills, destinies (like specialized jobs) give you joyful choice. Even you think 'I made a wrong choices', don't worry, you can return to level 1 with all skill points. And reckoning mode is awesome, you become a powerful one and you can do fate-shift (like finish blow). I always felt catharsis when i finished a strong enemy by fate-shift.  But 'KOA' also has bad things. First and Worst thing is '38 Studios (developer of 'KOA') was closed without 'KOA' licence sold. That means no more updates, DLCs and 'Kingdoms of Amalur II' :(  And character customization is awful. May be, you have bad feeling, when you make your player. Because character customization has very little selections to make your face. Then your worry become a problem of game play. You can see a NPC what have exactly same your face with different hair color. But that's not a problem, i can imagine he is a my doppelganger or unknown my brother who was seperated at childhood (in game story). But real problem is same faces NPCs are too many to focus story line. For example, You will meet a mentor who guide you in arcana faction quest, and he will send you to the archimage. (I skip many things to prevent spoiler). Then... you will see a same mentor face archimage with white hair. WTF, Even they are major NPCs of faction quest, they have same face!!! except hair color!!!! This problem will teases you until final battle.  Other thing is the low level cap. If you are a person who complete all quest in the game (not repeat quests), you can reach level 40 (max level), soon. In my case, i could reach level 40 after siege of mel senshir. Probably i could do that because i finished 'The Legend of Dead Kel' and 'Teeth of Naros' before cross the ocean. Then i lost my purpose of side quests and battles. Level cap must be higher than level 40 to make player can push forward.  Anyway 'KOA' is a good RPG game. If it was not, i didn't get all achievements of this game. 'KOA' is a new IP game what has potential to be a great franchise game. But it's a shame, future of 'KOA' is unclear.
3108	1	a	like halo and wave defense had a baby, that had a pet dinosaur, that tried to eat the baby, too far?
4753	1	a	This game is the reason I wake up in the morning.   Acid shooting dino/10
4139	1	a	It is fun enough said
556	1	a	An all round awesome ARPG. The worst thing I can say about it is that due to the poorly managed company behind it, we won't see any more to what could have been a longer lasting title.
5376	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
832	0	a	It's as if there was a guy who had a rediculous amount of money, loved video games and had unlimited amounts of time to do absolutely nothing with got really really stoned in the midst of an incredible acid trip and thought to himself, 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ I could do that.'  Then he sold everything he owned and tried doing exactly that.  He failed of course, but the manner in which he failed was so spectacular that it serves as a lesson to everyone in the industry: Rely on the foundation of money and you will fail.  Bottom line? GUI sucks my balls, story is meh and I was left in total dismay about almost everything in the game. Terrible. If it were free and I was paid $20 an hour to finish this game I would quit before lunchtime.
6059	1	a	this game is soo cheap that i recomended that you should buy it cuz so cod graphics u can even 360 no 4325432 no scope in the game if you added hacks to yea, cheap 99 cents mlg pro sniper gamex. recomended to be a mlg game. included dinos but u can no scope player also
894	1	a	high quality game for low quality people.
3285	0	a	SERIOUSLY? YOU SAY THE BEST GAME EVER? THIS IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BULL â¥â¥â¥â¥    if you want a REAL GAME of dino buy primal carnage but i don't name that a 'video game' this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bull â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5253	0	a	Buggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Couldn't play as a result. You better off with a free flash game.
2395	1	a	Objectively this game is pretty bad, mainly because of the bad AI and stiff animations, but due to it being co-op, and it's crazy concept &amp; gameplay, it still manages to be loads of fun. The developers still update it, too, and so far every update has added something good.
299	1	a	There is so much to do, I'm only 12 hours in and I haven't even touched down on the main story line, I've just been keeping myself busy with side quests and adventuring!
4628	1	a	It's not a deep game, but a very fun one. If you combine this with the good gameplay mechanics and decent graphics, this is a really good investment for $1.00.
5866	0	a	Worst game I ever played. Even CoD ghosts and Minecraft are better then this â¥â¥â¥â¥. VALVe give me my 1$ back
6331	1	a	This is a great game, dinos, weapons, pve and pvp, loadouts, levels, unlockables, classes. If you like these things, get it! For only 99 cents right now, it can't hurt, right?
5369	1	a	Cool Idea 
3704	1	a	To be completely honest this game really isnât that bad, it has become a better game than it was before. The graphics are decent, the music is great and the gameplay is pretty smooth and fun. The game still is a bit buggy but it is worth a buy in my opinion. 7/10
1373	1	a	This game has its flaws, but it sticks in my mind as one of the most underrated RPGs I've ever played. A well-crafted world with fascinating lore, fun combat, and loads of places to explore and quests to complete. A real gem.
3086	1	a	What BF3-4 Dinosaurs should be!
2541	1	a	I thought dinosaurs were the scariest thing about this game. Turns out it's the bugs.
1746	1	a	Not the greatest game by any means, but it's definitely worth a play through. The best way to describe this game is a hybrid of God of War and Borderlands IMO.
641	1	a	i recommend this game to all my friends its a really good game to play
3933	0	a	Don't buy this. save your 0.99p on the sale!
3005	1	a	Although I can barely handle this game on Low graphics, this game still looks good. The gameplay itself on the other hand, is AMAZING! I can see why they recommend a 6-core processor though xD
4043	0	a	This is so terrible.
5997	1	a	Find some friends, buy the four pack, you won't regret it!
3570	1	a	Pure dumb fun. I mean, how often do you come across a game where you get to use lighsabers and flamethrowers and mechs against dinosaurs? It is certainly worth the dollar.
2953	1	a	A friend gifted me this game, i played it once. game crashed twice and lagged the hell out of my game. I swear I had like 4 FPS. I don't have a bad computer, and i rarely have a problem with this type of thing. Dinosour haelo is fun. 
1801	1	a	Multiplayer please!!! will be the besT!!!!!
2204	1	a	I dont know why, but I prefer play Disciples II... but this is not bad at all.  Much bugs was imporved and fixed after the Renaissance and Resurrection!  Reincarnation &gt; Resurrection &gt; Renaissance
4771	1	a	nice game for the price :)
197	0	a	Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.
2671	0	a	Dinosaurs AI is very bad, they only walk in straight lines. Clipping issues with dinosaurs. Graphics could be so much better since this game was release in 2012. The maps are boring, plain open fields of nothingness. The gameplay is clunky and unrealistic. Weapons seem like they don't have any weight and I think bullets travel foward until they hit something. The dinosaur theme itself, not that interesting but I decided to give it a try anyways and wasn't really disapointed cuz i was expecting anything good from the start. Wouldn't even pay 0,01 for it.  (anyone who wants to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this will be talking to the hand cuz i have better thing to do than listen to lil fan boy kids.)
562	1	a	KoA is going to be remembered not for the game, but for the complete collapse of the studio and the fallout from that. Which is a shame, because KoA is a decent game. Right away I'd like to point out, it's essentially Fable + MMO, all single player. Combat is generally quick and easy, quests are your standard fetch and kill fare, and the world is generic high fantasy. That said, it's also lovingly crafted and just flat out fun to play. Even on the hardest setting the game is easy, and as quick as I am to decry games being dumbed down, it can be incredibly satisfying at times to just tear through hordes of enemies. The skill system has some decent depth to it, as does the gear. The world is beautiful and the sound design is solid. The game can feel grindy, again, it's basically a single player MMO, but it's also fun if you're into that sort of thing. If nothing else, pick it up cheap for some awesome chakram action.
5257	0	a	Don't buy this, no one plays
2441	1	a	My friend said to me 'hey Protahto! this will be the best decision you ever made', I believed him. I have since killed myself from the hatred I bear for this game. Has some neat holiday themed updates. Fun times ahead. 8/10
5539	1	a	It wont work I hate it
3789	1	a	Just One Word...... AWESOME!!!
5406	1	a	This game is really cheap will be one of the greatest/funniest experiences for you if you have a friend with you on call, and just play for fun, the mechanics are ridiculously funny when you're in a good mood.  Play this game with a friend, preferably on call, that makes this the most fun.

389	1	a	This game has completely engulfed my being. It's all I want to do. Play it.
415	1	a	One of the most overlooked game.
1626	1	a	Awesome game, simple fun and adictive
6008	1	a	Ridiculously low price, has a lot of potential.  seriously why wouldn't you play a game that costs only a dollar but is over 2gb of dinosaurs?!!?
6165	1	a	Awesome Game. Just buy and enjoy it.
3092	1	a	controls are confusing, and it lags SOOOOOOOOO much for meh, but i dont dislike it. its really laggy, but i enjoy it...
6028	1	a	The game has a broken rocket launcher and super glitchy cars with rocket boosters, nothing more needs to be said.  10/10 would play again for hilariousness
643	1	a	Awesome game, have some great battles in it, love the lore of the game fighting is quite fun and always looks awesome although its easy combat really, but for any fan of RPG's get this must have game its a gem!
4731	1	a	This game is LOADS of fun its like a combonation of Halo and Jurassic Park!
5673	1	a	I spent 10 dollars on this game in 2014, money that I worked for.
2240	1	a	cool game love the series and the story line.
2862	1	a	.50 cents on a sale to play hours of tons of gamemodes with friends. Sign me Up
2194	1	a	Story: 7/10. Can be compelling at times, and bland at other times. It can be a mess with so much going on, and it lacks emotional depth that would normally get you invested in the story.  Visuals &amp; Sound: 7/10: It looks fairly good, but animations tend to feel repetitive after a while. Same goes for weapon and spell effects. It seems a bit uninspired considering how similar it looks to games like World of Warcraft, but if you're okay with that then no issues here. It definitely looks above average. The soundtrack is decent, nothing bad nor is it memorable.  Gameplay: Probably some of the most fun I've had in a combat RPG, ever! The skill progression system and character customisation (combat-based, that is) is spectacular. You can mix and match your character's abilities to range from a regular fighter, to a dirty rogue, to a mystical mage, and everything in between. This definitely has some of the most rewarding combat, level-up, and looting experiences in recent RPG games.  Conclusion: I would buy this game for the gameplay alone. Sure, it doesn't have the most amazing story or unique brand of visuals, but the gameplay value is stunning and will keep you coming back for more. If you enjoy combat-RPGs that give you the freedom to manuever around in combat and rely on your own reflexes and ingenuity to get by, then this is it.
2267	0	a	I wish I could recommend Disciples III, since I love the world they built, but the truth of the matter is that this game is an unholy grindfest. With 50 hours under my belt, I've managed to complete 1 of the four campaigns, allowing me to deliver a person from Point A to Point B. That's it. That's all that can be meaningfully said to have happened in the story.
3838	1	a	This is the creation of the smartest minds of this generation working together to create the worst game in history.  10/10 I was mindblown. 
4663	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
4806	0	a	Get to the chopper

5717	1	a	Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead really i have mixed feelings on this games so eat some pancakes!  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.
4554	1	a	I think this is a fun small game. Sure theres not much to do but its still can be fun.
2292	1	a	Open the door, get on the floor. Everybody walk the dinosaur
2555	1	a	THIS GAME was pretty so so, yeah, my friends didn't want to play it anymore
3202	1	a	its just awesome plain and simple
1819	1	a	A solid action RPG in all respects, Kingdos of Amalur is a fun little gem that gives you a nice big world to explore, a big pile of questlines and sidequests to get on with, a few interesting pieces of DLC and nice, smooth combat. It brings absolutely nothing new to the genre, but if you're an avid fan of smacking loot confetti monsters in the face and scratching a completionist itch, you could be doing much worse than this.  The story doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ around. It right up shows you the main antagonist laughing on his evil throne of Anal â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the Innocent, you've got your snobby immortal elves, clever tinkering midgets, and bigoted, dumb humans, all the good stuff. Little story arcs and points of interest meet you on your travels and characters are likeable enough. Again, it's cliche, safe, but executes what you'd expect just fine.  The crafting system is simple enough, letting you customise gear you want based on what items you have. Loot comes in the WoW-esque colour branded system where you'll stick to your PRECIOUS PURPLEZ even though they're for characters ten levels lower than you. Levelling up is braindead basic, with three talent trees (Roughly fitting into the categories of punching â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the faces, zapping â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the ether, and stabbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the back) and upgrading some skills you require along the way, like lockpicking, aforementioned crafting, persuasion, yadda yadda.  'Open world' is perhaps a little bit of an oversell. You can run around all the lovely locales at your own pace, but if you do venture a little too far, you will end up getting one-shotted by the most common of enemies if you're not quite up to standard in level and gear. The areas are at least pretty for the most part, but you might get sick of seeing the same generic caves or mines over and over.  It's got better combat than The Elder Scrolls games, and goodness knows people need to be yanked away from sucking that schpinter perhaps just a tad. I did find myself getting just a little bit bored of performing the same patterns of attacks and dodges, which whilst felt lovely to execute, you wish maybe the enemy AI would spruce things up just a little bit.  Perfect and new it isn't, but I picked this lesser-known title with all of it's DLCs for a tenner and it's eaten up plenty precious hours of my life, and I haven't even completed it yet.  (Of course, in typical EA curse fashion, despite this game getting plenty of good reviews, the company behind it went bankrupt and the brand is six feet under, so if you don't feel like feeding your hard-earned cash into their stockholder and executive board, maybe you want to pass up on buying this straight from Steam. You stay classy, EA!)
4337	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
4028	0	a	Horrible balance. I watched 10 dinos attacking one soldier and it never phased him while the dinos dropped like flies to a shotgun. Don't waste your time. While I get the idea its just not fun to be on a side so severly handicapped.
5038	1	a	LOl there is one question..... why is this game so demanding????????? i play chrysis 3 on medium settings with better fps then this game with low
5108	0	a	This is Bad

2170	1	a	It's always a good time with KoAR.
3488	0	a	boring
5197	1	a	A great game to play with friends, sure it may be clunky but all in all a hilarious shooter where you can fight dinosaurs with mechs and tanks etc.
1056	1	a	I have played this for many hours on my ps3, and still cant get enough of it. The developers did an exellent job on the storyline, and not to mention over 100s of side quests. if you think skyrim was awesome then i would HIGHLY recommend this i have over 50 hours of game play on my ps3 and have not beat everything in the game yet. THIS is one of those huge games that is full of loot, battles, and quests... GET THIS GAME! one of my favorites would be this game and im sure it will be yours too!
3219	1	a	It all started back in 2014, I got this game because my friends told me to. After playing it for the first time i was addictted and i started seeing the world was boring unless i was playing ORION Dino Horde, my life was centered around it. Ruined my life 10/10
5119	0	a	I dont like this game and I dont recommend it to anyone,you will have to pay it for 6 days,you just shoot in this game it has no point,so if you like first person shooter games without a story this is for you,but if you dont you shouldnt play it.It should be free to play,because its to stupid to pay for it.
5249	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
3459	1	a	On it's price, I expected it to be another bad game on cheap sale price.  But it was actually Killing Floor with dinos and futuristic guns.   Very decent game, especially on it's price. You can customize your character, your guns and even your enemy dinos! Also graphics are pretty good and in this game there is even nice looking rain. Game has fun multiplayer too.  Game is based on planet where future humans fight against dinos. I don't know plot as this game doesn't have single player campaign but it's doesn't need one. Gameplay is pretty simple. Shoot some dinos, upgrade your skills (these reset in every game but you can unlock weapons so you don't need to buy ones) and defend your base. Notice that in every dino wave there will be stronger dinos like T-Rex. Also you can have mechs and cars by unlocking objectives. Also if you're playing solo, you can just free roam and kill dinos that gets on your way. There are also classes but you're gonna find them out ingame, but myself I like Assault as I can have jetpack.  This game has also workshop and map editor which is awesome. Steam cards and VAC to protect players against cheaters are also good. Only negative is that game runs poorly on high settings and I can run Skyrim on max settings 60fps.  Every player who likes Killing Floor, Black Ops Zombies or even Left 4 Dead should get this game. Also people that like any sort of FPS games should also buy this! It's cheap and worth on it's original price. 8/10
2036	1	a	i love this game , one of my best game &lt;3
176	1	a	Awesome game. It's like the artistic style of Fable and Oblivion got blended together with the playstyle of open worldness of Skyrim and, to some degree, combat mechanics capturing the essence of God of War. The story is enthralling and the gameplay completely open for you to choose how you wish to approach it. Not to mention that it looks completely amazing, and the load screens are seconds long, never having one longer than 10 seconds, even with the settings maxed out on my somewhat dated machine. Something I wasn't expecting when I got this game, was how mature the story and some of the kills are, though tastefully done. If anything, I'd call it a positive that they made this game more adult oriented. I really love this game, thus far, and it has tons of replay pottential. The only thing I find that could detract my love for this game is the apparent time it takes to complete, which I've seen many say is about 200 hours of gameplay. Be warned of that.
3454	1	a	do you want to see how it is in jurassic park with a Scifi twist then you would enjoy this game where you feel immersed with the first person view where your helmet visor freezes over from the snow or get's rain drops that blur your vision when its raining. I Recommend this game for the Co-Op modes it does have PvP modes but in my opinion they aren't as fun as working with your friends fending off dinos to protect your base.
3440	1	a	 Worth much more than 1 Euro/Dollar
2436	1	a	Really cool game tbh. Looks cheap bad etc... BUt truly its a great game with a bit of call of duty in it and some nice graphics really cool ideas and creative!
4213	1	a	anything with dinosaurs and guns is AWESOME

5696	0	a	I cannot think of a more horrifying experience. I'd rather have militant terrorists penetrate my eye sockets than play this again. My neighbors all moved out of my neighborhood and the value of my house is degrading because of how severely awful this game is. An â¥â¥â¥â¥ is more exciting than this game. This game is probably used in small African societies to scare small children into walking 40 miles to get a bucket of well water. It is easier to untangle 10 miles of braided steel cable than it is to enjoy this game. I would easily never recommend this to anyone. I do not understand why this game ever was accepted through steam green light, but it seems to me that whoever accepted it has a major mental deficiency. This game is so terrible that I don't even know if it is legal to make something on this level of scum. If I wrote anymore on this review, then I would be giving the game unnecessary attention that it clearly does not deserve.
475	1	a	Pretty fun hack n slash style RPG! Very beautiful landscape. I am in love.
2349	1	a	For $0.99 you can go buy a chicken sandwich or shoot T-Rexs with a grenade launcher while flying through the air with a jet pack strapped to your back. Its not even a tough call.
4125	1	a	Pros: Shank Dinosaurs Funny Accents Better version of League of Legends Masterpiece of Videogrames Gave me cancer Pterodactyls show you the world Aladdin Style Best game EUNE  Cons: Not enough dinosaurs Expensive  10/10. Tim Allen Approves 
4126	0	a	heavly bugged and has no orginal content that isn't stolen from other games
5710	1	a	It has dinosaurs in it.
5234	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
6244	1	a	this game is just starting out and has great potential. Being able to kill players and dinosaurs what more can you ask for.
6060	1	a	For what i payed i'm proud to have bought a 4 pack and getting my crew started in this game! This has been one of the most impressive alpha progression i've seen. Also there is a bigger project behind this and from what they offre us here i c'ant wait the see the rest! One of my best alpha investments. Thanks to the dev.crew for such dedicated work! 9/10 !!!!!!!!!
693	1	a	The game reminds me of the Fable series. There is a mass of side quest and the story seems interesting so far.
4689	1	a	FRICKING REDIC LAGG JHOLY CRAP IT TAAKES A WHOLE SECOND FOr MY MOUSE TO START TO FOLLOW MY MOVEMENTS EVEN WITH EVERYTHING DOWN ITS STILL SUPER SLOW! PLEASE FIX, as well as the controller support! 
4549	1	a	What is there left to say. I payed less than 1â¬ for this and it delivered such. Nothing to regret.
6208	0	a	Let me just say there is a good reason that they only show off community reviews on the store page: every slightly educated video gamer knows this is a functionally bad game. The metacritic score is correct and should not be tampered, and no this isn't a different game than the Orion before it. While this game has many features, none of them work together in the slightest. It seems as though this is just a marketing scam for a garbage game that tries to attract every single 10-year-old shooter player. I played during a free weekend, and I can confidently say that I will never look at this title again. I wouldn't pay 5 cents for it.
3458	1	a	I avoided this game for months. When it became free to play, I got hooked. I don't think I can go back to CounterStrike after playing this. Too much fun with friends here. Not much to the game at all, and once you figure out how to counter, it gets extremely easy even on higher settings, but for some reason I'm hooked.
4026	1	a	if you like survivel games this one is pretty good along the lines of cod zombies and killing floor to name a few. this game breaks up the dull wave by wave play by adding objectives, cap the out post and kill the large boss dinos or the wave will just keep respawning. all in all this is a pretty good buy.
3497	1	a	Great game for the price, lots of fun!

5174	1	a	Very fun to play with friends you will have lots of laughs but playing alone can be sort of dull.
1092	0	a	It has a huge bug that does not allow you to complete the game. This bug is well known but has not been fixed. Keep that in mind if you purchase this game!
208	1	a	It's a pretty standard Fantasy Action Game experience - you pick from a couple of Totally Unique Racial Categories, make some basic cosmetic changes (hair, skin tone, etc.) and then you go smash the crap out of things.  Character progression is somewhat reminiscent of Torchlight with a bit of The Witcher for good measure. You can 'multiclass' between Tough Smashy Style, Sneaky Stabby Style, and Explody Magic Style.  The lore is more-or-less your standard fantasy novel business - there's good (not-)elves and bad (not-)elves and the bad (not-)elves are going HAM on your homeland. Good thing you're a Chosen One and can stand up to those naughty naughty (not-)elves! Did we mention that you have a Mysterious Past that you have to uncover? Of course you do.  It's going to be tainted by comparison to Skyrim, as they're both Epic Fantasy Smashy Smash games. Skyrim excels in having a truly open world (much of KOA is pretty much linear - the old invisible fence is full in effect here) and near-limitless modification capacity. KOA excels at having a much more enjoyable combat system - lots of fancy combos and trick moves. There's a 'rage meter' mechanic that's kind of neat in a silly 'Mortal Kombat' way - you charge up your murders and then you go into Super Murder Mode, where you get, of all things, a quicktime event where you have to mash buttons to Extra Super Duper Murder someone for bonus XP.  It's silly, even for Epic Fantasy Gaming, but it's probably worth snagging on sale.

1541	1	a	awesome so far
1503	1	a	Reckoning is really one of those games where you, as a player, are encouraged to enjoy the game however you want to play it. No matter how you distribute your talents, there's a destiny (set of class related perks and bonuses). Truly a fun game, and the plot is actually pretty good.   Side quests galore, spent 110 hours playing this game and I didn't even finish off some of the secondary plot chains. Even the side quests have plots. It's a great overall experience for an RPG, it plays like a hybrid of Fable and Dark Souls with the difficulty at manageable to easy and adds in a pretty good amount of lore and story to keep you interested but not bored of the plot. It was enough story for me to read what NPCs were saying, and Lorestones give you some quick story bits relative to the area.   Weapons are really satisfying when they connect with opponents and vary greatly in damage, range and speed. Combat can be fast paced or you can take your time getting just the right moment to strike. Spells offer limited variety in the elements (Earth, Lightning, Ice, Fire, Poison) and have some interesting mechanics.  Resisted buying this game for quite some time, I don't like to support EA, but it was a worthwhile investment.
132	1	a	This game was such a beautiful let- down. the scenery was gorgeous, the side quests were more befitting a hero than Elder- scrolls side quests ('Go slay these giant spiders.' vs. 'Hey, would you mind carrying this bag up those stairs? kthx.'). and all the classes started with unique abilities and weaponry. But about midway through the game, you start realizing how lop- sided the class options are. Stealth is nice for killing one dude, but there will always be 15 other 'hive- minded' dudes in the area ready to swarm you. The mage is flashy and interesting, but you only get four real attack spells, and only one of those deserves constant use. To make matters worse, despite you having the ability to be the grand archmage of everything ever, you dont get access to any of the spells that enemies use. like teleportation across the battlefield, and auto- targeting tornadoes. The only class ready to stand against anything is the might class. Anything close to you gets pulverized by your hammer (the only weapon option with a decent speed vs. damage output trade), and anything out of its short range gets yanked in by a hookshot. It is a powerful combo that breaks down targets that will always laugh off magic or stealth approaches. Now for the ability sets. lock picking and spell breaking protected chests is a matter of probablility, so quick saving and loading makes points into that moot, same for stealing, so putting points into these is worthless. the only decent options are sagecraft and smithing to make decent gear, a point in persuasion ( to gain access to yet another probability game) and detect hidden to find better gear and more money.   TL;DR- Get this game when it's 50- 75% off. Gameplay gets boring, but exploring the environments will be worth while, and it's pretty long, to boot.
393	1	a	There are already several excellent in-depth reviews here on Steam so I'll keep this short.  I really enjoyed playing through this game. The story is done well and offers some fresh takes on your standard fantasy fare, the world is huge with plenty of places to go and things to do. The DLCs are worthy expansions that add new world areas with yet more places to go and things to do, along with some nice loot for your troubles. There is a tremendous amount of content here.  You don't pick a class for your character, like in the elder scrolls games you build your class up from skills, and you can mix and match pretty much however you want. The skills can be easily be reset at any point for a nominal fee if you want to try something different.  Combat is fast and fluid, nothing turn-based here. You need to learn to dodge and hit your enemies from behind, or use a ranged weapon or magic and blast them from afar. It's also possible to get a teleport dodge that does damage as you pass though enemies. You can equip two weapons at a time in any combination and switch between them fluidly in combat. Once you've filled a gauge, you can unleash awesome kill moves to quickly take down difficult enemies.  The graphics are bright and colorful and look good, with an art style that reminds me of WoW. The animations and effects are well done so combat is fun to watch.  There's a few cons, the biggest one being game balance. Early on, the game is fairly well balanced, but each zone has a level cap on the monsters and loot which spawns there which you can easily exceed before finishing all the quests in that area. This makes the later parts of the game laughably easy unless you've just been rushing through the main story missions. Also, the developer unfortunately went bankrupt making this game so there will be no fixes, sequels or additional content, which is a real shame given how great this game is all things considered.  Overall, an excellent game with a few small issues that can be easily overlooked. Make sure to get the DLC as well.
5690	0	a	dis the worst gam eva
15	0	a	A very odd take on poker mechanics crossed with RPG battles. I just dont care for the strategy here. Just another game where I get to an impossible point after a couple hours with no clue what I could be doing wrong. Eh, I give. Uninstalled. I'd sooner suggest people try Puzzle Quest 2 for this kind of asthetic.
3364	1	a	This game might be one of the best value games on the Steam store. I would call it a mix of Halo and Counter-Strike with Dinosaurs. For the most part the vehicles are very cool. I like the aircraft and the mech in particular, though the jeep feels kind of clunky. There is a nice variety of maps to play and they are rendered very nicely. The guns are where it's really fun. I just can't get enough of the fully automatic shotgun. The big dinosaurs are tough to take down and it's rewarding when you do. I definitely enjoy this game a lot more than what I thought I would. And for a regular price of $1 you just can't go wrong with this, assuming you like shooters.
793	1	a	game runs like a knife cuts through butter, stable 200+ fps on a 780Ti, gameplay-wise one of the most enjoyable RPG's I have ever played. Really cool and versatile combat mechanics, every piece of gear looks friggin' awesome. Semi-linear open world with fun quests, great voice acting, and a lot of side quests to kill time with. All the basic RPG elements combined with a really addicting blacksmith system. KoA will always have a place in my heart.
4702	1	a	Some of the most fun I have had in any FPS besides the half life series.  It's worth 5 times the pricetag.  You get dual pistols, flamethrowers, jetpacks, and mechs, and you fight FRICKING dinosaurs, with beautiful gameplay, this is one of the best co-op FPS's ever made.
278	1	a	It's a really good game I personally love the open the open world the combat is quick and nice I recommend this game. 
3136	1	a	Great game
6353	1	a	Though the old version of this game was not a well-liked game, this one is quite the oppposite. It's not fantastic, but it certainly is for paying $0.99! I'm not saying it isn't fun, because it certainly is, but it simply does not have as much content as more expensive games. But thta's why those games are more expensive. Overall, I like the GUI, except the buttons could be labeled for PC gamers as well (in the menu, it shows A and B button indicators for console), and the HUD could use more concise labeling. I had trouble telling which bar was which. It is a fun game, and I plan on playing it for a while.
1163	1	a	I like this game. Is really nice but when you play it longer it will be all the same.
1005	1	a	This game is great and i have only played for a couple hours but those couple will turn into at least 40 because this game is a lot of fun. The combat is really good and fun. quests are good and plentiful there is always something to do. I like the art direction as well. This is a must have for any RPG fan
6212	1	a	Beats playing Dino D-Day Worth getting :D DX11 Support, Unreal Engine, You can ride on a T-REX and destory humans together, you can drive bikes/cars etc, totally epic game well worth checking out.
776	0	a	Boring, slow, clunky, and obviously something it was never meant to be. This was not meant to be a single player RPG, it was meant to be an MMORPG, and not even a good one, and not even for the PC. No MMO on the PC has this poor of an interface, this strange of movement, and this bad of an economy. Crafting and gold donât scale fast enough to match shop prices, so donât expect to buy more than one piece of gear when you go into town. Ultimately, my biggest issue is that the areas are so narrow. Compare to all MMOs, and you will find the every zone ringed by hills, most of which cannot be scaled. The difference is that, until a zone transitions, they are far away. If you stand in the center, you will need to walk a good distance to reach the cliffs. The walk from the middle to the edge is less than the distance to my bookcase.  Boring, poorly made, and poorly adapted. Shameful waste of the 5 bucks I spent on it.
6022	1	a	WOW. Just wow! I bought it for a friend and myself when it was only 50 cents. Honestly I just had waaaaaay more fun than many expensive games could ever give me. I [absolutely] recommend this game. Its easy to learn, its hard to master. Its managing your money for skills, weapons or vehicles, and when you die, you lose your bought skills and weapons, but the weapons are still at the place where you died. It's absolutely 100% impossible if you try this game alone. Luckily, there are many servers and different game mode. It also is very easy to setup a server yourself, that friends can join. I have never...EVER given a game higher than an 7. 9/10 for general 10/10 in my experience
2994	1	a	It's essentially killing floor, but cheaper and with dinosaurs and a car...and jetpacks...and no patriarch. It's actually nothing like killing floor. 8/10 Would recommend to people who like Killing Floor.
2885	1	a	This game is certainly worth 10 cents.
5917	1	a	starsiege tribes with dinosaurs  really loads of fun to play  game looks, sounds, plays and runs great  so ignore the metascore / bad press / negative reviews and check it out, at just $1 is a steal!
154	1	a	took me about 150hrs to complete the whole game and dlc:s.very enjoyable,biggest downfall it comes a bit too easy about halfway there even on hard difficulty.recommend.
1392	1	a	Fun game, only gripe being that the unique items are all so low level, so there's no gear to get once you get past level 20 or so. I don't want to have to use Prism Weapons, they look terribad but you don't get a choice because the crafted stats are OP :T
6397	1	a	its a nice game , but why is it so cheap :o i was expecting it to be 20$ or something its really good for a 0.99$ game
1599	1	a	Freeeakingohmaigahd! XD Wow, this is... Okay, let's breathe for a second...  Okay, so Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is quite an experience... And I mean that in the way that says... Well what I said above. It is an amazing game, definitely worth a look if you got 6 bucks, or 12 if you want all the dlc, because EA LOOOOOVES money. XP It's still a well done game, not as open as it could be for being a 'open-ish world' game, but that does not detract from the game itself. This is truly a game that should be enjoyed by all RPG fans. THIS NEEDS TO BE IN YOUR LIBRARYIFYOULIKERPGS!  *takes a breath*  However. Despite the amazing combat and weaponry, there is a downside or two that I can think of... One, it is a bit... Cartoon-y for how serious it is taking itself... It should be more Dark Souls-esque if it wanted to really be all 'badass story-ness-ess-ess-ess...-ess'. Two, the story itself, fairly weak, but also perhaps that is the fault of it being so long, and needing to spread out it's luscious goodness of combat and stuff all over the place. Three, if you watch The Angry Joe Show, you know this next one. The characters are all... Pretty average. No real deep, meaningful connections like in say, the Fallout series, or the Elder Scroll series, or otherwise.  Another upside that I forgot to mention is the arcane and the regular lockpicking systems. They are actually pretty challenging, and you will find yourself getting cursed or locked out of chests often if you are not careful with your timing/placement of picks.  Overall, this game, as Joe said, is a great game, just needs some more backing to help with it's look as well as it's feel. But so far, this is looking like an amazing game. And with only a bit of time left for the sale, I would say at the very least try out the demo, if there is one avaliable, or if not, then watch some reviews and see if you like it. Quickly. Like right now. X3 Anyway, I found my newest game addiction, and if you are a fan of actual control of your character, a host of secret places, tough fights, easy money, and Brownies, then this fantasy title DESERVES your attention. ^^
307	1	a	I've always felt RPGs to be a bit different than other types of games. They require time, dedication, and skill. But in return, they give you one of the greatest possible benifits- no, not a drip for your sensory systems or endorphins, but an endless creativity and a bueatiful world. That being said, creating a game is different from creating a painting. It can't just look good, it must be fun to play, fun to interact with, fun to experience. And while when many think of RPG, TES comes to mind, I think Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games that is sorely missed. It carries you into a colerfull, viberant, world, ripe with imagination and ready for the taking. It gives you what is, in my opinion, a better system than any other game- it allows you to have the freedom of skyrim, but also the classical class system and skill trees. The gameplay is fun, the world is simply gourgeous, and the lore is plentiful. This is one hell of a game you would not want to miss.  (NOTE: I am a PC gamer, however, I find this game is much more enjoyable with Xbox 360 controller. Its not meant for it, but it sure should be!)
4625	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
5873	1	a	melee is so op but awesome, THIS GAME IS GREAT! =D
395	1	a	Decent story - relatively satisfying conclusion - and enjoyable gameplay with gorgeous scenery throughout. Immense customization is available and the combat is fast paced, intuitive, and rewarding. It is easy to change your 'fate' and try a different play style at any point in the game - I switched back and forth from magic and finesse more times than I can count - and the different unlockable options for combat are really enjoyable. More than just a hack-and-slash, this game encourages you to consider particular approaches for particular enemies based on their weapon type and behavior. At the upper levels you have four or five different moves for any given weapon, all executed through a simple interface - click, pause click, click while dodging, click while blocking, click after parrying. Combined with a wide variety of spells and special abilities, you have numerous options for engaging with a particular enemy, or multiple enemies at once.  It was hard to really get a feel for my character, though, since it is clear that in order to complete quests and gain experience, there is a very particular sort of person your character is supposed to be. More options for how to complete certain quests would have been nice.   Overall though, it was a great experience and my first playthrough lasted 78 hours. And I'm thinking about playing through it again because I know I missed so much and never even gave the 'might' skill tree a chance! 8/10 would recommend.
2039	1	a	If you like a world where you can run around doing quests but there is still a bit of structure to keep you on track then this is the game for you. A friend describes it as baby's first Skyrim and I think that is probably an apt description. A jolly good time and it looks quite pretty too
1159	1	a	Very likeble RPG! momvent on PC is fluid + combat system is very effective love it!
3803	0	a	wanna waste your money? Well, this game is for you!
4360	0	a	its a dollar. still plays like â¥â¥â¥ though. why do i have hours into this? thats a good question.
147	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur confuses me.  It is a game I couldn't imagine *anyone* asking for. Not in 2012, anyway, it is not a game to enter the Dragon Age and Skyrim league: Its art design is tepid and barely par for course, the story is not really that good, the UI is a consolized mess, there is no stat sheet (!!!), mod support is ZERO, there is very few skills and combat can be overly easy at times.  Now, with that out of the way, this is one of the best action RPGs I've ever played, and one I've certainly played way, way past the point where I should have stopped. The best comparison I could draw with a similar game would be Fable, really, since there's a lot of elements in common with it: Quick, flashy combat, three skilltrees you can invest points in (finesse, might, sorcery), two weapons you can switch between on the fly, a few magic spells (2, until a bit further on), you'll be on your own most of the time, and combat is strictly real time. The only part the game looks a bit more developed is on the skills category, where you can find several ways to improve your adventuring and crafting abilities. The greatest achievement of this game over Fable however, is that while Fable lost itself dillydallying over customization and tattoos and farting in the face of villagers, Kingdoms of Amalur disregards all that in favor of an incredibly tight gameplay and a very flexible, if not perfect, skill tree and progression, which provides an open-ended freeform progression to the player while at the same time opening new abilities and overall feeling way meatier than Skyrim's, whose progression was more of a polite indicator that you were getting better at shooting with a bow by way of shooting more with a bow.  Now, this review will be based on my 50-odd ingame hours so far. I have played with a ranged/daggers rogue complemented with some magic spells and Might talents. As you can see, I'm a kinda indecisive player, and chosen a class that's been historically looked down upon on RPGs. One, or both of those choices would have made it very difficult for me in other games: being spread too thin in Skyrim, or playing an archer on Dragon Age would make things exceedingly difficult for me. Not with KoA. There is a class that favors all-rounding. Specializing in bows doesn't mean you can't put points in swords. Or magic. And if you choose straight combat, you can utterly annihilate anything with basic combat. You can respec a pretty good number of times, too, and clever players will be able to squeeze every profession in order to get the most of them and the best equipment. But I must admit, reaching that conclusion required a bit of patience from me. The game starts very insipid and generic, and as I said, none of the first impressions I got was really that enticing, but if one can look past that, beneath the apparent simplicity and half-assedness there is an incredibly strong and extense base material: graphics are more than competent, the soundtrack is perfectly functional with moments of greatness, quests are pretty interesting if you decide to listen to them and finally, at the center of it all, the delicious, chocolatey core of it and its main driving force for me: the gameplay, and specifically, the combat.  Combat is fast and flowing, camera never gets in the way and animations and attacks are very well done. All abilities have a place on it, and a lot of approaches are viable. They might say it's a game designed with a controller in mind, but I've found the keyboard layout extremely confortable (unlike in, say, Devil May Cry), and since it's way more actiony and mobile than other games', it is also extremely satisfying: even if you are decimating groups of wolves in 5 seconds flat, you'll feel like a badass doing so instead of getting bored because it's too easy. Yes, my character has 4 active offensive skills and 2 sustained ones, but I can kick so much â¥â¥â¥ in so many different ways between them and my ultra-powerful handcrafted equipment that it never feels old or boring. And besides, it's better to never let your guard down: it's as easy to lose half your life as leaving your guard down for a moment.  To sum it up, if you are a fan of exploring places and killing monsters I'm not just going to ask you to buy it, but to get all its DLC (especially on sale) and to be a bit patient with it. Empty your mind, shed your preconceptions and have a bit of fun with it, start doing the first missions, you don't even need to pay a lot of attention to it. Play the game for a bit, and you most assuredly will get a satisfying experience out of it. If you ever got excited about Fable, or if you are in the mood for having a good time whacking critters over the head with weapons of incredible power, pick it up without a doubt.  8.5/10
5084	1	a	A bit buggy at this stage, but at its heart a bundle of mindless fun!
3636	1	a	I nominated it for the 'i'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.  I'll never see that 49 cents again :(
6386	1	a	Best game a dollar can buy. :) Would like to play again.
5337	1	a	Awesome Co-Op game to be played, the [0.99 USD] is totally worth the price. Its 1 Dollar US but 2 Dollars in AUS. Same price as a Candy Bar.
1194	1	a	Such an underrated game, the combat is fun and challenging and the environment is mysterious and deep. Feels slightly linear from time to time, but i dont see that as a bad thing. I often get distracted to easily and end up spending many hours doing f**k all :) worth a play. Real shame it got overshadowed by the release of skyrim back in the day.
507	1	a	Spent SOOOO much time in this game... didn't want to leave. Never finished out all the achievements or even all the stuff for the dlc that I could have. Other games beckoned.  Graphics- decent Combat- decent Options- all right Crashes... happened. I've learned to save  Would I recommend this to someone looking to play something where they can wander a bit open world? Certainly. A good sale would sweeten it , did for me. Just watch out for the trolls....they have a mean streak.
1728	1	a	a good RPG overall, too bad combat gets too easy at high levels, even at the hardest difficulty avialable  main storyline is nice, not great but definetely enjoyable, and there are dozens of side quests that can really keep you busy for some time  7/10
5116	1	a	If you combine Call of Duty Zombies, Halo, Turok, and Jurassic Park, you get this game.
1353	1	a	Really nice graphics, huge world, and lots of side-quests. The combat is pretty cool too, the way you can mix the types and choose what suits the best. All in all, I'd totally recommend this game.
4807	1	a	Very great game to play for only $1 its got the best graphics
321	1	a	Very fun and addictive combat. Story is good yet suffers from a lot of the typical and overdone gater/kill x quests. The world, however is very deep and rich. The voice acting ranges from laughable to good or great.  The inventory system leaves much to be desired but isn't any worse than unmodded Skyrim.  Overall, it's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to replay to try out the different classes.
5762	0	a	I played Counter Strike Nexon:Zombies longer than this.                 And Counter Strike Nexon:Zombies won't even start up. best.
2487	1	a	there be dinosaurs; u shoot them more importantly, u could almost buy a candy bar, or get this game instead
3335	1	a	Bought it for $0.50, more fun than games I've paid $30+ for, this thing is simply amazing.
5551	1	a	epic thats all i can use to describe it 
6268	1	a	Defenitly a good game, much like Killing Floor. Need a lot of teamwork to succed against late wave, or else its a bloodbath.
2464	1	a	Didn't think I'd like this CS:GO-inspired kind of game, but oddly, the first time I loaded it up and played a little bit, it was like the first time I played Zombies. It's so simple yet addicting and for $0.49, no one can argue that price.
4683	1	a	sWAG
5346	0	a	when you paid for the game
1210	1	a	Lore galore, with Fable like combat!
797	1	a	Interesting story full of adventure and mayhem. Great gameplay mechanics. Beautiful graphics. R.A. Salvatore! Just an awesome game. If you're into ARPGs and haven't played this game yet... for shame! 9/10
1190	1	a	very well done---awesome gameplay--:)
2844	1	a	Very recommend.It is a very interesting game,it's price is very cheap but the game experience is good.The optimization is fine so the game can runing smoothly on a low-configuration computer,so you may not worry about your configuration.In the game,you can play three different career and cooperate with your friends or a Bot.And there are also so many interesting game modes,you can enjoy them one by one.
316	1	a	This game really fullfilled my action RPG needs and it's got some great features. First of all, I got a bit shaken off by the camera system, but I got used to it. It's quite funny because this game kinda has to be compared to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, because they came out practically at the same time. I made a bit of a comparison with a friend where I called this one a 'little skyrim'.  That said, this game has some unique features, such as: +Fate meter/Reckoning Mode (special combat mode, like an overdrive) +Twists of Fate (bonus after certain key quests) +Destinies (passives according to character stat growth you made)  The game has some replay value since you can: +Do story and optional quests again giving different answers and check the other's reactions +Invest on Persuasion in order to see different reactions +Align yourself to good or evil in certain story quests where you're given the option to either kill an ancient being(or keep it imprisioned) or unleash him for his power  As for the game design itself, some pros and cons are: Pros: +You can do Stat resets anytime by visiting a Fateweaver and paying some game currency +Fast paced combat which rewards for diversity over repetition +Varied weapons, skills and playstyles to choose and re-choose from +Big meaningful sidequests for certain factions +Skippable DRM (the game asks for your e-mail, but if you don't input it, it carries on) +Investing on different abilities (lockpicking, blacksmithing, stealth, detect hidden,...) may unlock new dialogue options  Cons: -The main storyline boss fights are quite dull -Most of times your input doesn't matter for how the NPCs' general reaction unless it's from one of those unlockable options -Once you enter a map, monsters are designed to accomodate to the level you were when you entered, forever, meaning old areas become easy pretty fast if you're 'running errands' -Killing enemies while stealth doesn't alarm someone beside that guy, but killing a civilian in a city hidden in the attic brings all the cities' guards over, for some reason.  Overall verdict: It has got me playing for some time and got me interested in the story and some of it's features, but it didn't become memorable and some parts of it just seemed unpolished. Your interaction with the game's world is meaningful, but only to a certain extent.
1466	1	a	Anyone who enjoyed fable 1, or Ninja gaiden black will love this game.
1498	1	a	Well, I don't know much, if anything atall about the company, or anyhting to do with its production. But this game is pretty damned good! It's got a very large world to explore, a lot of side quests, a lot of levels, enemys, and choices. Along with various skills you can chose and can help you progress in the game. There is quite a varity of weapons, and you can even make a hybrid character in Magic, Finess(Stealth, Bows, ect) and strengh! All of them are very viable choices. All in all, I've give this game an 8.7/10. My reasoning. Its pretty, it had a nice varity, and it has give me around 6 hours game play with just 5 quests compleated. Not even main ones! The only drawback is the dumbass AI with the stealth mechanics. Even worse than Skyrim.
630	1	a	Awesome game, have some great battles in it, love the lore of the game fighting is quite fun and always looks awesome although its easy combat really, but for any fan of RPG's get this must have game its a gem!
451	1	a	Now this is a game I would like to have back when I was a kid. dont really know where to start with it really. craphics remind of some good MMO games which works pretty well in this one, also combat is very fast and taking down hordes of enemies will take only a moment. or you can simply run from them if you dont have time to deal with them right now or you could not simply care less.  havent played it throug yet, but for these first few meters. I gotta say that I surely will. its fantastic game and its beauty is something to I really admire.
2239	0	a	The custom mouse cursor in the game is stuck and I have to guess where my mouse really is. Not even gonna bother playing.
4884	0	a	This game is terrible, luckily it is the type of terrible that you can laugh at, do not buy in uless it goes under 2 bucks
1174	1	a	if u love RPG like fable u must play this too
1697	1	a	Love, love, love this game. Where to start.  Storytelling: This is THE reason to buy this game. Lore, quests, even random NPC chatter is amusing, interesting, and energetic. I went into the game as a fan of R.A. Salvatore and came out very happy that his style and creativity translated really well into the video game world. 10/10, 5 stars, and *confetti explosion* for this video game's writing and dialogue.   Combat: This aspect of the game I felt was it's shortcoming. Any weapon and path you choose always ends up the same. You can take on monsters 4 levels above you without effort pretty early into the game and storyline bosses are extremely easy. That being said, there was a nice feeling of impact with large weapons, but little to no impact with small weapons or magic. 4/10 (no confetti explosion).  Zones/Ambiance/Leveling: I group these things together because, to me, they all mean the same thing. If you like the zone, you will level faster, enjoy the quests and leveling process more and feel more 'in tune' and immersed in the game. The zones, frankly, ranged from unbelievable fantasy art with such attention to detail I couldn't believe it wasn't a cinematic... to utterly dry, boring dust bowl that I had to slog through and couldn't spend one more second in or I would quit. The variances of the zones ensure that anyone who picks up the game will have a good time, but I wish they hadn't sacrificed quality for variety. 6/10   DLC: I only bought 1 DLC, Legend of Dead Kel, and it was a good bit of fantasy candy to spend a couple days on, refurbishing a home, getting ridiculous gear and generally exploring a small private island you can put your personal touch on. Definitely a good pack for the cost. 8/10  Overall: 28/40 (70%) I really enjoyed this game over the course of a couple months. Casual player friendly and incredibly fun backdrop for an RPG adventure.
1340	1	a	+ Bright, colorful world reminiscent of WoW + Real-time combat is fluid and flashy, generally quite satisfying + Flexible class system with hybrid classes, can change any time + Can re-spec at any time for a small amount of gold + Can tweak character's appearance at any time for free + Solid crafting system with smithing, alchemy and sagecraft (make gems to slot into weapons and armor)  ~ Some QTEs. They're minimal but if you really hate them be warned. ~ Story is kind of interesting, but lacks any memorable NPCs and I was never really invested  - Minimal role-playing, conversations have 2 responses, nice guy or â¥â¥â¥â¥. - Combat is not challenging, even on hardest difficculty potions heal instantly with no animation and are easily crafted in bulk or bought cheaply - Although there is fast travel, you will still have to walk long distances some times, and there are no mounts - Dungeon design is uninspired, and they pretty much all feel exactly the same - Skill trees are hugely underwhelming, mostly passives with a few uninteresting abilities. The fun in combat comes from the weapon skills and combos   All in all it's a pretty solid single player RPG. The world is pretty to look at and the combat is fun enough to keep me playing. Do yourself a favor and play mage- Chakrams are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome.
605	1	a	So underrated. So much fun in combat. It has some faults, especially near the end, but it is fun, versatile, and the story is great. If you see this on sale, pick it up. Bring a 360 controller.
5812	0	a	How the hell did i miss the 'buy as a gift button' so i can sell this crap.
5438	0	a	this game is realy bad it doesant even deserve proper grammer
4091	0	a	Before this huge update, the game was fun and I enjoyed it. But now I'm experiencing a lot of frame drops, bugs and other gui problems. Seems to me like this version was not tested enough and released too early.
639	1	a	Nine hours, first play!...I just couldn't sop! Great fun and no complaints other then it is an EA game...  It's been on the shelf for like two years in my inventory and today finely took it out for a spin. Man, didn't know what I had!  I play on a pc. Mouse and keybord work fine. Not sure how it would work on a console. No bugs encountered from what little time I've played, read some negative reviews concerning this issue though.  A little corney but I rate this game 10/10 anyway.
5029	1	a	Halo, with Dinosaurs. Enough Said.
2757	1	a	This game is a simulator taken on space where you get attacked by dinos,WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!People say this game is laggy but thats there computers problem it works perfect for me and I tried it for free and found very enjoyable so i bought premisson for teradacyles to put me on the top of the world and it was worth it,somehow.
1358	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. I've finished it a month ago or so and it has become 'The game' for me. Now it's hard for me to find a new game like this or better :(  If you ask for my poorly 5 hrs of game... I've played on my boyfriend's account, that's why I can say it's good. (so I can play it again on mine)  Anyway if you're interested in good RPG, give Amalur a try. You won't regret it.  Finally Games like this are rare to find nowadays :( .... For me
4066	0	a	Put this game in the trash.
5945	0	a	Installed the game. Launched the Game. Walked out of base. Looked around and said nope.
5782	1	a	Maybe this is the beset game
5760	0	a	Hello, today I am here to write a review for the game - Orion: Prelude. Let me start by saying this game is absolutely terd awful, and I don't think anyone should have ever even tried it let alone it get to over 1 million copies sold. I have played this game for some time with my friends and after being avid fans of killing floor this seemed like a complete rip off. But with aspects from other games like borderlands and it's second wind. I think this game is poop and everyone should know im only writing this review for a steam badge. Thank you.
43	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
1422	1	a	So far I'm really impressed with this game, the interface is simple, much like the Fable series, but it doesn't feel so limited, I always feel like I have everything I need to survive an encounter at my fingertips. It doesn't feel 'clunky' with a mouse/keys like the Fable games do either.
2071	1	a	This is really Good game and i collected each and every part of this game and only concern is the boos fight was not much expected. it is so easy to complete the final step.
4511	1	a	This game has had some improvements, ignore metacritics, its being constantly updated. The only problem I have is micro transactions. 8/10
6003	1	a	Picked up 4 copies for 2 bucks, got hours of fun with my friends.
789	1	a	Great game, lots of replay value here.
5288	0	a	Okay, so. Basicly your a dude who fights humans and waves of dinos. Pretty cool right? Wrong I didnt like how it was, there was nobody to play with and it was really boring.
2400	1	a	Yes, this is the game you should buy. Very good for the price.
1747	1	a	It's truly sad to see a game go without recognition such as this one. Any RPG lover should have this hidden gem in their library. The combat is fun and fluid. The weapons are unique and stylish. The character design is well made and the voice acting is good. The world itself is stunning, and although graphics wise it's not Skyrim on ultra, it still grabs serious attention in its beauty. The only true complaint i have with the game is it's armor, as i thought the majority of them were pretty ugly. I recommend this game to the RPGer, as it's truly perfect and fiercely under-rated.
3472	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
4622	0	a	Not working with Linux (Ubuntu) ?
6402	1	a	Orion may have started off as a bad game, but through time and effort, it's finally become a fun game.
3383	1	a	really love this game, my friend bought it for me and we always play it together, so much fun its really awesome. kudos to the developers
3020	0	a	This game is the love child of nazi-zombies and borderlands, except this child has an extra chromosome.
3084	1	a	Don't trust the metacritic score, this game went through several mayor changes, and the score is based on a much older version. This game is amazingly fun to play with a bunch of friends, and extremely diverse too. You can cloak yourself to escape from a T-rex, get enough distance in a suped-up helicopter and unleash hell on this dino by means of overpowered laser rifle! Leveling up earns you cool rewards, and so does unlocking achievements. For this current price, buy the 4-pack and blast some dinos to bits.  There are enough game-modes to keep you entertained for days and enough maps and difficulty settings to challenge your strengths. You can even open up a vast world and conquer it completely, provided you don't die in the process. Seriously, this game is top, recommended out the wazoo!
4618	0	a	Horrible game. The guns feel horrible like they aren't doing anything. The devs say that they've improved the game, I would argue that they made it worse. The jetpack DOESNT work off the jump. The gun skins feel just thrown in.
5460	1	a	I've been having so much fun playing Dino Horde that I forgot to eat and died!
1666	1	a	Very very fun and i'm glued to it! Cant stop playing. I love this game! Beautiful game and love the combat.
2934	1	a	Like Skyrim with dinosaurs. 10/10

989	1	a	At first, I had a hard time adjusting to this game... And now, I am addicted.  Pros: - Excellent story lines (even with the side quests) - Very good combat system, you can mix up all of the 3 classes (warrior, rogue and mage), wich I personal find very useful.  You can also join all the different factions in the game, and even buy titles in some cities. - Every story and quest is voice acted, and they are fairly good acted as well. - If you like cartoon-ish graphics, this will be something for you. - Fast travel between cities and dungeons. - Maxed level at 40, wich I find good as this will keep the game balanced.  - 3 modes -Casual, Normal and Hard. - Cool looking weapons and armors. - You can alter your fate (specs) at any time in this game, just find a fateweaver (icon looks like a deck of cards)  Cons: - Main quests are done too fast, in my oppinion. - Sound is/can be buggy during battles and in areas with too many sounds at the same time. - After a few fights with the different enemies in this game, you quickly learn the way they fight, so they become quite  quite easy to kill. - Some of the side quest can be repeated, sadly this can be quite annoying as you canÂ´t remove them from your list. - Only one quest at the time can be marked, shows a yellow ring on the map. The white rings are the other quests. - The 2 DLCÂ´s are way too easy to complete. A max of 2 hours each. - Game does not seem to be supported no more.  All in all, this game is a really good single player RPG, and without a doubt worth trying.
5290	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
1616	1	a	just finished this game it was a good game really enjoyed it but its quit similer to skyrim :/
5028	1	a	I dont even own this
5853	0	a	Pile of wank
2447	0	a	So I see a ton of reviews stating that 'This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!', but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.  Pros: The game is 0.99c. It has co-op in so many ways. It has pvpve. it has hordes of dinos. It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank. There are lots of weapons. Conquest mode has a very interesting concept. It has the old announcer styled 'Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect'.  Cons: There is a bug that allows your 'Private' server to become a public server without warning. There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears. For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use. If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much. Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.) Getting stuck on spots is very likely. The tank's machine gun is ear â¥â¥â¥â¥ much like the large dino roars. The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will. There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds. They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now. The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos. There are still other bugs that have not been adressed. Controllers still do not function properly with the game. The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems. This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.  So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that. So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.
581	1	a	This game is like finding a precious stone among tons and tons of sand after months of looking for it. No, seriously, this is one of the best RPGs I've played in a very long time. Dare I say even better than Skyrim? Sure, the world isn't as 'open' as Skyrim, but the graphics are more colorful, it plays more 'actiony', and the story is richer. Nothing makes you feel more powerful or awesome than throwing a pair of chakrams and taking out all of the enemies around you.
3039	1	a	why do you keep changing the name?
4100	1	a	I played it a while back on a free weekend and saw it was only Â£1 and i had just over a pound left so i got it and its an awesome game
199	1	a	This game is a solid 9/10 Classic RPG with elements ala Skyrim and Fable. High fantasy setting with lots of drops and gear upgrades along with a nice combat system for those of us who want to keep it somewhat simple. The setting are stunning and the story is really good. I loved it. It was just the sort of game for me.
860	0	a	Reckon thisââ©â
2593	1	a	This is a great FPS with many play options and configurations. In a phrase: Halo vs Dinos. Oh and it sells for less than a dollar. I have put more hours into this game than other games I have spent $50 on.  I highly recomend it.
3299	1	a	It gets boring after playing for a while. Gameplay is too monotone. However it worths its price. If you have friends to play with, you can have a few hours of fun.
1882	1	a	Very underrated game, definitely worth a buy.
210	1	a	Good game but let down by quest breaking bugs if you complete certain side quests before progressing the story.  Once you know which side quests to leave its a good game.
2031	1	a	BUY BUY BUY The child of Skyrim and Fable. You wont waste your money
2755	1	a	I would like to take your time to say...that this game...is only fun with friends and if you do it by yourself...  Well how do you feel when you touch your pee pee while looking at random images?
6243	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing don't let the reviews deter you.
3981	1	a	This game literally gave me cancer. Thanks asshat chek ur privlege shitbirds sdufaisopjdfa;si9eruuuuuufhnoas
1312	1	a	this is a great game. realy enjoy not being tide down to one set of weapons, and that you are able to equip all available weapons in the game
5702	0	a	Couldn't play properly don't have the pc best pc but should run well however it is so Laggy I can't tell what is going on going to try and get a refund not what I expected
4152	1	a	nice game but the grapics kinda suck
1776	1	a	10/10 Belongs in the Hall of Fabled RPG's
1431	1	a	I actually found this game quite enjoyable and very well made. A large scale world with more than just a couple hours to complete. The landscapes are excellent, the game play quite well done, with a variety of choices in the character make-up. A game they actually spent time on to produce. A game made properly, and much more to play than most games that come out today that only take a few hours to complete or if your lucky a couple days. I'd recommend buying it with the add-on packs so you get the full world of play. Companies that make games today should look back on these games to learn how a real game is made.
4347	1	a	This game is the best. GOTY 2014  In all honesty this game is fun. A good time killer fun with friends.
4352	0	a	This game is like the last guy to be killed by Kony before everyone stopped giving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about him. Forgotten....
222	1	a	one of my favorite games this year, really too bad the dev went out of business so we won't ever get a sequel :(
4291	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
4789	0	a	loaded up game, game crashed 10/10
3035	1	a	This game is a must buy if you like the early halo series IE 1-3 , if you like jet packs gears of war or dinosaurs. This game started out broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥ when it first came out and a lot of people got really butt hurt that this game was broken. But guess what they fixed literally every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing people complained about. I bought the game when it was broken and shelved it for a bit and came back after fixes. But this games early community seems to be a bunch of limped dicked â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es because they still troll this game ..... They have no right to talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this game any more, the dev's truly made a cult classic out of this one and if your still upset about this game then it is time to move on it is great now stop living in the past.   This game is and will forever be one of my favorites not only because Dinos + jet packs + mechs with a Halo 2 meets gears look about it. But because the devs kicked â¥â¥â¥ and took a broken game they could have abandoned, and really polished the hell out of it. I have bought not just one copy but at least 10 so far because it is an amazing game to play with friends . Takes me back to when I use to do LAN parties as a kid :D  Do yourself a favor hop on and enjoy.
3714	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
4724	0	a	Game sucks
2189	1	a	It is a very solid game. The combat is basically as fun as you want to make it. To elaborate, you can play an archer and shoot enemies from a distance with the occasional dodge, or you coud go with daggers and be right in the thick of it. Both are viable and you can even have both at your disposal to switch either based on enemies or preference. The skill development system is very flexible and allows you to respec by paying an NPC. The voice acting in the game is pretty good. There was clearly a significant amount of effort put into fleshing out the lore of the world for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing. There is an absolutely silly amount of side quests for a single player game. I would definitely recommend it.
4621	0	a	Back when this game was call Dino Beatdown the game have fewer dinos the graphics were 10x better and the gameplay was smoother. Now updates dino horde and prelude came changing the game into this bloody rubbish, and a major graphics downgrade to make the pretty ok looking game look like 32bit S*h*i*T and the only good thing to come out of it was the weather effects for the snow lvls  i used to love this game in 2012 but the updates ruined it
1120	1	a	A solid game through and through. It has all the elements in place that make an excellent RPG. Graphics and sound were straight on even if they did use the same voice actors over and over again. The combat system was well developed and thought out and the crafting system they have in place was also good although a bit simplistic at times.  The main story telling was a bit lacking to the point where I stopped paying attention halfway through. I did encounter a game ending glitch that I was fortunately able to bypass by going back a few saves but it ate up some time. Finally after I hit the level cap and got the best equipment in game I lost all interest in sidequests/exploring as I just didnt see the point. So I burned through the final quest/areas just to see the final contect and finish the game.  Its unfortunate that the company went under but I would recommend this game to any RPG fan.
3391	1	a	Its relly good and fun game but little laggy and buggy also pay2win i think   Ill givethis game 8/10 :P  Comon buy it its cost onley 1$
1045	1	a	I actually really enjoyed this game :) I'm sad not alot of others did. Still, I'm happy to have it on Steam. I hate Origin....
4476	1	a	Bad game. Don't play. Play Halo instead.
1825	1	a	(writing this only 8 hour into the game) From what i played , this feel complety like a universe to explore , there is alot of backstory and content and it is interesting to discover . There is alot of side quest barely touch the main quest yet , but that mean a good thing , it is a full game where developer did not rush the game . For gameplay it is perfect , it feel rewarding , you got plenty of choice as for combat as rogue,warrior and mage but you can also combine them as for warrior-rogue or even warrior-mage whicht can lead to interesting mechanic of combat . If I should recomment this game? Definitely a buy !
1338	1	a	Very fun game with easy to learn controls and interesting story line.
272	1	a	So good i can not discribe it :)
4477	1	a	Orion (insert subtitle here) is a super low budget crappy looking Halo ripoff that pits Master Chief look-a-likes against wave after wave of brainless angry dinosaurs that want to bite him to death.  Its not creative, deep, or original. It is a crude and simple game. And it is fun enough to be a guilty pleasure. The enjoyment doesn't last for long however, since Origin gets impossibly difficult a few waves in. For $1, you get what you pay for.  Its the ultra low quality attention to details that amuse me the most. I like how when most of the guns are fired, the recoil animation is the model's hands sliding up and down their forearms. Or how one of the character poses for holding the pistol is the same as holding a rifle.
2761	1	a	Really fun and enjoyable game with a great price!Of course it was down to 1$ for like a week but still 11$ is worth it!I had some fun playing this game and I will propably play a lot during the summer.Now I have to focus on my exams and I don't play videogames a lot :p
3465	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
2180	1	a	Underrated game! :D  
5713	1	a	Great game :D
3008	1	a	Pretty good game if you happened to get in on the huge sale, other than that i couldn't rec @ 15$. Controls are below average, weapons are about average, gameplay is maybe a little below average, graphics are poor, concept is pretty badass!
3212	1	a	Those that bought is game when it was 15 bucks must have felt cheated......I bought is at the price of dirt. Anyway Orion Dino Horde or what its now know as Orion Prelude is a game where you survive hordes of dinos attacking you,its similiar to many zombie games and wave of enemies games so you will enjoy tis if you enjoy those.
4129	1	a	This game reminds me a lot of Killing Floor. Basicaly you face down waves of dinos, with the ocassional objective capture in the between, and jumbo dinos to fight off, all while protecting your base. Simply yet addicting. Totally the best $0.99 I ever spent :)  Loads of fun with friends and offers a good variety of classes (flighing, healing, &amp; stealth).
4121	1	a	this is the wost game ever made
6142	1	a	This is the best cheapest halo clone i've ever played. They even ported in the warthog, tank, and magnum, along with mechwarrior mechs. I've gotten better value playing this rediculous game than many others in my library that cost 10-50x more.
4461	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosaurs.
3163	1	a	ok its food for the first 4 hours then you start to realize that it is way too damn easy. that makes it bad. the controls for the vehicles are annoying, i mean who does the borderlands controls like they suck... i want to press 'a' or 'd' to turn not move my mouse... the game really does suck â¥â¥â¥ though. though it is fun if you like that kind of game.  now i will say it is fun, i will say it is intresting, i will say it is worth the buck you pay for it, and i will say that if you have enough cards to sell, sell them and get this game. its bad but not for the price and the enjoyment you can get out of it.   will i play it again? yeah at some point is it worth my money? yeah it is... it's only a buck. is it worth playing? depends how bad are you at Modern Warfare...   this game is fun it is easy but hard at the same time, while i can survive multiple rounds (like 15) in Modern Warfare's servival mode, i only survive at most 5 in this game. but the shear size of the waves is rediculous. they get hard fast... but well sitting ontop of a rock and snipting the heck out of a few hundred dino's with a 75% acuracy rate... is rediculous. heck i think i am about 80 or 90 witht the top tier sniper... that isn't that hard to get. i can bearly hit the broad side of a barn in modern warfare when i snipe, yet along headshots are rare. in this game... you can pick up the sniper and head shot alot of dinos verry easilly. there are times you will run out of ammo before you miss a shot. large targets i guess...  lets now talk vehicles... they suck. getting them sucks even worse and well when you have to use an emp to access them... that is bad. intresting but bad.  i'm getting a little ranty so let me say the bottom line.  SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?  Yeah. you should. play if for 4 hours then realize it isn't much of a challenge. yes it is fun, and i would recomend this if you have a buck to spare.
4740	1	a	Graphics: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Performance:10/10   When I bought this game I was expecting a broken peice of crap game. HOLY &amp;%$# I was wrong This game is addictive fun and great for co-op teamwork though a few of the gamemodes and a little broken. But the makes that up with Halarious Ragdoll glitches like a T-rex doing a flip. or a Raptor freaking out halfway in the ground. This game is not something new it reminds me alot of other co-op games but thats the point of this game it's a time killer game, for say you got 40 minutes to kill. This game will eat that 40 minutes right up. My verdict is a 9/10
3653	1	a	wtf were those guys smoking when they made this
5500	1	a	Has fish cars. 10/10
4297	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
4624	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
1614	1	a	a good game! Kingdoms of Amalur : Reckoning is for sure a good RPG, made at the near time of skyrim the game itself resemble its brother-competitor a lot...but doenst even scratch its nails. Amalur is a joke near skyrim, so lets no go there. Lets talk about a game that by itself is very good and worthwhile. My gameplay was about 100h ...i did everything possible(almost) and more....gameplay is focused on the action-rpg style with few elements of path choosing, which means is a open world but straightforward game, with systems similar to crafting, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing and more. The lore is HUGE, everything has a tale behind and a good tale that is. Overall the game is good, i feel it lacked some 'GOOD MUSIC'(ost is very...dull). In the Pirate's DLC we have a gamebreaking bug that was NEVER CORRECTED, for that i wont forgive EA since i almost lost my game when i was on 70h .  Overall Amalur must be bought and has a 9 of 10 on score. Compared to Skyrim its a 4 of 10 score.  Which means, an amazing RPG, but stop comparing it!(like i did ) to skyrim lol!
638	1	a	This is one of those games that i picked up from blockbuster back in the day on a hunch. turns out my gut was right this is one fun game that has alot to it. I didnt have downloaded content at that time and in a week barely scratched the surface. this game is worth a look at if you are into rpgs and well games that have alot of content to them with the abiltiy to build your character your way since as far as i seen it doesnt matter how you build it

2060	1	a	Immense game, far bigge and much more interestingr than I ever thought it was going to be, can't stop playing. I should qualify this a little, I gave up on PC gaming for a couple of years because I could not follow my passion anymore, Sim Racing, because of illness but wanted to keep my 'eye' in so bought a couple of 'doorstops' 360 and PS3, this was one of the first RPGs I got for the 360 but only played it for a few hours but never go invested in it, after a full refub of my PC I started buying the games I had aquired for the consoles for it, my god what a change, M&amp;K control and I was like a pig in mud and this allowed me to wallow forever, excellent fun, I cannot recommend this highly enough.

610	1	a	Graphics are a little dated but an extremely fun game
2975	1	a	It is very funny but it is not worth 13,99â¬   But 0,99â¬ IT IS SO WORTH !  
2068	1	a	A fantastic game, extremely underrated.
309	1	a	Very fun and addictive combat. Story is good yet suffers from a lot of the typical and overdone gater/kill x quests. The world, however is very deep and rich. The voice acting ranges from laughable to good or great.  The inventory system leaves much to be desired but isn't any worse than unmodded Skyrim.  Overall, it's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to replay to try out the different classes.
4464	0	a	I don't know how this game is on steam. Constant crashing, disconnecting, bugs, etc. This isn't a finished product, not even close. Sound design is pretty bad, animations are mediocre, player and weapon models are kinda bad too. Dinosaurs are alright, but the environment is actually shockingly beautiful.  A bundle of bad/boring/broken mechanics, a generic grind game style, and no real reason to be grinding have this game coming in substantially worse than almost any other multiplayer free-to-play game, making it a bad purchase. Only played for about an hour, but most laughter and enjoyment came from just how absurdly bad some aspects of the game were.
5241	1	a	This game is definitely worth the price of a few cents. If played with friends it is extremely fun, however that won't cover the fact that the animations in the game were sloppy and jittery, the graphics were low poly, and the hud was too transparent. Yet despite all of that I really enjoyed playing the game definite reccomend.  TL;DR: Buy it to play with friends, it is like dino zombie survival.
4278	1	a	Reasons to play! 1. Super fun  2. Completely free!  3. Supportive and open developer  4. Character progression and customization 5. Different classes for different play-styles and class roles 6. Dinosaurs (Duh!) 7. Jetpacks, mechs, helicopters, tanks, hovercraft, jeeps etc. 8. Lasers Swords and good sword play! 9. PvP and coop, and PVPVE too (players protect bases in teams and can sick dinosaurs on other teams) and gamemodes where you can be the dinos too 10. You can surf on the hood of your buddies jeep/hovercraft/tank/helicopter  Reasons to not play :[ 1. You hate fun?
3519	1	a	this game would be horrendous if it didnt have coop
2294	1	a	Many people asked me about the game âOrion: Dino Hordeâ. So I have written a review now. ^^  First I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game 'Dino Beatdown', not for 'Orion: Dino Horde' and the game hasnât only changed the name, its totally different now.  For many people itâs still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright â I would give for it 7/10 points. â You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitchesâ¦) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DONâT KNOW WHY!  Reallyâ¦  I LOVE THIS GAME!    For me itâs like a mix out of âPrimal Carnageâ (Jurassic Park Style) and âKilling Floorâ plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general itâs about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).   Possible Game Modes:    Slaughter  (lots of enemies)  Survival  (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)  Rampage  (like in âPrimal Carnageâ there are 2 teams âDinosaursâ and âHumansâ who play against each other and switch after that)  1v1 Duel â¢ Team Duel â¢ Team Elimination â¢ Free for all Duel â¢ King of the Hill â¢ Instagib â¢ Conquest â¢ Gun Game   You can play it  solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).  You can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!  During the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech &amp; Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles. But you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level â there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.   Classes:   Assault  He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (Thatâs freaking awesome! Itâs so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is âFrag Grenadeâ.   Recon  The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.   Support  The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they canât just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you canât - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, itâs possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^   Back to the level system:  You unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50.    Achievements:   Oh itâs just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.  So all in all.. what should I sayâ¦ this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure itâs not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isnât realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~
3392	1	a	A bit buggy game, but enjoyable none-the-less. Shooting down a Pteranadon? Heck yes!
5766	0	a	I've played this game, and it's alright, but nothing special. It's missing a lot of polish. I was hoping to play the newer one, but after learning that the company ripped off assets from other games and then LIED about it (seriously, just say your models were inspired by theirs. That's at least partially believable), I have no desire to support this company any longer, and I wouldn't recommend buying anything from them.
5821	0	a	This game is Literal â¥â¥â¥
384	1	a	Good game with potential to be great. Has some flaws - bad FOV, random encounters, forgettable side-quests - but many strengths: great main story, a vast semi-open world with rich lore, absolutely fun combat (I recommend playing a mage). I had fun with it.
4955	1	a	I Saw My Frined Riding a Cockroach-Like Vehicles... While I do 1080 With Helicopter.  'Best 1080-Heli Simulator Ever' - 11/10 IGN
730	1	a	this game is severely underrated. i felt like a jack of all trades beast when it came to combat. dialogue felt very stiff and life less and had me skipping tons of dialogue through boredom of the (mostly) deadpan voice overs. the powers/weapons/spells felt so perfect in combat that this game won me over right off the bat. the character customization is passable. the art style in the game overall impressed me and i enjoyed the fantasy setting. the game is honestly somewhat reminiscent of the Fable franchise, and if you are fine with those games then this is right up your alley.
3915	0	a	The game is horrible. The idea is good, implementation is very bad. I wouldn't even pay the 99 cents because nobody plays it.
4108	1	a	It's like Battlefield, except with Dinosaurs.
3336	1	a	This game + the Jurassic park movies prove that all dinosaurs are evil, even the good ones. Cheaper then a chocolate bar. Random crashes just add to the fun.  10/10 would throw grenades at dinosaurs again 
2396	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
2788	1	a	Really worth 99 cents :D 
746	1	a	Fun, but too long. You're not fixed into a specific character class like a lot of other RPGs, and you can build your character to fit your playstyle. As the lucky one who's immune to fate, it is up to you to complete dozens and dozens of side quests because Bob is trapped by fate to be unable to get off his barstool to give a letter to Tim who's sitting at a table on the other side of the tavern. I imagine if you didn't do all the sidequests, you might be able to remember why you are slaughtering your way across the land. There is lots of gear to be found, but once you get a set, you find yourself keeping it for large parts of the game due to the set bonuses. Occasionally with the combo system you end up just being dragged around by your sword. Occasionally you will get NPCs to help you, but they are only to hold aggro as they do no damage and seem to be invulnerable.
5228	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
5514	0	a	no wonder this game is 1 dollar dont even bother with this game its really bad
5984	1	a	Grinding on a T-Rex back while shootaring other mighty dinos in da face with my epic 'kill-all-these-mighty-dinos-gun', awesome stuff!  would recommend, 2/1!
170	1	a	awesome rpg game i enjoy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game u have spells crafting and a huge map so there every reason to play the game and its not hard to play u can also play it casualy thats what makes beter
4614	1	a	I've played it once with a friend and actually had a fun time doing it. While it may be underwhelming on the surface, it is very fun if you're willing to relax and just play a game a bit without too much thought involved.
153	1	a	I played this game on PS3 back in 2013 when I was subscribed to PS Plus. I logged hundreds of hours. This game is HUGE, maybe not as big as Skyrim, but it's up there. LOTS of quests.
1968	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is in many ways an offline version of World of Warcraft which i have been searching after for some time. I never really knew about the game and stumbled upon it when it was on sale. It is a stunning open world rpg where you can level up with the level cap being 40 and the options for your gamestyle and which type of character you like playing are really diverse and interesting. The main draw for me is the actual world that which is stunningly beautiful. A lot of my time is spent taking screenshots of the vast open landscapes and beautiful colours :P. The loot system in the game works really well too with lots of different armor and weapon types to farm which i am used to from my WoW days. Overall I was shocked at how good the game is and still like to go back to it from time to time for side quests etc which are highly recomended. An instant classic for any rpg fan 10/10.
3072	1	a	You know what they say... 'it has swig'  #ND2013
859	0	a	I realize that I played through this entire game and its DLCs and even went so far as to get 100% of the achievements, but I just cannot recommend it. It's not all negative, it's just... boring.   And it shouldn't be. The environments should be mind blowing. The character design should be good. The weapons and armor designs should be interesting. But, they just... aren't. They are by themselves out of context. The screenshots and such for this game make it look really interesting and captivating. But when you are playing, everything is really bland text-book fantasy cliche and so all these things that look really nice out of context become dull and boring when put together as a whole in the context of the game.   Also, the crafting system sucks and doesn't seem to make any weapons or armor better than what you can find in the game. Also, the random loot system sucks: you find a piece of a named armor set, but by the time you randomly get all of the pieces or even enough for it's cumulative effects to be useful, you've leveled up way beyond it and have found generic armor beyond its capabilities. And, I'm not sure if it is possible to make sidequests any more generic, boring, and repetitive.   The gameplay itself and combat are fine, I guess.   So, bad crafting, bad loot, extremely meh gameplay, nothing special combat, and incredibly dull cliche story and characters make this game just plain boring. If you are looking for a fantasy world to explore, you'd be much better of going and wandering around Skyrim again.
5049	1	a	This game is one of the worst games I've ever played. The only two good things about this game are: 1. It actually opens, 2. It has an FOV slider. This game is an awful waste of time made by a bunch of lazy â¥â¥â¥ devs who can't make a proper game. -5/5
4595	1	a	its is quite a fun little first person shooter i think if you like these sort of games you should defenatly have a try
2219	1	a	This is a very polished and balanced version of the original disciples 3 games.  It feels worked, solid and different in every little corner. Map has more stuff now, variety of enemies has been increased and i have the feeling that difficulty is raised a little (in a pleasant way), making map spells essential. If you enjoyed the originals like me, i think you'll find this one pleasantly refreshing. If you didn't like the originals, i think you're going to enjoy this one as it is very professionaly polished. The game remains the same and still gets repetitive. But battles and map movement now feels a little more dynamic.  Voice acting is now mediocre, from laugable-terrible that it was before:).
2467	1	a	Rightful winner of Game of The Year every-year 
3090	1	a	This game is far the best dinosaur game i've been played, a good game to play with your friends.
653	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a 2012 single-player action role-playing video game developed by Big Huge Games and 38 Studios, and published by Electronic Arts.   Before this game was released, it was touted to be designed by a former Bethesda Game Studios veteran Ken Rolston who had worked on the award winning Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Famed fantasy author R.A Salvatore created the lore and backstory for the game's universe and the artwork was done by Todd McFarlane who is famous for his work on the Spawn comic series. 38 studios itself was owned by former baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, who was known to be a very avid video gamer himself.  With such big names behind this title, how is the actual game itself?  Sadly, it can all be summed up in one word: Average.  Graphically, while the game was done by Todd McFarlane, it looked nothing like McFarlane's signature style of bold colours and harsh artistic lines. In fact, the whole game looks like a Fable clone artistically. While the locations can look quite nice at times, it gives an overall 'Been There, Done That' feel. Especially for players who have played Fable.  Gameplay is also extremely linear. Every location in the game, every dungeon feels like a corridor. While the game gives you an illusion of an open-world, it never really is. You will be stopped by invisible walls, can only travel on certain allowed paths. Its so restrictive, that your character cannot even jump, and can only leap off ledges at certain designated points.  In every RPG, story is quite possibly the most important aspect, and surely a story by famed fantasy writer R.A Salvatore would be something special? Well...not really.  While R.A Salvatore tries to craft a very intricate universe with lots of backstory, most of it can only be found in lorestones, books and you actually need to go out of the way to read them to understand the lore behind it. I don't know about you guys, but video games aren't novels. I'd rather EXPERIENCE a story thru gameplay myself rather then read one when i'm playing a video game. The over-arching main story quest is also quite generic, and is actually rather short with only 13 quests in total. None of the characters are particularly memorable and there aren't any plot twists.  Now I wouldn't have minded if the main quests were full of depth but they simply are not. Most of them just directs you to go to a specific location, kill someone and rinse and repeat. If it isn't a search and destroy mission, NPCs will actually ask you to go to 3 completely different areas on the map to do basically the same thing before you trudge back to the NPC to continue with the story.   Considering there are no mounts in the game, you can understand how tedious it was to travel on foot to repeat the same thing 3 times. This is obviously used as a cheap way to artificially lengthen the gameplay time. Luckily there is a fast-travel option available, but you can only use it if you have been to the location before. I never once used fast-travel in an Elder Scrolls game, because each location in that title is unique with lots of explorable locations with interesting quests. With this game however, I was so bored of the generic story of the main quest and boring fetch quests type sub-quests that I fast travelled whenever I could.  With that said, the only saving grace of this title is the combat which is absolutely brilliant. Combat movement is extremely fluid combined with beautiful animations makes combat a joy to play. It doesn't matter if you choose to swing a sword, use a dagger or cast a spell. All of them have unique and cool animations and are a joy to play with. It almost felt as if they spent all their budget on perfecting the combat but neglecting everything else that makes a RPG special.   This game adds a unique 'Reckoning' mode for combat which is a mode you can activate to go slow motion ala Matrix style after accumulating enough to fill a meter to dispatch multiple enemies with flourish that will net you extra experience points. The game will go into a QTE mode where mashing certain buttons can net you even more experience points. While its cool to go all Matrix style on enemies for the first few times, the novelty does wear out after your 50th 'Reckoning' mode and it quickly becomes just another way to farm Experience Points.   As I come to the end of this review, I feel that you should know that this was the only game developed by 38 Studios before they filed for bankruptcy. 38 Studios is no more. This also means that the future of this IP is in doubt. The last I read back in 2013, there were no buyers interested in this IP Franchise when they were doing an auction to sell off their properties. Do not expect to see a sequel or anything Amalur related anytime soon. (If ever.)  Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10 An Action-RPG with excellent combat mechanics but with little ambition. It doesn't try anything new and gives a very average overall feel to the whole thing. Worth a look though if its on a very deep discount.
5931	0	a	.
4049	1	a	I have played the first beta of the game ... it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ . But i have to admit that this has been the best transformation of a game i have ever witnessed
5874	1	a	It was so bad, that I thought Infinite Warfare had been released early.
2680	1	a	Oh man, this game.  Let us begin with the very beginning of this game.  It was â¥â¥â¥â¥, just utter â¥â¥â¥â¥, a friend of mine couldn't even play the game back then because when one of us hosted the other couldn't join, we were frustrated by this and thought the game was horrible. We regretted ever buying this game and shelved it for all eternity. However, I remained faithul and watched the development going on from the shadows and I must say, good job Spiral Game Studios! You have shown people they you are one of the few developers that actually give a rats â¥â¥â¥ about your game and want to make it bigger and better! Gone with the DLC crap, you buy the game you get the updates and DLC for free! Period!  I salute you, with the new updates I have gained faith in you again and the news about the Orion Project gave me new hope, I just installed the game again and will try it out, a full review will follow afterwards and I wish this will be my most favorite game, because the new additions are so many for me it should give me a lot of time to try them out, not a fan of PvP but that is my opinnion. Full review coming after real gameplay.  Also, for all who see the rating of Metacritic, that was when the game first came out under a different name and was utter â¥â¥â¥â¥, give it a try, show your support to these awesome â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, show them that Indie developers need more support then right corporations that care only for the money and not its fans!  Extended Cut; So, I played some more and got into a solo match of Open World, man is that snow coming from the skies? Is that a fricking T-Rex walking around not noticing me? What is going on!  I quickly found out that Open World is Open World, a place covered in and by snow, it was snowing when I spawned but after a few minutes it vanished, so I took my jeep, went to the generator and saw it was a generic survival mode, activate the generator and hold out, pff, easy I thought and so it was, I was bored and got the Cryo Blade (Lightsaber) and oh my gosh this thing is powerful, two hits against a mobs head with the 2x damage boost and you are set to go solo mode. Now, why would I continue playing after I defended the generator and have to go to the outpost? Easy, five huge beasts to slay with my trusty VTOL, now the VTOL is great and all, but if you DON'T kill the flying dinosaurs you are pretty much screwed, they chew away your VTOL's armor and the fact that T-Rex throw rocks at you, start flying boy. So, after I got downed I tried to fight the T-Rex who got his little T-Rex friend AND army with him to fight me, eventually I died and thought; 'Screw this, it was fun.' And to my surprise I could revive by killing an enemy, which was awesome, also could my shields regen after I got hit a few times, which worked only once because I got overwhelmed again. So, after a minute of fighting the T-Rex got me and digested me, woops.  Also, the fact that there are chests and cabinets with money and/or weapons in them is a neat idea, first loot and then see if you can buy a better and bigger gun, a great idea for people who just hop in and need a bit of extra cash to win the battle!  All in all I give it a 9/10, it is a great and awesome game and they did a great job, the snow effect made for some intense fighting because my vision got blurry and frozen as soon as I stepped outside, which made it harder and more challenging, I won't give the 10/10 until I actually play some multiplayer matches with random people and friends and see how it works then, overall a great game if you want to test you luck and survival skill against two T-Rex's and their little buddies, next time I bring my own army of four with me and see how long they can survive against us.
4881	1	a	It's fun but for a few hours play it doesn't look like a finished game but it's fun and i recommend it if you are looking for a game to kill half an hour with
6069	1	a	Just gives me a black screen biggest waste of 40p 10/10
3225	1	a	Okay, so you're probably thinking that this looks like some game for 5 year olds that the devs incorporated guns into. Well, I thought the same exact thing. WELL I WAS WRONG. This game is so much more than that and with the size of the actual game, with the sale going on, I would buy this game for a dollar in a heartbeat. Don't pass up this steal before it's to late. I have not bought it yet but I will make sure I do before the sale ends.
919	1	a	Hello there im BlueSkyKingDrago I have a youtube channel and I just upload a video but its 2 part video so please come check it out this game is really good I got the collection so I got all of the game and I have yet to play the DLC. So I hope to see people check it out. Oh and the youtube channel name is BlueSkyKing Drago
3247	1	a	One of the games that comes with a ''Buy ME'' tag on. Easy to play and fun FPS.
4113	1	a	9/10 AMAZING!  I'd had my eye on this game for a while then it went on sale for $0.99. TOTALY worth it. The co-op is great even with only 3 classes. The music is nice and the visuals are breataking. I get such a rush too, there's nothing like gunning down a charging T-Rex and there's nothing cooler then having the game shift into bullet time when you take down one of the big boys.  Furthermore the extra modes are just as mun, pvp dules, rampage, conquest (don't get me started on conquest).  The only downside I find is the lack of diversity with the builds. It's not horrible but having three classes where their only differences are their abilities (Jetpack, Heal gun, and Stealth) does take away from some team elements that could be there.  Honestly, I'm having a blast (even more so than I did with TF 2!). $1 or $15, get this game .
450	1	a	Excellent game! Like a cartoony Skyrim.
3413	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a sword. The dinosaurs didn't have feathers. NOT SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL!
2040	1	a	Great game,i have played it on ps3 but the pc version seems to have sound issues
2399	1	a	Its good fun with a team of freinds and its only 1 euro.  Lots of different modes, maps and weapons and lets not forget the dinos, they are great.
5962	1	a	LETS KILL SOME FREAKIN DINOSAURS AND STOP PLAYING...........3 hours later. I USED MY TIME MACHINE TO KILL REAL DINOSAURS but then died
5888	0	a	its finally free to play...
1793	1	a	So far I can see potential but it's clear that it just hasn't got the budget of something like Skyrim. I like the world and the idea of completly custimisable levelling but I don't think it quite delivers. 7/10
1677	1	a	Great game with alot to do, if you can get past having to do some fetch quest youll enjoy it. Its got around three hundred hours in it and a fast paced combat system.
6282	1	a	A lot more fun than I was expecting. Being able to fight dinos in a mech suit is amazing.
2683	1	a	I bought this when it was Orion: Dino Horde. I LOVE this game!! For 0.99$ its is worth it, actually its a rip off to the developers! This game hasa hours of replay ability and it is still being worked on,  so the people claiming the ai sucks, shut your trap, msot people who claim it sucks have little time on it anyway. Its a great game to play with m8s or random people online. It requires stratagy on higher levels and good teamwork. 11/10 In my opinion, anyway its only a dollar and you spend 20$ to buy cod 4 still.
3262	1	a	Good game easy to play with friends
3503	1	a	I seriously can't recomend this game enough. I don't know why I havn't written this review Earlier, I've had teh Game since day one and have watched it grow from it's pretty rough and shaky start into one of the most fun Lan party games I've ever played. Sure it's not the highest quality games but It's certainly one of the most fun esspecially with Friends.  I can't thank the Developers enough for all there hard work and sticking with their product until it became the game they always wanted it to be. Also Seriously the Game is only $1 now so if you havn't got it yet shame on you. It's the best value you'll ever get from one dollar. Can't Recomend enough. 
1213	1	a	69%
4707	1	a	Great fun, cool cartoony graphics, bugs seem to have been cleared up pretty neatly showing that the developers behind it care and are willing to support the game and its community.   It is extremely cheap so I do recommend buying a 4 pack to share with your mates as the most fun is offered in CO-OP with friends. :P overall, definitely get this game! :D
6074	1	a	Erm. Dinosaurs, jetpacks, vehicles and a lightsaber? For less than Â£1? So damn sold!
5279	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
6284	1	a	So bad that it is amazing
5897	0	a	not worth a dollar, removed game from library
4551	1	a	Good game!! worth Money!! (1$)
1449	1	a	If you actually play this game all the way through, doing all the side quests and such; you get more than your moneys worth. This game is like Skyrim in the fact you can easily put over 100hrs on it and not even notice it.
3211	1	a	 Fun! Lots of fun and innovation right ahead!   + Awesome concept + Various types of dinosaurs + Alive community as hell + Usually has some good prizes + Lots of game types + Well made vehicles + Awesome potential  - Few and unbalanced classes - Relatively a few weapons - Not very known game - Sometimes you get p!ssed - Suggestions to make a perfect game   PROS   1. Awesome concept  When I first bought the game I thought like  dafuq am I buying? A game with a goal that is to kill dinosaurs? But wait, it's only R$1.50? I'll give it a try . And I liked it! A lot! The concept is fun, the teams have to be organized to survive the hordes of dinosaurs, that come from air or land. Although the graphics are not thaaaat good (they're only ' good ', not ' very god ', but that's not bad). Even though the dino-shooter game category is incresing, Orion is awesome and even if it's cheap it deserves a nice place in that place in that category.   2. Tons of different dinosaurs  The game itself has a lot of different dinosaurs, from different species and with different statuses: some are tank-ish, others are fast, others fly, others are so small that shooting them is way too difficult and etc. That's awesome! Bringing lots of types of dinos is truly a heavy thumbs up to the game, while other games lack in this topic, Orion is an absolutely  win  here.   3 Alive community  The community is alive, differently from other games and the devs are constantly open to discussion or sometimes they start contests or invite people to play with them, isn't that cool? I've seen lots and lots of games  (some good games, acutally)  that are with more than one year without free patches and are only 1,5 or two years in the market. This game's about 2.5 years until today being sold and is being constantly changed.   4. Usually has some good prizes  This topic is strongly related to topic 11, unfortunatedly. But everything has its good and bad sides! The good thing is that I've seen Orion with awesome prizes (85%, 90% off) a lot of times before actually buying it. I bought it with a heavy discount, 90% off if I'm right, and profited very well. It was actually better than a lot of games that I actually paid more and had less fun.   5. Game types  This topic is not as important as it should be since most of the shooter games -related to dinos or not- have this in common but since it's present in Orion it should be pointed, shouldn't it? Like many other games there are lots of game modes PvP, PvE, EvP, etc. It is a positive point so it has to be put here but nothing special.   6. Vehicles!  The vehicle types are cool! There are tanks, jet-motos, mechs, futuristic helicopters, jeeps, mechs and other types! The good things are not the vehicles themselves but the way you can use it. Even if the graphic's not that excellent there's always an animation of getting in and getting out, signal that  at least  the developers tried to make the game the most complete as they could. Other thing is that depending the place you are and enter the car, you can't drive or you can't shoot, that's a complete and wide thinking of placing the player in the most realistic ambient to the game. You can also get up on some vehicles while they're moving and they 'carry' you as long as you're on them. Of course that there are some necessary vehicles missing, like a two people mech and a 2-4 people helicopter but the game they way it is is not that bad :)   7. Awesome potential  Well, what can I say, this topic means it all. Yea, Orion has a huge potential, believe me or not, and it only depends on the developers. The ambient is nice, the dinos are annoying  (well, they're only doing their job, hah) , the vehicles are challenging, there are bosses  (with, let me say, are hard AS HELL to kill)  and a lot of other things that are differential to other games. This game's technically prepared to have any colossal upgrade that can greatly increase it's gaming experience, remember this.   CONS   8. Unbalanced classes  The game can have up to three classes only (assault, spy and medic -you probably know what they all do). But it lacks a LOT of classes, for example at least engineers, tanks, snipers, hunters, scouts, and ninjas/melee-handed  (anyway, call them the way you want)  are missing. Another bad thing is that every weapon is absolutely the same if used by  any  class, with means that, for example, if an assault player uses a machine gun they'll get the same damage output as a medic (which is NOT right, since the assault-dude is focused on hitting while the medic is focused on supporting). That's not right. The game could have at least an upgrade-tree, too, particular to each class. You can see some suggestions at topic 12.   9. Few weapons  The game has too few weapons in my opinion and they're all pretty much the same. They're all ballistic and the game's context is futuristical. Not that the game would need to have futuristical antimatter-weapons or black hole generators or portals, no. But at least some energy short range weapons, maybe some lasers, gauss rifles or 'dino-ECMs'? Maybe...?   10. What is Orion?  The game's not very known, maybe because the gaming industry is way too competitive, maybe because it was re-released twice I think, or even maybe because  the game has poor grades  [www.metacritic.com]  in a lot of sites and was poorly reviewed by a lot of critics (just see their grades). That's odd, I might say. If you see the Steam Store valuations  the game score is 74/100 . Anyway, despite the reason is, the game does not has a very good fame and that keeps pushing it down the gamer community, not only Steam.   11. You usually get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥  Most of the times when you're playing PvE games at medium difficulty or harder you have huge chances of getting killed, despite of the reason. But the point is that when you die you lose ALL (I repeat, ALL) of your character/weapon upgrades and weapons! FFS! I know the game's not meant to be easy but this kills the game sometimes, it's very common to see players leaving rooms after getting killed, making the survival task way harder than it normally is, unbalancing the game and making sometimes other players leave! If you buy this game be sure this will be a common thing to you!   12. It lacks a lot of good things that could absolutely make it a perfectly success game  The game's awesome but it lacks a lot of things that some other games have that make them more successful as Orion. Let's list them up here  who knows maybe a Spiral developer read them     Classes overhaul : The class system needs to be completely remade. Not that the ones who are in the game are bad, but because they're insufficient to fill all of the gaps the game lacks:[/tr][/tr]    Class  Duty    Assault  Shoot things at a fair range Can fly.    Spy  Master of disguise. Can turn invisible.    Medic  Can heal people up Has a +0.5 HP/sec regeneration aura (10 meters).    Engineers  Like techy stuff Can repair vehicles with his money but earn more money.    Tank-ishes  Have more armor. Better at close-ranged fighting.    Snipers  Snipe!    Hunters  Incredible damage with bows/crossbows. Can smell enemies    Scouts  Poke and run Can run faster with their futuristic armors.    Melee  Awesome damage with swords and knives. Can make enemies bleed!       Campaign    Bigger vehicles   More game modes   Profile passive skills   More dinosaurs! :D  
2201	0	a	I wanted very, very badly to like Disciples 3. The art is as stunning as Disciples 2, perhaps even more so. However, the balance is all off - XP gain is not proportional to threats, combat is a slow and frustrating affair (unless you're losing, at which point it will end in two rounds), and even after battles that I've won I had to make a trip back to my capital every single time to resurrect people. And then, if I'm unlucky, sit and mash 'END TURN' until I have the money to afford them.  The fact that I can only claim land in specific points also adds to the tedium, as I have to watch my territory ponderously expand toward resource cites that I've cleared out for dozens of turns before they are claimed.  Of course, the quest dialogue and voice-overs are terrible. Fortunately there's an easy way to turn unit voices off.  There were plenty of improvements between Disciples 2 and Disciples 3, by the way. Combat is now on a tactical grid a la Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. Each grid has randomly-determined sites that can increase the effectiveness of one unit type, and leveraging these effectively can make a moderate battle into an easy one (although they still don't make difficult battles into reasonable threats). Some overworld spells can be cast into runes, which can then be used to cast a scaled-down version of the spell during a battle. Heroes have something not unlike a very toned-down version of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, or the leveling system in Final Fantasy 12 - basically a grid in which each square has some sort of bonus, and you can claim any square adjacent to an already-claimed square when leveling up.  But ultimately I'd give this one a skip, even as a fan of the genre.
6336	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a knife. Never bring a T-Rex to a knifefight 9/10 would knife again.
1540	1	a	it's everything wrong with fable 3 made right and better
4700	1	a	super great game u have to get this game
6323	1	a	Short and simply put, ORION is a game developed by people clearly concerned with their consumers having fun. If you can get the game on sale, convince some friends to pick it up, or snag a bundle. At a good price, the game is worth the one night of fun you would get at minimum. The weapons are interesting, the combat is hectic and the maps large. The only real complaint that I have is that it is too hard to earn credits to buy better guns, abilities, and in some maps and game types, vehicles.
2961	1	a	The whole time I was playing this game: 'WTF IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!?!'
2583	1	a	This is probably the best game that you can get for $1 (on sale)! Only thing I don't like are the microtransactions (purely asthetic). I would have preferred to unlock all the asthetic's through playing the game but really it's quite minor. This game holds it own and seriously is more fun and addictive then the shooter you are playing right now. It's a must get.
614	1	a	This is the case of a game that could have been more and falters to stumble to a unremarkable finish. The concept of the game allows for free class shifting allowing a wide range of combat playstyles to be changed often but the quest themselves are fairly rotuine for the fantasy genre. It is however my personal feeling that where the game fails most is in providing an endgame to care about. The climatic battle of the game is comes well before the final boss who is introduced in name but fails to engage as a plot device and dies mere seconds after appearing, the final zones provide nothing that you haven't seen dozens of times since due to poor level pacing you most likely hit max level several zones ago. But you''ll notice I still recommend the game, despite these drawbacks its still fun to play if taking for what it offers. Picked up on sale it will easily provide enough to make is worth the price and that's really all a game needs to do.
1840	1	a	This game is incredibly fun. It came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. I love the class system, and how it enables players to play 'pure' classes like the typical mage, warrior, and rogue, or blend them together to better match your play style. I also really liked how each class had 2-3 weapons they were able to use (or 6~9 depending on blended classes), and I think that made combat even more versatile. (On this note, I really surprised to find that mages had access to a non-staff/wand weapon for offensive, physical attacks and I loved that.)  KoA:R has a fairly decent storyline, too, and definitely a boat-load of quests to do. I think the only issue I had with it was that I reached the level cap (40) fairly early on, or maybe about halfway through the main questline so I couldn't get all the skills/upgrades I wanted.   But overall I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy open world RPGs.
720	1	a	You know the best part is ... after play it i know i need to make a mod for this game.. ofcourse for myself  i hate when we change weapon the other weapon just pop out to the air.. we are a warrior not a magician xD  but this game well im not playin this game that long 'yet' but after play the prologue and mission 1 im pretty sure this game will give me same addiciton like Borderland 2 and Elder Scroll Franchise give to me   - ( not rated yet ) - ( read other people comment about this game ) - ( This game have a good graphic ) - ( but not have a badd â¥â¥â¥ enemy inside it )  
5463	0	a	this game wasnt worth the cents paid for it. pretty much on par with bad rats, but bad rats is a bad joke.  Orion is just bad.
4322	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
149	1	a	I think it's time I finally gave this gem of a game a review.   Unfortunately this game didn't do well on its release because games like Mass Effect 3, and Black Ops 2 were stealing the hype of players, and Skyrim had just come out four months before - thus this game went unnoticed. 38 Studios went bankrupt shortly after the game was released completely destroying any hope for a sequel.     So, why should you buy this game?     It's definitely not an Elder Scrolls game, which is why I have enjoyed it so much. The game offers:   200+ hours of gameplay. (Excluding DLC)    Extremely comfortable and convenient fighting and spell casting controls. (100% Controller Compatible)   Countless armor and weapons to build, collect, and upgrade.   Stunning visuals and graphics and so much more!  Todd McFarlane was the graphic artist on the game, which gives it a breathtaking and also somewhat cartoonish feel of the game. Each area of the game is distinctly different and absolutely beautiful, whereas with other RPGs you get the feeling you are in the same area the entire game.   If you're still skeptical of purchasing, go ahead and download the demo and see for yourself. The game is more than worth its full price of $20, so if it's on sale go ahead and grab it. You won't regret it!  9.5/10
2944	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Do you like peacefull, non FPS games? Do you like usefull teamates? Do you like paying for good games? Did you answered NO to most of the questions? Then you will love this game
6352	0	a	This game is glitchy and buggy and the gameplay lacks any kind of fun You are only trying to find the small dinos in the grass (they are hard to find) to kill em and the you shoot the big uns  nah
1381	1	a	Overall a fun game, could have been one of the best to have out of 2013, has some great graphics/modelling and battle scenes are good to play in, excellent story line with interesting characters, these are the PRO's  Some of the CONS are some quests have missing links so you can't complete. I've got Nvidia surroundview as my PC set up and I cannot get a chase camera set-up to follow my avatar, had to get used to diferent way of playing. The biggest fault for me was during the Finale [I'll try not to give too much away, don't want to spoli anybody's fun] got to the point where I was in a postion to kill the Big Boss and I couldn't complete because of a fault, in fact my avatar became so far in the 'distance' I could hardly see him and he wasn't able to use the intended technique to finish off the Big Boss.  Would have not recommended this game because of it's faults, but generall it's such good entertainment that could have been unfair, been trying to see if the Developers have got an Update for it,couldn't find one on EA [no surprise there], but hopefully one will be put out through Steam
36	1	a	A normal poker game,a little hard and simple.  The gameplay and rule is easy to learn,so you can enjoy the battle,but the game's music is so bad,only one music from start to finish ,like the producer want to brainwash you...so close the music is good at you.  This game is not good and a little short,I got it from indie bundle,so I am enjoying it and unlocked all of the achievements.  At last,Do not buy the game without special sale.
5267	0	a	50/100
4217	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played.
733	1	a	Awesome yet underrated.  Pros: Combat System Beautiful Graphics Beautiful Scenery Short loading screens Lots of content Finishing moves are brutal Class freedom  Cons: Some quests are boring Might be too easy  Score 9/10
3875	0	a	This is not one game.... this is a lot of games (and even movies)  Weapons : Cod AW/BO3 T-Rex : Primal Carnage Helmets : Star Wars (Boba Fett, Kylo Ren)  it was also released twice....  source:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
70	1	a	A very good casual RPG-poker game with perfectly fitting music and visual style.  Worth the weight.
5313	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
4863	0	a	this is a buggy piece of shiz i literally have not gone one second in this game without it lag furthermore its not even a good game in the first place
3699	1	a	Nice game  good graphics
3882	1	a	Better Than PRIMAL CARNAGE !!  Jst give it a shoot
6147	1	a	This game is like an Arcade Machine game except that you don't have to put a coin in everytime you want to play it.  When i bought this game, i wasn't really expecting much seeing its price tag, don't expect it to have BioShock Infinite graphics or something but it's still a really good game for $0.99!  Don't be fooled by the ''Hours played'' on my profile, i played alot offline.  PROS:  * Good buy menu, diversity of equipment, items and weapons * Multiplayer, duh * Objectives and missions, not only waves like in CoD zombies   CONS:  * Driving of the vehicles, it's not that good and you have to steer with your mouse. I don't really see any other cons.  So yeah, you should definetely buy this. 
543	1	a	This is a great action RPG... no really, I mean that. Most ARPGs are neither good action games nor good RPGs. This is actually good on both accounts, the combat is actually fun and not a click-fest. The story is quite good too. It doesn't have a big brand or franchise behind it so it was a bit of a risk, but it payed off big time. Long game, lots of hours of fun.
1853	1	a	Just look at the number of hours I've played....speaks for itself.
420	1	a	Fun Action, Easy to follow, Recommended Game
217	1	a	Really fun mechanics, and a decent story, one of my favourite RPGS and a must play for any RPG lover. 8.5/10
5797	1	a	Really, realy stupid
4293	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
2572	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!  9/2 Would not â¥â¥â¥â¥.  play it
2477	1	a	10/10 would get chomped again.
1028	1	a	Truly an amazing RPG, one of the best I've played in years!
1982	1	a	Wonderful RPG, the quests are fun, the lore is built upon the classic RPG type and yet feels new,the controls are pleasant and the graphics are eye catching and eye oddly old school. The music score/environmental is phenomenal. I highly recommend this especially if it goes on sale with all the DLC. It has that memorable charm that will be with you like a good cozy book. My only grief is repetative voice actors, but even they are fun to hear. 9.5/10
2774	1	a	Nice game, having lots of lag issues though, that needs to be fixed. (its the game because i have no problem playing other games)  this game is awesome to play with a few friends or just by yourself. this game isnt challenging at the start but later on you will die a couple of times wich is good, it keeps the challenge in the game. the graphics are great (although i have to play on lowest graphics because of the lag issues)   everything summed up a bit: buy this game, its awesome. but you do need a pretty decent pc to play without lag
1172	1	a	Awesome game, spend many hours exploring the world. Different ways to engage combat is also very fun, making the replay value good.
6061	1	a	the soundtrack i9n this game is so awesome!!! the prehistoric mode is awesome too i like to put the dinos health and damage to 25%:p
3405	1	a	This game is highly addicting. And packs a whole punch for such a cheap price.
3644	1	a	Great Game Jet Packs and Cloaking devices; Jurasic Park gone wild!!  Highly Reccomend this game for great online experience with your buddies.
1558	1	a	If u like RPGs then this game is the game fr you. PS tis game is best played with a gamepad or a Xbox controler 
3611	1	a	ARIZONA Vs. ORION: Prelude  I played this game for a total of 33 minutes, this includes the time I spent trying to find a server to play on. The game is worth $0.99 with no sale. Do you know what else is worth $0.99? A can of Arizona ice tea. I caculated the time I would spend to consume the beverage. ORION: Prelude gave me more time of enjoyment than an Arizona ice tea for the same price.   PLEASE READ: I didn't caculate the amount of enjoyment that one may find playing with the aluminum can after the liquid is consumed. Activities like squishing it aganist your head, stomping on it, cutting it open than poking your friends with the sharp edge and playing the game where you flick the can opener to see if you can flick it off. All these activities are equally, if not, more fun than ORION: Prelude, ORION: Dino Horde, Dino Beatdown etc.  
5982	0	a	this game suckss i want my money backk
5727	0	a	HUH this says single player. I booted it once and only saw multiplayer. I can't play multiplayer games. Whats the deal?
1271	1	a	It starts interestingly enough, then story rises with the amazing seamless settings. I could not stop taking pictures with the screen capture function of Steam!  The way you handle your weapons, awesome. Until you realize that enemies can, and usually will, be able to interrupt your attacks.  Then it gets old. Quests become formulaic.   You realize that if you put your gemmed items in your house's stash, you will lose the gems when you quit and continue the game. And some items can't be placed in your stash at all. This is important since the nature of item-drops in the game will quickly deplete your personal inventory space.  So, the game ends up like this: Quests are pretty much the same in principal. The fighting gets old, and rather frustrating later on when enemies interrupt your attacks. You pick up items, then sell them, then resume your quests and exploration, then pick more items (from chests, treasure piles, enemy loot, etc), and sell them, then resume your quests and exploration, then pick more items, and sell them, then resume your quests and exploration, then pick more items, and sell them...  ...and so on and so forth.  90 item spaces for your personal inventory is not enough.
3038	0	a	Play this if you hate yourself... and dinosaurs!
5978	1	a	This game is great and it's only for $1.
2379	1	a	Fun game, lots of problems, get it on sale or whenever they give it to you for free which is almost god damn every month. So, that's a thing.
2084	1	a	Great game, fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2289	1	a	  TLDR version; 
2860	1	a	I have no idea how it costs so little. It shouldn't be this good.
5733	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.
1146	1	a	I like this game, I really do, its fun. It's got fantastic combat, a great loot system, a inventive and unique crafting system where you make your own armor and weapons and â¥â¥â¥â¥. The world is beautiful and the soundtrack is really good too. It's downsides are lack of character developent and likeable characters and it's story is kinda boring/weak. It can be hard to get into when you first start, but don't give up, it gets fun. Otherwise this is an example of a good RPG. Final Score 8.7/10 with a badass seal of approval
446	1	a	This game is good, but could have been great. The first few hours, this game is a blast to play, until you out level everything. Once you out-level everything this game gets way to easy on hard settings. Also after you out-level everything your gear is way better than anything you loot from enemies (not rewarding).    So, why do I recommend this game? Because if you get it on sale you'll atleast enjoy 30 or so hours of it until you out-level everything and it becomes boring. The combat, skill trees, and the weapons and armor are really freaking awesome. I really wished they released coding for modders, this could have been my best game in my collection if I could've fixed how fast you level. There is one older mod for it to fix experience and gold while leveling, but it looks shady and you have to run the program everytime you play.    I'm not a dark souls fan, but also hate playing games were I one shot eveything. So I give this game a 5/10. I knocked off 5 points for bad acting and becoming strong than a God after 30 hours with no real incentive to contiue the 100+hour game.
5413	0	a	this game is horrible ,dont buy it your wasting your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ money!
940	1	a	Just bought this on sale and im already amazed by the fluent gameplay it has similarities to skyrim except improves wherever it lacks in spell casting looting and combat.
2317	1	a	It's fun with friends for a few hours every so often. you're crazy if you don't pick it up for this price.
5876	0	a	There are terminal illnesses more enjoyable than this game.
1395	1	a	Great single player RPG Action game - Loved it on Xbox got it again for steam.
1398	1	a	Amazing! Picked it up on sale, Â£7.50 with expansions, turns out its worth the Â£25! The graphics are good, the fighting is engaging, the scale is beyond belief, but best of all, the game runs at a steady 30+ fps on my laptop using a Dual Core 2.0GHz CPU and an Intel HD 3000 graphics card! Well worth the money, seriously recomend for everyone, especially those who like me are stuck with a weak Intel HD graphics card!
1305	1	a	This is a worthy buy if you ever see it on sale. Very rich lore, skill system gives you flexiblity in your playstyle, freaky challenging enemies (lots of variety in enemies, too) and a seemingly endless world to explore a loot. Sometimes it can get a bit tedious and not all of the side quests are interesting but overall you'll find something to sink your teeth into.
162	1	a	Besides The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, this is got to be my favorite RPG. Beautiful game, great combat (better than Elder Scrolls to be honest) and great sound design. A must play for hardcore RPG fans!
3969	1	a	Dinosaur wave game. Kill dinos, get paid, buy upgrades/weapons.  Good pace, easy to get the hang of, and very fun!
5273	1	a	AWESOME GAME!! It is one of the best games i have ever played, and for you who is thinking about getting it do so.
3439	1	a	First review so bear with me guys. ;_; So, I was gifted this from a friend and we decided to play together for a little while during one evening. Needless to say, I had a blast from the short amount of time that I played it. Once I have some more free time at a later date, I will definitely play this game again! I loved playing with other people in an attempt to wreck some dinosaurs and stuff... Aaaand to get wrecked by the dinosaurs themselves at times. Worth the buy for sure.
3773	1	a	This game is very underrated. It is definitly a lot of fun to play and I have yet to come across any of the bugs that it has been critisized for. It is deffinitly avery pretty game. Only issue I can think of are the dinosaur actions as they can get a little derpy. Still very fun.
513	1	a	This a fairly generic Fantasy RPG, but it is very solid, the combat is quick and feels good to play, the main storyline took me 25 hours of playing to get through, not to mention the side quests and stuff I did along the way. Definately worth buying as it goes on sale freqently. The ability to craft weapons and to respec your class means you could mix things up without having to create a new character. Good game, if not the most unique or original.
4559	1	a	Make the large dino spawn to 400%, huge clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥. People except you healing the generator, no problem. Guy goes afk for most of time and then comes back, takes your â¥â¥â¥â¥ Nice game to play with â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiots  10/10 would call someone a jew again.
4496	1	a	For $.99, you can kill dinosaurs with 4 friends or play PvP with 9 friends! Best decision in years!
4962	0	a	0/10
4562	1	a	One thing I can't figure out... I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale. Now, all of a sudden I have to buy it a second time, and at full price? Why is this happening, I thought I already owned this game.. Other than that. The game itself is awesome in my opinion, I love the halo-esque feel when playing it, then throw in dinosaurs. Done... All in all, it's a great game and would love to continue playing it, if it wasn't for the fact I apparently have to purchase it again. Hopefully this problem will be fixed one day.
3964	1	a	This game is so bad BUT if u want to have fun with ur friends u goota try this out ! If u like to own dinos by trickshotting or quickscoping them this is ur game :D
4947	1	a	Some people hate this game others love it, if you are unable to play it is most likely your computer and/or your intenet connection.
2615	0	a	Better than the meta-score, but still not worth playing.
6189	1	a	i wish i hade this game but my mom wont buy me â¥â¥â¥â¥  
3403	1	a	&gt;Bought it during the steam christmas sale for %51 off. &gt;Lauched it up but never played a round &gt;Never even launched the game for about 5 months &gt;Finaly got back on the game and played 1 solo game &gt;Only got past wave 2 &gt;Didn't play the game for about another 3-4 months &gt;Got back on a couple days ago and played a hour or two &gt;Found out the game was pretty good, like halo but you kill dinosaurs instead.  10/10 would spend 49 cents and not play it for 5 months again
5384	0	a	i have just four words to say DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
2427	1	a	Nice game but it has some things that could be done better but the benefit that it's a cheap game makes it good. :)
5935	0	a	:(
1241	1	a	A very solid and underrated game, great character system, and a decent story  8.5/10
5233	1	a	Few bugs there and here. Little bad frames, but you kill dinosaurs.  I give it T-Rex/10
1645	1	a	Impressed with sale price, a fun little game.  bit weird at first, but you soon get into it.  well worth the 5.99
4566	0	a	Gun shoots are not really that real, need a long distance of running before jump into action, abit of boring game.
1035	1	a	A pretty good action hack-n-slash game with a gorgeous world filled with some interesting lore. The game falls short towards end game because the player can be really overpowered and not much is challenging anymore.
5907	0	a	Rip 1$
1011	1	a	So far, I am really loving this game! I actually prefer it over Skyrim, just because it is not as repetitive. The gameplay is simple, but not to the point of being a super easy kind of game, although, once you acquire the best spells you're a bit overpowered lol
664	1	a	True gem of a game that was seriously overlooked on release! Despite my extreme dislike with EA products, I found this when it was on sale and decided to give it a try... it is very well made, the story is immersive and the combat is intuative. The world is huge and I found myself wanting to explore every corner of it! Of course that same OCD meant I had to finish every side quest before really moving on, and I did find myself a tad bit over-leveled from about halfway thtough and on, but most people (the non-OCD ones anyway) shouldn't run into that problem. The DLCs actually felt like they added to the game and not the typical 'add-what-should-have-been-there-for-another-15-dollars-because-f**k-you-we-are-EA' kinda way xD
6071	1	a	got this for me AND my friend for $1.60. very fun, you buy weapons and fight dinosaurs
623	1	a	Very nice game and beautiful scenario worth buying it and its always excited to finds rare item and also unique set pieces in this beautiful open world RPG highly recommended
3355	1	a	While the metascore may seem off-putting, it is COMPLETELY misleading. Great for a night with your buddies; fast gameplay interspersed with 60-second breathers, craploads of weapons, and multiple game modes to keep it fresh. The only problem is a slight lack of polish, but the game's wonderful mechanics shine through every time. In short: Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is fun!
2905	1	a	t-rex sited on me 10/10-woud be afk agien
3455	1	a	if u have a computer that cant run games very well do not buy lololoolololl laggy af
818	1	a	Great game its like playing World of Warcraft by yourself without the hot key rotation 
6170	1	a	It seems that I can NOT buy the 4-pack for my friends, now that I have purchsed a copy for myself, just so I could check out the game before sending it on to them.   This may just be a Steam Store problem, which I think I have run into before this purchase attempt.    Merry Christmas or Happy Thanksgiving, depending on which is being advertised first in your locality.
1917	0	a	.
128	1	a	Two things when playing this game: Stick with main and faction quests, treat sidequests / tasks as filler content to help you level. And play it on hard because that seems to be the base difficulty of the game, with normal and easy being merely watered down.   It's a good RPG, with an enjoyable combat system (even without controller) and gorgious graphics but it's selling point of having TONS of quests is also what shoots it down. They're mostly copy / paste of the same concepts and feel like they'd belong in a MMO. Not suprising considering this game was going to be an MMO at first, but a shame that this is what ultimately dragged down the ratings and enjoyment of a world that seemed so full of promise.   The two story DLCs are great value for your money, recommend getting those for more story and less sidequest grind.
3041	1	a	great game 
1592	1	a	Plays like fable, minus moral choices/appearance effecting things. Pretty well balanced game, decent-ish story line.  Sort of amusing that the description of the game notes, Todd Mcfarlane as Spawn creator but only gives Salvatore 'NYT best-selling author' rather than mentioning Drizz't.   Lotta Irish folklore influence, sidhe, elves, brownies, boggarts, leanshee.  Pros: fable-like gameplay--martial &amp; magic skill-trees. Rogue/Warrior/Mage, with ability to multi-class. Can sneak, pickpocket, lockpick, pass persuation checks, and sneak assassinate enemies.  Cons: honestly the only cons here are the level cap at 40 being hit a little early, but thats a somewhat known issue and you can't really expect that to be fixed by a defunct game dev. studio. Never really feels too grindy, but there are a lot of go-fetch side-quests...pretty sure you know what you are getting into though, if you are looking at this type of RPG/fantasy genre in terms of that.
3316	1	a	This game was on a 93% off discount recently, going at 0.99 USD a piece. It's possible for me to fork out a single buck from my steam wallet after liquidating some of my items, so, why not?  The first thing you should know about this game is that, there is a reason why it's score is 36/100. Yes, this game is crudely made and, in most manner, buggy, but that does not mean that this gmae isn't fun. You will get to witness some seriously ridiculous conditions, such as rains or blizzards that which can pretty much blind you. There are also times where you can get your hands on some vehicles. Cherish them, as me and my friend managed to ram more than 100 enemies while driving an average looking hummer jeep (and it 'capsized' after my friend tried to ram a boss and failed).   I didn't play much to give a full account on how to stretch this game to its full potential, though I am certain this will be a great party game and its worth a laugh or two. Just one thing, don't get this game at full price.
739	1	a	Great single-player action RPG. The respec and multiclassing system works really well.  Cons: Requires more graphics hardware than normal for a game released in 2012. Don't expect it to work on an old gaming PC just because it's an old game. A GTX 550, a mid-range card from 2011, could run the main game smoothly, but not the Teeth of Naros expansion.
1376	1	a	This RPG occupied a lot of my time when I bought it for the Xbox 360. It has the ability to fit whatever combat standard that the player wishes to use. I wish my character would talk but otherwise it has all the trappings of a great fantasy world. I remember listening to Kurt Schilling on The Instance Podcast talking about the direction that they wanted to take the world of Amalur. I believe that it would've been amazing. It's a shame the studio went bankrupt...Sigh.
3361	1	a	I managed to survive one wave with my weak â¥â¥â¥ PC, and it was awesome. Bought the 3 dollar expansion whatever thing.
6134	0	a	Worst game ever. Like, NOTHING in this game works, except for the singleplayer. But that â¥â¥â¥â¥ ain't balanced AT ALL. 'Look at me! I've got a jetpack to fly places you can't hit me!' Assault-class all the way - eat â¥â¥â¥â¥ Orion.
2508	1	a	shot an Dino in his â¥â¥â¥ and he blew up 10/10
3101	1	a	Wow i can write a rewiev for a game i doesnt have(Yet)  10/10 Not IGN
517	1	a	For 5 years this games still plays and looks better than some next gen RPG's. Though it still has it's flaws such as Stun Lock, aimbot enemies you can't dodge. But still the gameplay is stable, and graphics are excellent.
118	1	a	Vastly underated game. What Fable should have been 10/10.
2247	0	a	First of, the game is horribly buggy and impossible to finish, which sucks, because up until now the franchise was brilliant. Dont get me wrong, the game is beautiful and the story is inmersing, but the bugs completelly break the game, many battles (specially boss battles) are simply unwinnable, therefore so is the game. I wouldnt recomend buying this game, not even in sales.
4057	1	a	Excellent, needs more players...
3196	1	a	To be honest, the game is far from being perfect. The animations are bad, the bots are dumb and for the first hour in game, you don't really know what's happening. BUT the overall concept is really, really cool. It's just like some guys were sitting together over some beer and then someone said: 'I'd really like to play a game right now, where I can punch some T-Rex on his nose!' And then the second guy said: 'Yeah, and where I can fly a jetpack while shooting rockets!' And the third guy just shouted 'LIGHTSABRES!'. Then they finished their beer and started working. For all of us. Because we all secretly wanted this game.  Even though the result doesn't look as great as they probably hoped, the game works. And goddammit it's so much fun. Buy it. And buy it for your friends too, so you can punch T-Rexes and run over raptors in beach buggies together. It costs less than a beer.
3125	1	a	With the gun style of Borderlands and the HUD style of Halo that makes this perfect. And you kill dinosaurs. DINOSAURS! How can you not find 99 cents for this game! Within 10 minutes of starting my first game, my friend and I were in tears because of how much fun this game is. 10/10
4149	1	a	It's very cheap and very entertaining to play when you're bored. The graphics are really nice and runs very well on my computer.
2450	1	a	Orion Dino Horde Is A great Game! it literaly grabs you into the world where you must fight dinos for survival BUY IT NOW BEFORE THE DINOS EAT YOU!
6233	1	a	Got eaten by dinosaurs  10/10
4002	1	a	not as bad as i thort it was going to be well worth 99p definatly reminds me of halo and turok :) good game for online playing :)
419	1	a	Ruined my life &lt;3  its awesome  GET IT 11/10
1871	0	a	Everything about this game is just pretty bland, I stopped paying attention to the plot after a half hour, which is really sad for an RPG. itemization is poor, I spent 7 of the 10 hours played using the same weapon, which was a 'green' quality weapon which for some reason was better than some blue or purple weapons I found. The music was forgettable, as were the characters that I ran into, the world, and the writting/dialouge.   The combat isn't bad, but it lacks a lot of options you would normally expect to find in games like this. You have a melee/range attack button and a magic attack button and that's about it, melee combos act the same nearly every time with the same weapon and in the first 10 hours there were 3 attack spells, 1 of which was worth using. There are some other melee abilities if you invest in them, but they never appeared to be any better than just using a normal 3 hit standard melee combo.   This is essentially a single player MMO, with a more active combat system but without a lot of the things you expect from MMOs, but at least there's a lot of quests and a bit of grinding, so if you're into that, this game will give you some good play time but otherwise I can't recommend this.
4523	1	a	best 1 euro spent of my life
4761	0	a	Didn't have any intro or any tutorial. Graphics are bad. Really, I don't like any part of this game
5008	1	a	So this game is kinda like Turok. Like it's a dinosaur hunter  But it's also a defend the base, upgrade your weapons, ect. thing. Anyway. So we had a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tank. Like full on Halo Scorpion. Like this thing was heavy. Missiles and turret and â¥â¥â¥â¥. And I was a medic so I could also heal us. And I was likewell dinos, I've got the invincible tank of death. GO MATT (my driver)! And then out of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nowhere a giant â¥â¥â¥ crocodile dinosaur pops out and we're kiting it and then a Stegosaurus rams us into him and then he hits us back into it while it's ramming us and we literally just ALL (dinos and us) fly into the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing air while spinning as the dinos hump us to death and we explode in a firework of tankitude. Laughing so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard I can't even. What the hell.  It won't win any awards and realistically speaking it's not out of beta or anything but man. Worth the $1.
6143	1	a	The game is a whole dollar! Buy it! But seriously, great cooperative survival/hordes game. If you like killing floor or team fortress, you're going to love this game; especially when you consider the paltry price tag. Think Halo, meets Turok, meets Killing Floor and voila you have Orion Prelude! Highly recommend purchasing it!
2636	1	a	This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something. You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it. It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents. If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself. This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes. You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans. Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents. This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support. Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason. Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos? This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that. Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.
1149	1	a	I played a bit of this on Xbox when it came out and enjoyed it quite a bit. While it would be better for the PC if you have a controller the keyboard/mouse combo is pretty simple to use and get used to. The game itself is a little buggy on occasion but it's nothing bad (definitely not Skyrim status buggy). The storyline is fun and it's an exciting game but it doesn't have much replay value to it, even if you choose a different race. Character customization is limited but not bad. Character classes are enjoyable throughout the game, and there's a decent variety of weaponry and skills. The fateshift thing is pretty cool. You can basically dual spec. as well. The crafting skills are great. Cinematics and character/NPC interactions are entertaining. Overall I feel it would be a better game if there were different story paths, or if it were more in-depth in general to go with the amount of time it takes to complete all of the side quests + the main quest, but for the type of game it is and how it plays it's about an 8.5/10 for me.
1050	1	a	really good for epic RPG action adventure :p
2155	1	a	i love the colorful atmos of the game. The combat system is so enjoyable and loveable
4503	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
4720	1	a	This game is amazing it has warthogs lightsabres hornets and spartans. If you like star wars and halo this game is aids
3793	1	a	IDK if it worth $15 but what I DO know is this. As someone who hates online games, I have found my first Online Gaming Addiction. Since picking this up for a buck during one of the sales; I can't stop playing this game. I fricken LOVE it! The best way to describe it is Turok: Dinosaur Hunter... if It had wave survival/horde mode. You blast wave after wave of dinos &amp; completing objectives with insane weapons weapons and vehicles while earning money for upgrade &amp; more weapons. I know the game use to be a buggy pile of **** and the devs pulled some shady â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Metacritic early on by astroturfing its user score on Metacritic then relaunching it under a new name. That said, since then the Devs have worked their asses off fixing and improving the game and it shows. The devs may have ****ed up in the beginning but have since redeemed themselves IMO.
5882	0	a	Lol dev is trash hate this game
6109	1	a	10/10 would punch a T-Rex in the mouth again.
4780	1	a	Least expensive time passer in a while.      10/10
1970	1	a	I love this game! Its so unlike every other fantasy RPG I have played. Its combat has a very MMO feel, and the character creation is so good! The universe is unique, and the specializations are absalutley awesome! I also own this game for the xbox 360 and i have probably logged over 20 hours in it, and i havent even put a dent into the main story. If you love fantasy, a unique story, or beautiful scenery, this game is for you!
2705	0	a	Played this game in a FREE weekend EVENT (THAT'S WHY my GAMEPLAY TIME IS SET to 0 Hours) The sale price is a trap !! Don't buy it unless it is less than 0.49$  The game is one of those that u play for like 2 hours then never coming back to the game again Primal carnage is way better than this game  What king of openworld gameplay that can take only up to 5 players ???????
4515	0	a	this game sucks its sooooooo laggy they did not make this better than the last one it  suuucks
1527	1	a	This game is the middle ground between Fable and Elderscrolls, with a closer focus on combat. That is prob the best way to describe it. Expect far more depth than Fable, but far less than Skyrim. Less liniar that Fable, far more so than an Elder Scroll's game. Graphics that kick Fable into the mud, but are not up to the standard of Skyrim.   Combat has far more depth than both in complexity, but is essentually button-mashing that requires timing.   The main Quest has more of a story and lore than Skyim, but the side quests are all 'Go here, kill, come back' and predictable with no NPC depth like Fable.  Overall great fun, easy to get 30 hours from a playthrough, but the repetitiveness means it is not really worth the cash when you could buy Skyrim instead. Wait for a sale and grab it.
4959	0	a	This game has some cool features but I don't think they executed their plans good enough for it to be a good game. Gunplay is terrible on this game, dinosaurs are poorly textured if you ask me. It's always the same, you can go on for ages. A little bit too easy. After all I wouldn't recommend this game, this is also the reason why it became so cheap in the first place. NO.
1143	1	a	A very good and addicting game had Dark Souls 2 not come out when it did, I may have spent another 200 hours on this game that I instead spent playing Dark Souls 2, Definitely worth a buy expecially if you can get it on sale.
3289	1	a	A well spent Â£0.79 i must say, very good, recommend to everyone who like dino's or shooting so yeah
5891	0	a	I paid for this game and now its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free alright go â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur self
5574	1	a	I only love cod zombies and the survival mode is a good alternative to zombies.
1134	1	a	RPG fan? Got some money to spend? I'll say buy it..try it.  I love this game. The story is quite nice.  There r so many Side Quests(pros or cons,up to your opinion). Crafting gears..gems to slot into gears. The monsters..the skill tree.. NICE! but Caution! - if you do a lot of side quests..you may end up be an OP.  Which is nice to end the storyline...but the fight would be less action.  if u know what I mean.  Worth my money on this game.
11	1	a	One of the best card based game I have ever played. And now it's a real bargain, you cannot have good enough reason to not buy it. ;-)
1135	1	a	Surprisingly enjoyable. Easy and fun to play with fantastic fighting moves and a good story. Love the Fae Blades
2650	0	a	Oh boy, this game.  The game isn't horrible, at least not as horrible as metacritic says it is. But it still isn't good. Everyone else has explained what the game is like so I'll just do a pros and cons list.  Pros -  -It's 99 cents. -Can be fun with friends. -Graphics are mostly nice. They aren't bad, but the player models are kind of weird looking.  Cons - -Animations are horrible -Dinosaurs have skin made of steel. -Boring when played alone -Definitely not worth 15 dollars.  Overall, 6/10 would not recommend. May want to get it now since it's a dollar, but for 15 dollars, you'd expect more.
57	0	a	Sorta easy to follow uncomplex card game with a pretty unsatisfying combat mechanic. I enjoyed it to start with and it quickly got boring.,
5429	0	a	this made my balls itch !  never again ....
3203	1	a	AMAZING GAME! Sometimes you just need some mindless, time-wasting, jet-packing, missile-launching, dino-stabbing carnage. Even better? Get a few friends on a match with you and watch the hours melt away. This game delivers... NOW BRING ME SOME PIZZA!
3121	1	a	Killing floor with dinos and other game modes 10/10
1837	1	a	Very fun game, definately many hours of fun to be had on here especially with the DLC as well.
2203	1	a	This is how Disciples 3 should have been like from the start. Reincarnation is an awesome successor of series. Compared to Reinessance maps are reworked, everything(literally!) is rebalanced and difficulty is just set perfect. Contains 3 base campaigns as well as Resurrection one. Even old rock(melee), paper(mage), scissors(archers) system is nicely remade. I think it's combat is the best I have seen(archers or mages aren't OP) and I played a lot of heroes-like games. Also except some minor translation bugs everything is fine. Buy this instead trying Heroes 6 or 7 uplay disasters.
1750	1	a	Great game if you love RPGs. Think Elder Scrolls meets Fable, then throw in a combat system like something from God of War or Darksiders, plus lots of great loot and the ability to craft your own armor, weapons, potions, and gems. Highly recommended.
964	1	a	Combat dodging is somewhat janky, but otherwise a great game IMO :) Well worth it on a sale.
4412	0	a	What do you get when you release a buggy game, with stolen art assets that are slightly modified, glitched sound files, and gameplay that randomly restarts? Orion: Dinobeatdown.   What do you do when the community rages at you for it, do you:  A: Create new art assets completely from scratch. B: Smash the bugs as quickly as possible. C: All of the above or D: Rename it something else, add another game mode, and don't do anything else?  Well, these folks went with choice D.  D, For Don't Buy. Not Dinosaur.
2516	1	a	DO YOU HATE PREHISTORIC LIFE? DO YOU HATE THEM ENOUGH TO MURDER THEM WITH VARIOUS FUTURISTIC WEAPONS?? IF YOU'VE ANSWERED NO TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, DO A 360 AND RE-EVALUATE YOUR LIFE CHOICES IN LIFE. BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS (AND THE OCCASIONAL QUADRAPED) TO TRULY FEEL SWEET JUSTICE AGAINST THAT VEGETARIAN STEGASAURUS THAT KILLED YOUR FAMILY BACK IN 'NAM. YOU OWE IT TO THEM (AND THE PRESIDENT) TO SEEK JUSTICE AND REVENGE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. TAKE IT, BECAUSE IT IS A DANGER TO YOURSELF IF YOU GO ALONE, SO BRING FRIENDS. NOT ME THOUGH, I'M BUSY.
5280	1	a	Nice game
180	1	a	Kingdoms of amalur: Reckoning is an open world action rpg with emphasis on combat.  The game's plot is interesting in concept, but flawed in execution (more on that in a minute). The world is filled with powerful magic and watched over by a powerful race, the fae, split between the winter and summer court. They have lived in relative peace with the mortal races of humans and elves, until one day the winter fae attacked the mortal races. Unlike mortals though, the fae ressurect after a while, for no fae truly dies, or stays dead forever, while mortals do. You are the recently ressurected hunk of meat that takes whatever form you customised it to look like, dragged out of the well of souls, a magic item capable of bringing the dead back to life in massive numbers, except that you are its first and only success. You learn that on the day of rebirth, the winter fae have attacked the facility you are in just as you wake up, you are told about the well, what you are to a basic extent, and then told to flee the place before it caves down on your head, not before you learn you have weird powers, somehow connected to fate...  Now, it turns out that everything and everyone has a fate, dictacted by the tapestry of fate, you however, are not connected to it, and can change it however you like, in theory. This is leads to one big problem. how linar the game actually is.   You can do all the side quests in any order you like and follow a number of faction quests in whichever order you like as well, but, even if you have literally nothing binding you to a set path, no choices you make have that big of an impact, save for a handful. You are stuck following this same basic path up until the points where the game says you can make a choice, do you side with A, or B? Sometimes, if you are lucky, C. A good example is when a soldier who wants to sell everything he owns to the people of a town asks you to do it instead. You can buy all the items off him instead, but i wanted to give him way more money, maybe an OP sword i forged and make him feel better about life. I couldn't, i just had to follow the quest line mindlessly. the majority of quests can be summed up similarly. Most of the side quests are fetch quests, or 'go kill this' quests, or delivery boy quests (where you go back and forth between two characters exchanging messages and items). You can ignore them, but even the major quest lines feel weak, the only entertaining ones were those to do with the fae, but i, at no point, was able to just do whatever i wanted. I can't explain how restricted i felt doing some of these quests, and how many of them felt extremely boring.  The lore of the game is suprisingly well put together in some parts, i really loved the fae and how the winter and summer fae acted within the world. Both of the fae quest lines were the highlights of the game for me. That was the only bit of the story i found actually praise worthy.  The game, apart from the dull quests and plot full of holes, is really fun. The combat system in this is very satisfying, you have a total selection of nine weapon types, each one with a few combos each, and a slew of special moves. The enemy variety isn't great, but its just good enough to stop the game from getting stale. In the early game, combat is a bit tough, especially against niskaru, but, by the mid to end game, its dreadfully easy, especially if you ever get health regen above 4 points per second and max out smithing and sagecraft, effectively allowing you to mass produce gear that outshines every other piece in the game. The game never felt truly challanging, except for a few bosses here and there, and the only time i was fully involved and entertained was when i was surrounded by a pack of niskaru and i was out of health potions, then it was challanging.  Character progression is pretty in depth as well, you have three skill trees, magic, strength and stealth. You put points into various aspects to unlock and power up abilities, and if you put enough points into trees, you unlock classes, allowing you to gain bonuses to certain aspects of your character. I did however manage to break the game by unlocking the thunder storm ability, which was a mass AoE attack that also stunned and knock back, from there, it was down hill the moment i got chakrams, which were AoE melee weapons with high damage output.  The art style is, overall, vibrant. Everything is saturated in a rich color scheme, and alot of the designs for the enemies are pretty interesting. Though, every last bit of armour and weaponry looks like it was pulled directly from an MMO (which this was originally meant to be, or at least, meant to be a pre-quel of if i recall). As such, its all rather over sized and silly looking. Your character looks like a goof, mainly because half the time you'll be running around with pieces of different armour sets that just do not blend together. Not to mention the rather limited character creation menu.  This game isn't terrible, I would never talk anyone out of buying it unless they are specifically looking for great plot. Everything it does, it does to a decent standard and only in storytelling does it fail. It not an all time great, its not a hidden gem and its not a classic. Its more of a cult classic than anything. If you are looking for a standard, decent rpg with good combat and have some time to kill before you move onto something else, or just want an rpg who's entire focus is fae. Then this is a game for you. If you are looking for a strong plot or an rpg where every action you take directly influences the overall story for better or worse, avoid this.  I personally found this to be...acceptable, I don't regret my time with it, nor do i think i'll recall this game with any amount of deep fondness. In truth, i tried to beat this twice as a console pleb back when i had a PS3. The game glitched and broke twice on me, around the 40 hour mark. So the main reason i bought it again and beat it was for closure. Having finished it, i can cry to the heavens 'Eh, it was alright'.
2083	1	a	It's good. Deserves more recognition.
4713	1	a	This game got a 36 for a metascore. Are you kidding me? This game does not deserve a 36. It's a great fps, and the different modes are really cool. The graphics arent great, and there are some bugs. I've gotten stuck in many rocks and stuff, and dinosaurs get stuck too. Also, the game should have bots. Sometimes i just feel like playing a team deathmatch, but i wanna play alone. But you can't. Your guy just stands there and it says waiting for players and every few minutes a dino will run by. However the game has some very cool features including many guns and upgrades. Plus, I bought the game for only 99 cents. It goes on sale all the time. In fact, as I'm writing this it's on sale 1.49. With a few updates it will definetly be worth the $15. I'm not sure it's there yet though. It's definetly worth $1 though. If it gets really cheap, you should try it. Some people love it, some hate it. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10, because it still needs a few changes in my opinion. But it's still fun the way it is.
2475	1	a	After about four hours of firing non-stop rockets into an unending wave of invisible raptors with bright orange heads, I'd say this game was worth the 50c I paid for it.  The horror never ends.
5772	0	a	The game's a shoddy Halo clone with goofy dinosaurs. Didn't have fun with it when it was new, but your mileage may vary.  However, the developers of this game are shady hacks. They've done multiple re-releases of this game in the past, in order to bury the earlier iteration's extremely poor reviews. They dropped the price to a hilariously low 99 cents [or less during a sale] so they can take advantage of people thinking, 'This game's super cheap, I won't lose anything if I buy it'. They've stolen assets from other developers on several occasions, such as an armory model from the game Natural Selection 2.  As further proof of this second point, another identical halo/dino game by them simply titled 'Orion' was recently removed by Steam as of the writing of this. They ripped a *fictional* sci fi gun model [a very different scenario than if they stole a modern-day, real gun] out of one of Activision's newer CoD games and shamelessly used it as their own. I don't normally side with Activision, but I really wish more big companies could strong-arm these scumbags out of the industry.  Having paid the original price for this game when it originally released as Orion: Dino Beatdown, which was 20 bucks, and of course long before the days of steam refunds, my regret for buying this piece of garbage will never cease haunting me.  Don't buy this. Don't support these devs with this game or any other game they make. Let it all die.
2118	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game. It has a good amount of replayablitity, especially if you want to 100% the game. Just wish they would have made a second one.
1911	1	a	great graphics unique atmospere and a solid story the voice acting is very well done and the immersion is good too. its also easy to run, computers from 2010 up should run it perfect. i definently recommend this game if your new to steam and you don't have a lot of dough also if your a fan of the Fable Franchise, and especially if your a fan of fantasy RPGs swords and magic and all that. So if any of this applies to you buy it. i would give this game an 8.5/10. So have fun!!
4590	0	a	This game is more shity than my â¥â¥â¥â¥
1346	1	a	Very underrated game but - after finding out how to respec; I didn't touch it again. Not sure why I just lost all interest in the game.
183	1	a	The game is Action RPG, but it feels like offline MMO and its quite massive to complete.  here some pros and cons:   +Colorful Environment [Mid-Anime]  +Massive areas to explore  +Crafting (potions, armors, weapons etc.)  +Leveling system (max. 40)  +Home upgrades +Abilities and cards system  -Shallow main story -Auto-save mechanics are not working properly. (be sure to quick save)  -Repetitive soundtrack (gets quite boring after a while)  -Repetitive mobs (enemies)  -NPC Lip-sync is a total disaster -Lots of side quests (but meaningless)  In conclusion is a good game and I quite enjoy it.  ...even better if you bought it on sales. 7/10
3033	1	a	I know Jeff Goldblum and he says that this is the best game where you kill dinos and he is the best person to judge dino games because he is Jeff Goldblum knower of all things dino.    ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY JEFF GOLDBLUM!   Real review: This is the best game ever, I mean having the upgrade stations on one part of a map and atleast 20 seconds apart with a minute to get to them is the best idea for the best game ever.
2727	1	a	By far the best game for 1 EUR I ever played till now. DINOSAURS! You ARE SHOOTING DINOSAURS :D:D:D Add a Level and Loot-System = Perfect.
1451	1	a	This game is FN sweet, a excellent cross between skyrim and other rpg games like prince of persia. its very cool with the builds, and also the effects are amazing. I would give this game a 8 our of 10 for playability and give it an 8 out of 10 for graphics/environment. The only negative aspect. is not being able to jump from any ledge in the game or no climbing. If it had those factors. I would have given it a 10, also the bows having a limited number of arrows that take over 10 secs to replenish is a bit silly, if your going to do something like that make the shot capacity larger than 10
3856	0	a	Not so good of a game, badly-optimized too. Developer stole assets from other companies, lie/threaten legal action to the community to protect themselves, and get away by removing those content when caught, excuses attached.
1068	0	a	Not even worth the 4.99 i paided for it when on sale. It's a pile of sterotypes and cliches in a mishmash yet some how boreing pile.
4160	1	a	play this game with friends... its way more fun that way... 8/10
3817	0	a	I played the 'game' for 30 minutes. I put game in quotes because i can hardly call this a game by definition. Honestly i have no idea where to begin with this horrible excuse for a 'game', so i'll start with the interface. I was greeted with screen prompts made for a 360 gamepad. I didn't even have a gampad plugged in mind you, apparently I am supposed to use a gamepad instead of my keyboard. Even if it was a port to PC, which it isn't, why would they use 360 controls as the button prompts?   Next, i tried to join a game; 4 times, each time unsucessful. It displayed a list of servers you can join, but may of them had a ping labeled as 'lobby' tell me, what exactly is 'lobby' ping? I finally gave up trying to join a server with people in it, and decided to join an empty one just to get into the bloody game. Hindsight being 20/20 i should have just shut the game down, and unistalled. It was free however, I was naive and wated to give this 'game' a chance. How very foolish of me.  Upon entering the match, the sound was bugged. I kept hearing a repeating sound of some sort of dinosaur trying to bite my head off every 10 seconds or so, even though no enemys were to found anywhere nearby. I had no idea what the objective of the gamemode was, but it displayed an enemy generator and friendly generator health bar, as for what the hell these generators did, I couldn't honestly tell you, but somehow my team's was down to 10%. I shot a couple pterodactyls and raptors; which I could barely see because it was on some winter level, and apparently my character didnt have the ability to wipe this all consuming frost from covering his entire visor. Seriously, it was like someone took a jar of vasaline to my characters face and went 'off you go! time to kill some dinosaurs, i think!' Very shortly after, the game crashed, which was the best part of the game in my experince, BECAUSE IT WAS OVER.   Honestly, just 30 minutes of this game gave me a headache, and im pretty sure if i kept playing i would have had a brain aneurysm. Do i reccommend this game? That is a hearty and concise NO. I don't care wether or not this game is in alpha, beta, or what have you. If you are going to allow people to play it, make sure it is actually playable. 
2357	1	a	10/10 Achievement unlocked for no reason.
3425	0	a	Multiplayer is absolutely broken and unusable
1240	1	a	This is a game i go back to over and over when i want some good story and combat in a rpg, i highly recomend this game since i have played this completed this 3 times. Don't note my gametime on PC cause it was on console. If you are a fan of good combat, RPG, exploring with wonderful story and side quests this is a amazing game to get. Buy it on the price it is or just wait for sale, either way its worth it! 9.5/10
2074	1	a	This is one of the most under aprriecated games of all time. The game company 'BIG HUGE GAMES' went bankrupt after the release of this game because they went over budget and didn't get enough sales afterwards. I think the only reason they didnt sell enough was because it was barley advertised.  It feels like a new fable game but with plenty more content but less of that typical fable humor. I've heard some deescribe it as a watered down skyrim but i'd say it's just a different styled RPG compared to skyrim.  Seriously good tho
3556	1	a	.99 cent i played it longer then i ate a mc chicken... its better then some games i've paid more for.
4445	1	a	LIGHTSABERS AND DINOSAURS (The game still has bug's) 10/10
4573	1	a	This game is the description of 'so bad it's good'.
1586	1	a	Think Elder Scrolls, but with a much more MMO feel to it. Reccomended to anyone who enjoys RPGs with a lot of free world exploration and customization.
3029	1	a	so my reviews are along the lines of 'fu*k this game, 10/10' and this is no different. Wave defense, jetpacks, tanks and dinosaurs, what more could a guy ask for? you get to kill them? YES.    Fu*k this game. 20/10. Seriously.
973	1	a	A straight up old school style one person fantasy RPG. Lots of fun, with decent graphics, great voice acting and music. A rich world with lots of deep back story. Tons of side quests: I have played around 40 hours and doubt I am half-way through...A few flaws, but over all a good game.
1774	1	a	If you are willing to overlook some annoying quest breaking bugs that will NEVER be patched this is a game any rpg lover can enjoy.
2062	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is good rpg that excels in its combat but falters in its story and side quests. The story is layed out in way that doesn't flow like a good story should. Having said that, the combat is what made me finish the game and its dlc; the fluidity of the spells and weapons are unmatched in a third-person realtime rpg. 8/10
4800	0	a	'Incredible visuals and addictive combat.' Hmm, is it possible to file a lawsuit due to false advertising?
214	1	a	Combat is where Kingdoms of Amalur truly shines. Other RPGs do present an overall better and complete package in terms of lore, story and characters, such as Dragon Age: Origins (the last true Bioware game), Skyrim (the best of the Elder Scrolls series) and Knights of the Old Republic (one of my personal favorites). However, combat in these games is something to 'get through' and 'endure.' In Kingdoms of Amular combat is something that is enjoyed in the moment.
4123	1	a	0/10 it ruined my life. Okay, without joking, this game is too fantastic to cost only a dollar (however I should not complain here, I can save up more money), great dynamics, epic slow motion, the only things I don't like: the music is a bit boring for me and the other thing what disturbs me even more is that I can run through the dinosaurs (so, a not neat texture bug) but if this bug will be fixed, and more music will be added, this will be a perrrrfect game in my oppinion. I can only suggest it to anyone, especially now that it is super cheap during this sale.
2324	1	a	At just under 2 hours played -  - Running over raptors with vehicle = Yes - Lightsaber dinos to death = Yes - Jetpacking over entire map = Yes - Eaten by T-Rex = Yes  Halo with dinosaurs at 39p!!!!
606	1	a	Very simple but still fun game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
6111	0	a	The game is on the verge of being likable which is what makes it worse.
2216	0	a	Recommend not playing this game on hard. The game isn't good enough to warrant the extra challenge it entails. If you're playing because you liked Disciples 2, then you're probably playing for the story (which admittedly isn't very good either). Took me about 120 hours to finish the first campaign. That's with less than 50 turns used per mission, minimal potions and spells, and full clear every map. Pretty brainless for me overall aside from occasional battle rigging, watched One Piece while playing this.  Gameplay: Concept changes all around for the most part but the core difficulty remains approximately the same. A lot of battles need to be rigged to be won or return when higher leveled. Tactics and proper magic usage will for the most part win most battles. If we're comparing difficulty between this game and Disciples 2 (hard difficulty), they are approximately the same but functioning off different systems. You still had to rig battles in Disciples 2 until your hero was OP and magic was also pretty important as well. The critical strike system is pretty bad though. Some new features like the 'guardians' are pretty terrible, rodbearers were exponentially better.   Overall, might be worth buying on sale if you were a fan of Disciples 2 otherwise stick with HoMM series. Game wasn't bad, but it's not worth recommending to the average player.
4151	1	a	For 99p its a good deal, he maps are very big and open and everything looks pretty. Its difficult to keep track of players as they tend to die in two chomps, the sounds are repetitive and the voice commands are so cheesy they would be rated extra mature. Fun for multi player if you can have a laugh at some of the physics, its no Serious Sam and you get exactly what you pay for!
3767	0	a	There is a reason this game is 99 cents, because it's god damn awful.  The voice acting, the gunplay, the driving, the dino AI, and the PVP. Pvp is â¥â¥â¥â¥, thats it, the voice acting is horrid, the gun play if you can call it that is like having a stroke seizure thing while in a whirl pool shooting a gun with a broken arm. Awful. Dino AI loves to run into rocks, and they can't understand that if your on the rock that means they can't get you.  Also, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the god damn flying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awful trash. â¥â¥â¥â¥ em.
5611	1	a	I have to say this game is pretty good for $1
1423	1	a	A wonderful mishmash of Dragon Knight Saga, Skyrim, and several other good RPGs. Special powers are beautifully rendered, combat is visceral and enganging. The story thanks to Salvatore's background is enganging, and enjoyable. If I were you I'd take a closer look at this gem of a game.
5779	0	a	Performance is god-awful. One day while playing, I began pulling 1 FPS. I can't fix this.  I have an R9 290 and an i5-6500. There is no reason for this crap.
2339	1	a	game made me hate pterodactyls  go hear for moor revew:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ceubiesreviews 
4392	0	a	This is the worst game ever created all things considered. If a free Android game is bad, you don't really care because your expectations were so low to begin with. When a Dino game is this bad, it can be considered to be near the top of the list of worst games of all time. With the budget and the supposed good reviews this game received, David Prassel should be sued with a major class action lawsuit of everyone conned into buying this game. The graphics are terrible, the dinos were mindless, and the multiplayer is idiotic. There is no strategy, the maps are way too open and large for nerds to play. With the jetpacks your game becomes broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  9.9/10 ~ IGN legit reviewer
5456	1	a	Why is this game rated 36/100??? its like frigging halo meets jurassic park, with upgrades, special abilities, and giant â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs trying to eat you and your base! SWEET GAME! Multiplayer is the â¥â¥â¥â¥!
4587	1	a	I love this game a bit laggy if u play on a laptop with pretty nice graphics but still awesome
4574	0	a	This game is still HORRIBLE after three years of support. Please stop supporting it and let it die. If this is seriously 3 years of effort, you need to find a new career path.
877	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash game 1/10 story line
1505	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning will always been one of my favorite games. It was not perfect, bugs, and unbalalnced attributes will allways be a part of this game but for some reason I keep coming back for more. Here I am, a years later still redownloading it on every computer I come by to play it again and again.
5575	1	a	Metascore is way low!! this games actually pretty fun.. PvP needs some improvement but honestly I would pay full price after having such a good first experience playing this game  Definitely reccommend!!
574	1	a	Jumping with Dagger Class weapons thrue Enemys is alot of fun, even more are the Finisher xD. Would Finish Again 10/10  I got over 50 hours in Origin Account but wanted it on Steam too, stil had not time to play much xD.
3533	1	a	Awesome for the .50 cents price tag alone!
424	1	a	I had heard a lot of crap about this game before I played it, and only bought it because it was 7 bucks with all the DLC included and because I had tried a demo of the game on the 360 a while back and it seemed decent enough. That 7 bucks brought me roughly 77 or so hours of content. I consider this to be a pretty decent deal. The main complaint I hear is that the game is repetetive - which RPG isn't? I also hear it compared to MMORPG games a bit, but the quests do actually have you going to places and doing various tasks rather than your traditional MMO routine of 'kill 5 rats.' It does have the Dragon Age 2 issue of all of the dungeons looking roughly the same, but that was the only real negative I could think of while playing through the game. The story is interesting enough, the combat while a bit easy at times is variable depending on how you spec your character (one of three styles: warrior, thief, mage ..essentially). You can also mix them up a bit.  If you can find the game for as cheap as I did I say grab it. For 60 bucks? I don't think I'd have been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I spent the money and got this in return, but I'm not sure I'd buy this over something like Skyrim for the same amount.
5959	1	a	I picked up this game along time back and it was unplayable so after looking at it again what an inprovment great game good job team!
3758	1	a	Fly through the air with a jetpack cutting up T-Rexes with laser swords. 10/10
1906	0	a	THe game has an interesting combat system and would acutally be fun ... if it was not completely overloaded with sidequests to the point where I simply gave up because I felt so swamped that I had no fun playing anymore.  A linear questline with some sidequests is fine, I even love a ton of sidequests as long as they are structured in any way but as it is here you pretty much can get a quest from every second npc wandering around. They should have put those gazilion quests onto a notice board or something so you can pick those single quests all at once. Also the quest-tracker needs to be a lot better in a game with this many quests. Maybe creating chains would also help instead of single 1-3 step missions.  I bought this game on sale, so not much money lost, still I regret the buy a bit.  In the end, do not get me wrong this can be a very nice game, the combat is interesting, I like the style and it has a lot of audio content (pretty much everything is spoken so there went a LOT of effort into this part of the game - even if some of the actors sound royally bored) ... BUT and this is a big but: this game is only for you if you have a massive amount of time and like running in circles to finish missions for days on end and do not get frustrated by overwhelming amounts of go-there-kill-that-come-back quests. If you are looking for a game that you can go up against for a really long time, pick this one up, if you like even a resemblence of structure (and I am not talking forced lineare gameplay, open world is fine as long as there is some structure that keeps you from getting totally lost) skip it.
848	0	a	Bought this game and couldn't even launch it. Google revealed many others with the same problem.  Not sure if this is an issue with installing it through steam or an issue with the game.
4147	1	a	If I could say one thing about this game...it would be dinosaurs
5775	0	a	This game is like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ step child of the video game 'halo' and the old television series 'The land before time'. Aside from running around like a brain dead moron killing little foot, There's really nothing to do in this game. 10/10 would not recommend to a paleontologist.
30	1	a	This is one of those games that makes me wish we had a 'thumbs in the middle' button. I liked it overall, but there were times where my experience just felt frustrating, and I don't think it was my playing poorly or anything like that, I think it's just an awkward design at times. If you're looking for a card game, there are better games, but it's not the worst one on the market.
1892	1	a	A good role play game.
3326	1	a	Reminds me of Firefall ... but a little bit cheaper
5227	1	a	Had a great fun in this game and will be playing more during next lans. So good lan game
5676	1	a	An excellent game that you'll soon forget!
6225	1	a	Very entertaining to play with friends a must buy for under 5$.
4259	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
6202	1	a	Watched my friend run around a mountain being chased by a t-rex while I was invisible. 8/10
959	1	a	Seemless sandbox with simply amazing enviroments. Captures that 'awe' feeling you might remember from your early days of gaming. Simply put, its worth the money in every way imaginable.
3979	1	a	Definitely underrated, but still gets boring relatively fast.
5172	1	a	SO this game from customer side, looks little boring. But. this game is much diffrent when you play. its AWESOME !!! kill dinos, buy weapons (but you will lose them after last wave). i dont know why its too cheap. but its cool.
2109	1	a	I sold Technomancer because I was disappointed in almost every aspect (except graphics). I tried out this game and I love it! I love every single aspect (inclusive graphics)!
2359	1	a	shot a midget pterodactyl with a helicopter shooting rockets, then i randomly blew up: 11/10 would die again 
2778	1	a	I don't know what you guys are talking about because it's even worth 15$ But one dollar I don't how they make money. But it's a good game. 
3143	1	a	T-Rex throws machineguncar on hill, machineguncar not reachable for enemies and can kill all 20/10
5759	0	a	Not only is this a mediocre game, but it's chuck full of stolen assets ontop of being rereleased three times.
46	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
5794	0	a	laggy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
6319	1	a	Pretty pointless, but fun nonetheless.
1014	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Rektoning ( Í¡Âº ÍÊ Í¡Âº) i r8 8/8 m8
1323	1	a	Gothic 3 should look like this one. Game after little camera fix program is nearly perfect!!!
2431	1	a	I was riding on the back of a T-Rex.  10/10
2457	1	a	Best game ever 10/10 would play again
171	1	a	Worth every cent. The skill combinations and seamless integration between magic melee and ranged skills always keeps a fight interesting. The monsters are a bit repetative but what do you do when you see a lot of repetative mobs?  Kill them all.  The story line is also well thought out with extensive and detailed lore.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys mmo's and action games.  A side note; you will become incredibly powerful in this game. Hard mode is the way to go if you want a sight challenge, but the game isn't very hard to play. Great for the casual gamer.
1243	1	a	This game is so addicting and I'm sad that there won't most likely ever be a sequel.
2137	1	a	As of writing this, I'm 115 hours in and am only in the first half of the last part of the story [exhausting every quest along the way], and still have both of the DLC to go through. The combat is probably the best part of this game, the fate/destiny level system pretty much serves to let you customize your style of fighting. The artwork is quite good, if mmo-ish. The story is decent. There are plenty of quests to do, parts to combine to make items you want, and houses to furnish. It's not too challenging though if that's what you look for in an RPG [my playtime is just due to me grinding as I go to get to max level so I can do the DLC at max (DLC drops and rewards scale to level as you enter iirc) before ending the story].   My advice for maximum enjoyment, challenge, and actual decision making, in terms of gear, is to avoid getting gold through excessive gem combination farming and to not be tempted to save-scum when salvaging gear for crafting parts. Also, try to finish everything in an area before moving on because regions level lock to the first time you enter it and thus you can cripple your progression if you just run willy-nilly and locking the first regions to level 2 or something [despite it being open world].  For the power gamers: gem combo farm like hell for 30 mins after like the first four regions and you'll never need money again. And save scum like hell when salvaging to get those +damage parts for crafting when they're available, because crafted items are the most OP stuff in this game.  TL;DR - Excellent Combat, good skill set customization, good art style, ok story, plenty to do, not the most challenging, crafting is op, gem combo farming is op, region level lock shenanigans possibly spoiling the open world and ability to level up fast element for some people
4103	1	a	nerubian dino hord is a revolushonary game that blends the horde mode made by halo reach and jurassic park to make an incredibul gamig experiense
1421	1	a	A decent port of a very underrated game. The combat is fast and fluid, the voice acting is of a decent standard and the graphical style is charming. The storyline has a few interesting points to it and the premise as a whole intrigued me. It's definitely an RPG to play if you enjoy the typical mechanics of the genre. While it has a few mechanics that are poor copies of other more established titles (notably The Elder Scrolls) the game does enough on it's own merits for me to recommend it.
6306	1	a	Pretty cool game, un polished in a lot of areas. But for the type of game it is, it handles pretty well.
515	1	a	mostly my 2nd longest played rpg on steam first one would be skyrim unless you count ffxiv.  game is really fun and un-noticed by many gamers, you will like this game it has many hours of content in the base game plus many more in dlc content. side quest are fun to play and even give purple weapons exploring caves and killing monsters gives blue and purple at times. graphics are nice and have a fantasy feel to it the music is okay but can be better the combat has to be the best part of this game from evading strikes to using chain attack moves on farther away enemies, mages are my favorite class to play because they can call down giant rocks on fire and just wreck everyone. stealth is fun to play as to but not really needed with there were more classes to choose from maybe a demonology or summoner maybe even a cleric class :(. only thing that really pisses me off is the fact that everyone looks the same and the monsters get dull after awhile i mean skyrim had the same monsters spread out but you didn't fight them every 5-10minutes like in KOAR  i will still give this game a 8/10 because it has kept me playing it this long   doing this when i am tired so spelling may be off :/
3926	0	a	I personaly dont like it if its 1 â¬ then u buy it but no at full price bcs its always same kill 30 mini dinosaurs kill 1 gigant kill 30 minis kill 2 gigant and so on
5354	0	a	Once upon a time I gave this game some praise and said it was janky but fun! Unfortunately, then all the content dried up, a microtransaction shop was added (along with the maps cut in the last pre-Horde patch), and the game effectively turned into a just-fixed-enough-to-be-dull game instead of a hilarious drinking game.  If you buy this, only buy this with friends who know what they're getting into, and who will certainly play with you. Also have fun waiting for a sale, because the devs have sat out the past two major Steam sales for... â¥â¥â¥â¥ knows why.
2812	0	a	Warning , there is NO invert options on this, i have waisted cash and space on this . if you do find options for this pls let me know as i cant find invert anywhere. good looking game but built in the stone age it seems:( 
4763	1	a	I LIKE IT BUT IT REQUIRES A VERY GOOD COMPUTER TO PLAY..
1425	1	a	I sunk around 100 hours into this on the ps3 when it came out and decided to buy this again with all the DLC during a summer sale. Unfortunately for some bizzare unknown reason, you can't change the key bindings which makes it awkward to press some of the keys in my opinion. I binded these 'awkward' keys to my mouse so I don't mind this flaw (that, and to me hard difficulty isn't that hard). The combat is great, it's what makes the game. Feels like a single player MMO for me with housing and housing upgrades you can purchase, factions, being able to respec into any talents you want to along with professions, and a vast open world to explore.
1077	1	a	Awesome game for this price. 93hrs on record and now my family are playing it. Will there be another one made ............. i hope so
527	1	a	A simple game. Extremely repetitive. Has its charm or else I wouldn't have put 50 hours in it. Every dungeon looks the same, every quest is kill this or collect that, and the combat lacks any variety. But if it's on sale and you want a change of pace it's not that bad.
3790	1	a	I think this game is the best dinosaur game besides primal carnage 
522	1	a	excellent fantasy rpg. lots of good action with tons of things to do. way better than risen.
4482	0	a	Became free to play because it was not even worth 1 cent
2192	1	a	wait....this isn't Skyrim?!!
2394	1	a	wow. such dinosaur. very achievement.  putting a mech on a helicopter  10.000001/10 would glitch again
3386	1	a	wow..lots and lots of dinos especially on prehistoric difficulty...lots of fun and only 79p..AWESOME
3928	0	a	Constant problems with server connection, ingame user interface was poor/poor game play. Did not feel like a complete game
2688	1	a	A good game. Entertaining, Beutiful And- DINOSAURS! The maps are well made. The game is extremelly fun, though lacks a large player base. Deserves more than its current meta score for sure.
4706	1	a	ITS FUN at bit laggy but fun all the way! 
6277	1	a	Pay no attention to the 'metascore' as it does not reflect this game at all. At the moment I have just finished my first game and it was awesome. It reminds me of Halo mixed with Turok. I figured out most of the controls within five minutes and was soon blasting away dinos. If you want a fun game that can also present a challenge then I recommend this for you.
2167	1	a	If Fable and God of War would ever get drunk and end up doing some QTE's of love, Kingdoms of Amalur would be the result.  If you like hacking and slashing away in a colourful fantasy world, this is probably going to be your best buy in a while. Even though the story's not as epic as in other RPGs, there are a lot of cool little storylines going on. And if the story doesn't do it for you, there's the awesome combat. Think God of War light with shakrams, swords, hammers and what not. Add a metric but ton of loot and lore and you've got yourself a great way to spend the coming winter.
2523	1	a	Super fun game the score is very deciving its super fun!!!
3724	0	a	6/10
3083	1	a	Very fun time killer with friends.
4880	0	a	Its pretty terrible. Not even worth .99 cents.
5938	0	a	its bad
87	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
5504	0	a	This game is terrible. On release it felt like an Unreal Tournament 3 mod but a very incomplete one, and now it is full of content, still feels like an unpolished UT3 mod. I'd give it 3/10. Not worth it. It has potential but needs a lot more work.
3460	1	a	This does have a feel similar to halo. Haven't gotten very deep into it yet but it also reminds me of playing Turok back in the day! Seems like a great game to play with friends!
1617	1	a	I really enjoyed this game a lot, but once i completed the main storyline quest, I lost all interest in it. So great game, but little replay value for me.
1333	1	a	(played it originally on ps3) A very time consuming, but awesome RPG. 9/10 ( would not recommend more than one playthrough)
2283	1	a	360 noscoped a T-Rex for 0.49â¬ 10/10
4077	1	a	cool game
2720	1	a	Will not start up... Dont get it yet, wait till they fix this!
3274	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, and you also enjoy slaughtering them, this is your game! 10/10 - IGN
2072	1	a	
1772	1	a	great game, great crafting. im really enjoying the story!
3748	0	a	It's Left for Dead with dinosaurs. Except you're protecting a thing, and it takes too long to get to the thing from the shops.
4196	1	a	This game costs 79 cents. 79.Cents. It's worth it. If you want a few hours of fun with your friends, buy this. It has dinosaurs, an in-game shop,did i mention dinosaurs? It's fun.
3011	1	a	You can kill a T-rex with a lightsabre.  10/10
6327	1	a	a game you can't stop playing hrs upon hrs of fun :D
4302	1	a	The T-rexs throw rocks better than a MLB super star pitcher.
358	1	a	Highly underrated game. Incredibly fun. Great story. It's a shame that the studio that made it went under.
4177	1	a	Dinosaurs, space, vehicles etc. are all totally worth the price
2941	1	a	Just 2 much lagg, sad but true.

2937	1	a	'Games can't fail. Only developers can.' - orion dev team  this statment is true to every sinlge aspect of a game.  this game use to be unplayable, glitchy and down right imposible sometimes, but not the game has evolved into something beautiful and worth every penny you spend on it.  litteraly wtf guys, you forced a dream to come true, you are the real heros of videogames.
3017	1	a	Orion Dino Horde, is basically HALOXKILLERDINOSAURSXGOODGAME. The game is fast paced with a couple ways to play. Three classes: Assault (Can Fly), Support (MEDIC!), and that one sexy female class that can go invisible. With rounds of dinos and lots of guns to play with, what could go wrong?
5102	1	a	This game will leave no jimmy unrustled
297	1	a	Awesome game! pick this up if you love long long RPGs.
2497	1	a	Great Game For MultiPlayer And Killing Different Dragons !!! &lt;3 &lt;3 but shuld inprove a bit cause it's a bit of a mix of Halo i hate Halo but when i m playing it i kida foget about it :)
4508	1	a	Great and Cheap for $1
117	1	a	This game came out 4 years ago on my birthday, and unlike my parents, I wasn't disapointed.
85	1	a	If you like card games, you will like this competative version of poker and roll playing. I had so much fun with the demo, I had to purchase the full version. Only complaint, it's too short. Give it a try, you'll like it.
3796	1	a	You can be a small dinosaur 100000000000/10
6190	1	a	this game is one of the best games i have ever purchased on steam i compleatly love this game and any one who loves servival should get this, this game puts cod zombies servival in the same league no joke :D
3162	1	a	Like halo... with dinosaurs very good and fun
5436	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
6299	1	a	by far the best $1.00 I've EVER spent... 8.5/10
501	1	a	The combination of rich lore inspired by Celtic and Gaelic mythology and the varied and engaging combat, I loved my experience in this game. I like the idea behind MMORPG games, but the execution falls short for me and the social component is more of a liability than an asset. Kingdoms of Amalur delivers on the promise of the MMO setting, and the ability to rebuild/respec your character from scratch was a great way to keep the experience fresh and engaging. While it doesn't warrant multiple playthroughs, once through gave me dozens of hours of fun and exploration. I just wish the player races had greater consequences.
2153	1	a	This game could easily make tons of money becoming an mmo!!! This game is a lot like fable. The combat is a lot better and the story is less rediculous. Very beautiful graphics and the game play is fun too!
4179	0	a	Kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ but still dumb entertainment, recommended for the $0.99 price tag as opposed to the $14.99 price tag unless you are dumb enough to buy it at that price...
1412	1	a	Love it.
4164	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. The physics engine is flawless. I was wrecking dinos left and right and then a T-Rex through a boulder at me. 10/10 would buy the 4 packs for friends.
2474	1	a	This game started out as 'meh whatever' and is now skyrocketing somewhere between 'neat' and 'awesome'. While it's not a AAA title game it is also not available for $50- anything below $15-20 for this game is something you cannot say no to. Whether you just wanna mow down a ton or Dinos with your friends or wanna mow down a ton of friends as a dino- this is the game for you.
345	1	a	GREAT game for a newbie. My first RPG and it was very easy to pick up and play. Beautiful scenery and storyline.
1192	1	a	I disliked no autorun feature the biggest. Other than that the game is completely and utterly awesome
6187	0	a	I tried this when it was free to play. It is just an awful game.
1074	1	a	This game is on the same thread as Skyrim and Fable. If you enjoyed those you'd like it. You can really design a lot about your character; stealthy, sorcery, or a bad-â¥â¥â¥ melee dude, up to you. The beginning is a bit slow and tedious to read, but once you're past it it's a lot of fun. There are talent trees and professions, so if you're used to that sort of thing you should do fine in this game.
1708	1	a	BEST........AROUND...NO ONES GONNA EVER TAKE YOU DOWN!!
1401	1	a	Most 8/10 game I have ever played
3751	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is an interesting, multi-player game. Although the concept of Dino Carnage With Friends has already come into play, Orion Dino Horde does it well, with science fiction laser weapons, the ability to play as a dinosaur, special objectives, and three special classes, all with a useful mechanic to help win a game. However, I found lag an issue on a computer like mine, 500 mb hard drive, 4 gb RAM, and lowest quality on the game, but i still had 20 fps. If you have a good computer, its a good game, but otherwise invest in something else. I still recommend it though. 7/10
5464	1	a	worth the 99 cents 
2329	1	a	is it a perfect game? Nope not at all BUT it is very fun i bought it back when it was $0.99 and even though its now f2p i still dont regret it, its a fun fps game to just shoot some dinosaurs trying to stop your generators and you have a large assortment of vehicles aswell as weapons also if you play most of your games offline and solo like i do it completely supports that so grab some guns and blast some space dinos!  (if there is one bad thing to be said its the micro-transaction store for cosmetics im not a fan of stuff like that in any game at all but aside from that its still a solid fun game to play)
215	1	a	This game is unusualy easy. Even on the hardest difficulty it is not that complex. It has great character evolution and many magnificent items. Even though there is the difficulty problem this game is worth it.
1202	1	a	Open World RPG in the same vein as Elder Scrolls meets mostly competent writing meets character action game combat meets Diablo-style loot. And while all of this is done competently, it often feels like the game suffocates under the amount of ideas and things to do the developers wanted to put in. You certainly get your money's worth. When I reached the maximum level I hadn't done even a quarter of the side quests and the myriad of stat bonuses from loot, crafting, collectibles, quest rewards, leveling makes the game unchallenging even on the hardest difficulty.  Get the Widescreen Fixer to adjust the FOV to non-console standards, set the game to hard, try to play as a non-mage or at least avoid the one-hit-kill spell meteor. Don't grind, don't do tasks, avoid side quests aside from the faction ones.
4329	1	a	I bought this game for two of my friends and I.  Now all three of us hate me.
2342	1	a	This game is no where near related to it's metascore. First of all, this game has gone through some intense updates that have made it insanely fun. You have the Unreal engine (Which is very good), The Halo-like multiplayer, and YOU CAN KILL DINOSAURS.  TLDR: I ate my friend as a T-rex and I don't think I've ever heard anyone â¥â¥â¥â¥ themself over the mic. 11/10 It's OK - IGN
264	1	a	A pretty formulaic action RPG with a sometimes-interesting story and little to no challenge involved on even Hard difficulty. If you've played Fable, that's roughly what you should be expecting. It's okay for wasting a couple of days of your life and somewhat enjoying it, but the wasted potential makes me cri evertim.
5415	0	a	It's terrible :/
1315	1	a	A very under rated game. An Open World RPG with the combat mechanics of an intense action game reminiscent of God of War. If you happen to see this game on sale pick it up, it's definitely worth the 5 bucks!
541	1	a	In my personal view, Kingsdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has been the best Fantasy RPG I have played so far, even 3 years after it's release. It did not only fulfill my expectations but surpassed them easily. It is sad to think that this game was so poorly advertised and underrated that it actually cost a lot of people their jobs. This work deserves more. This world has been created with great detail and amazing imagination, the story is classic fantasy yet totally different. And the combat speed and effects will burn your eyes out! I always return to Amalur, exploring the vast landscapes is a treat in its own right and there are still so many missions and quests yet to master.
926	1	a	Destiny system OP. NPCs worship me as a living god.  10/10
3192	0	a	This game sucks
4823	0	a	Horrible, I feel ripped off for 99 cents right now. Bad game.
3493	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
4473	0	a	Orion: Prelude (previously known as 'Orion: Dino Horde' and before that 'Orion: Dino Beatdown') exemplifies poor design with just about every detail, from the graphics to the gameplay. Visual effects (Motion blur, lens flares, water droplets) are overused to an extreme, actually making it very difficult to see what you're doing in some cases. It's as if the developers saw an effect they liked and put it in because it looked kind of cool, without any thought to how it meshed with the rest of the experience. This pattern holds true for the rest of the game: features are either half-baked (class system is totally useless) or just poorly done (sound design and animations are just awful).  Perhaps the only thing worse than this game is its the community: they really put the 'cult' into 'cult classic'. Look at any review online and the comments section will be littered with comments ranging from claims that 'the game is much better now and deserves a re-review' to outright accusing the reviewer of slandering the developers. It holds a 'mostly positive' ranking on steam simply because fans bombard the review board with meaningless positive recommendations (probably so they can appear in one of the games trailers).  The idea had potential, but there really isn't anything redeeming about what Trek Industries made with it. The only selling point is that it's so cheap, but I'd actually recommend not buying the game just on the principle of not supporting such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ product.
5182	1	a	it didn't give me cancer. 5 stars.
1330	1	a	One of the best games ever on the pc. Combat is fun, customization is freaking nice. I originally played this on the xbox360 but was never to fully commit. graphics are nice. performance on my is nice too.
55	1	a	Wish there was a neutral rating for games like this... Not bad because I like card games combined with RPG elements but this one has some serious flaws (too repetitive, lack of content etc) and mostly the end game. It sucks so much...
504	1	a	Best game ive ever played so far in my life cant wait till Bethesda make new games hopefully like this one 
1360	1	a	Love the game!   Positive:  - Awesome graphic art style  - Great gameplay / combat system  - Really good story  - Very fast loading times  - Big varied world  - Extensive crafting  Negative:  - Level cap too low (DLC included)  - Re-spawns are a bit too frequent - Some quests don't get marked as 'finished' / Some quest items get stuck in the inventory.   All in all: Highly recommendable RPG! :)
6405	1	a	This game is one of a kind. I loved the game play and how hard the bosses were(sorry for the bad spelling).
904	1	a	it copied skyrim.
2696	0	a	Wow this is bad. I didn't plan on even testing this out until I read some reviews and decided to try it for the weekend trial. Wow what a mistake. I played a whole 30 minutes of this and knew this was garbage. This game has numerous basic gameplay issues. Just to start off, you can't properly remap your keys and the keys displayed in the control settings don't correctly state what key something is currently bound to... Shooting a gun has some sort of a lag from when you actually click and the gun shoots to when you see your weapons recoil/flash... Everything is scaled horribly, it's like they had no regard for what things should look like. You'll have dinosaurs ranging from mouse size to giant size, vehicles, buildings and consoles all look like they took a whole 5 minutes slapping something together... I honestly knew what I was getting into when I looked at this game and other reviewers made me think otherwise. I am honestly more dissapointed at the Steam community for all the 'recommendeds' for this pile of dinosaur crap. Don't waste your time on this, even for a $1 there are much more polished games out there.   Metacritic got this one right. Heed my warning, stay away.
1748	1	a	A very deep often overlooked game. This game takes the best part of fantasy lore's found in top notch RPG's, as well as a good action based combat system typical of hack and slash games.... oh and of course loot.
2830	1	a	Great little game, fun too mess around on and fun to play with friends. I would recommand getting it. :D
2334	1	a	I was honestly unsure of this game, a friend of mine had bought it for me so I gave it a go. Now there is an issue with lag at some times but it is rare. The up of this game, well it's just fun as hell. I love getting in the cars and just plowing over the raptor. Even my son plays this game with me on another computer. the game is multiplyer or you can go solo if you so wish.
2268	0	a	Avoid this one! It plays like an old school HoMM, but it is just broken. The AI will gobble up mobs (and almost always be higher level), yet when you fight it behaves incredibly simple and very easy to predict/control. There is very little deviation in troop layout, the battle maps are extremely small, and movement is very limited. All combined makes for almost no deviation in strategy. You'll find one (maybe 2) strategies that work and that's it! Don't bother trying to have fun, just repeat the same strategy for every single fight and walk around the map some more. Oh wait, sometimes you have to buff your army before a fight. I guess that makes it refreshing and new.  I really wanted to like this game. I liked the first 2 Disciples, and I like the HoMM style of gameplay. The graphics are nice too. But, this game is just broken.
1413	1	a	This game is a bit under the radar considering I'd never seen nor heard of it until it went on sale, but don't let that disuade you from buying it - it's every bit as good as the other top tier open-world-fantasy-RPG-ish games available.   In a nut shell it feels like 'Elder Scrolls meets Darksiders 2' with the fantasy art style, combat, epic story and equipment/looting systems. Definitely worth the sale price, and I even came back to buy some DLCs which are worthy of purchase as well. If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 it would be a solid 8.5 or 9.  Also, if you are like me and don't like the zoom level of the camera you can download a program called Widescreen Fixer and this game is auto-listed in it. Select, set it up, and you can set the zoom as far out as you want.
4662	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
6354	0	a	Very laggy, wasn't able to do anything. I had just the game open and it glitched and lagged so bad. I felt like I was on DSL again. The graphics are nice, but it isn't worth the lag. I give it a one out of 5 stars, graphics are nice. Only good thing about tha game to be honest.
18	1	a	Great game. It's like Puzzle Quest but with cards instead of gems. And I don't know a thing about playing cards. So you can imagine how fun it is for me. The graphics are simple but cool, and add to the atmosphere of the game. The  sound and music are pretty good also. But there is something I hope they'll fix in future updates. Because it starts off pretty easy (obviously), but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly (after about 10 fights). And it's not just based on skill but luck as well. So there are times when you have to refight enemies 5-6 times in a row. Only downside to an otherwise excellent game.  [Rating: 77/100]
1299	0	a	If for whatever reason someone out there would like to play a MMORPG, but without the 'multiplayer' and 'online', this is the game for you.  Also the field of view is balls.
5861	0	a	1 start game : Menu screen at 2-10 FPS???!!! 2 starts private match for controls : FPS CANT GO ABOVE 5??!! 3 Wants to be dino: HOW DO I BE A DINO?! 4 Never figured out the AI and how to be a dino: WHAT?! 5 Never figured out controrsl no tutorials: &gt;:(  RATING: -5/10
2466	1	a	This game made me realize that judging a game based on Critic reviews is a big mistake. I just don't know why people complain about this game. This game is very enjoyable and has hours of fun!
3349	1	a	I don't know why, but i can write a review for this game. I have 74 minutes of playtime, and have unlocked 14 acheivements. I have never played this game.  ?  
1534	1	a	Excellent game, Crafting was amazing, gameplay was fantastic, Only downside was lack of a multiplayer mode.
1980	1	a	This is Skyrim, Arcade Edition.  (Note my playtime says 1.3 Hours, its actually closer to 40 - been playing Offline for a large part.)
747	1	a	good game you cant turn off the quest makers. Makes for a challengeing game, instead of just running from way point to way point. Good voice acting,good dialouge and story. 8/10   SUCK IT 
4078	0	a	For a dollar, I would say give it a try. However, since a dollar isnt how much it usually is, I won't reccomend this game. Now, I've only played two gamemodes, but they seem to be the main ones, nor have i put much time into this game. But here goes my first thoughts.  First off, I'll go over Survival, a classic Horde-survival. However, it seems very broken and simple. While on top of a building, well out of reach of a Triceratops, it hit me and sent me flying, even though there was no way that could've possibly hit me. The raptors and compies are also far to easy to kill, as they are unable to jump to reach you. This gamemode seems simply to easy.  Now onto Rampage. The Dinosaurs attacks have simply HORRIBLE hit-markers. As a trex, I bit right on top of someone, but the game simply didnt count it. The eggs also simply floated in the air, sometimes out of reach for most dinosaurs, when the carrier was killed in mid-air. The vision was also weird for me, and sprinting doesn't seem to make anything move faster, but that's probably just me.  Overall, try the game for free if you have enough space and feel like it. However, I highly reccomend against this, as the game is pretty broken in several key-aspects at the moment.
403	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a 'should buy' for anyone into fantasy CRPGs. Why not a must buy? It is a game and apparently a game franchise with no future. It plays far better with a controller than it does with a mouse and keyboard.   What about the good stuff?   If you don't like crafting, you need not engage in it; but, if you are into crafting, there are opportunities to build some crazy good gear. Potions are kind of hit and miss, but you won't regret being able to make health regeneration and healing potions. Overall, crafted gear is not as critical as it can be Skyrim; and potions are definitely more useful.   I really liked the combat system with its combos and different types of attacks working better/worse for different foes. There are opportunities to crank up the difficulty and win by thinking your way to victory. Alternately, you can reduce difficulty and just button mash your way through . . . should you fear the joystick and the nuances to combat. Each of the three major types of character archetypes yields a different playing experience.   The story and RP aspects of the game? Given the pedigree of those involved, this was actually little disappointing. The story arc isn't bad, but it is not as rewarding as, say, Dragon Age: Origins or the first installment of Mass Effect. The DLC is actually pretty good if you can forgive the grindiness of Naros and the silly in Dead Kel (some will find the silly endearing . . . others not so much). Some of the faction quest lines are actually good to very good; but the relationships you build with the factions comes to crashing end when the faction quests end. At the very least, this is a missed opportunity.  I have no regrets buying this game when it was on sale.
5956	1	a	this game is soo cool i want it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
2261	0	a	The game is glitchy for me. The mouse pointer does not work. So I can't play the game.
2718	1	a	For however â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheap it is, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hilarious to play with friends. It also looks REALLY good.
1499	1	a	To everyone involved in making this game, thank you for crafting such an immersive joy ride. This 'playable novel' is inventive with careful attention to detail (and vast amounts of it--far above average).  Those who merely want a twitch game might be disappointed; it's not very challenging once the character becomes developed, but that is part of the story design (and only those most afflicted with ADHD will be negatively impacted). Anyone who wants a great fantasy story to live will not be disappointed. Kingdoms of Amalur sets the bar very high in both quality and quantity: huge lands with tons of distractions (from hidden nooks to intricate side quests), interesting character skill development options, colorful variety and careful backstory for both characters and environments (wonderfully realized lorestones!), loaded expansions (even more value and variety), and for the most part, the best voice acting I've ever witnessed (now with 100% more real feelings!). Trust me when I say that you cannot fairly judge the game based on its tutorial phase.  So much detail has gone into the storytelling aspects, that it approaches the lofty goal of suspending your disbelief, a power that only the best movies and novels have. The main hurdle to this is the often terrible dialog options for the main character, though they are not nearly as moronic as some games. Any good storyteller will agree that clever-yet-realistic dialog is key to believability (and fun), and by doing shortcuts (shoddy, creativity-devoid choices), the designers damage the immersion they work so hard to build in other areas. If you are picky as I am, you will find yourself not choosing certain options simply because they make your character sound like an imbecile. Roleplaying/design still is in its infancy, and I hope it will improve as writers realize the importance of dialog that works both ways.  Gameplay is not as smooth as it could be in some cases, but by the time you reach the astonishing city of Rathir, you should hardly notice it. I look forward to seeing how the genre can top this gem of a game.
2607	1	a	This game was a ton of fun despite the metascore. XD
1838	1	a	Strange game but a tad interesting, feels like it was not fully polished at times. It feels like 'Fable' but without changing your avator and no worrying about food so it seems a bit water down for a game. If you can get this cheap enough and want to mess around and do quests, it is good for a weekend time waster if you find yourself bored.
4141	1	a	Played it for a while and it worked perfectly fine and it was wvery entertaining. Good game. Worth the money.
601	1	a	this game suck ! such nostalgic iwanna back in time was this game release :(
3716	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
2743	1	a	This game ended slavery and cured aids..... 99/10 IGN
2575	1	a	ok, i can't beat around the bush here, this game is fun AND ONLY FUN with friends if you're a neckbeard loner lurker on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ then this game is the equivalent of having a dinosaur mug you for 15 dolans or 1 dolan if you got it during the sale, with friends you can make fun of how stupid and awful and dumb and fat and ugly and mean the game is together, unite people with the hatred that is this game. its fun with idiot pals 4/10
4892	0	a	What a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the third time.
1759	1	a	Had my doubts around this one even after looking at all those positive reviews. Finally took the plunge and glad I did. Still playing but loving it every bit!
6	0	a	Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.  Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.  Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).  Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.
5736	0	a	well this game should be free it cost 72 cents? really? make it free plz
3832	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber while flying with a jetpack....Need i say more?
5734	0	a	This game is just pure trash ...
4433	1	a	Spent $1 and a few minutes convincing 2 people to also spend $1. Got the three of us in a hummer and drove it into a Stegosaurus.  We exploded and died.  10/10
2518	1	a	I heard bad reviews coming into this game, but me and my friends ended up having an absolute blast playing it.
5886	1	a	I shotted the dinosaurs. I liked it.
5056	1	a	Very addicting!
2213	1	a	Ok, I need to write a review about this game. Are you a Disciples fan? Have you found yourself lost in the previous versions for hours on end? Then buy this game. Its better than all the other new 'R' incarnations I can't spell (Renaisance, Resurecction, whatev) since it takes the best from all of them and leaves the rest out. I read some of the negative reviews on here and like a fool I let it delay me from having the best Disciples experience since Sacred Lands Gold. This is polished, flowing, and builds on the previous games while adding modern mechanics and TONS of new artwork. People giving negative reviews can be listened to but their complaints are mostly about Disciples in general. Is it hard? Not nearly as hard as the first Disciples was. Is it tedious? Not nearly as much as Disciples 2 was. The magic is very specific, as in certain spells may sound all-powerful (and be bloody expensive) but there are many times they will be useless in battle. You have to be careful and cherish everything you find. There's lots... LOTS to explore and discover. It will take you a long time to develop powerful characters that can face anything (as in, multiple levels and countless hours), but yeah that's Disciples for you. The game is all about power-matching and countering, like any good magic fantasy, but Disciples was always famous for ramping things up and this version is no different. You will be forever out-matched, that's the point! Courage and charge on! Also, get good at healing and using powerups. Again, if you liked the original Sacred Lands with all its glitchy headaches and miserable gameplay (ie. always being outgunned), then you will like this game. Also, you can now carry forward two heroes with 9 items each to new campaign levels (!!!) Oh and when you resurrect a unit, they retain their experience from the previous battles and will level up upon returning to life if they can! Yay improvements! The art is fantasic, worth it just for that imo, and also if you're obsessive compulsive like me and love a good, complex, interesting and ultimately satisfying game (your souls are MINE you damn dirty elves!)  Hints if you've never played before or its been a while; - When upgrading your leader skills, you should ALWAYS been gunning for the extra leadership point. Adding another member to your team is the best possible thing you can do. - Set difficulty to easy and leave it there. - Legion was always unfairly powerful, its the same this time, so play as them I guess if you're having trouble. Invest in Fiends and have them do the dirty work. - Pretty everything you do should be geared toward upgrading two good, balanced teams. When a member dies you gotta go back and resurrect/heal, yes every time. Pump all experience into the same 8-10 units. Spend all extra cash on leveling up dudes in training camps. - The easy enemies in the beginning are very valuable. Save them as easy pickings for your newest recruits. - Turn the music off or you're going to drive yourself insane! (My last level was 140 turns!!)
5761	0	a	They steal assets and claim they never did it. Great.  Activision may be scums, they clearly got robbed anyway.
2969	1	a	Even though the meta score is 36 its still a great game.
1249	1	a	Bought this game on a Steam Sale for $4.99 and it was well worth it. I have seen the game before was a little hesitant to purchase it at full price. I would recommend this game highly though.  It a good action RPG with nice combos and a good skill trees. The feel of the world sort of reminds me of a single player world of warcraft. Lots of quests and places to explore.  As of now I have only played the Fighter but I plan of going back and playing a rogue and spellcaster type.
1638	1	a	this game shouldnt be overlooked i just started playing and already i love it.art style, combat. for 5.99 you cant beat this .give it a try youll love it. post more when im further in!!!
3463	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
2924	1	a	Maybe this is a buggy game... but for 0,99$ ist really good and can give you 100 hours of fun :D
339	1	a	Underrated gem of a game. Cool combat, pretty great class customization too.
1281	1	a	ONE SENTENCE REVIEW:  Kingdoms Of Amalur Reckoning may look generic on the outside but deeper in the game is a good/deep combat system with an interesting story with enough originality to keep you interested until the very end.  LONG REVIEW:  Looking at Kingdoms Of Amalur you'd be forgive for mistaking this as a single-player WoW game. As the biggest flaw in this game is sadly everything looks too generic. And this is a problem as the world being shown in the game is very interesting filled with good voice acting, and a main campaign thats original enough to keep you interested. Without spoiling any of the plot, the game revolves around you (named The Fateless One) who is revived from death by a machine created by the gnomes, and is said to be a detriment to the plan's of the Self Proclaimed Leader of the Winter Fae. Sounds cliche? Don't worry without spoiling the plot I can tell you that this game offers enough originality keeping it from lingering into cliche territory. The lands you explore in the game are actually a mixed bag, The first town you get into is fine and all but sadly feels small and unlike Skyrim or Oblivion, it isn't really that populated. The game does make up for me for having interesting Side Quests (ranging from find the traitor and the cliche, 'Go to Point A then Point B then Go back to me' quests).  So now you're probably asking is it better than Elder Scrolls? NO, Of course NOT! Does that mean you shouldn't buy it? NO, actually if there's ONE THING this game does better than the ES games is that it knows how to do combat well. The combat is primarily simple at first (using default controls) left click to attack, right for spells, 1234567890 to switch between spells. But then the combat goes deeper as the game progresses with the game encouraging you to mix between either Mage, Rogue, and Warrior and getting your own set of perks as you level these 3 Classes up. A thing I have to bring up would be the weapons. For the first time, from the moment you get out of the tutorial you're automatically presented with High end cool looking armour and weapons. No there's no tier 1 2 3, etc. And it gets better that when you craft something they allow you to name it. Sadly though unlike Elder Scrolls ( a game similar to this ) the game feels small. As there are no mounts in the game travelling from Point A to D felt more like a 5-15 minute chore not a badass journey.  So overall yes I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning for its combat, even if the game isnt as good as Elder Scrolls.
5339	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
5448	0	a	Itisbad but fun sometimes
3665	1	a	Punched a dinosaur. 30-10
568	1	a	 It's a damn shame 38 studios isn't a thing anymore
4509	1	a	STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10  The game has been updated to make it like 100 times better now.  My goodness, this game has evolved to something unbelievably good. I played it for a couple of hours three months back when I purchased the game. I didn't like it then. I uninstalled it and thought I would never play it again. Back then, the whole world looked blurred and murky. It deserved the $1.00 that it costs. But today, the evolution of this game is unbelievable. It is so so so beautiful. The gameplay is good. I just kept running randomly in my first game to appreciate the scenaries. Plus there is Steam Workshop supporty, I mean you really get a lot for the $1.00 you pay. My appeal to those that have not played this game in the past couple of months - visit the game once... you won't believe you had such a beautiful game lying in your library (probably hidden by now).  STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10
6251	1	a	Shoot â¥â¥â¥â¥ers in the face and they die, the filty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s had it coming anyways. They aren't suppose to still be alive and they killed my mechwarrior.
107	1	a	A serious RPG with an awesome fighting-system like Darksiders. Multi-Monitor-Support with Fixer. Love this game!
1607	1	a	There are already a dozen reviews that'll tell you how good this game is, how it was overlooked, a hidden gem, etc. So I'll skip that and just say that it's a great action RPG and well worth the price, especially if you can nab it during a sale.  However, the main reason I wanted to write this review was in regards to the DLC packs. They won't let me review the DLC on their own, so I'm tacking it on here. I've yet to play through the Teeth of Naros or Legend of Dead Kel packs, but from the looks of it, it seems they add some decent content. The Weapons and Armor bundle, however, is worth skipping. It's all level 1 gear, so you're going to replace it an hour after you get it. Ultimately it doesn't really serve any purpose other than giving you access to a full set of gear and a choice of weapons right away. Not really worth the cost if you ask me. So, I'd recommend skipping the Weapons and Armor bundle. Everything else though seems great.
2604	1	a	Incredibly fun game to play with friends!  A survival game that pits the future against the past.  I highly recommend all players pick up a copy of this game, especially for it's unbeatable price!
1609	1	a	Nice Rpg game.
4115	1	a	Suprisingly a very fun game. 7/10
5404	0	a	Rewrite time! Although this game is, most definately, fixed from its Dino Horde days, the game is quite poorly optimised. I bought the four pack, and gave one copy away so I could play it with a friend. He managed to play it. I was getting 15 FPS on the title screen, and I was worried about the gameplay, so I went and set the graphical settings as low as they get. Me and my friend create and join a game. 8-10 FPS. Although I am not playing on a gaming PC, this could run Farming Simulator 15 (Not in my library I have it on disc) at a stable 40 FPS on medium graphics, Arkham asylum at 50 FPS on medium, PS2 at 20 FPS on low, and PVZ Garden warfare (Yes, I use origin as well as steam, hate if you will) at 30 on medium.   EXPLAIN YOUR OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS PLEASE!  My friend, who does have a custom built gaming PC that can run PS2 on ultra high at 200 FPS, said that the game was easily broken (A ton of glitching dinosaurs) and the vehicles were too OP.   I'm sure it can be fun... but it does not work well. 2/10.
4793	1	a	what
5814	0	a	Metacritic is right at this point! Crappy game.
4814	1	a	its a fun little game if you can get some of your friends together, and with its cheap price its nearly impossible to say no... Now all i need to do is make some freinds...
1641	1	a	Fable and Skyrim had a long, romantic night together and cranked out KoA. Take Skyrim's massive map and varied locale's, stories, and peoples with Fables aesthetics and impressively smooth combat, then sprinkle in a little Dark Soul's difficulty and you get one slick game.  Pros: Its pretty. That's not saying much nowadays, but the world designer and art team need their props on this one. The combat is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ satisfying. The effects are excellent. Its easy to pick up, but its difficult enough so getting it just right is embarassingly satisfying.  The side missions are interesting enough. Like most RPGs, its mostly 'kill stuff' or 'kill stuff and retreive this', but that's not a bad thing. That all just gives the combat fun times more time for fun. HAVE NOT FOUND A 'GRIND' MISSION YET. Grinds are my biggest turnoff to MMORPGs and RPGs. Good riddance and hallelujah: they are nowhere to be found. The game is almost frighteningly long, or so it looks. I've only been in about 1/8 of the map, and I've played for 15 hours. With one character. I'm positive I'm going to be playing this again, so that means over 250 hours for me. Excellent. Cons: The voice acting is downright bizarre. The dwarves are British, the Elves are Scottish, and the people are... I don't even understand. Not exactly a bad thing, just weird. The Elves, or Fae (whatever), speak so slowly *I* get tired of it. This is coming from the man who was enraptured by Paarthunax's dialogue in Skyrim and the Oasis Tree in Fallout 3. The combat is a *little* blocky, like a speck of paint missing on the side of a yacht little. Nothing that would break the game. Lastly, the main story is not particularly bad, it just doesn't really grab me.   If you like Fable, but want about Buy it when it goes on sale. Seriously.
6150	1	a	Fan-fu**ing tastic game!
331	1	a	It's a shame the studio is now defunt as an avid fan of the Elder Scrolls Franchise I REALLY enjoyed this game. You can see the talents of the professional story writing all across the game. The story is what really does it for this title, not only the main story line but the faction story arcs as well, and even the one offs. I recommend this title for any RPG fan.
4805	0	a	I can't even joke about this. One of the worst games I've ever played.
5958	1	a	Ever have that urge to punch a raptor in the face while you wear a high tech suit? I thought that would be stupid. Then I got a knife and broke the game. Dont try to make this game deep, it doesnt work. Just fly around with a minigun wrecking anything you touch.
1803	1	a	wtf went wrong? this game is actually enjoyable. it has an mmorpg feel to it without the mmo to fit the story: that you are some one important. this could have been amazing if it was an mmo though. combat is smooth and fast paced, but simple enough to understand, similar to the witcher series. exploration feels like you are actually in a vast land. only question is what happend? this game definitely looks like it was meant for the mmorpg player.
1168	1	a	Borrows mechanics from all sorts of games: hack-n-slash, RPG, etc. Plays it very safe by following formulas closely without being a mere copy. Visuals aren't too spectacular and there are some bugs. Voice acting is very solid. Overall a good game, but it honestly doesn't do anything special to make it memorable. Which is a shame, because its concept of controlling one's own fate and affecting the fates of others sounds like it'd have amazing potential. If you're looking for a fun but extremely generic action game, Amalur is for you.
4367	1	a	Its good.
2190	1	a	One of the best games from a new studio I have ever played.
5985	1	a	This is a fun time killer! No plot, no mystery, and for shooter fans, no learning curve.  Loads fast and play is fun.  I call this a win.
1216	1	a	for something that has EA's stamp of doom... it was pretty good..
2790	1	a	If you are looking for some good clean fun with your friends ORION will give it to you. Nothing fancy, just A LOT of Dinos to be killed. Although a bit lacking in the graphics department and such. Still worth the $0.99 price tag.
1324	1	a	Great game!
1588	1	a	I really like this game... Drangon age meets Skyrim. I had no idea this ever came out. It is a huge open world and has some interesting stories. Tons of side quests that are not fetch 8 bear ears. 23 hours in and I have done NOTHING on the main quest line, just reputation group quests and side quests. Some small bugs, so save often... easy to do. There is an auto save, a quick save and a hard save. I have only had one bug where I pickpocketed daggers off a elf before I killed her and then it was stuck wanting me to take the daggers I aleady had. My bad for fiddling with the quest chain. But I had saved! Went back and did it in the right order and it was fine.
5462	0	a	1. Bought the game. 2. Played 5-10 min. 3. Refunded the game :)
2408	1	a	If you are using Steam Enhanced and see that this game has many dislikes, dont act on that. This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.   Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.
2936	1	a	This game.....I feel like im watching an albanian mock-up of Jurassic Park. It's absolutley wonderful 11/10
5151	1	a	Kill the dinos
6408	1	a	Don't let the mediocre graphics and dated Unreal Engine put you off of this game; with a few beers and some friends, this game is actually pretty fun! A cross between Turok and Halo, giggle your way through multiplayer survival mode as you lay waste to hordes of Raptors, Triceratops, T-Rexes and other baddies with an arsenal of machine gunes, pistols, flamethrowers, and tanks! Replayability may be lacking, so try and pick this one up for sub $2.00 prices.
1818	1	a	world of warcraft and fable had a baby and its kingdom of amalur
5204	1	a	Fun game, best one of the best Co-Op FPS game since Killing floor. Love the concept the maps are big and easy to navigate. Graphics are bad, some stuttering when switching guns and muddy texture. The reason I reccomend this game is it is CHEAP and easily playable with a group of friends. Would like to see the player count go up to 8 or 10 due to maps being very large.
4768	1	a	Such a fantastic game for such a low price! Really like the concept of the game and the gameplay is ridiculously fun :)) I could run around and stab dinosaurs in the face all day! :D
3831	1	a	very good game defiently worth your money
4942	1	a	I enjoyed this game for the first bit. It was better when there were more than 2 people online.
5883	0	a	As the game stands, it's not half bad for a $1 game, a lot better than most $1 games on the google play store. However this is not the google play store. In fact, i've seen better games on google play that are free. I honestly would recomend this is you're really bored and have $1 to blow on a semi-ok game. However the dev team, or whatever portion of them that wheren't fired so they wouldn't have to be paid for their work, have blatently stolen assets from other games. Honestly i hope the development team tries to drag out any possible future lawsuit between them and Activision so they go bankrupt from the legal fees and loose the hypotetical case
947	1	a	Even though the storyline is stale and repetitive, I found myself quickly addicted to this game. The combat is very engaging and fun. You feel powerfull without truly being so. The game has its hard moments, especially during bossfights. But the overal challenge is low and has little replay value.   Very fun to play for an hour or 50, but after that it'll grow old on you quickly. Main quest had its fun moments, but in the end, I rushed through it to just be done with the game.  Would recommend rpg fans to pick this up. Because I've had hours of fun playing this game which is extremely engaging and fun for quite a lot of hours.
2517	1	a	Definaltly one of the best, most funnest multiplayer games and fps games. Don't listen to metascore. I have no idea how they gave it a 36. It deserves like 106! Just get it. GET IT NOW. You need this in your life. You won't regret it.
2863	1	a	Teached me so much about history, 5 stars.
6145	0	a	this game's â¥â¥â¥â¥
81	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
3447	1	a	14 hours and still not bord so..... ya i have also put 270+ hour in terraria another game i highly recamend
174	1	a	Amazing Game that deserved much more.  The best combat systems in a game i've ever played, huge mmo type world in a singleplayer experience, very nice crafting and skills sets etc.  Well worth the purchase for hundreds of hours gameplay, which is rare in a single player experience these days.  Still better than Dragon Age Inquisition.
4904	1	a	Favorite game.  10/10  Maximum fun achieved with a group of friends.
896	0	a	This game is the final nail in the coffin for Electronic Arts games. After paying! for and downloading this game it is impossible to play without apparently altering my root menu. I uninstalled Origin after it became apparent that they would not let my use the Origin store to buy new games/dlc, but had hoped that EA games on Steam would be better. They are not. EA has shown repeatedly that they do not care about whether or not you can play their games, mearly that you give them money. They are single handedly killing the gaming industry and I, for one, would not be upset if the entire company went bankrupt, went to jail, or were to be killed horribly. In fact I would shake the hand of anyone that did. EA has stolen money from me for faulty products like the snake oil salesmen they are. I wash my hands of them.
2654	0	a	Turn away. Now.
5414	0	a	Pile of crap
6185	1	a	i love this game and the tank is so awesome
3563	1	a	I play this game when my thirst for life goes dangerously high
434	1	a	Fable + WoW + DMC = WIN
3397	1	a	10/10, bought the 4 pack last time it was on sale, gifted it to my friends, I now have no friends. Thanks Trek Industries!
3511	1	a	To be honest, i only played the free trial, (3-5 days) but i have to say, i am quite surprised how AWESOME this game was ;)
2918	1	a	This game is bad and terrible for a lot of reasons but it's somehow really fun to play.Am I going crazy?
2058	1	a	In some ways it reminds me of Fable. Part of that has to do with the music score. Or maybe I'm totally bats. Dunno. But whatever the case, I love this game. It's too underrated! The content is wonderful, the graphics are lovely, and it hasn't glitched on me yet!  I wasn't sure I'd like the class system, but actually it's quite interesting. At first I favored the rogue class, but then I started branching into all three disciplines. The hybrid build is ridiculously strong.  The crafting system gives you a leg-up in the gear department; but like with many things, that seems to pay off more at higher tiers. Still, you can make some pretty awesome stuff.  Play it! Chances are good that you won't regret it. :3
2989	1	a	Reason why the meta score is bad because the game is bad
2121	1	a	An easy and casual RPG with a good plot, a plot thats easy to follow and allows you to not play the game for a long time and then come back to easily pick up where yo left off. Good controller support which allows for a laid back gaming experience.
5849	0	a	DONT BUY THAT GAME  Why??? Because its the WORST game I ever played!!!  And, I must say, I never played a game and rated it bad!!!
6129	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN FOR 99 CENTS IT IS BAD IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE FAT CHODE
842	1	a	one of the best RPG games ive played :) prety good
5031	1	a	It a ok game i think it need to look more realistic and have more graphics good job on the way the game work tho keep it up the work .
4654	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
127	1	a	This is a GEM!!!!!! If you don't have this you are missing out. Good story, good gameplay, nice graphics. Too bad the whole bankruptcy thing with the dev's and the city killed Big Huge. Politics, ruining gaming for everyone LOL.  Lots of loot for the 'loot Loonies' out there, Lots of quests for the ' I must do everything OCD'ers Crafting and naming your own weapons and gear for the 'who needs a purple, I made this green thing-a-ma-jig' Evil choices and stealing for the 'I was never hugged enough as a child'  This is one of my all time fav's, 10/10 in my book.  Test of time nominated
5542	0	a	To be honest this game offers nothing new. You're better off playing halo, or team fortress.
2613	0	a	They say the Meta score is wrong I think their right I agree with them the metascore is wrong.  It should be lower
3953	0	a	boring
5367	0	a	After spending half an hour going through lobbies and never entering a single game, I uninstalled.
2829	1	a	Using the Unreal Engine, this game is a combination of Halo and Killing Floor, only more entertaining. With three classes to choose from and a extensive leveling up system, this game is one awesome indie title for the ages. Orion has difficult but pleasant battles with all kinds of dinosaurs, including T-Rexs. It is very satisfying to fight and kill these very large and prehistoric beasts. The fast-paced shooting works greatly and I most definitely recommend this title for everyone.
5687	1	a	its one grat game so GET PUMT!
1363	1	a	Very good game, it is often overlooked and that is the bisggest problem with it.
2286	0	a	Both the publisher: TREK Industries and the devs: Spiral Game Studios should be permanently removed from steam. Not only do they steal assets from other devs, they have a long track record of not following through on there development promises. They try and undermind the steam review system by removing valid reviews, they changed the name of a game they never finished so they could re-release it and make everyone pay for the same game twice while abandoning their first game. I for one will never buy a game from this publisher again, not for $10 and not for $0.10. Devs that only have one release game should not be allowed to rename that game so they can release it again to make more money and cheat their customers. If you like Dinosaurs consider buying Ark, survival of the fittest is free, seriously Ark made a second game and charged nothing at all. What is your excuse TREK Industries/Spiral Game Studios?
3733	1	a	Emotionally charged, rampant with memorable imagery. Orion: Dino Horde is a philosophical adventure that only one with a liberal amount of experimental sexuality will properly enjoy. The rush of adrenaline is unparallelled to any carny ride or action film in current existence. Fun with friends and loved ones, not really recommended for young children or pregnant women.  In short: more fun than it has any right to be
3067	1	a	Given the massive sale that is going on right now it warrants a look at only $1. The score given by Metacritic is wrong. The game is a polished FPS that is continually getting updated. Fast paced survival action is what gets it for me. Nothing seems to over powered or useless, and there are many different styles to choose from, and routs to take. I am looking forward to see where they take this game in the future and I am gad I can be along for the ride.
2697	1	a	Awesome Game, for the price you pay it is absolutely amazing
3535	1	a	Great game for the money, but don't expect much more than shooting dinos with various weapons.
6238	1	a	For what this game lacks in graphics and dept, it makes up for it in fun and playability. It plays alot like Halo 2
821	1	a	~THIS GAME KICKS â¥â¥â¥ AND IS ONE OF THE FIRST TRUE AWESOME RIDES 
5423	1	a	You can kill a T-Rex 10/10
4096	1	a	Open the door, get on the floor, errybody shoot them dinosaurs. Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but its essentially COD zombies plus Halo's firefight with just a dash of freaking dinosaurs. Have you ever played another game where you got to shoot freaking dinosaurs wit yo homies? NEIN.
1259	1	a	First thing to say. This game is loooong. I played for 36 hours till now and I only completed first part of the really massive map. I'm not sure if I finish this game because of that, but whatever. What I've played yet made me staisfied.   What really stands out here is dynamic and fluid comat system. There are lot of ways to wreak havoc among your enemies which makes this game really enjoyable and keeps you playing over and over.   The other nice touch is the possibility to completely rewrite your character on the fly. Bored with your rougish, sneaky archer? Spend little money and make yourself a tankish, badass hammer-wielding paladin. You can make all sorts of builds but the game focuses on versatility. You can play as standard RPG mono build but You can also excell with a character based on every class available.   The game engine is more than competent. I experienced no hang-ups, glitches, stuttering or framedrops which is really something that makes this game stand-out in comparsion to some recent big game releases.   Graphic style is inspired by the works of Todd McFarlane and if You have seen his comics and figures, You know what to expect. I really dig this set-up and it really helps to enjoy the fairy tale fantasy world that was created here.  What I don't like about this game is the writing. Dialogues are rather boring and I skip them most of the times. I'm not sure what is wrong about them but they seem pretty generic. All the lore that consists of books, lorestones and ballads are really forgetable. The main plot is pretty generic either. Your standard nameless-hero-saving-the-world kind of thing. That's probably the reason why this games didn't receive that much of attention since it release.  Anyway this game is more than decent and if you have abundance of time to waste, this game is more than capable to make you satisfied,
4287	1	a	Definetly a good co-op game for 99 cents
6318	0	a	One of the worst games on steam. Unplayable. If I could remove it from my game library permanently I would.
295	1	a	Probably one of the most overlooked games I've been surprised by. Immersion is completely to the 9's, the artwork amazing, and possibly the most convincing voice acting of any RPG I've played of late. It's only weakness that I have seen is it's combat so far. Simple and only challenging sometimes. This may be cured by the difficulty slider, but due to the big warning that is given for changing it, I have left it for this playthrough.
4552	1	a	You can go Chuck Norrirs on a T-rex from inside a combat walker a.k.a. mech. How awesome is that?
1201	1	a	For a game that nearly bankrupted the state that did not sign the constitution it was pretty good. 7/10
6396	1	a	Cheep and a quick game to play. Fun with friends.
6101	0	a	It's so glitchy and unoptimized. I wouldn't bother purchasing it.
1292	1	a	Very fun game! Wish they would make another!
1355	1	a	It may be a button-mashing bit of nonsense as far as combat goes, but the animation style for the combat is so fluid and lovely, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. I go back constantly when I want flowing combat no matter the style of fighting. This is a game I wish had been entirely completed and still had support, or at least the easy capability to mod because it has amazing potential (I believe the company that made it went bankrupt?). So, the voice acting is pretty lackluster, the plot has an interesting idea, but it's the movement that happens while fighting that makes me love this game. If you ever just have a ton of time to kill and want to fill it with interesting and beautiful combat, maybe have a good laugh or two at the voicelines on top of it, this is your game.
2218	1	a	Love this game! I held of on buying Disciples 3 due to hearing terible things about Renaissance. But after reading how Reincarnation fixes many of the issues i bought it in a heart beat on gamersgate 6 months ago.   The music and atmosphere is great and really makes the franchise stand out compared to other turnbased strategy games. Though the combat is more HOMM like instead of Disicples 1 and 2, its still a very fun game.   I really recommend this game to people who love turn based games, especially to Disiciples fans.
524	1	a	Amazing game, im not normally into deep rpgs but this game has me hooked!
4909	1	a	It was okay.  More towards a Halo Theme.
1873	1	a	A tremendously fun game. It's priority is enjoyment. Some games give you dead spots or areas to attempt to get through so you can get to the good part. This is not that kind of game. The combat is responsive and quick. The adventures are of every type but not repetitive. If it does become repetitive for you just switch your character to try a new build or new class. It is worth the money and would have been worth the release full price but I didn't discover it til the latest steam sale. It is the best of all the great RPGs I have played. Probably the best realization of the paper and pen originals.
5946	0	a	My computer couldn't handle this one sorry it seems cool tho
913	0	a	KoA world is so boring and uninteresting. So many side missions to do but you couldnt care less
4343	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
2669	1	a	Sometimes I want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ a dinosaur but be careful that you dont get dinosaur STD e.g dino genital herpes, Dino aids and dino gonorrhea and GTD but i love seeing that dinosaur riding my â¥â¥â¥â¥ and me cumming in its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but it is fun.
3966	1	a	Tons of fun if you are looking for a mindless shooter.
5399	0	a	probably the worst game i played for 10 minutes
1372	1	a	One of the best underrated and overlooked RPG Gems , if you liked elders scroll oblivion, this game is going to give lots of hours of joy.
6343	1	a	Purchased while on sale for $0.99, watching the game play videos I assumed this game would be a lag nightmare or somehow not live up to any decent expectations. It proved to be the best gaming purchase I have made in years. Even for 20x what I paid this game would be worth it, as the key to any good game it is very fun!
2900	1	a	Good buy, a little expensive though
4692	1	a	OMG! BEST! GAME! EVER! totaly worth a 10/10
972	1	a	I'm level 4 and more testing is needed, but it's fun so far
780	0	a	It starts good but after 20 minutes of gameplay, apart from the bland quests, found a box with all powerfull weapons and with that all game completely become so easy to be uninstalled.  'Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do'  I completely agree!
61	1	a	At first sight a very simple game , but it grows in complexity as you keep playing. Besides it's a nice way to learn how to play poker in an 'RPGistic' way through a nice storyline, I totally recommend it.
3184	1	a	10/10 I cried for three whole weeks after I bought the game. This game is litterally my life, shrek is no longer my life this game has become my love as well, sorry shrek. This game has to be the best game ever with the dino blast and the dino chopper all going like 'pew pew pew pew' gotcha! take that you dinosaur scumbags! MURICA NEEDS ITS OIL SOME HOW â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ES. Must say I played for 30hours straight using a bucket to â¥â¥â¥â¥ in and drinking my own â¥â¥â¥â¥ to survive, was worth it just to finally kill some god damn dinosaur looking â¥â¥â¥ mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ers. I lied 20/10 would reccomended beat the hell out of that there call of â¥â¥â¥â¥o 3
3647	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends
656	1	a	I fell in love with this game at first sight, I saw that it would be like one of the older RPGs, except it had its own ring to it- it isn't some sort of hack and slash or ping into random places sort of game, its a game that once your in, your mind is the key to your role, specifically, you have the power to chose exactly how you're going to play you're part of the game, whether it be a classic staff &amp; spell, sword &amp; shield, or dagger &amp; bow, the game does not force your class on you, instead, you may be a hammer wielding thief or a chakram throwing warlord. The leveling tree in this game is spectacular, you level up, choose what attribute you want to level up, and then ability points that allow you way to carnage wreaking moves that can turn the tide of war. Another thing to this game is it's graphics, although they may not seem the 'best', I can assure you they're beautiful in their own fun way, it makes me think of the Fable series' artwork, where everything would fall into place perfectly with all the wonderful scenery within the map. I would love to name more, but there are a lot of things-small things- that I like about this game, and eventually I'd ramble on like I am now, so without further procrastination, I will end this review now...wait no! ..... yea now...
6364	1	a	One of the few examples of Early Access done right I'm still confused as to how such a total piece of garbage became so great 
5476	1	a	I just impulse bought two copies of this game: one for me and one for a friend. This game is....   INCREDIBLE!!!!!! I love this game, it's awesome! You can punch dinosaurs in the f**king face! I bought a bow, the jetpack augment, and I stood on a rock popping raptor heads like Macklemore pops tags. After that I got a walking turret and killed 10 raptors with one rocket. This game is so damn fun, I'd have paid $5 if I knew this game was so good (but I don't have that much so don't make me)  I just wish I could get a cape. I love capes. By the way, the only paid stuff (real money shizz) is vanity items from what I can tell. This game is definitely worth your moneys.
847	1	a	A non-biased quick look @ the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQfMAdnF9Q4   I've spent many hours playing this game, decided to get the Steam version. The minds of New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore, Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston have combined to create Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, a new role-playing game set in a world worth saving. Build the character you've always wanted and continuously evolve it to your style of play with the revolutionary Destiny system. Choose your path and battle through a master-crafted universe featuring some of the most intense, responsive, and customizable RPG combat ever. - Highly Recommended!
861	0	a	Game breaking bug in the main quest. Awesome. Wow.
5353	0	a	Well, the system requirments are way off. I have a AMD Phenom 2 970 Quard @ 2.2GHZ 4 GB DDR3 and an ATI HD 4250 with 256 MB. When I checked the specs on this, my system should have been able to play this. All settings to low ... still lags very badley.
1824	1	a	I love every minute of this game! I have beaten it about five times now. It's a very long game, especially with the DLC. 60+ hours. KOA has most beautiful graphics of any game I have ever played. Perfect combat. I love being able to create my own weapons and design them to my liking. My favorite weapon is the Chakram. The Balor in Mel Senshir is the best BOSS battle I have ever played, and that's in the middle of the game!  If you're looking for a serious (and time consuming) RPG, I definitely recommend Kingdoms of Amalur! 
2090	1	a	Ok, I have played this on Xbox, Playstation and PC, and they are all marvelously fun. Sadly the PC version doesn't like the new Xbox One controllers (something about the software that it works with) but it still works great with keyboard and mouse. This feat alone I give a nod of approval towards.  It is not the worlds greatest game, but if you're looking for a fun little fantasy game then give it a bash. If you're like me and just curious, you might even find you like it.
4940	1	a	Very nice game for only 0.49 euro :D
3275	1	a	The game still needs work... like, a lot of work, but it's surprisingly fun, especially to play with friends!  Don't believe the Metacritic score. Buy a couple copies for you and your friends, and you're guaranteed some good times.  Just watch out for those baby dinosaurs. They'll bite your kneecaps off.
5855	0	a	What can I say... I couldn't pass on a game for 99 cents with screen shots like that!!! But alas, it was only false and high hopes. Personally, I really preffer to try to avoid knocking someones hard work (as I assume someone did at one point put some sort of effort into this at some point) and I wish I could think of something positive about this game but I just can't. Really, it is that bad, and the only thing that this game has working for it is the price on sale. Oh... that's it!!! That something positive I was looking for!!! You should buy it for the price! Just because you have 99 cents laying around that should be in some starving developers pocket! Or you could wait til its regular price and help that starving developer with their alimony payments too!  But seriously, I feel like I've waisted too much of my time (and life) on this game as it is. Which is where I'm coming from when I say that you'll have to trust me on this and donate that 99 cents to help all the neglected and abused dinosaurs of the world. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you too can help save a helpless dinosaur.  Oh, I just though of another positive... Hats! Yes, the game has hats! And best of all you can wear them... Virtually! Yes! In the game! ... Okay yes, hats are not that exciting but it might be you like things on your head! So lets summerize this...  You should buy this game if you:  -Are a Philanthropist for:  -Dinosaurs  -Game Developers or  -Are balding or is bald   -Likes things on you're head  -Likes virtual things on your virtual head more  -Don't need 99 cents or   -Missed the sale and  -Don't need $14.99
1814	1	a	This game is simple, beautiful and so much fun! I recommend it to anyone looking to play a grind away RPG!
2217	1	a	I don't often write reviews, but many of the amateur articles I've read about the Reincarnation edition of Disciples III have been deplorable and unfair. I am 35 and a lifelong PC gamer. I love strat games. Chess is my #1 game in general and there are few other strategy games I appreciate.  If you know and remember Master of Monsters (Sega Genesis), I say this edition of D3:R is worth your cashola. There are no bugs I've seen (Win 7, nice compy, blah blah). In fact, it's one of the more solid games I've played. I like that I can Alt-Tab out and do other things; the sound stops, the game stays static and contained, totally dependable. I have often kept my Disciples campaign running for days, just clicking into the window to make a few moves and then going about my business, not unlike how I play chess.  There are threads and threads of bad press about this game in its past forms. I tell you, this game is gold -- extremely reasonably priced -- and a great work of art the series of which has culminated in something I am absolutely enjoying. Feel comfortable sending me a question if you like. I'd be happy to defend this software in my private time.
1555	1	a	This game is a great, no further words.
3683	0	a	A shoddily made wave defense game.
2032	1	a	Fun, decent game, can play for quite a bit of time for entertainment.
5699	0	a	this game gave me both testicular and breast cancer.
1665	1	a	Good looking art style, excellent feel, and a lot of choices in combat. I am definitely happy with this purchase.
5523	1	a	1) Load Jurrasic Park theme 2) Play with a bunch of friends 3) ??? 4) Profit  10/10 would medic gun a T-Rex â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
380	1	a	Great for all ages!! Love this game and highly suggest it. The enemies are fairly simple and not too scary for little ones to fight! Great story line, and lots to do!!!
1957	1	a	Plenty of things to do, and a very polished game, I haven't experienced a single bug
2928	1	a	1 dollar, come on, thats chump change. Just get the game. Even if you're not going to play it just get it.
3006	1	a	Can kill T-Rex with mech.  10/10 Game of the Year  On a more serious note:  This game is incredibly underrated. I've played several hours of the survival mode alone, and it has been some of the most fun I've ever had in video games. The gun's models are well done, but are few in number. The game runs like butter and has crashed only once after a couple hours of gameplay. The dinosaurs models and animations aren't cringe-worthy. The combat is fluid, but some of the mechanics are questionable (Specifically the fight-to-survive mechanic). The graphics aren't anything revolutionary, but don't take away from the experience. The rounds in survival do, however, need a ready-up function to bypass the minute wait time in between waves.  I payed $0.99 for this game and had a better experience with it than I have with most AAA shooters selling for 60 dollars.  8/10, highly recommend.
3605	1	a	its a kick in the â¥â¥â¥ cream and a Super Fat Dirty â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the face
4388	0	a	Literally an atrocity.
3628	1	a	awsome game
5529	0	a	This is not worth the 50 cents i paid for it.
3886	1	a	Let me start by saying when I first played Orion: Prelude (or whatever they were calling it) a year or so ago it was a terrible terrible game, and I really did not like it at all. Since then however Orion: Prelude has changed significantly with the updates it has gotten in the year or two since I first played it. It is at a state now were I can say that its no longer a 'bad game' per se just not one that I enjoy. By all means Orion: Prelude or whatever its called at the time you are reading this has gone from being a terrible empty mess to being a decent although somewhat mediocre Dino survival game. I still would not buy it myself, but for the price currently 0.99 cents I have got to say if you like the idea of a Dino survival game, this is worth looking into.    I myself still prefer Primal Carnage over Orion: prelude, and Dino D-Day is also another game I like significantly more than the Orion game. I even hear that game Stomping Land is pretty good, though I have yet to try that myself. All I have got to say in the end though is that you may like Orion: Prelude, it has come a long way since its (imo terrible) launch. Orion; Prelude may not be as good as the other games listed above (Primal Carnage, Dino D-Day, Stomping Land) but it is the cheapest, and that counts for something I guess. Orion: Prelude goes on sale all the time, so If you are interested I would get it during its next sale.
1209	1	a	Really loved the action on this RPG. Story gets you involved. Controls work well. A few glitches but easily 8 out of 10. Get it on sale and love it
723	1	a	may not find a game like it.wished there was a sequal..
3783	1	a	Best game in the village
545	1	a	This game is very under appreciated. I love this game, it's absolutely fantastic and any RPGer should get it. The main questline and the faction quests are the best parts and most interesting things about this game, and I especially love how completing some of the faction questlines will bring up interesting dialogue.  The thing I really love about this game is the fact that it's an adventure RPG with action oriented combat. That was the big reason for me buying this, and although the combat is sometimes finicky, I was not disappointed. A gem amongst so much RPG trash.
1108	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a Good Rpg Game and i like it so try it out rpg Gamers ^^
4644	0	a	Worse the 'Day One: Garry's Incident'. Although the price it one dollar, dont buy it.
5711	1	a	very good _ game 14.99$ :(
3003	1	a	Ok, so the graphics aren't jaw-dropping and there are so many bugs with the animations, gameplay and pretty much everything else...but this game is awesome. Because it is just plain fun - there is no mind-boggling depth to it, it's not all srs bznz and you can genuinely have a laugh and just enjoy the ride. Even if you're a filthy casual, like me, you can jump right in with those who are a much higher level and not feel out of your depth or unable to get stuck into killing compys, taunting T-Rexes (or should that be rexi?) and punching pterodactyls in the face.  Because if this were real life, you would TOTALLY punch a pterodactyl in the face. Admit it.
100	1	a	Not a very popular game but I like it very much. One of the best RPG's I have ever played. It deserved to but a greater sucess than it was. Seems it was knocked off the radar with the release of Skyrim, but in many ways I find it a better game to sink time into. Combat is great fun in this game. The world is vast, beatiful and creative with lots of side quests to keep you exploring. The story line is a bit meh and could have been better. I've put all my skill points into Sorcery which is awesome to play, and can't wait to try the others. I recomend Blacksmithing, Sagecraft, a little stealth (unless you are a Rogue, then lot's), detect hidden and persuasion. Gold is very easy to acculate in the game. Two thumbs for Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning.
3583	1	a	i recommend this gamne especially at co op
1334	1	a	Awsome game. Enjoyed it very much :)
1603	1	a	this game is a must for any RPG fan! one of the best games ive played in a long time!
2177	1	a	Awesome game - if you like open ended RPGs like Oblivion, and visceral combat like God of War, you'll love this game!
1528	1	a	I PUKED RAINBOWS!!!! ITS BEAUTIFUL!!!! ITS FUN!!!! ITS GOD OF WAR LIKE!!!! NARWHAL BACONS!!!! OH YEAH!!! C-COMBO BREAKERR!!!!
353	1	a	Someone said this game is like a single player MMO where you only do quests. Very good comparison. Fun for a little while, but not enough to hold my interest. Didn't finish. Combat system is rather simple, but lots of variety. Nice combat graphics, but there seems to be an emphasis on appearance over actual challenge.
256	1	a	It's a shame they wont get to turn this game into a MMO like they wanted. KOA is a great game, love the action and the easy to use controls. Discounted or not its a must buy for anyone that's into Action RPG.
2599	1	a	This Is Freaking Awsome 
294	1	a	Short: The game is amazing, yet so underrated and overlooked. It's got good character customization and creation, it has a plethora of awesome weapons and delivers a funny yet dramatic storyline.  * Pros - Open world (HUGE) - Lots of weapons and other equipment - Three 'classes' to choose from, warrior (Might), rogue (Finesse) and mage (Sorcery) with lots of skills each, which can be mixed! (I.e. Might/Finesse or Finesse/Sorcery or a bit of everything). - The player is fateless, so you can choose different fate-cards that have different effects, choices in dialogue also make differences. - Funny dialogue, you can decide what to say and get a funny response if it's absurd. - Lots to explore, many dungeons, areas and quests! - Awesome combos and finishing moves  * Cons - Lacks some sounds, even though your player says something, there's no sound for the dialogue. (Though the npc's are voiced) - There aren't as many monsters as weapons, enough, but there could be more. (Some vanilla are even used in the dlc content) - There's no mounts, so running everywhere is a pain sometimes. (There is fast-travel though)
3546	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing best, Shooting dinosaurs whiel flying around. 50 cents? are you kidding me this is the deal of the century.
4705	0	a	This Game is Horrible
4411	0	a	The game has horrible optimization and it crashes all the time.
4558	1	a	You get to be a dino which is f*cking awesome
6025	1	a	Best game ever, the Birdemic of video games
4456	0	a	Do not buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
3807	1	a	funny game to play with friends
2864	1	a	Is the best game
4250	1	a	I have had so much fun with this game. I bought it as a joke to my friends and me to laugh off but its kinda hard when its acutally a good game :I  Its really entertaining, and seriously, where would you go if you wanted to shoot a dinosaur in the face with a shotgun while flying over it with your jetpack?!  Can only recommend this game.
2107	1	a	Fun rpg that has a lot of content. Worth a buy for sure.
3906	0	a	Unfortunately I was not able to play this game; when it would get to class selection, it would lock up. I couldn't even ALT-TAB out of it, as it was holding the rest of the computer hostage.  It isn't as though I don't have a beefy machine though:  Intel Core i3 CPU with 4 processors nVidia GeForce GTX560 OC video card 8 GB of RAM (unfortunately, 32 bit Windows 7, so 3.45 GB available)  I may try this again later, but not interested right now.
3937	0	a	this game is horendus â¥â¥â¥â¥. do not EVER buy it. everything is done wrong, its laggy, clitchy and even that the idea sounds cool, it is done very poorly.
3148	1	a	Theres...Dinosaurs
1361	1	a	This review is certainly a review I should have wirtten long ago, but here we are now.  This game is brilliant, and I loved every second of this expansive game. The design of this game (Which comes from the narritive mind of R.A Salvatore, and Oblivion's director) is an overarching theme that all life is dictated by a thread of fate when they are first created or born; and the protagonist cheating fate and forging a fate of his own that affects the fate of all. The concept is one I've really not seen before in a video game narritive, and it definitely soothes my ache for strong philosophy and writing in video games. The story seems to lack a bit though.. You do meet a few characters througout the story, but they feel more like pieces on a Chess board than breathing individual (Besides one you meet towards the end of the game's second act), but I enjoyed their presences when they were around.  The art is great, I love all of it. It evokes many different vibes, and the environments are lovingly crafted, despite the way each area on the map is segmented out, giving a weird map design in an otherwise fluid game world. Klurikon will forever stand in my brain as a testiment to how much focus a narritive design can have on the impact to the world around the player, while still delivering tight gameplay and fantastic visuals.  The gameplay of Amalur is very reminiscent of the Fable series, giving open variety to the player, and rewarding the player for switching up their moveset and exploring the way to game works. In combat, the player may have two weapons equipped at a time, free to select either with the press of a button; while magic spells are always available to use, and can be selected via the keyboard, while the UI shows any macro'd spells. Fighting enemies offers the players points towards their fate bar, which builds up and allows the player to trance into a state where they can unleash their true awesome power and deliver satisfying finishers to enemies for extra exp, which is a fun treat to watch and revieve; performing well in fights (eg. not taking damage, varying up attack combos) will earn the player more points for the bar.  The DLC is a whole review in itself, as it offers dozens of hours of fresh, new content, so I'll leave this review concise enough. Amalur is a grandly underrated game (I presume due to lack of marketing during its release) and deserves full attention of the gaming audience, please give it a chance to play, you won't be let down-- Look at my face, would I lie?
5981	1	a	For its price, it's absolutely a crime not to purcahse it
4111	1	a	There's just so MUCH to this game! Granted, it is all about killing dinosaurs, so if that's not your thing, this game will not be for you. BUT, if you DO like to kill hordes of dinos... You've found a game that I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy.   This is a great game to play with a group, though. Solo, you might find it slightly daunting. But come on, who's really going to take on a horde of dinos on their own? That's what I thought.
3315	1	a	Flew some weird airplane into a T-Rex. Best $0.74 I've ever spent.
2485	1	a	This is the most 99 cent game I've ever played
1415	1	a	Great RPG game for this small studio. Too bad they went out of business. Good quality game. Slightly easy but a lot of fun and definately worth playing. Originally got it on my 360 but the sale here made it worth getting on my PC too. Good story, Decent combat. Chakras are fun.  I do wish they had full controller support but it is definately doable.
28	0	a	The core gameplay mechanic is original and fun, but I couldn't play enough of it for that to matter. For many people, the game crashes after reaching the first village. Just freezes and can't be unfrozen. Some people say they fix it by disabling 'Raptr,' but I don't even know what that is, and it doesn't appear to be even installed on my computer. If I ever manage to solve this problem, I can give a better review, but for now, I have to say that a game with such a massive bug isn't worth gambling on. Furthermore, there is a lot of dialogue and 'story,' but all of it is just horribly written. I mean really, really painful to read, and you have to go through it all. And if there is dialogue at the start of a fight (usually seems to be) and you die during that fight you have to click through it all again. I feel the game would be better if they either hired a proper writer for the story, or just gave it a bare bones plot and let the player enjoy the actual battles more, without having to suffer through the dialogues. Maybe add a 'skip' button.  Again, I've only played the tutorial, because I can't get it to work past that. It's possible it gets better, though writing that bad in a game doesn't tend to improve. I suppose my real hope would be that there would simply be less of it. If I ever get the game working, I will give it more of a chance, because the combat is quite interesting, and then I will update my review with a more informed experience.
2454	1	a	If you have Â£0.99 its a must buy! Better yet buy 4 copies for Â£2.99 then you can give them too your friends when they ask why you don't come outside anymore... I see dead dino's... and I love it.
3932	0	a	Game described in 2 words: Connection lost...

4629	1	a	Best 69 cent spent in my life.  Online FPS with many guns, upgrades, superpowers, vehicles and DINOSAURS!! The game is easy to get into, has nice graphics, is well optimized and most importantly, it is damn FUN!  9/10
2115	1	a	single player MMO. It's hard to say whether this game is worth playing or not. It's literally like playing world of warcraft solo. So you have the same grind, the same â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fetch quests, and the same art style. Then again there are some nice touches like a better-than-average story, and a crime and punishment system akin to skryim which lets you be a jerk, if you so choose. A decent way to sink some time, but don't expect much.
5268	0	a	boring chaos
2795	1	a	Step 1: Happily play with friend for 20 minutes Step 2: 420.69 mph in a speedy gonzalez car.  Step 3: Get stuck in rock Step 4: 5 mins later figure out suicide command Step 5: Continue to play happily  10/10 ign would buy again.
6340	1	a	Fun game to play with friends :)
230	1	a	Fantastic game. Not as polished as some other RPG's out there, but I believe this is due to lack of funding. If you enjoy RPG's at all, I highly recommend this one. Tons of content. I pretty much skipped 90% of the side/faction quests and proceeded along the main storyline, took ~40hr to complete. There are supposedly an additional 400 or so side/faction quests in the game. The map is huge as well. Larger than some MMO maps. The storyline is decent. The fighting mechanics are a blast. Protip: do NOT start pure sorcery. It gets boring quick. My advice is to start with might or finesse and then play around with sorcery later on if it strikes your fancy. You can respec on a whim.
5950	0	a	just trust me and stay away from this...

5003	1	a	Great game Transformation!
269	1	a	I have so much to say about Kingdoms! This is one of my all time favorite RPG games. The battles can be a bit repetative and you can count on your enemy throwing the same fight combo at you time and time again (which makes it pretty easy to get those parry achievements) The story line is huge! and there is so much to do in this game which brings me to my first complaint... the level cap :( You can reach the level cap by just doing the main factions. The first time i beat the main story line i was a little bummed to learn of the level cap. I mean who doesnt like to watch their XP sky rocket when you finally beat that main pain in the a** boss?! However, i just started a new game, leveled up the weapons i knew i loved and kept on going.  Sometimes the camera view got a bit wonky, its hard to fight when the camera decides to view only the ground lol but it is possible. Just a slight annoyance.   The open world is also huge! There are tons of side quests to keep you busy for quite awhile. I love the Fast Travel option, which lets be honest, who doesnt just love spending half the game walking from end of the map to other?! (insert sarcastic gaze) Fast Travel really really helps with a map that is this big.  I downloaded The Teeth of Narcos DLC after i beat the game the first time. It's okay.... The underground sewer is a bit of a maze and isnt as 'open' as the main game map, but it's still pretty fun. Again, it brings up the level cap that sucks....  The game says Partial Controller Support but after 200 somthing hours i would have to say that its pretty much full controller. Has anyone heard of a Kingdoms 2?
675	1	a	If you try and play this after playing the Witcher 3, you're gonna have a bad time...
3538	1	a	By buying this game you spend money unnecessarily for Neak crap.  I would recommend this game to people who have a lot of friends, so that they can play (quite good) multiplayer, which  with a bunch of friends definitely enjoy.   Gameplay: 8/10  Graphic design 7/10   The price is a little overshoot.  servers are half-empty.  Even some bug is avoided.
5453	0	a	A steaming, gigantic, dynosaur TURD!  Want to kill hordes of brutal enemies? Play killing floor... You love dynos? Go to a museum or watch discovery channel...   Please, for your own sake, STAY WELL CLEAR FROM THIS GARGANTUAN PILE OF DYNO CRAP!!!
6020	1	a	A little like Killing Floor from when I played before Prelude came out. It's pretty teamwork based with the dinos being creatively made and separately challenging. Smooth graphics and large marketplace for in-game upgrades and perks.
7	1	a	My only wish is that Mystic comes out with a sequel...and soon. I loved this game even though there was a lot of negative reviews...which only goes to prove that everyone has different tastes in games. I played this game several times and loved it each time for something new that I would discover.
1856	1	a	Love fantasy mmos but hate playing them with other people...well this is the game for you then hours of great gameplay and go here then go over there quests and yet somehow it never seems to get old . 
4071	0	a	Don't
3685	0	a	Terrible, 'nuff said
5451	0	a	Itisbad but fun sometimes
232	1	a	Game feels like a MMORPG but single player. The gameplay is nice, never get tired of it. Graphic isn't the best but understandable, however the landscape are something you can really look at and be like wow. But as we all know the feel of a MMORPG game with 'Kill and Collect X items' quest gets boring over time when it's repetitive. The main storyline is short, but there are tons of side/faction quest that you can do which will add more hours of gameplay.  Overall Rating: 8/10 Hit: Gameplay Miss: Quest (too repetitive)
3461	1	a	This game is actually really good...
4409	0	a	I might change my opinion, but for now, my review is short and to the point - like my play expirence. It SEEMS like a really good game, and soloing with bots it feels like it would be fun with a group, but joining a server is impossible because of the numberous issues that come up.  Yes, yes - I know the forums list solutions, but there are a zillion to try and they are insanely involved - more so than one should expect to go through for any 'finished' game. This feels like a buggy alpha, not a full release.
935	1	a	Yes, there's a lot of (good) content to this game, especially with the dlc's. However, much of this content becomes repetitive because you will mostly be facing the same enemies over and over, with minor cosmetic differences. The fact that the difficulty level seems way too low, will not contribute to your excitement. Setting it to hard for a normal experience will help, but when your enemies are numerous enough, expect perma-interruption battles that leave you falling and getting up until you run out of health potions. At which point you won't get up anymore.  There's lots of running involved in this game, as you would expect from a semi-open world rpg. It's not so bad, though, due to the numerous quick travel options. Except, you can't quick travel in dungeons, not even after clearing it completely. The creators did their best to design a lot of the dungeons in such a way that you end up at the starting point, but you will often curse them for not applying that principle to the one you're in at that moment.  The 'rare and rarer' (a.k.a. 'unique') weapons are a joke. Put some points in gem crafting and you will be able to put actual useful stats on your weapons and armor. Sadly, this means missing out on some of the better cosmetic aspects of the game. I'm assuming, based on other reviews, that the same goes for armor crafting. Do not bother to skill the lock picking and disenchanting skill, as they will, at most, let you avoid minor incomforts (i.e. running to a healer or buying more lock picks).  Inventory management will, of course, be slightly tedious and annoying. But I've seen a lot worse. You will get access to a stash somewhere along the way.  Voice acting is decent, although repetitive as well. The storyline doesn't take much imagination to come up with, but now and then there's a gem in there (probably inspired by some folklore). Just be prepared for a LOT of storytelling. Skip at leisure. After a while, anyone will.  The camera is horrible and way too close to your character. The HUD is consequently way too large. I'm guessing this is because this game isn't an original pc game. This will be a major annoyance, until you get used to it (again). Just don't expect to be able to aim well, the auto-targeting system will not leave a lot of room for free choice. Also, melee attacks, especially, have elaborate animations and will leave you cursing your character for its lack of agility. Getting more agility will not change this. Luckily, the AI isn't clever enough to take full advantage of the consequent holes in your defense.  The skill trees are nice and contain decent variation, allowing you to effectively pursue any possible play style. I would advise you to experiment. There is even room for mixed classes, based on how you divide your skill points, which is a big plus in my opinion. This means there's an actual role-playing aspect to the skill tree. Skill trees are often mistakenly seen as something that makes a g an rpg.  All in all this game is fun, until you get tired of fighting the same battles. Although I usually want to do every possible mission, I would advise against taking too many side quests, especially when they seem to not add much to the story or your gear. Don't expect good graphics, even though this game seemingly isn't that old. Buy it on sale (for 5 euros) and you'll have a good deal.
2368	1	a	Lol why did I buy this
4174	1	a	AWESOME but slow load speed and shooting reaction 
2843	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs. Interesting environments. Unique weapons.  All this can be yours for just one easy payment of $0.99.
4821	1	a	This game deserves all the money and high ratings it can get.
1912	1	a	amazing game. you get far more in this game than other games in the same price range. I highly reccommend rpg fans to take this game and it's DLC for a spin. not only can you choose from four races for your hero to be, you can also choose gender and even do some pretty in-depth customization. and for those who enjoy crafting their own stuff, you are going to drool over how indepth the crafting system is. Now why are you still reading this and not playing the game?
779	0	a	It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.
1744	1	a	Awesome Game, great single player RPG, shame the company went broke but still well worth your time
1709	1	a	Huge game with hundreds of quests. I did every quest in every town and I was totally overleveled by the time I was 50% of the way through. Played it right when it came out and thought then it had good graphics and a great story. That said, I completed it and have never picked it up again, so replayability was not there for me (also due to the huge size of the game -- I really just needed a break when I finished). I had a ton of fun with this game and would recommend to anyone looking for a big, story-driven RPG. However, Morrowind (or Fallout 3, etc.) it's not. Feels lighthearted and graphics are bright and a bit toony. If you are on the fence, try the demo as it's pretty representative of the combat and story you'll get in the full game.
4843	1	a	GRATE GAEM I PLAI EVRI DAY AND I CREI EVRI TEIM. I qUIT MAH JOB TO PLAY THIS GMAE....SHREK IS LOUVE SHREK IS LIEFE...
2732	1	a	Dino Horde. I really think this game is great. Fast paced, balanced achivement/ credit earning (changes based on difficulty setting) Really helps to play as a team, and feel free to guide new players in to helping the team's overall progress.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. Very replayable in the current release.  I would value this game around 15 - 20 USD all day long.   I am having trouble browsing/finding game matches/ servers. Usually about 10-15 come up, but I have trouble connecting to most of them. Often time I find myself in a Lobby, and It appears the host is AFK. Would also love to see projectile/paths added. Other than that is very fun. Give it a try!!
1734	1	a	cracking game! Love it 
5210	1	a	This game lacks polish, support and a good PvP multiplayer. However, i think it has very strong coop/singleplayer gamemodes, most notably Survival and Conquest. These two modes (even with all the mentioned issues) are entertaining enough to keep me playing. There are vehicles, epic guns and battles on big maps with changing weather and time of day. The difficulty can vary from really easy to extremely hard, so there will always be a challenge. The game has so much potential, yet it is wasted by the developers, but I still like it.  The game provides a great PvE experience. I recommend the game for people who prefer PvE and don't mind minor bugs. 8/10
727	1	a	If you lke RPG then I recommend this when it on sale.
1306	1	a	8/10. You'll need to stick with the game for a bit as I didn't find any of the initial story line quests all that interesting. That being said there are a few fairly interesting side quests and advancing your character and combat in general can be fun. Blacksmithing is definitely OP if you max it out as soon as possible though. Im probably 60% through the main story (mins DLC which I have) and my crafted gear is far superior to anything im finding. I'd definitely recommend the game though. I say 8/10 because I think the game was designed around multiplayer and that isnt present and also because there are a lot of stereotypical fantasy genre things in the game like annoying british voice acting etc.
4373	0	a	This game needs to make it's mind up weather it's a free 2 play, or a payed game.
1743	1	a	this game is awesome, no clue why it sold so bad,  IMO its better than skyrim (which sold great) honestly, I feel like the devs of this game gave it their all and got nothing in return... do your part and buy this game and play it for atleast as long as i have (Right now im at abuot 20 hours with no sign of slowing down)
792	1	a	This game is actually freakin' fun. Ok, gear grinding and quests are standard fare but sometimes you want to go dungeon diving and swap out your gear some. This is definitely one of those games that lets you do that. The controls are tight and exactly what every MMO and action RPG ought to be: Dodging, blocking, spell tossing, reasonable mana regen, cooldowns, etc. The visuals are great and the way the camera handles makes you believe you're in control, side saddle to the action. Quest givers talk to you and there's an endless amount of stuff to do and ways to wrap up each adventure along the way. If you're just looking to have a good time or you really want a game that reminds you of Everquest, Lineage or World of Warcraft, this is the way to go. Ding it on one point: Should have been a way to host a server so you could play with friends. Maybe this studio will do an MMO at some point. Would definitely be interested in that. Lots of good ideas executed well. 9/10 from me. -Knight
1646	1	a	If you don't have this game yet...it's on sale...get it! It's hours of fun in a beautiful world.
5420	0	a	Well... it's not bad... but... it's not good as well
4316	1	a	This is the greatest game ever made.
701	1	a	Fantastic game. Sad that it will never get a sequel. The game studio was really talented, it just got ruined by poor marketing from EA Games.
2008	1	a	Huge game with a world that's overflowing with content.  I should really finish this some day, 60 hours in and I think I only got 3/4 of they way and that's only because I started skipping most of the sidequests. It's been so long I'll probably have to start over to make sense of it all.  It's a shame the company tanked so hard because this is a great game.
925	1	a	If you liked Fable but wish it was a tiny bit less simplified and had more elements of modern RPG's, this is worth picking up on a good sale.
6094	1	a	Just Like My childhood dreams.....KILLING F****** DINOSAURS
279	1	a	Just like the description of the game, it's litterally Salvatore, McFarlane and Rolston meshed into one. This game is freaking rad. I don't play many RPGs like I used to, but this one is a good exception. The game play is like a mix of elderscrolls, mass effect and the witcher. The world is absolutly massive and its quest overload (just like an elderscrolls game). The world (that I've seen thus far) is oversized giant mushroom styled high fantasy....its pretty to say the least. Dialoge, actually pretty well done. A lot of folks seem to think this plays like crap on PC, well I disagree. This plays very fluid. Don't like the keys? Rebind them. I already see myself tossing a couple hundred hours into this. Totally worth the whole 12 bucks or so for the game + DLC on sale. I'd be willing to throw 20 at it....well worth it.
3854	1	a	I bought this back when it was orion dino beat down, i bought four copies and i still have two,the game? its well worth your time if its free ,but the money I spent? Well worth it, I love this game honestly ,my computer has a hard time with it but my pc has a potato graphics card.   In conclusion,should you get it? yes,of course it always been good,even when dubbed 'worst game of ever' It was good,even the community is good so just play it already you â¥â¥â¥
4975	1	a	looks pretty in 4k and runs well too.
