3190	1	a	Beatdown, beat em up, killem good!. Just watch the skies for the god darn TERRIES! May you jetpack in peace.
5998	1	a	Very fast pace, comes with bots (THANK GOD), would be extremely fun to play with a group of people, and it's on sale right now. Get this if you have an extra dollar. It's well worth it.
627	1	a	This is the kind of game that fits me like a glove and can really get into! If you like the Elder Scrolls series or the Zelda series, you will probably like this too. Very expansive environment to explore &amp; lots of gameplay time available. I love long treks in freshly crafted robe &amp; plate mixed gear on my mixed class wizardly cleric who sometimes whips out elven ranger style blades when the going gets too thick or when a beefy giant resists my meteor fireball spell &amp; my ice staff too. The art style is highly colorful like WoW. I recommend faeblades and chakrams as maximum versatility backup weapons. This game even has shields for wizards called talismans. They have a magic energy field about the size of shield but with a slightly different unique shape.
4722	0	a	I thought I'd give this a shot since it was so cheap but honestly I could not enjoy this game in any way, shape or form. This is just my opinion and who knows, maybe you'll like it more.
4581	0	a	I do like this game but not as good as everone said (i got it for $0.50) but its ok i guess....... 5.6/10
2490	1	a	These developers man. Selling this game for $0.99? This game is better developed than any early access and most recent full release titles. Well worth the amount you spend on it if you have a friend to play with.
3840	1	a	Very fun gushies
5740	1	a	Best game to get Call of Duty guns
2186	1	a	Underrated.
2229	1	a	A bit difficult to start out but that makes it more fun!
3821	1	a	still better than Halo 4
5225	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6156	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was ninety-nine cents! 0,99/0,99
5459	0	a	I thought the progression would be more mercurial, and only vanity crap in the store.
916	0	a	Fun game for the level or so I could play it. A couple hours into it I'm getting weird bugs where buildings render only half the time and the quests don't show up on the map anymore. I'd get a refund if I hadn't bought the game so long ago. It's unplayable.
1934	1	a	Let me start off by saying that the game time associated with my steam account is no where near how long, and how many times I've played this game. Originally fell in love with the videos upon its release, and I'll openly admit it, that I torrented it at first 'to check it out', like many of my kind will say. I fell in love. I don't think a day passed that I went out and bought this on the Xbox 360 and finished it on that. I later sold my console and had an itch for the game and purchased it on origin (ugh, right?). Then I purchased it once again on Steam, and here we are now. With that long back story having been said, now for the review.  The games environment is many things: Beautiful, yet dark. Peaceful, yet dangerous. Seemingly vibrant world citizens, yet quite solitary.  Graphically, the game is done quite spot on. I have absolutely no complaints in that department as I enjoyed every single second of spending time in the world that the devs have created. The camera angle though was a little bit annoying but you get used to it after some time and you learn how to manipulate it to your advantage.  In terms of gameplay, the fighting is phenomenal. Think Darksiders meets Fable (right!?). The difficulty of the game seems to be an issue for some, but I downloaded the Heartcore mod, which basically amps up the difficulty to your preferred setting, completely for free. Once I did that, made the game more enjoyable, especially when killing big bad trolls.  The replay value of the game, from someone whos definitely gotten his money's worth time and again, is outstanding. There's just so much to do in terms of side quests and side stories that just extended the life of the game so much for me personally. On top of that, the 2 DLC's also add story aspects, which are accompanied by sweet lootz at completion, aside from the shiny lootz 'Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle' DLC you can also purchase.  I guarantee you that for the current sale price of the game ($5) you cannot go wrong with this game.  Overall, would give this a 9/10 and would gladly recommend it to my friends.
3390	1	a	Couldn't resist for less than a dollar. Downloaded. Logged on to server. Shot a tiny dinosaur in the face with my pistol. Picked up and carried into the atmosphere by a pterodactyl. Plummeted to my death. 10/10 would forget parachute again
5178	1	a	This is my preferated game.
6154	1	a	not recomender for low spec pc but for pc that can survive this sure realy recomended =D 
5562	0	a	Cancer
1813	1	a	Great game, good graphics, very long gameplay but it hasn't gotten boring after 24 hours of ingame play. I would definitly recommend this game if you like RPG'S.
2126	1	a	ver good game better than the console version lol to me it is anyway i wish there was a number two coming but nope anyway its well worth the $ and the expansions are two
5220	1	a	Flipping the bird while running over dinosaurs with tank -9000/10
1633	1	a	Note: I haven't sunk too much time in to the game so far.  I bought this on a whim, like a lot of people probably did. Having knowledge of the people who worked on it I figured I'd be in for a blast. KoA:R is usually referred to as a single player MMORPG, and it fits, but that's kind of what's making it fun. You just sort of zone out for a while, have some really fun action packed fights, similar to Zelda or Fable, and go on your way. The quests play out almost like an MMORPG or an Elder Scrolls game, and to those used to the formula it's nothing too amazing, but nothing too grind heavy to put you off of it.   I'm only 3 hours in, but the game is so far pretty enjoyable... I mean I assassinated a dude while he was peeing Tenoutaten.
5631	0	a	Great optimization! 2/10! CS:GO runs on my laptop in 4k highest settings i 70-100fps, dis shet runs at same settings with a shetload of 14 fps! Eyes dont hurt! But thats not all, if i put it down to 720p on low settings i get a beloved 2fps more! Dunno if its my 860m gfx card thats the fault or something else on my pc, or is it just the game itself :/ Because of those problems, i didnt test the game fairly good :P Defineitly (or hau dafuq is it spelled) recommened dis game if u wanna get a pair of glasses, but ur eyes are perfect and ur mom says u dont need dem!
2867	1	a	An AMAZING fps game! Just watch the trailer and you'll know why. This game has guns, jetpacks, tanks, helicopters, and dinasaurs in it! It's 99 CENTS just for the plain version, and the WHOLE game, PLUS FOUR PACKS are only 3.99! It's worth so much more! I would reccommend to anyone who is a fan of an fps, and surviving waves of enemies. I even got a four month free trial!
2113	1	a	I rarely write reviews about games that I buy and play. This game is the exception. It's a gem! I'd had it in my wishlist for a while, unsure whether or not it was worth it. Bought it during summer sale and it was definitely worth it.   Pros: -Combat system is awesome! Smooth, fun, engaging. -The lore of the game is great, what else could one expect from R.A. Salvatore?  -If you enjoy Elder Scrolls, this game will a have a slightly similiar feel. Why? One of the lead developers for ES IV: Oblivion was the lead developer on this game.  -Great way to waste time. Would sit down and next thing I knew it was 4 hours later. -Controls lay out makes plenty of sense.   Cons: - Underdeveloped story and characters. Could've done more there.   Overall, 10/10 would definitely recomend! Worth every bit of what you may spend on it!  
1993	1	a	A massive game if like me you do all the side quests, and the skills trees give you lots of choice to make your perfect avatar. Recommended!!!!
2165	1	a	This game was amazing when it came, and it is still great today. I played many hours on the Xbox360. This game had much potential for a sequel, it is a pity the company went under. Every so often I get an itch top play which why I grabbed this for the PC as well. I recommend this to all RPG and adventure lovers! Enjoy!
290	1	a	It's really unfortunate this game came out at the same time as Skyrim, as it deserves it's own place. It has an amazing story, a world at least as big as Skyrim (maybe bigger), and great comic-book style graphics. Combat is much better than in Skyrim. The add on DLC is amazing, can't recommend it enough. The world setup is very immersive as well. Crafting is OK, not as good as Skyrim, but the potion creation is a bit better in my opinion.  Only downside is that there's a lot of walking, and no horses. The fast travel system works the same was as in many of these games - you walk there the first time, then you can teleport between places. Overall, really loving this game.
1669	1	a	The most fun combat I have ever experienced in an action-rpg. I had great fun trying out the combat styles, and the rpg element of the game is pretty decent too. Def recommended, especially if its on a sale ;)
1851	1	a	'Do you reccomend this game?' there should be an inbetween button for games like this.  I'll start with the good points: -Your character has an interesting reason for being the protaganist of the game.  -Personally I love the combat, the choice of weapons and elements that come with it. -Dynamic locations. -The destiny options are pretty cool. -Wide range of skills and abilities to level up -Can play for hours. -The locations/magic/abilities/weapons are beautiful.  Then there are the negatives:  -By the end of the main storyline I had no idea what was going on. -I became way too overpowered and combat got a little boring. -Boss Battles were hardly boss difficulty (far too easy). -The final boss was WAY too easy.  -Personally I thought the storyline was a little boring. -Relationships with NPCs were boring and almost non-existent.  Overall, I would have been a little annoyed at myself if I had purchased this at full price, luckily I didn't. I would reccomend this game to people who prefer an easy RPG game and little strategizing in battle. Currently I have played around 39 hours worth of the game and have completed the main storyline and both the DLC add-ons and a moderate amount of side quests and still have plenty of exploring, leveling up and other quests to do. This game is a hell of a lot of fun nonetheless but It really lacks an immersing storyline which I really love in RPGs.
5896	0	a	PS2 graphics Scummy game dev
2736	1	a	This game is fun!It has ok graphics not the best but who care's.  Ok let me get to the point,I i was not to sure if i should buy the game but with all the helpful comments I bought it! It won't lag,trust me unless you are on a server with high ping.So I say buy the game you won't be sad if you do and please as soon as you go in-game don't say it sucks and you have wasted your money because you havent!Enjoy the game i know i have and just because i have only played 1.6 hours of it is because i just bought it so trust me for a game this cheap there is nothing to lose!You can make your own servers to play with your friends so have fun.
2223	1	a	Disciples III Rebirth is the one you want to buy. Unique art and music as ever in this series. It could be love, love, love.
2521	1	a	Pretty good game, I like getting the handheld minigun as support, and having the self healing as that class to is a teensy bit OP, and the start pistol is pretty OP for that too, but really good game overall
1758	1	a	A great action RPG. Though it went with a more MMO style of approach to a single player title, the customization was grand, the story was interesting and well written, and it was a worthwhile title to play despite a few small issues (odd facial animations and dialogue at times, very limited crafting system, etc). Probably not worth 60$, but anywhere between 10-25$ is good for any RPG enthusiast.
937	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is one hell of a fun game, tons of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing loot, combat is whatever you wana do, and the story ain't too shabby either. Sucks that the company kinda went Bankrupt. Would have loved to see more from them. 
453	1	a	I guess the title Kingdoms of Amalur fits better than Fable: The good version.
4265	1	a	I got this game for a dollar. Definetly worth it.
552	1	a	I'm having fun with this game, its only draw back is that it will use the same dungeon more then once for quests.
4307	1	a	This game is brilliant! it's tons of fun! me and a few friends just got it for the hell of it to have a go and oh my god! it's one of the best games i've played it's addicting looks nice and funny as hell!  Trust me grab a few friends and try it out!  Don't let me play time say otherwise!
4429	0	a	Horrible graphics swallowed lage â¥â¥â¥ cracks
5620	1	a	5/5
4994	1	a	Still Better Than Jurassic Park  I Like This
374	1	a	Nicely design game wonderful creatures the only problem I have is the inventory system is a little clunky but other than that I would totally recommend to anybody who plays RPG's and such things ! :)
6231	1	a	I totally just beat a triceratops to death. I have wanted to do that ever since I was a kid. Also revamped my hate for pterodactyls.
4751	1	a	better than takedown 10/10
4131	1	a	It's that one type of Halo game but with Dinosaurs!!
2689	0	a	I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.  I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.  Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.  Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser. I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.  I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.  There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.  In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round. The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles. I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.  I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time. But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.  Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game. Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it. Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.     
2124	1	a	10/10, would raise damage resistance to 100% again.
4541	1	a	An absolutely awesome game to play with friends whether it's a co-op survival against a horde of dinosaurs or a deathmatch between players. Although this game has quite afew bugs and things that they should improve on, I would definitely recommend this game to a friend!
2747	1	a	TL;DR: It's fun, frequently updated and generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. Wait for it to go on sale though, because the gameplay isn't worth the full price.  I was a bit scared when I picked up this title because of all the bad reviews it was receiving, stating that ORION: Dino Horde was one of the worst games ever made. After I watched a rather hilarious german gameplay video, and the game was on sale for less than 2â¬, I finally decided to get this game.  First of all, we've got to set the record straight: ORION: Dino Horde IS NOT the same game as ORION: Dino Beatdown. This should be a no-brainer, but unfortunately many people will still post bad reviews mistaking the previous Dino Beatdown for Dino Horde.  Dino Horde is a mutiplayer action game in which you have to kill off waves of dinosaurs and defend buildings. Between those waves, you're able to upgrade your loadout and perks by spending money which is earned in a TD-like fashion by killing enemies. The general concept is rather simple as is the gameplay. When fighting on foot, the gameplay consists of rather monotonous gunplay. Because the dinosaurs are generally faster than the player, movement and celever positioning don't really play a role in fighting. The only real variation lies in the different enemy types of which some require different strategies to kill. The game also includes vehicles and vehicle combat, which is a pleasant relief. The graphics are rather good considering this game is a low budget production, but the map design can be monotonous from time to time.  The strengths of the game lie within the co-op aspect and the frequently updated content. Since the launch of the title, the developers have included multiple new game modes, some of which deliver a rock-solid co-op experience, as well as other additional content.  This game isn't the next big multiplayer co-op shooter, but it definitely has it's moments and is generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. The price of 13.99â¬ isn't worth the experience though. If this game goes on sale anytime soon, you might want to pick it up for some hours of multiplayer fun.
1732	1	a	There are few games out there such as Kingdoms of Amalur, the Combat is fast and fun the skills unique making each and every potential class interesting. The story is very well written and leaves you wanting to keep going to finish it. Alkthough there are some immersion base failings and some minor consistency issues overall there are not many RPG's out there that are anywhere near as good.
4570	1	a	fantastically cinematic shooter action, listening helplessly to your friend scream as he's torn apart by a T-Rex in slow motion, and avenging him with your bare hands is a rare experience, play with voice chat for maximum adrenaline
1019	1	a	EA helped to make it so do with that what you will.
1336	1	a	I enjoyed this game a lot with its beautifully crafted open world.. Mechanics not perfect to me but still was nice experience. 8/10
4415	0	a	MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ARE A JOKE  I am at least double the requirements of this game and cannot play at anything but 1fps on the lowest settings!! Fix this game and I will change my review 
2976	1	a	It ain't â¥â¥â¥â¥. I dont get the exceptionally low metacritic score as it's pretty much what is. I would give it a 6.5 at best at full price and an 8 for a dollar. Good silly survival co-op if you play with friends kinda reminds me of killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicles. It ain't no Killing Floor though.
636	1	a	This game. This company. Oh the potential. RA Salvatore created a wonderful world. The developers did a good job of making it feel large and alive. But all of the money issues... they are gone now. We will never see a KoA Online.  Let me start with the bad. The difficulty? Too easy. The DLC was letting players pay to effetively add power (at least the preorder DLC I had). I never understand why players want to effectively pay money to use cheat codes. And how developers started deciding that that would even work. But it is common now. The story? Mediocre... oh the world is wonderful but the story... well it is not quite top tier.  The good. The combat is fun. The character customization feels nice. The world (yeah I keep saying that). It could have made a great MMO but we will never know.  The devs just spent too much money, took on too much debt. I still recommend this game when you see it go on sale. But just remember that the team is gone. Don't expect an expansion, more DLC, or even more patches. I feel that $30 is a bit steep but at half off I can definitely say give it a try.
1919	1	a	Game has stood the test of time fairly well,, I like the elemnents of fate that the game brings to the table, however the character customization into skills and such falls fairly short in context to the size of the areas that you will explore for fun and, in conjuction with your reckoning mode that gives double exo for kills, you will find yourself vastly overleveled for each areas 'Fae' or wild creatures to destroy and this will make you push ahead to the areas that you are leveled to be in, thus missing some quests here and there, or missing a twist of fate.  This game is like fable, in that you can basically walk around very early in the game and kill basically everything at your level with ease, even on hard mode. The enemies themselves have these mechanics, like some will take more damage from back attacks or an elementally charged attack that they are specifically weak to, however you will find yourself not even using these strategies and instead just blasting through them with whatever you have, which will probably be more than easy enough to do; in conjection with the depth of the character leveling system, this game just falls short of a great experience, but is still worth playing!  Buying this game for $4 was probably one of the best buys that ive made on steam to date and not everyone will like this game, but for $4 everyone shoulld own it. 
6316	1	a	I like this game in general good graphics and great gameplay are fun but the only problem is finding a match which is sometimes hard 
976	1	a	Really underrated RPG, it does have some problems and its has that 'Fable feel' to it but still manages to give an amazing experience! TOTALLY RECOMENDED.
5207	1	a	10/10
2916	1	a	This game is awesome first off. Its a little broken in some places but theres tons of cool weapons, good graphics, awesome action and punching dinos in the face. If you have a couple of dollars you should really consider getting this game.
1565	1	a	This game...  Such a great time-waster RPG. Great batttlesystem (remniscient of Zelda-styled autolocking) with fun weapons and skills.   I have tried to playthrough the game on two separate occasions. Both times I quit for the same reason: GAME BREAKING BUGS.  If you want to play this, make sure you have a save for every hour, in 3 different saves. Also, be prepared to search the internet in HOPES of finding a glitchy way to overcome the bug.  I wish you luck, friends. F**K you devs for not putting out a hotfix for the insane number of well-documented bugs that RUIN a player's expeierence and fun.
4578	0	a	Look at the pretty screenshots.... This game blows.
5478	1	a	this game is good it came out on my birthday
1313	1	a	if you like Skyrim you will definetly love this game! definetly buy it, though for the price it could be a little cheaper its the same price as Skyrim, it's probably still worth it but i would recomend picking it up on a sale like i did. but its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing AWESOME!!!
2700	1	a	its one of the best games, some may gripe about the price drop, but its so fun to run around lopping off raptors heads in a single sword swing  really lazy, didnt read: its better than most games that take many many years and many MANY millions of dollars to make
3401	1	a	Fight for Egg-Based Dominance in a world of marines fighting for Egg-Based Dominance and Dinosaurs who conveniently are also fighting for Egg-Based Dominance.
4276	1	a	I regretted not buying this when it's on sale. Who wouldn't want to fight dinosaurs?
319	1	a	I'll make this brief. This game is more than worth waaaaayyyyy more the 10 buck asking price. Intricate story, awesome weapons and easy to use control scheme--saying a lot from a RPG noob like me--make this a fun, captivating and replayable game worth every penny. DLC just as good and worth scooping up with the game.
2345	0	a	Stealing content from other game developers and lying to their fans about it, deleting negative comments on their Facebook page, setting up an Indiegogo campaign to steal even more money from their fans (They donated $500 to themselves in the campaign to make it look like it is successful) @  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orion--5#/  , abusing employees (Firing them just before the release of the game and not paying them a single cent), abusing the current publicity they are getting (  http://imgur.com/s4WSxmf  ), threatening to sue people for having negative comments on their company (  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/d4rc74m?context=3  )    https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/   Also, this game is horrible in the first place. I bought this game last year and I have only played 0.1 hours for many good reasons.
3354	1	a	Great game for the price but don't expect more
5583	1	a	so swag me and my bud quick scoped some dinos they dident see it comeing!
1285	1	a	great game has all of the componants of a solid RPG fun abilities great crafting system lokst of dropped fun loot and an unique skill tree setup great game!
3255	1	a	To be honest it's a crap game. But it was 99c!
1409	1	a	Yes I do! ItÂ´s a Nice Game!
3830	1	a	Left 4 Dinosaurs is a wonderful game
2664	0	a	its bad
5192	1	a	it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
3252	1	a	i like to shoot the dino and think that the gun is my wiener and i am peeing
2125	1	a	Simple, cool, fun graphics - very similar to Elder Scrolls or WoW without the online play and monthly charge. A good casual RPG/sandbox for experienced gamers.
5278	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
2251	1	a	If you enjoyed D2 and would like a more polished spangly version, this is it. Plays pretty much like D2 with knobs and bells on. Pretty good :)
4083	1	a	10/10  Best game I've ever played.
4635	1	a	ayy, thats pretty good, 10/10 good priced and great game. great fuc king deal
5147	1	a	ORION is a great game, I love it so much!
2569	0	a	So it got updated. And nothing from what I've noiced has changed. It's still the same boring buggy mess when it was orion: dino horde. Just go buy primal carnage instead. That's an actual good game where you shoot dinosaurs.
3608	1	a	the graphics look like Halo CE. Other than that great job :melon:
4055	1	a	This game has rose from the ashes. When I first got it the game was buggy AF. But now the game is fun.
2504	1	a	Totally Worth 99 cents
4874	1	a	One match was really all I needed. It's my type of game but not polished enough for me. The graphics and sound aren't very good and the music is nothing spectacular either. Not to mention that the animations are really clunky and stiff. The gameplay is okay; it has a Turak and Halo combo. I must warn you though...I got bored right after my first match. There's no story or anything to this game. You just simply jump in and fight dinosaurs. There's 3 classes to choose from and they all have their own abilities. Assault has a jetpack, medic of course has a medic gun, and a stealth class that can go invisible for a short time. I also noticed I had a lot of connection problems which shouldn't happen since I have a gaming laptop. But some games will do this. I recommend it for a dollar only. 6/10
1404	1	a	It's a Single-Player MMO game
5868	1	a	For the money it costs, you can really try it. I don't know how it was at the beginning, but I just bought it for 49ct and it's totally worth it. Only thing I don't like is the weapon system.
48	1	a	I thought magic the gathering was nerd poker. This game takes nerd poker to a new level. It's not bad but it's not that great. The artwork is pretty decent.
4860	1	a	THAT IS ONE BIG PILE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥!
4204	0	a	&gt;Last played February 21st 2014  As it should, and always will be.  I really have no idea what they added since then, but based on what other negative reviews have said, I don't think I have any other insightful comments to add, so I'll just a story if you want to read more.  I got this game in 2014, probably the 21st of february to be exact, all because someone I knew back then told me to get it to play with them. They really enjoyed playing this piece of tosh $1 arena dino shooter game at the time. Well I guess their taste in this game was indicative of them overall, garbage. The end.  Just play TF2, Dirty Bomb, any other F2P game besides this.
3069	1	a	Besides it being terribly hilarious, Dino Horde is really all I thought it was going to be. For only being able to play durring the free weekend, I was able to get a taste of something fun. Something that makes me laugh at it's simplicity, yet how amazingly fun it is. Best played with friends, this game is able to showcase just about everything it shows in the videos. It's a defense, survival, pvp/pve that does hearken to Halo, Killing Floor, and Jurassic Park as well. Though it goes beyond that into amazing maps, survival games, and even gives the players chances to get back at their friends in a multiplayer deathmatch.  It is a ton of fun, though I would say wait for a sale to get this. It's not exactly worth fifteen dollars in my mind, since there were bugs, but what game is without flaws? If you got it when it was a dollar, then hopefully you got your money's worth. This is most definitely worth the time for friends who want to have some co-op madness with dinosaurs and guns and mechs and always wanting to punch dinos in the face. That's always fun. :3
1341	1	a	fall 2016: it took me roughly 100 hours to complete the game along with both DLCs and 'most' of the side quests. Overall I really enjoyed it.   The fighting mechanics are definetly a high point of the game for me. If I compare them to let's say Skyrim's fighting mechanics, these are more arcady and unrealistic, but they're just so much more fun. You have more weapon types and combos to choose from and you can cast all kinds of spells at the same time. You can combine skills and have a warrior/mage character for example and let me tell you, roughing up a group of enemies with a greatsword and then finishing them all off with a lightning masterspell without having to switch to it in some menu feels really good :) The story and characters are interesting and the voiceacting is on point. DLCs are worth getting in my opinion as they give you new maps, item sets and stories.   The two things I can imagine players not liking are that most of the set items drop randomly so you're gonna have to grind in said location if you wanna complete that awesome looking set. and that if you play the completionist style when you're doing all the sidequests and exploring everything, you're going to reach the max level quite soon and you might find the game a bit dragged on towards the end. Neither one won't really bother you if you enjoy the game though.  A BIG YES FOR ME! ..the company that made this no longer exists which is a real shame cause I loved it
1788	1	a	amazing graphics although the dialogue can be a bit overdone i love the game overall 4/5 worth the buy especially on summer sale
4891	1	a	i played this game before when it was free for 7 days (twice) and now im waiting for a friend to buy it
1868	1	a	This game is huge and every side mission is like a different game with pretty environents. I didn't play Witcher 3 yet, but this game beats Witcher 1 &amp; 2 and Skyrim. AWESOME. 3D is amazingly beautiful with a Mod fix.  I totally reommend it.
4906	0	a	boring game don't buy.......... :P
4030	1	a	This review is mainly for the multiplayer campaign, but wow. A tri-class Halo mixed with waves of dinosaurs! You must defend the generator that allows you to buy new perks and weapons. As you complete each level in the game, you push forward to capture new ground; rallying points containing vehicles of different types. Here are a few highlights:  - The pterodactyls pick you up and drop you. If you haven't invested in a parachute, you fall to your death.  - You may drive a tank, a hoverplane, or multiple other vehicles as you capture new rallying points.  - You may be targeted and charged by a triceratops.  - You may be eaten by a T-Rex, a 'Spinosaurus, ' or perhaps a seuch...sucha...oversized crocodile...  - Choose to wield pistols, a main weapon, a secondary weapon, or melee. Or just use a vehicle!  Overall, I dig this game, particularly with a good group of friends.  It bugs out on 32-bit systems. Deal with it by playing in windowed mode. Why wouldn't you do that in the first place? Either way, 8/10 for the time I (and many others) spent dealing with bugs.
5990	1	a	It's okay, but I got bored after a while :c One of those games where I wish I can give it a neutral recommendation.
2143	1	a	I actually enjoyed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game when it first came out. Sure it has it's flaws but theres really something special and magical about it if you can give it a chance.
4283	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
2298	0	a	After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.  First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.  I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as 'The Worst Video Game EVER!' and 'Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?'. I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was 'the best turn-around in video game history!'. Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. 'It's Halo with Dinosaurs' they said, 'Nonsense!' I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed 'I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!'  So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?  What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.  The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.  Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.   EDIT:  In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game, but my recommendation stays the same.  To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself 'he can't be that bad'. Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?  This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. 'Can you still have fun with it?' Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.  There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.  You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.
1158	1	a	Very good game. I recommend it for people who enjoy games such as Skyrim and Fable. This game is very similar to dragons dogma so for people who enjoyed that game on console, this is the game for you. 8.5/10
2649	1	a	OREOS: Dino Horse is the spiritual successor to the universally acclaimed smash hit Cabela's Outdoor Adventures, building upon everything that made the fan favorite so spectacular (YOU JUST USE CARS TO WIN, AS LONG AS YOU ARE SEATED IN A VEHICLE THE ONLY HORIZON FOR YOU IS ONE OF GOLDEN RADIANCE) and revving it up to the next level! Squeezed from fresh virgins harvested at Spiral Games Studios very own Hell Engine, ARYANS: Dino Harp finally delivers what all satanists have been craving for the past 2 decades: For someone to take good ol' fashioned class based FPS gameplay, dumb it straight the â¥â¥â¥â¥ down, shoehorn in pointless costumes and hats, and throw in all the assets from Natural Selection but instead of aliens have ZANY â¥â¥â¥ SPACE DINOSAURS so that it can all be blended up, mixed into a fine non-alcoholic beverage, and poured all over the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ground because holy hell this game is complete dogshit why in God's name would anyone wanna drink it. But don't soften up yet, cause this game's still got enough hilariously stupid shenenigans to keep your â¥â¥â¥â¥ rock solid; It's got all the core essentials to being cool, including but not limited to 1) Dramatic Slo-Mo Kill Cams so you can soak in you/your friends every death, 2) Motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥in jetbikes, 3) Motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥in JETPACKS, 4) Poorly Optimized Motion Blur (a strong sign of being truly next-gen), and 5) Rag Doll Physics out the â¥â¥â¥. If you aren't soaked through to the seat by now than you gotta have a crotch colder than the Artic Circle, in which case this is the kind of game that might just actually kill you. TL;DR it's ugly and stupid and cheap but if you're looking for a silly co-op shootbanger than you came to the right place
4205	0	a	Terrible Halo ripoff however it's still mildly fun for a couple of hours to play regardless of how bad it is.
5177	0	a	There's a reason its a dollar...
3177	1	a	Seriously just go buy this..Loads of fun and it's practically free..even in SA..
5791	0	a	Why can i write a Review for this game if i havent even played/bought it????????
1197	1	a	Great game. Amazing combat system, plenty of quests. Easily a 60+ hour game. Recommended if you liked Oblivion/Skyrim/Fable.
4070	0	a	If I knew what I know now about this game I never would have bought it I'd say the current price of 99 cents is a ripoff. Unless they changed every single broken â¥â¥â¥â¥ing aspect of this piece of turd since I played it then its still the worst game I've ever played. And I've played some â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my day.
5223	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
3515	1	a	I fap to this well spent 0,99$
3293	1	a	Funny game :) got alot of fun playing all those game mods, shooter based on the unreal engine. With 3 classes, each got his unique skills, different dinosaurs, variating from small Comps -&gt; Raptors -&gt; Triceratops -&gt; T-Rex's etc etc. even Spinosaurus and the Deinosuchus Croc. U can play all these dinosaurs and even flying Pteranodons etc.   Nice survival mods, egg caputure etc etc. alot of different weapons add even more fun and tons of achievements. Get this game its worth it :) sometimes its even supercheap like i got 4x for just 3â¬ or so :)
6355	1	a	I cant believe this game is only for $1. If you are too stingy to pay $1 for quality, then go sit in the corner.  (personally i got one of the free copies)  First of all, you are paying for bare minimum quality you would expect from a $1 game. However, the quality you get is much better then that of most $20-30 games. Not to mention all the different game modes, equipment, enemies and customization.  Sound/picture quality: 7/10 (few graphical/camera issues that need to be addressed. Luckily they do not affect the core game)  Gameplay: 8/10 (its just generally all around fun. What more could you want from shooting dinosaurs)  Multiplayer: 10/10 (Had no issues with multiplayer. Its just one of those games thats 10x as fun with friends)  Highly recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it. Its only gonna continue to get larger with steam workshop content flooding in. (PS: some game modes allow playing as dinosaurs)
516	1	a	amazing ten out of ten if your looking for an uncommen rpg to play.
5433	0	a	The fist few hours are cool but, when you get into it, it's boring.
619	1	a	Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur is a really enjoyable action RPG. This game looks great, has awesome combat, tonnes of loot,weapons,armors, abilities and skills to customize your character with. The DLC for this game is worth getting and adds to the many hours that it already takes to complete this massive game. The only cons I can see for this game would be the jittery camera movements and some of the minor side quest can be rather dull. All in all however, this is a great RPG to pick up.
1532	1	a	Wow! I was most pleasantly surprised by this game, probably about 25%/35% in. It resembles Fable (in a good way). Its quests embed sufficient story to obscure the foundation of any mission ('find/harvest/kill/visit X'). The story itself is quite adequate: multiple faction story lines, sufficient missions. Weaknesses: graphically unimpressive, no party system, dialogue menu options often uninspiring, awkward controls.
3344	0	a	its very expensive i dont think you should waste your money on this.
3106	1	a	A fun FPS that has basic FPS things (mainly stealing mechanics from Halo) but has it's own superior uniqueness.
5833	0	a	Bad and unoptimized!
3996	1	a	This game is far to fun to play. I do recommend this game. This game only COST .99, but it guys. It is worth it.
4299	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
3218	1	a	I Got killed by a T-Rex 11/10
4791	1	a	It's not great but you can get a dollar's worth of fun out of it easily.
3537	1	a	Spiral Games Studioâs newest game set in the Orion universe is Orion: Dino Horde. A supersession of Spirals previous game Orion: Dino Beatdown, Dino Horde expands the game mechanics and universe in every direction into something worthy of having James Cameron or Ridley Scott putting their names on. The cinematic visuals and lighting are some of the best Iâve ever seen in a game, and are something to be expected from a Spielberg film.   Check out my full review at     indieNewsNow.com   [indienewsnow.com] 
3365	1	a	This game is the funnest game i have ever played!
163	1	a	The good parts of Fable and the good parts of Dragon Age mixed into one game.
4977	0	a	Bought this game as a four-pack for some of my friends with amazing computers. NO ONE CAN RUN IT!
6119	1	a	Orion: prelude is very cheap game , but don't fool yourself saying if the game is cheap the gameplay is also cheap, no , it just doesn't happen to meet up in Orion: prelude, the game is very fun and I can see people are already addicted to it and it is just a great game.  For 1 dollar , you get minimum 140-160 hours of gameplay out of it , that's why I want to recommend this game , cheap price , long game. You won't find this aspect in most games in our days. I can ensure someone will play 200-300 hours... is it you ,reader? XD
1631	1	a	Its pretty good, 8/10, combat is epic... story okay..
3126	1	a	This is definitely a fun game. Easy to learn after about 15 minutes of messing with everything that you have access to. The best weapons are late in the game so you'll have to be patient with pea-shooters. Each weapon does have its own unique set of characteristics but overall, I have quenched my thirst for killing dinosaurs - like no other game can! Thanks N!N and the Orion dev team(s)!
4312	1	a	Bearing in mind the price of this game, it's pretty okay!!
2295	1	a	Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space with rocket launchers, lazers, and a sword? Do you want to do all that for only a dollar?  Of course you do! Buy this game!
5659	0	a	This game just downright sucks. For someone who likes to play dinosaur games this one isn't even trying just another survive the wave game nothing special. Just buy primal carnage extincion you get more worth outta your moneys then this game. But why do i hate this game? It's not even something only just a game with ''skins'' ''classes'' and ''different'' dinosaurs same colours, Graphics aren't even being updated. This ''game'' just needs to be stopped.
1300	1	a	I really enjoy this game. It almost seems endless! The world is huge, the story is interesting and there are more side quests than seems rationally possible!  Pros: The graphics are bright and colorful, the items and weapons are plentiful and I'm still seeing new enemies! Getting around is esay with plenty of teleport spots available. And the location variety is amazing, I'm often awed by how creative and beautiful the environments are!  Cons: The side quests get repetitive; a lot of them are fetch quests. Not enough puzzles, they pop up here and there but not often enough. Inventory is weight based and I'm constantly returning to towns to sell stuff! It's like freaking Torchlight levels of item management! :)
1084	1	a	Such a marvellous action RPG - it does have a few minor flaws, but the game more than makes up for them elsewhere. It's such a tragic shame that the studio had it's funding pulled at the last minute consigning this marvellous universe and gem of a game to the history books.
3925	0	a	I would love this game if every five seconds I didn't crash. Now note I have a very nice and fast gaming computer. Other then that though the game is very well rounded although it needs a litlle work.
4664	1	a	addicted with this game :)
3482	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1811	1	a	Super fun sandboxy game that got completely overshadowed by Skyrim, alas. As someone who loves different character builds, being able to change abilities/classes at will is awesome. My only complaint is that there's almost too much game for the level cap, which is very easy to hit significantly before endgame if you, like me, feel compelled to do every sidequest you find.
4068	1	a	this is only my third day of playing and already my hair is starting to grow back and I find myself constantly surrounded by chicks in bikinis. 9/10
903	0	a	Looks and plays great, but something is lacking. Maybe it's what theologists call 'a soul'. Everytime I play i get bored.   If you need a good exploration based ARPG, play any Piranha Bytes game. Even Risen 2 or Gothic 3.
3449	1	a	Suprisingly hilarious with friends, good for the $1 I spent on it. Don't expect variation and uniqueness.
618	1	a	Great rpg...super easy control really nice game
6052	1	a	I honestly thought it would be a bad game, but i have had a lot of fun so far in the few hours i have played this game. It is worth the 1$ and when you play with friends the experience is much much better.  Plus it is litterally ALL Zombie shooters like COD Zombies, Left 4 Dead, etc except with Futuristic weapons, vehicles and WITH FREAKING DINOSAURS!! Sometimes the game is a little glitchy, but it is nothing bad.  8.5/10
6393	1	a	This is it to much FUN. I haven't played a game like this for awhile, i mean a Fantastic Joy. Before I wasn't too interested in the beginning with the concept of Dinosours. But in the End I gave it a try and it is a great price. It does feel like that they say it is Halo, and other FPS. Im hooked with this game Simple yet satisfying.
3481	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
5975	1	a	Do you like flying around in a futuristic robot suit? Do you like sneaking behind dinosaurs and killing them off with a knife? Do you like playing as a T-Rex and eating your friends while you're at it?  Then this game is for you!  - Although repetitive, the game does not fail to bring surprises in every session (wait for that huge pumpkin man). - I like the big dinosaurs that spawn every now and then (TRex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, etc). - The vehicles are a great way of traveling around the map especially when objectives are far from the base. - The AI is actually quite smart when you play solo. They know how to ride vehicles (given you're the one who's driving), and they know what to do and when to do it. - There are only three classes to choose from, and this might discourage some from purchasing the game. - The game is actually quite cheap for what it is. - There is no single-player campaign, but there are single-player game modes. - It's like Dino D-Day future style, but with lots of game modes.
3324	1	a	A somewhat rickety dinosaur first person shooter, it makes for some very short periods of intense fun. It's definitely a game that you will want to play with friends, but have fun dealing with weird connection bugs. Overall, definitely worth $0.99.
2660	1	a	Yeah, I have been playing games for years and years, and back in the day, games were fun, games were simple, and most of all games were FUN, specially with friends,this game while simple in its premise, has a lot of heart is fast paced, and is loads of fun, sure the meta critic is low, but that was its previous incarnation, not this one, this is a great article on the game check it out:   http://www.dsogaming.com/editorial/orion-dino-horde-controversy-let-the-battle-begin/   Besides what have you got to loose for a few dollars? this game gives you more bang for your buck than some AAA titles that I own, and even tho It might not be the most polished or graphically amazing game out there, it delivers, and brings home the pizza!  so dont hesitate, you will have fun, you will be surprised at the sheer madness of running around from killer dinos, and then jumping in a jetbike making a last second save, the gameplay has lots of emergent moments of pure madness, and in that you can see that the folks that made it has a vision, and above all know how to make a fun game.  Play it, you will be surprised! oh and it has a 5 star community you cant go wrong!  
6207	1	a	Picked it up for $1.49, super great deal! The more I play the game, the more enjoyable it has gotten. There isn't a very large learning curve, and within the first hour or so you have a decent idea of what's going on. After that, exploring the levels some and seeing the different weapons and vehicles this game has to offer makes for an ejoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this game, there's a good chance it might suprise you!
1255	1	a	The short and skinny: This game features the art style of World of Warcraft with the open world and quest style of Skyrim. It has huge replay value and is immensely enjoyable, even with some bugs here or there.   Kingdoms of Amalur is both a unrivaled triumph and a missed opportunity. As you play the game you can easily fall in love with it and you'll find an absurd number of things to do in the open world enviroment. Truly there are maybe 5x more quests than you'll need to move through the main story and level up. This allows you to the freedom of turning down quests you dont think would be fun or a waste of time. Or it lets you focus your efforts in a few places and save the other quests for another play through. This really lengthens the replay value of the game. Really the only thing that prevents this game from being as good as or better than skyrim is the absolute zero mod support. Unlike games that don't fully support modding, Amalur simply locks it out without heavy hacking. In that regard the game has no longevity like Skyrim. Which brings me to one problem: the game is buggy and the company that made it has gone bankrupt. There will be no patches to fix anything as even the rights to the game are in arbitration in bankruptcy court. If the game had mod support, players could have patched the bugs, but without it...you have to live with them. Some are more annoying than others but what can you do?  Over all the game is amazing. It really makes me sad to know there will be no sequel as the state of rhode island owns the rights to this title while trying to make up for losses from the bankruptcy. You can google the details on it if you like. The end result is no sequel and no future for Amalur. Its such a good game too... its maddening. It has some quirks and so on, but over all the game is amazing. I can't believe I waited so long to try it. I felt like I missed out. I guess better late than never, right?
2346	1	a	Right now i have played around 20 hours on it and I'm still enjoying it! If you just want to relieve some stress, just play this game. It certainly helps. The fairness between Man and Dino is in favor of Man. It depends if YOU like that, but i certainly do. Note: With friends it's MUCH more fun.  PROS: - A lot of variety in weapons and vehicles. - A lot of different game modes. It never gets boring. - Very well-made maps. - Different classes. (assault, support and recon) - Augments where you can buy all sorts of stuff. - It is strategic. e.g. which augments and weapons should you buy first? CONS: - There are some strange bugs. But they can always be solved. - When playing Solo. It kinda gets boring after a while.  Over all, I REALLY enjoy this game and now my other friends can join too bc it's F2P now! P.S. I see a lot of people complaining it's F2P now and they want their money back. Jesus Christ it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 99 cents and you even get helmets for it. Stop complaining for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake.
5361	0	a	worst gamer -1,000.000/10
4932	0	a	ripped my money
5543	0	a	A buggy mess of a halo ripoff that dosen't understand what it wants to be
4345	0	a	it sucks 
5118	0	a	i was tricked by all the good reviews into downloading orion,its nothing new and not worth ur time,terrible bad grahics,bad font,game screen looks dated and biggest downer was tht as i started playing i thought' what the heck?' im running faster than dinos and its almost like a arcade shooter or a shooting range hitting carboard like dionos,so u can hate me for putting it like this...but u dont want to do this - go play on ur mobile!
6413	1	a	Definitely worth .99 cents, really fun and action packed, they are STILL working out the bugs, but that aside it is really fun online game. The dinosaurs vary in size and difficulty, along with bonus beasts to slay.
5466	1	a	i have played this game for half a hour a already had loads of fun i mean its mother******* lightsabres chopping up dinosaurs whilst mechs are shooting away at the giant trex who is trying to eat you i would highly recommend this to anyone 
6087	1	a	i played this game some time ago and from what i remember this game is awsome i played for 3-4 hours at a time
889	0	a	I haven't purchased a game with the EA logo on it since BF1942 due to their underhanded practices, but a friend highly recommended this game and even paid for it. With that disclaimer out of the way, on to the review.  Overall appearance: 5/10. Standard, generic, fly by night MMO look throughout the game. It is vastly empty, with very specific paths to follow. This is reinforced with invisible walls everywhere which prevent you from doing the simplest of tasks like jumping over a log. This kind of unpolished short cut methodology is fine for F2P MMOs, but not for a single player game. The armor sets are frequently reused, so you can have 3 or 4 different sets, yet they all look identical. The developers didn't even take the extra day to retexture the pieces for each set.  Combat mechanics: 1/10. This game has hands down, the absolute worst combat mechanics I have ever witnessed in any game. Even Revelation 2012 was better in this regard. You go to attack a specific enemy, and are instantly, uncontrollably attacking something completely different. This can include other monsters, but also can include a rock wall, the ground, or even nothing at all. This unpolished, wonky mess of a system can and will get you killed by bosses over and over.  Camera movements: 2/10. You have no control whatsoever of the bouncy, rubber banding camera, which frequently pops underground and into trees and rocks during fights so you can't see what's going on. If you suffer from motion sickness, take your pills before attempting to play.  Questing contents: 8/10. There is a lot to do in this game. Nearly town NPC will have some kind of quest chain for you to accomplish. Not just one Fed Ex quest, but actual, multiple leg quests. This is a nice thing to see in this day and age of single mission, gofer quests that most games offer. This doesn't allow for a great deal of replayability though, since the quests and dialogue are identical regardless of character build.  In general, this game feels just like any other fly by night MMO, with the one exception that there is no one else around. The armor sets leave a lot to be desired, using the same pieces for several different versions. And with the horrendous camera whizzing around all over the place, along with your character randomly attacking whatever the game decides it should, make this an exercise in patience more than something fun to do. Even on sale, it's not worth it.  While there were a number of high profile names associated with this title, it is painfully obvious they were merely lounging while resting on their laurels as a handful of under skilled interns developed the game. Many cardinal sins were incorporated along the way, and while I really wanted to like the game, in the end just couldn't. If I wanted to pay money for this kind of frustration, I'd get back together with my ex.
3276	1	a	I'm not sure why there is so much hate surrounding this game. It is not bad, and is deffinatly worth the 99 cents i payed. Flawed, but fun.
918	0	a	I have not played this game much yet, but it has a really bad camera.
3145	1	a	This is a great game if iÂ´m bored with tf2 and cs:go...And for just a buck
954	1	a	This game is a lot more fun than I expected it to be. The ability to pick your play style, and change it through out the game is very nice.
5226	1	a	Nice game

160	1	a	English (US) The game is actually good, you get all you want on a avarage action rpg, open world, lots of items, items creation and upgrades, however, this is only a goood experience if you never played skyrim or dark souls, because kingdoms of amalur is really easy and repetitive, the A.I is really poor, and have this cartoonish style that I hate.  Pros: - Lots of items and big world to explore - Best item creation system I have ever saw in a rpg  Cons: - Cartoonish visual style - Poor A.I. it is really really easy... - No coop mode - Poorly told history. - Very repetitive   Portugues (Brasil) O jogo Ã© bom, tem tudo que voce espera de um bom rpg com aÃ§Ã£o, mundo aberto, vasto, itens a vontade, com direito a criar e encantar, pra quem nunca jogou dark souls ou skyrim, vai achar um Ã³timo jogo, agora se voce ja jogou jogos de rpg com aÃ§Ã£o melhores voce vai achar ele bem fÃ¡cil, inteligencia artificial Ã© pobre, e ainda tem um estilo bem cartunesco, meio infantil, parece que voce estÃ¡ no desenho animado do he-man.  Pros: - Bastante itens e Ã¡rea para explorar - CriaÃ§Ã£o de itens Ã© a melhor que eu jÃ¡ vi em um jogo de rpg  Cons: - Estilo visual mais infantil - Lutas sÃ£o bem simples, fÃ¡ceis e repetitivas, pobre inteligencia artificial - Faltou modo coop - Historia nÃ£o te prende. - Muito repetitivo.  Nota 7/10
392	1	a	A very fun game. Rich lore, interesting storyline, various unique creatures and weapons. There are 3 main playstyles that vary considerably. If you want you can focus on one of the 3 or you can split it up between. There are so many possibilities, cool moves and useful spells. It has a solid blacksmithing and alchemy component to it, as well as something called sagecrafting where you can create gems that will power up your items.   Because most people are going to know what its like compared to Skyrim I guess I'll have to talk about that. In my opinion the combat is more rich. There's dodging, and blocking with sheilds is actually worth it and plays into your attacks if timed right. Also it feels way less hack and slash than Skyrim, there a different moves that when applied correctly can turn the tide of what might have seemed an unwinnable fight. The game auto-aims for you, but that doesn't detract from the fighting experience at all. The spells are also more interesting than Skyrim's. Skyrim might have more spells but they end up all feeling the same while KoA:R's are all unique and have very powerful uses in certain situations.   Kingdoms has an amazing world to explore. It is a bit small compared to Skyrim and doesn't allow for as much freedom (for example you can only jump down from cliffs and walls at certain points on the map) but it is something you get used to and it helps with where the game really excels: combat, because you are channelled towards groups of enemies.   The graphics are fairly decent and the game runs smoothly. I did run into a bug where you get stuck and cannot move at all and have to fast travel to get out of the place and the general pop in distance for enemies could be a bit longer, perhaps there is a way to change this in the .ini files or something, I'll have to check. The lipsyncing of characters is sometimes off and occassionally they make really awkward movements when speaking, which are a bit immersion breaking. The voice acting is quite good though like all RPGs I really wish they could have used a greater variety of voice actors.   Overall its a great experience and I'm quite addicted to it so far. There are so many choices and I feel as if I will do a bunch of playthroughs with vastly differing character builds to get the whole experience. Oh that brings me to one last thing. You can 'unbind your fate' for a relatively cheap gold cost to reset your points. This means if partway through a playthrough you got sick of smashing people with giant swords you could pay a bit of gold and change your character into a stealthy assassin or a flashy mage.
416	1	a	I'm m ight be a little late to the review scene, But this is one of the best action rpg games around.
4877	1	a	What a blast to play with friends. Some minor annoyances allong the way but for &lt;1$ I reccomend this to any and all people
3549	0	a	DO not play this game. It's not worth the bandwidth to download. Uninventive, ugly as hell, stiff, 99cents would still be a rip off
2804	1	a	Fun, bought it on sale, easy to pick up and get right into it after a bit. Worth full price IMO
984	1	a	I was first hesitant about getting this game, but now, I cannot remember playing a single player game I enjoy more. I got it on sale, and decided to try it out. I had the DLC, so the start went reasonably well, but it could be a bit slow without it.   I would recommend this game if you enjoy RPG games in general, or just want to try something new. Pretty nice graphics, amazing combat interactivity among other RPG games, and a great storyline (If you're that type of person) which is kind of confusing at first, but then is grasped later on.  Overall, simply a great game.
4822	1	a	Best game I have ever played in my entire life. My single life goal is to become a dinosaur and attack furturistic humans that have outdated weapons and jetpacks that last almost 5 seconds.
557	1	a	Prettier, more fluent, and less tedious than Skyrim.
58	1	a	Take a bit of Nordic and Old English myths, add in some poker, and throw in a dash of epic. Well worth checking out...
334	1	a	Great game, worth every penny sad that it never got the attention it deserves
5287	1	a	It's cheap, runs smoothly, has servers running, some always populated, can play alone with bots to learn the game, LOTS of game modes, looks pretty awesome, sounds are good to okay, BIG maps, everything is customizable, has full X360 for Windows pad support, you can remap all controls on mouse+KB, or controller, did I meantion it's cheap??? A very under-rated game IMO, if more people played it, it could become popular, these guys did a good job with this game, My only gripe is 'some of the dinos are SO tiny/hard to shoot, but mele works okay on them (maybe they're baby dinos)'... everything else about this game save a few sound effects is awesome!
1009	1	a	Super pretty, super fun, and really dynamic. The story is really interesting and immersive. There's a ton of things to do too. One of the best story-driven RPGs to make my favorite list.
449	1	a	Really fun and dynamic game, though might be a bit too easy unless you play on hard mode. Would be nice if we can have companions like a wolf or such.
1563	1	a	I was excited about this game when I first heard about it coming out and I was just plain ready for a fresh and new RPG game I could put many hours into...and let me tell you this is deffinately the game. From the huge open world to the vast variety of weapons you can find/make this game offers so many quests and tasks to do to keep you occupied for hours.
431	1	a	I would heartily recommend this game for anyone who enjoys RPGs and high fantasy games without too many ttropes that have been trod upon one too many times.  At first I thought it was going to be like Skyrim, only less engaging and more cartoony. It is indeed more cartoony, but if you like helping people out, or are a student of Fae lore, then I think you'll find this game quite engaging. True, I've put about half the time into it as I've put into Skyrim (and I don't have the DLC for this game), but I ended up enjoying the hell out of myself anyway.  There's lots of memorable characters; the voice acting is really well done by a proliferation of actors; and at almost all times you'll feel as if you're really in a magical world. I thought that part was really well done.  And to top it all off, it ran really well on my mid-spec machine.
3199	1	a	Simply the best survival game I've played combat is great and the visual effects are great ! Could add some more weapons and some smother maps to maneuver on that would be more grassy or have more trees in them giving that prehistoric feel ! Playing with friends is easy and great fun... This game deserves a 10/10 from me !
4102	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde is a dinosaur survival game. If youve ever played nazi zombies or extintion then this is like it. You have a certain ammount of dinos to kill each round. Overall a fun game worth playing. 
2200	1	a	Imagine if Disciples 3 never existed and instead Disciples II was actually remade into a next gen game. While the base D3 was somewhat iffy, Reincarnation is an awesome game all around. This was achieved by retooling and improving almost every single aspect of the original game.  Pros: + four vastly different factions with their own strengths and weakness + multiple upgrade paths for units allowing for flexibility + very long (we're talking 40+ hours each) campaigns + the gorgeous art style, graphics and awesome music  Cons: - some rough edges like one or two mismatched voices
1635	1	a	This game is easily one of my favorites. The combat is astounding. When you're wailing on an enemy and you time that dodge or block just right, you feel like you are a fighting god. The whole game, from the atmosphere to the conversations, it has that feel of the original Fable minus the marrage system.  If you like the action styles of Darksiders, but with actual story not blocked buggy puzzles then check this game out.  Download the demo if you're not sure and give it a shot.
6309	1	a	It's a pretty broken game but it's fun to play with with friends
5112	0	a	Frame are complete â¥â¥â¥, and it's not because of my PC. Worst optimized game of all time, uninstalled
1949	1	a	If you're looking for a neverending RPG game then you guys should try this.  Choose who you wanna be, define your own destiny, and customize your own character with a tons of equipment, use every abilities you've earned to kill many thuatas on your journey. This game is totally one of many games that'll make you won't leave your PC!
244	1	a	Underated RPG Gem. Its a shame we may never get a fallow up to it. Fast action, fun qwests, and looks good too (sans the bad face's on the NPC that is). Don't pass this game up again!
2002	1	a	A pretty good rpg game with dynamic combats, a bit repetitive about the npc's but not even close to obscure the good points of this title.
66	1	a	if you love poker, you'll love this game!!!
1478	1	a	Much fun, very combat, wow.
1481	1	a	Well, Kingdoms of Amalur. Great game, great fun.  First of all, this game is huge. I've already spent like 27 hours, and I'm not even close to reaching halfway. There's always something to do, some generic quests, some different.   I truly enjoyed the art style in the game so far, giving me a shiny world, dark dungeons or maybe an outburned village. Nothing out of the ordinairy graphics wise, but still fine looking.  Combat is fun, it's easy though. If you don't put any limitations on yourself you will just rush through it. The last time I died was in a boss battle I was underleveld and equiped for. But combat is quick, and has a good amount of different options to it.  A giant plus is the story, it is understandable, has some different sides to it. And from the point on which I'm right now, it seems to become quite the adventure.  Last thing, it's overly generic. EAesque. Nothing really new, but still fun. I really enjoy playing this game, so give it a go. If you are looking for something groundbreaking, start browsing the indie section.
3286	1	a	If you seek a game full of fun and none stop dino hordes then this is your game, ORION: Dino Horde is a great dino survival, it has many gamemodes which are multiplayer and contains fun weapons and viechels. It is an easy game to get into and can be good for tornaments and other activities.
2362	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a FPS where you (primarily) defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10  Gameplay 6/10 I've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you. One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.  Graphics: 5/10 Looks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -&gt; horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.  Music/Sound: 4/10 I have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast. Sound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.  Performance: 4/10 The game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.
2341	1	a	Ok so this is the best co-op game ever made. (Yes, even better than Killing Floor.)  Why? It has what everyone wants in a FPS co-op; that being boiled down to one word 'FUN'.  This game is pure awesome entertainment. With an easy learning curve and lots of different playing modes. Your co-op team never rage, bully or quit. Everyone is having too much 'fun' for bad feelings to arise.  There is so much you can do, there are three soldier proffesions or in the game 'Rampage' you can be a dinosaur and eat other players! Then there is duel matches, king of the hill and much much more.  There are also a good array of vehicles to run over or shoot dinosaurs with, as well as many weapons and heaps of augmentations and upgrades.  I am completely addicted to this game. :)
4944	1	a	bought it for cards. played it and its fun enough to play for a bit
2019	1	a	Amazing game, if I do say so myself. I rather like a lot of features this game has, a few of them being the voice acting, as well as the 'add to junk' and 'sell all from junk' features, which really makes dealing w/ spare and unused items quicker and easier.   As far as the plot goes, I think it has a really great story line; love some of the plot twists, as well as the lore. When playing the game, I almost want to reccommend doing the whole story before doing any of the faction/other quests, but that's just me. I was glad I only did the story quests first because even after I finished the game, I had more game to play! So glad It didn't have to end there.   I highly reccommend Kingdoms of Amalur, it really is an underappreciated game. Once I picked the controller up, the hours just flew right by because I had such a hard time putting the controller back down, haha
3442	1	a	I could say a lot about this game being pretty standard shooter - but I have had some much fun playing this game. Shooting dinosaurs - levelling up and jumping around the map - this game is silly, surreal but fun.
5532	0	a	This is just my less-than-a-hour look at this and I must say it is no where ready for being released. It seems that this was rushed to be released without anywhere near a finished product. With no guidance or help, I started a game and became completely lost as to what I was to do next. After wondering around for a bit I stumbled on what seemed to be the right combo to get things going. Next thing I knew, after about 3 or 4 waves of creatures, I ended up in a LARGE wave with at least two T-Rex (boss) level creatures. And lots of other sized creatures. The game is confusing and slipshod... At least all of this is just my opinion after playing less than an hour. I think if they gave this more time then maybe it would be worth playing...
3366	1	a	bought a 4-pack for $0.99 and i've played alot more than i expected. it does need work but overall a fun game.
3571	1	a	this is a good game. great to play with friends
143	1	a	This game here is a double-edged sword really.   On one hand, you have: - Some absolutely insane and breathtaking scenery - Great art style, creature designs and a lot of eye-candy - Fun and dynamic combat - Very in-depth lore - Rich character building - Non-linear(ish), massive open world with fast travel  But then on the other hand, there are some pretty annoying cons, such as: - Next to no memorable characters, and if there are any, they are hardly likable - Terrible dialogue, talking to NPC becomes a chore you'd want to avoid - Limited character creator with presets instead of sliders, chances are you'll be running into twins throughout the game - Some skills like lockpicking are utterly useless - No enemy level scaling  Last thing to mention, game has quite a fairytale vibe to it, though it's still much darker than, say, Fable. It's a game that you'll either like or you won't. The game is nevertheless very much worth purchasing if you're fond of DA, Fable, Divinity, GW2, and alike.
1921	1	a	PROS -Massive amount of content. -Beautiful world. -Fun crafting system. -Smooth, satisfying combat. -Extreme flexibility with classes and skills, including the ability to rewrite your entire build at any point in the entire game.  CONS -I leveled way too fast. I know I could have upped the difficulty to balance the effect of that on combat, but I spent far too much of the game wishing I had more improvements to make to my equipment. It capped out too early. -Repetitive monsters, you fight the same 15 things throughout the entire game. -Monotonous voice acting - everyone sounds the same, especially the Fae. -Never developed any kind of emotional attachment to my character, or any of the characters in the world around me, to the point of having little symathy for those who died. That's very rare for me. -Very linear.   It's certainly worth the buy, especially on sale, but in the end it was not a riveting, lifechanging game. Just fun for a long time. I'd buy it again!
5701	0	a	This game is honestly crap, the graphics suck, and so does the performance.
5416	0	a	Unstable game, Crashes none stop and its not my PC.  Grphics engine has major issues.   It has great potential but it keeps crashing and its unplayable.    
5427	0	a	It's a mediocre dinosaur shooter. The gameplay is not very compeling and the graphics are sub par.
3040	1	a	This is the most fun you can have for $1.
2539	1	a	When I bought this game i got to blaze it everyday with a T-rex. T-REX IS LOVE! T-REX IS LIFE! 10/10
3307	1	a	For the price yes. Even though I didn't buy it... I did try it out and it was pretty fun. Bunch of kids, screaming: 'I'm going to eat your dinosaur â¥â¥â¥!' made me laugh...  Any way... Did you know, customize charaters requires you to pay real money? It makes me think of Destiny... DLC after DLC after DLC = $ It not a bad game. For a old computer. My gaming computer seeks for something else though. Thanks for the trial though.
3960	0	a	This game gave me AIDs and that means alot because i got it for $1 
4289	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
4349	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
5856	0	a	Changes name of game repeatedly to hide negative reviews. Steals assets. Fires dev team before game release. Nice.   Maybe he'll rename the game again to hide all these negative reviews too.
1070	1	a	i finished the first part of the game 'well of souls' after defeating the rock troll my next quest was to escape, by exiting the the door with a giant arrow, ive tried everything and the door will not open! im just stuck in the areas of the dead troll?!
4646	1	a	Nice one :)
2859	1	a	This Game is bad but it makes fun with friends because you can trickshot dinosaurs! 10/10 :D
5572	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Want to shoot one? want to run tiny ones over with a car? this is the game for you. if you come in expecting nothing this is a great game. you kill dinos, you get money you get bigger gun to kill bigger dino's. good little shoot em up highly recomended.
993	1	a	Plenty of content, plenty of good, gritty fun.
6416	1	a	Jetpack class runs out of fuel. I plummet to my death. 10/10 Would Die Again.
3717	1	a	I'm shooting giant crocodiles with tanks, buy it now it's on sale.
2443	1	a	A First Person Shooter. Check! Multiplayer? Check! Upgradable Weaponry? Check! Stealth Camouflage? Check! Jetpacks? Check! Tanks, Mech-warriors and other Military Grade Equipment? Check! Oh, yes... Dinosaurs, hungry for your blood? Check!  I have not had such a lot of fun in ages. Mutiplay with friends in Co-op is awesome. You should get it just for that. 
5005	1	a	Sure, pick it up for a buck. It's broken, buggy, surface-functionable, and someohw the only game with a decent damn flamethrower, but it's HILARIOUS to start up a survival game with max $ and max dinos. It's like playing superman with no moral restrictions!
5437	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
4220	1	a	Shooting Dino's and â¥â¥â¥â¥. Hell why not.
2668	1	a	This game is amazing, better than CoD and battlefield combined and the perfect blend of action and ridiculousness! I don't see why this doesn't get more publicity 
637	1	a	This game had me hooked in 5 minutes! I love the story and the lore surrounding it. It helps make a more cohesive story. All in all a great game that deserves way more credit, 9/10, you should buy it.
5732	0	a	very laggy even i use the recommended system
6385	1	a	I really love this game :) good game to play with your friends or people online :) little hard to do by yourself but still fun nontheless :) Can't wait to level up more on my Assault character!!
5586	1	a	Isn't tf2
4263	0	a	...
3514	0	a	it is nothing like Jurassic Park
438	1	a	This is a really good game with many story lines to follow. And depending which path you choose to take it will always lead to you completing the game I have spent many more hours than quoted on my steam account since I have the game also on other formats due to enjoying it very much well worth its full price. I do believe the DLC well worth buying also since it opens up many more hours of game play and interesting plots to follow. The one thing I do say to look up the alchemy and other crafts for recipes needed throughout the game. It is an easy game to complete if you are a seasoned gamer but still has enough to keep you interested for many hours. I hope you get all the enjoyment I have had whilst playing. It is also one of those games where you can play through and after several months later play again and still finds things you missed before. I have made many characters and enjoyed each one. The only bad point is your toon does not actually use her voice even in cut scenes which is a little annoying but that is like most RPG's
207	1	a	Had to get used to the camera angle and interface at first, but now that's no longer in the way I'm loving this game more and more.   Good: - Great main story  - lots of interesting side quests - good voice acting on every npc you meet - lots of crafting options. armor, weapons, potions, gems.  - plenty of loot, lots of different weapon types - great combat system for melee, very interactive with lots of combo moves - lots of skills and abilities. the skills remind me of Dragon Age with the persuasion, lockpicking, herblore and such. the abilities are much like vanilla wow's 3 tabs skill trees. great replayablity  - huge world to explore  Bad: - sometimes enemies cheat when you try to dodge and hit you anyway - character creation/customization options are a bit limited - ranged combat felt a bit weak/wrong to me. Not so much damage, I didn't focus on ranged to know how well the damage scales, but the auto targeting, the sound, the bow drawing, it just didn't feel right. - no camera zoom afaik, I wish I was able to zoom out more.  I'm glad I finally picked up this game.  I highly recommend trying it out if you are into action rpg's or rpg's in general really.
2449	1	a	Even though many people says that it's bad, I had alot oof fun with it. I recomend playing with friends for maximum fun.
4127	1	a	A game so bad that it's so good.
3987	1	a	I enjoyed this game, Gets really hard after 5-6 waves or so, If you enjoy a challenge this MIGHT be the game for you. 6/10
5511	0	a	Ok, so ive had this game when it was first released as Orion: Dino Beatdown. The game then was not good. The game now is alright but still in no way good. It has been through multiple scandals and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t involving theft of other ips work and assests. Skins from Primal Carnage, taking the original despender from Natural Selection 2 and then â¥â¥â¥â¥ing the devs of NS2 over etc. Theres just been a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t with this company which renamed itself and this game. It isnt good, yes its a dollar but tbh its better off using that dollar to go buy a Mc Chicken from Mcdonalds or something.  The servers are laggy and the game isnt optimized great. Oh and there are microtransactions in the game as well so theres that and if i recall there is a helmet that is basically Boba Fett from starwars....Oh and the new activision DMCA which is legit on Activisions part. The game once upon a time had promise but now its just not even worth the Dollar. I think when i originally got the game it was more than a dollar as well so â¥â¥â¥â¥ to that.  TL:DR dont waste money on a bad game or a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ company even if its just a dollar.
1001	1	a	Very engaging RPG game. Lots of side quests to complete. Open world awesomeness, together with really great combat system. How many hours of sleep do I owe this game...  Overall, though bits and pieces of mistakes, it is a very incredible game, and a must-play game for all RPG-lovers.  9.5/10
3099	1	a	It's mindless fun. The game takes itself more seriously than it actually is and tries to be over-the-top awesome which is quite hilarious. :D  The developer's good 'track record' makes me very optimistic about the game's future because they turned a complete wreck (Dino Beatdown) into a decent game and promise to refine it in the future, not very typical of todays small - and big - developers.  It is worth the original 10,99E in my opinion while for others it may not, but if it's on sale be sure to give it a whirl.
6296	1	a	Pretty good
2744	1	a	bretty damn cool  I've always loved dinosaurs and really all the games about dinosaurs are pretty terrible, but this one isn't all too bad it certainly isn't a terrible game, infact it's has the potential to be fantastic, and it's almost there, but I feel like it's a little rushed  great to play with friends, and the dino vs humans mode is a blast with a lot of people  if you've played call of duty zombies, or ghost's extinction, it's very similar to that, and all the same fun
1611	1	a	Don't believe all the negative publicity this game got. Unfortunately, it was released around the same time as Skyrim which overshadowed every fantasy RPG since launch. Fantastic game with great and unique combat system. Possible the best magic-user combat system of any game.
1831	1	a	If you like playing MMO's but actually hate interacting with other people then this is just the game for you!   Leveling, fetch-the-bearass quests and smash-a-button combat al packaged in a single player MMO game.
1440	1	a	A large, engrossing RPG world that features excellent combat, but eventually loses its luster because it becomes rather boring. You power up so significantly in this game (even more so with the armor DLC which I purchased) that it's just too easy to clobber everything in your path. Professions are an optional part of the game, but I just blaze on through with the found gear. Best absorbed in small doses.  7/10 Would purchase again (maybe not the armor DLC though)
2861	1	a	I hit a dead T-rex with a vehicle, t-rex flew into the air. 10/10
3852	0	a	Trash.
3415	1	a	As i exspected turok+halo+killing floor equal a game that does need to be redone but is still fun to play anway so im not surprised i tried it its fun.
4919	1	a	Much lag, is a hard game for the lag
846	1	a	Fun game, great combat, the story falls a little flat for my taste, nevertheless it's worth the buy. (Especially on sale!)
6200	1	a	Minecraft 2: Jurassic park edition is an absoulety faithful remake of the origianal Just Cause. This is one of my absoulute favourite game and it is defininately worth 10$
213	1	a	So at first i wasnt so sure if i was gonna like the game or not but the prize was only 4.99â¬ so i decided to buy it and i think i played about an hour or so and i loved it. I also instantly bought the DLCs aswell couse i know im gonna continue play this game.  The overall feeling of the game is great, the combat feels amazing and also the story seems really interesting so far.  So if you are a fan of RPG games and are considering buying this game you should go for it couse its one of the best RPG games i have played by far!!
5419	1	a	one of must have games...
3347	1	a	Defiently a way to say â¥â¥â¥â¥ the ecosystem. Had fun making the dinosaurs go extinct.
2377	1	a	Game is a lot of fun. Many of the modes require exercising precise teamwork. Updates have eliminated a lot of the bugs. The metacritic score does not do the game justice at all.
5166	1	a	Rammed my friends tractor with a tank. Plenty of laughs for 1â¬.
6054	1	a	This game is great. it like a cheaper call of duty, it was many of the same features and its easy to set up a server with friends
6194	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a cheap and fun indie game. If you like horde mode games, then you'll love this one. Stand off with up to 4 team mates against ever increasing hordes of dinosaurs and boss dinosaurs. Upgrade your weapons/abilities as the rounds progress. It's a fun little time waster and great with friends!
3983	1	a	To be honest, when I first purchased this game in 2012, I didn't enjoy it. It seemed poorly optimized and a little too hectic. I chalked it up as a dollar lost and let it gather dust.   I came back to it in a 'what the hell, I've got nothing better to do' mood the other day, and holy cow, was it a world of difference in perspective. Everything was fluid, the gameplay was solid and intuitive, and everything ran without a hitch. Within minutes of joining the lobby I was cruising around manning a gun on the back of a jeep, blowing up tyrannosaurs with a rocket launcher, and mowing down hordes of raptors and compys with a laser sword. And I was having a blast doing it. Honestly, this seems a testament to an early access indie developer that cares about the feedback of the community. I probably wont log any more hours on prelude, as I just purchased Project and look forward to playing it.  
5473	0	a	broken, and unfinished feeling, i really dont reccommend this game
1272	1	a	I'm downvoting so more people would read it: -Wait for the 75%-90% discount; it happened before and it will happen again -It's a GREAT RPG with complex story and dynamic gameplay -Worth full price, but if you can wait you won't be dissapointed -If you're not sure, they have a Demo  Edit: My soul won't let me downvote it.
4885	1	a	It is the best story game i have ever seen . Play and you wont cry!!
4453	1	a	IT GOOOD GAME PLS BUY DO IT 200$ PLS OR I KILL YOU MY TIGGA
257	1	a	Underated asffff
5679	0	a	GIVE ME MY FREINDS MONEY BACK!! He sucks at the game.
3452	1	a	Good indie Sci-Fi shooter! Kill all these Dinosaur hordes!
2004	1	a	A decent attempt at creating an RPG similar to Skyrim but comes off with a feel of being a failed RPG. There is no feeling in any of the characters, everything feels a bit stale in general and overly large for little reason. The combat is ok but varies wildly between too hard if you don't cheese and very easy if you do. So essentially an RPG for if you're desperate but really just go replay Skyrim. Trust me.
1756	1	a	This is going to be named 'Best RPG of the Year' hands down.  Fantastic story, in-depth customization, and a gruesomely awesome combat system all packed into one amazing franchise. Seriously, if you thought Skyrim was good, then you have no idea what you are missing!  Only thing this game needs is co-op features and modding support, and it will be MORE than perfect.
1089	1	a	Not sure how I missed it all this time. This game is great so far.
5461	1	a	Very Cheap and Fun.... for a few hours.
1494	1	a	R. A. Salvatore created the game universe and it is a BIG. HUGE. GAME. Todd McFarlane stepping in to design and direct the incredible artwork throughout. All the gameplay is driven off of those 2 efforts and it bests Skyrim and Witcher in many ways, in my opinion.  The only single negative I have is the inability (with a regular keyboard and mouse) to easily switch-to and fire your magical abilities...(you have to tap the ability mapped number key and then right-mouse click - 2 hands, so firing off 3 magic abilities requires 6 strokes) But no problems with other methods of combat. If you have a macro-capable RPG controller like a Logitech G13 or programmable keyboard method with software, than it's fine.
4782	1	a	-1/10 Worst game ever. Not even worth 99p
3989	1	a	Let's not be roundabout. This game is fun.   Killing Floor + Halo + Jurassic Park = WORTH
3554	0	a	For a game I have played for less than an hour, ORION: Dino Horde left a lasting expression on me. Not the kind of lasting expression that leaves a pleasent taste in your mouth, like tasting Auntie Anne's fresh home-brewed strawberry lemonade, more like the the type of expression that horribly scarrs you for the rest of your life.  I bought this game for a very steep price, like, dirt dirt cheap. I could have bought gum instead of this game, if that puts in perspective. This game, unlike gum, did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I'm pretty sure a piece of Trident layers would have lasted me longer than this game.  Upon launching, I was greeted with a nearly 780 FPS loading screen, which subsequently dropped to an FPS of about 20. I can run solitaire at a good 25 FPS, so this game had no excuse. When entering the very first game ever with one of my friends who I talked into buying this game, promising him we can shoot dinosaurs in the face until the early morning. He called me a nerd, and he was right. I was a nerd who was sucked into this game under promises of shooting dinosaurs and having fun.   My hopes were smashed, and upon dying to a lag-spiked Triceratops who appeared to be doing the thriller, I called the game 'bad.' My friend also agreed, telling me I sucked quite an exorbant amount of male genitalia for making him buy this game. Alas, he was true. I do suck.  Not as much as this game though.  
5992	1	a	Great online fps game, highly recommend, fun as hell played it all night!
5669	0	a	Devs should've stopped 3 years ago. They were right, this game was terrible. Not worth $0.50.
3722	0	a	THIS is a paid game..? Even for 99 cents, ist a waste money...
4851	1	a	Escaped by holding ctrl. 10/10
2895	1	a	Dinosaurs. Do I need to go on?
4315	1	a	Bearing in mind the price of this game, it's pretty okay!!
3490	1	a	Fun, tough, and addicting. Going into the survival mode solo is plain suicide, but it's very fun just to see how far you can make it. The plethora of Steam Achievements is wonderful, and if you are big on trying to 100% games, then you will have your hands full with this, in a good way. At the end of the day, gaming should be a fun, enjoyable time, and that is exactly what this promises and delivers. Walrus Approved.
2695	1	a	10x better then 'Call of Duty' :P
168	1	a	I have always loved this game, I love the variety of weapons that can be used, I love the art and i love the combat style especially with staff, the areas are pretty too. It's great for an old game, but the cons for me are the quests, there are just so many and sometimes it feels like 'blah blah blah' a lot of the way through you just want to hurry them up and get them out of the way, that aside.. for me it's still worth playing.
2811	1	a	I paid less than 75 American cents ($0.74) for this game today. And me and my friends just got over 3 hours of some of the most fun gameplay we've had in years.  At first, I thought, 'Hey, this movement is clunky', and then I remembered that this wasn't a $60.00 Battlefield X title. But it wasn't any worse than any FPS I grew up with like Wolfenstein, Half-Life, and... um... other stuff.  5 minutes in, all bets are off, and you're loving killing dinosaurs. 10 rounds of 'pull the trigger and shoot' and then you start to figure out an upgrade path for your weapons and skills. It's about 30 minutes of confusion, and then it clicks, and this game is fun as all get out.   The visuals are amazing. The levels are huge. The weapon selection is vast. The vehicles are ridiculous. Yes, vehicles. Not on-rails. Free vehicles like Battlefield.  Case in point: by the last two sessions tonight, the final map is an all-out dino rampage. Two of our three players figured out how to fly the gunships, keep them in the air, while providing air cover for a tank driving back to base. The slow moving tank was getting swarmed, and the gunships were raining missles down on the dinos attacking the tank. Meanwhile, the gunships were getting swarmed my pterydactyls. They had ground-cover from the bots though.   Seriously. It's not earth-shattering physics or revolutionary gameplay. But it's some of the most fun you can have goofing around with friends. It's an AMAZING game.  The maps are beautiful and huge. The layouts are really smartly done, And the progression for each level is smart too.  I wish there was a way to make the progress from levels 1-&gt;10 carry over to session 11-&gt;20, but you quickly realize that it's a 10-match world, and you scale appropriately. When the next round comes up, you start with nothing, but you're a little smarter. And you WILL play the next round, because its fun as hell.  Buy this. Buy the 4-pack and hand it out to people on your friends list.   I love this game at under a buck, but I'd have no probalem dropping $20 for this one.
5976	0	a	It feels like its missing a reason to play/continue playing other than to see how broken it feels.
2760	1	a	This game is highly innovative, interesting, and highly original.  I enjoyed it, and is definately worth cheching out.
966	1	a	TL:DR, I gave this game a 7.5/10, it feels like Darksiders 2, WoW, TERA and Torchlight 2 had sex. Minus mounts (as far as my knowledge goes) and Jumping.  The game, to me isn't very immersive but addicting, sometiems it feels like one of those games that you need to force yourself to play, like Dota 2, it's not interesting you untill you force yourself to play it.  The game feels like it began as a third-person dungeon crawler RPG similar to Torchlight II turned MMO then reduced to a sandbox RPG that leaves the Dungeon Crawler and MMO elements.  The controls + camera movement gets disorientating sometimes, it's very 'woah duuude' if you haven't touched it in a while but it's easy to get use to it.  It's also very easy to get lost doing quests, the main quest and faction quests branch off all over the place leading you to more similar quests and it's easy to get lost in all of these quests, I haven't played long enough to see how rewarding faction quests are, I only have roughly 6 hours on record (I have about 4-5 or so hours in offline mode).  The skill tree system I find is a bit weird and hasn't got alot of variety but it's still good nonetheless.  The video options are a bit limited, I can't find anythign regarding resolutiuon settings so some menus stretch off screen but are still workable.  At the moment there's not a whole lot of armour variety regarding plate armour for brawlers, though i haven't progressed far, Not sure about the other classes though.  The stealth system, I haven't really explored it but from what I know it feels and seems like it's fairly decent, I never really did stealth outside the tutorial level unless I was stealing from chests.  Regarding some other things, the game world is VERY large, it reminds me of World of Warcraft but.. a little larger, a better example of this is, if you've played Darksiders, specifically Darksiders 2 you'd understand what I mean by how open the game is, by this I mean that it takes a fair while to get from place to place and I'm not sure if there's a mount system or not.   With leveling it's kind of? slow but not at the same time, my first 5 levels it felt liek I shoul've been a higher level because of all the crap I did before hand, yeah you can do ALOT between levels so sometimes it feels like you should be a higher level.   Another example of this is, some games, like, you don't normally find yourself killing giant trolls, ettins or whatever like the ones in this game till you're a higher level and it feels so rewarding yet it feels like you shouldn't be killing them in such large numbers. I'm a long term World of Warcraft user and a user of TERA, so, this will sound weird, this next part is a little hard to explain, In the likes of WoW or TERA most of these 'giants', when you kill them in numbers like you do in this game, in other MMO's or RPG's i've played they're usually scaled smaller then the others or placed in very thin numbers, I don't know this is what I mean by it feeling like it was made as an MMORPG then made singleplayer, the game is very unique and strange if you're like me and are use to games like WoW or TERA, A better example would be Darksiders 2 minus the mount and colossal gods, yeah that sounds like a better mechanic example mixed with TERA and WoW.  if you must know, I refer to games like TERA or WoW because of how 'loose' the game looks and feels and the artistic style is similar, it just isn't right to compare it to the likes of Skyrim because Skyrim is a fairly solid feeling game and is impossible to think of WoW while playing Skyrim unlike this particular game.  Another thing I will mention, it feels weird seeing an RPG with this artistic design style that uses Ragdol physics, imagine World of Warcraft with Ragdoll physics... yeah lol.. but it's still good, it's great that made the larger ragdolls interactible as well, like you can push Ettin and troll corpses around, another thing to not, the ragdoll physaics is hilarious sometimes when an NPC has a death animation then snaps to ragdoll, sometimes the ragdolls just freak out.  I can go on longer but the rest is just fiddly stuff, overall I give this game a 7.5/10, If you like open world RPG's similar to WoW, TERA and as open as the likes of Darksiders, I'd recomend you get this game.
5294	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
131	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is something of a mixed bag. The combat system is fluid and fun, and Amalur itself can be gorgeous looking (with a little post-processing such as SweetFX). Unfortunately, the story, characters, and crafting mechanic is somewhat generic. I found myself losing steam two thirds of the way through the main quest. I am glad I finished the game, but I donât see any compelling reason to return to finish the side quests.
4447	1	a	These are the type of developers I support. They admited their mistakes, they started working on it and updated it for 3 years. They deliverd a stable game--for only 1 euro. This is Worth A Buy, even when you're not into this type of game, I advise you to buy it. We needs these type of developers on Steam or we will pay the price eventually.  
5435	0	a	Its Free WTF and i and have my money back :/ this steam  
735	1	a	Go to  https://www.widescreenfixer.org/  and download this. The FOV in game is horrendous.  - Papa Bless
5940	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
106	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning  I have previously played a fair amount of this on Xbox, I am pleased to confirm this is not a bad port for the PC but would be better using a controller. Overall it's good enough, and shouldn't be over-looked beacuse of the native console settings.  This game deserves the attention of any &amp; all RPG fans, especially those who enjoy well versed fan-fiction &amp; character art. The experience throughout the game delivers those elements not only consistently, but excellently; as well as any other Iâve played that never removed the presence of inquisition and curiosity. Delving dungeons, collecting loot â slaying mobs &amp; basking shamelessly in NPC related debauchery. KoA:R strikes each node of the gameâs fabric as a finely hit note under a bardâs fingers.   KoA:R was unfortunately somewhat of a casualty, only in the sense that it did not rise above some other unnamed releases at the same time of its own decent onto the shelves. That said, those who have played the game will no doubt recommend it faster than they would other titles played in the same genre. There is a wealth of lore, items &amp; art in the game that is unmeasurable against some of those other games you may list out next to KoA. The type that comes from the most experienced &amp; creativity proficient in the business â combining the talents of R.A Salvatore (One of my most influential and favourite authors) &amp; Todd McFarlane (needs no introduction) the story and the world that holds it has been extruded into an exquisite universe contained onto this game. Game developers usually spend decades writing &amp; elevating this amount of content and lore into a functioning, well balanced &amp; infinitely fun game. There are few areas where KoA flounders; fortunately, these areas do not impact so far as to deter the player away at any time. The inventory system  There are 3 schools of fighting that your hero can choose to be disciplined in; Might, Finesse &amp; Sorcery â you are not bound to any one skill line at any time, but may want to be more heavily balanced towards one for equipment requirements. That said, a mix of 2 or even all 3 really makes the combat new and doesnât go stale from using the same abilities and slaying enemies in a linear, uniform pattern. Each tree will grant you 3 points per level to spend freely in either tree. Thereâs even a respec feature in the game where you can âre-writeâ your fate and change your play style if you grow bored or have a change of heart with your skill.  The campaign offers 10-12 hours of gameplay if youâre strictly ignoring the heaps of side-quests. Add those and DLC, there is well over 100+ hours for you to get your ample fill. Some parts become tedious as there is no great way to get around the massive map so playing systematically, almost like an MMO can wear you down as the player or give you a real grind element to the game. This will sate an itch for a lot of gamers but create black holes for others and can alter the players overall experience. On sale, this game is a steal given it has more content than many new AAA titles and belongs in a lot of gamerâs library with all the features &amp; replay-ability.  7.5/10 
5573	0	a	A good Idea with the Carnivores-meets-CoD concept (anybody old enough to rememeber WizardWorks' hunting games?); but it's just too buggy and unstable. It kept CTD'ing and the interface is also a little irritating. I deleted it litterally minutes after I DL'd it. Even though it is only US $.99 I'm glad I caught it on free weekend. Even 99 cents would feel like a sickening,terrible waste on such an unstable (and if you ask me, obsolescent looking) waste of 8 gb of storage.
448	1	a	Similar to The Witcher in combat. Not as epic in scope as Skyrim but highly recommended none the less.
3287	1	a	This game is sweet
1250	1	a	Graphics: colours are very beautiful, visual effects are vivid - they aren't that realistic but they have a nice style. Modelling of faces could have been done better, but it isn't that much of an issue. Weapons and armour designs are very nice, too.   Gameplay: It's fun. I played this after Dragon Age, and while it took some adjusting, I found it enjoyable. Also, there are SO MANY side quests.   Story: I mean, it isn't a masterpiece. Story isn't as good as the bigger games like Mass Effect or Bioshock or the MGS series, but it's not â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Overall/my comments: I'd give it 7/10 because I'm the kind of person who really enjoys an amazing story, and well the story wasn't that amazing (but good enough). I mean, you get to play as a dead person brought back to life. It's pretty cool. Usually when I play games, I'd have one that really requires more concentration and one that's just a little more casual. When I was playing this, I had Mass Effect as the 'concentrated' one and this was the more casual one. It does it's job as a video game, it's entertaining and it isn't at all boring.
820	0	a	Good: -Resonably good premise. -Interesting original Faction Storylines. -Unique Combat System.  Bad: -90% of enemies/zones/quest structures/character models are recycled. -ClichÃ© telling of previously-mentioned premise. -Boring repetetive sidequests have you forgetting what the main quest actually is. -No interesting/memorable characters.  Sophisticated Conclusion: It's sooooo boring :'(
2290	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and knocked me off the triceratops I was attempting to ride for an achievement 10/10.  But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was ninety-nine cents!
5395	0	a	Good mechanics and graphics for a 1 dollar game, but too unpolished and unplayable.
6259	1	a	Don't let the Metascore fool you. This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. Have you ever played a zombies base-defense type game but wanted dinosaurs instead of zombies? Look no further. The graphics are good-looking and easy to run, and you get to shoot dinos. And play as them. Just get it already.
1112	1	a	Great game !   For all of you that are thinking of buying this game, do it !  It reminds me quite alot of skyrim and fable !   Definetly worth checking out !
5030	1	a	First off, Metascore is way off. This game is very fun, very fast paced, and can be very challenging. Think Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs. They're fast, deadly, and they are relentless. Raptors, Compys, Tri-tops, T-rexes, as well as many others make an apperance, and that's just the horde survival mode. Level progession system gives you more tricks to keep you interested, while scailing dinos keeps you from plowing through unhindered. Believe me, when you've got a T-rex, stegosaur, and dinosuchus chasing your â¥â¥â¥ down, you'll wish it didn't. :P Highly recomended.
4142	1	a	play this!
5146	1	a	an combo of starwars, dirsic park, tf2 and lots of fun
1501	1	a	Fantastic and tons of content. I put in well over 100 hours and maybe did half the missions. Lots of build possibilities though the missions and baddies do get repetitive after a while. Well worth the money, especially if it's on sale.
1890	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a rather slow paced RPG with an open world just waiting foro a brave soul to explore it! Though the combat system is rather strange, in my opinion, there's alot of different things to do and to find in this game - and the DLCs are good, too!  I've spent quite some time playing this game and still haven't finished the main storyline yet as I am too busy exploring jsut about everything.  If you're a fan of open world RPGs in third person perspective, you definitely should give Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning a shot, I don't think that you'd be disappointed with it.
3441	1	a	Probably one of the best games i have ever played.
674	1	a	This is a very good game, with a lot of options. In fact, it's so big and deep that the game becomes overwhelming. It also gets repetitive very fast. Fighting enemies gets dull. You have a plethora of moves you can unlock as you level, but in the end, a short 3 hit combo, block hit and dodge are all you need to survive. Weapons like bows or two handed weapons become redundant once you can craft your own items with god tier gems. Daggers, with their speed are the only choice as all the enhancements are +X per hit, instead of scaled or % increases.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game and go back to it every so often. With an art design between Fable and WoW and a combat system reminiscent of Devil May Cry (minus the focus on strung out combos) it is incredibly fun for short bursts. The Combat is fun and takes a while to reach the repetitive droning that I stated earlier. There is a large variety of spells and skills, but weapons and armor are pretty much able to be maxed out just around halfway through the game.   Note if you want a challenge, top tier regen gems and life/mana leech gems on weapons should be avoided. The only downside here is the lack of variety for enemies. Most enemies are beefed up/palette swapped versions of enemies you encounter early on.   The world is huge, and the lore is pretty deep if you take the time to find it all. The Lorestones are impressive in their stories, and the bonuses they provide are generally useful. But there are TONS of Lorestones. Trying to find them all is tedious even after getting the upgrade that reveals EVERYTHING on the map. Which leads me to the last point: the Jack of all trades approach is not only good, but generally preferred in this game. The rewards at high levels in this game (where your classes are determined by which one you want to be and qualify for) are far above the high level rewards for any other classes, IMO.   This game is a good play, but due to some repetitive (if fun) combat and quests, it only gets a solid 7 of 10 from me. You should play it, especially if it's cheap. But don't get obsessed with 100% completion.
2853	1	a	This game is actually really cool, like I spent $1 on it like 'pfft whatever, can't really lose at that price' and it turned out to be remarkably fun. I'm not sure what this game did or what state it was in on release but it's certainly much better now, has a huge Planetside 2 feel to it on a smaller scale but with freaking dinosaurs!  Planetpart, Jurrasicside, take your pick.
4853	1	a	This is the best FPS I've played in a long time!
5121	1	a	dirt cheap for dirt gameplay
3645	1	a	Shoot dinos and hope for the best   9/11 i give
3313	1	a	I love the gameplay, but it's full of bugs, too bad there is only players servers, if there was a matchmaking this will be great
4214	0	a	Worth the dollar to laugh at how utterly terrible it was, but only barely.
4499	0	a	Characters run like they have sticks up their asses. Had no animation when firing weapons. No clue why dinosaurs are attacking energy generators. And I'm told this game has been greatly improved from what it originally was? Do yourself a favor and play something else.
1257	1	a	I think the best way to describe this game is that it is a single player MMO. This makes it sort of a mixed bag. The world is large and the story is epic, but the combat is simple and often dull. I often felt like my character didn't necessarily matter at certain points. I also lost interest towards the last 20% and did not complete the main story line. Overall I liked the game enough, it just failed to keep me all the way through. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a long and easy RPG experience.
3435	1	a	Punched a T-Rex to death.  11/10 would punch again.
303	1	a	This game really fullfilled my action RPG needs and it's got some great features. First of all, I got a bit shaken off by the camera system, but I got used to it. It's quite funny because this game kinda has to be compared to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, because they came out practically at the same time. I made a bit of a comparison with a friend where I called this one a 'little skyrim'.  That said, this game has some unique features, such as: +Fate meter/Reckoning Mode (special combat mode, like an overdrive) +Twists of Fate (bonus after certain key quests) +Destinies (passives according to character stat growth you made)  The game has some replay value since you can: +Do story and optional quests again giving different answers and check the other's reactions +Invest on Persuasion in order to see different reactions +Align yourself to good or evil in certain story quests where you're given the option to either kill an ancient being(or keep it imprisioned) or unleash him for his power  As for the game design itself, some pros and cons are: Pros: +You can do Stat resets anytime by visiting a Fateweaver and paying some game currency +Fast paced combat which rewards for diversity over repetition +Varied weapons, skills and playstyles to choose and re-choose from +Big meaningful sidequests for certain factions +Skippable DRM (the game asks for your e-mail, but if you don't input it, it carries on) +Investing on different abilities (lockpicking, blacksmithing, stealth, detect hidden,...) may unlock new dialogue options  Cons: -The main storyline boss fights are quite dull -Most of times your input doesn't matter for how the NPCs' general reaction unless it's from one of those unlockable options -Once you enter a map, monsters are designed to accomodate to the level you were when you entered, forever, meaning old areas become easy pretty fast if you're 'running errands' -Killing enemies while stealth doesn't alarm someone beside that guy, but killing a civilian in a city hidden in the attic brings all the cities' guards over, for some reason.  Overall verdict: It has got me playing for some time and got me interested in the story and some of it's features, but it didn't become memorable and some parts of it just seemed unpolished. Your interaction with the game's world is meaningful, but only to a certain extent.
3462	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with. Anyone that enjoys a good fps, whether it be pve or pvp should give this game a shot.
5021	1	a	Very good but too laggy for my pc and can't be played on my mac.Enjoy if you're not stopped like me.
4588	1	a	Honestly, I'm torn as to whether it's actually worth a dollar or not.  On one hand, it could be great fun if you've got a full group of friends to play with.  On the other... good god, the bugs, the pointlessness of an entire class (of only three!), the repetitiveness, and the fact that a god-awful player can screw you over on Conquest by stealing your vehicle...
714	1	a	The only reason I got this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ was because it was on sale.
3898	0	a	this game was better a year ago when it was alpha and barely ran. this is now terribad and in the span of an hour it crashed on me three times, i couldnt host a multiplayer game for anybody, let alone friends, and microtransactions. id rather watch The Kardashians than play this steaming dino poo pile
1884	1	a	I went into this game with no expectations; its been in my library for quite a while, now, and I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it. The customization and character progression that KoA:R offers is near unrivaled in the industry currently, constantly giving a feeling of excitement when you level up. Then comes the combat: imagine the combat system of a generic MMO. That is also KoA:R.   On top of that, the quest lines make WoW look imaginative: expect a lot of 'kill X many guys,' or 'go into this area, and interact with this object on the ground. Sweet, now come back.' When either the combat or questing becomes interesting, the other is there to pull it down, and back to mediocrity it goes. Until you level up. Then it becomes exciting, until you get your next quest.  If there was a neutral recommendation, this game would get it from me. Too many kinks to pull me in as mod-friendly games have, and the MMO questing is fantastic for putting yourself to sleep.   I recommend getting it during a great sale, just to see what Big Huge Games offered to levelling up, and crafting.  
5409	0	a	Even free it's not worth it.
5936	0	a	f this game it sucks so bad. this is not a 2016 game, the developers should go and â¥â¥â¥â¥in i duno.  but what i do know, is this game sucks. so that is my review i am 6 years old dont give me hate. im new to this thank you. im 6 years old. dont play this dumb stupid dumb dumb game it sucks and im 6 years old. i hate this stupid â¥â¥â¥ stupid dumb banana peel excuse for a game. i hate this game so much im 6. years young.
2181	1	a	Hidden gem of a game. Perhaps too cartoon like for lovers of realism. But if you liked fable you will probably like this.
840	1	a	This game has a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of content, many areas to explode, literally hundreds of quests that all take a while to complete and are fun, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great.
4653	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
1030	1	a	pretty cool game all around. definately worth playing.
6398	1	a	99cent for killing Dinos? Totaly worth it even if it was 4.99 it would still be worth it
927	1	a	good game, lots of things to do, would recommend
1041	1	a	Heaps of fun, game looks nice and combat system is easy to pick up
6199	1	a	its a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that steals counter strike's guns, and halo's vehicles. but I had fun with it.
3427	1	a	Saw this game for $1 so i bought it... 
489	1	a	  I had this game on on my wishlist and my good friend bought it for me. This game start out as a good adventure in a new fantasy world and I was really excited to finally get started playing it. The first 20 or so hours were really enjoyable trip of collecting quests, beating down some monsters, and reading all of the lore. I made a point of finishing every quest. Hour 20 - 40, I had had enough of killing the same monsters so I tended to run through dungeons and monsters just so I could finish quests as fast as possible but I was still finishing every quest. The last 20 hours I was done with the game, I skipped everything that was related to an achievement or the main story and just slammed it home.  Pros Story is really good Combat is pretty fun but there isn't a lot of variability. 5 or 6 moves per weapon.  Cons I played on hard and the game was really easy. You will fight the same enemies all game. A lot of quests and items of note in the game are complete rips off of other games but only done half way.
1823	1	a	Pros Highly addictive. Beautiful graphics and engaging story line. It has a ton of side quests so you'll never be at a lost for something to do. Easy leveling, so no need to grind. Diverse builds make you really feel that the character represents your fighting style. Questing is non-linear early on in game, thus increasing the replay value.  Cons Maps are not as big as they look. Once you clear an area, you feel little need to return until mid to late game if you're a completionist.  Dungeons are a bit repetative in appearance and structure. Think Mass Effect 1. I'm a jumper...there's no jump :(.  Fast travel is nice, but sometimes you wish you could just move faster on foot (no mounts so far...). Physical appearance of character is not as customized I would prefer. But hey, it's not an MMO and it's not the Sims.   8.5 of 10
4327	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
3847	1	a	This game is much beteer than it's predecessor.I love it.
5877	0	a	Asset stealing at it's finest
4934	1	a	Cool
3705	0	a	save your money...bad optimization, poor framerates, super laggy even with good internet connection.
6375	1	a	Perfect game to play with friends. Shoot at Dinosours, grenade them. Play with the settings for crazy games. You get a lot of game and fun for the price.
3350	1	a	Awesome game on replay value!
2049	0	a	When someone says 'Jump!' the response should be 'How high?' not 'Wheres the part that lets me jump?'
5577	0	a	AWFUL it's total crap, maybe in 1995 would had seemed interesting now is outdated awful crap.
2042	1	a	All in all this game was a highly entertaining RPG experience. The few flaws it has generally don't effect gameplay too much like the lockpicking being stupidly easy in every way.  Pros  - Game is fairly long. I spent many hours on this game losing track of time while running through quests   - Pretty textures. I was highly impressed with how everything looked  - The combat is nice and fluid with anything you want to pick as your main skills.  - Characters are fairly interesting for the most part  - All quests tie into the story  - Fight big monsters (I love fighting big monsters)  Cons  - Game is quite easy. I suggest playing it on hard  - Lockpicking is way too easy  - Enemies spawn back very fast  - No way to travel quickly without outright using fast travel but as enemies spawn back fast anyway you would really only need to run around for XP farming. Which, as the game is really, really easy, will probably just over level you anyway.  Overall, it is a good game to try out you will probably have a lot of fun with it if you like RPGs. I suggest grabbing it on sale it is definitely worth a play  
4593	0	a	This game was a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ when it first came out. They have came a very long way than what it use to be.  Give it a try but only think about how lame it is already.
45	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
49	1	a	Mix Magic: The Gathering with Poker and Solitaire, and you'd come up with something along the lines of Runespell: Overture. Awesome game.
5789	1	a	Great Game,Cheaper Than Minecraft ! (Premium Account) 10/10 Would Buy ! :)
2055	1	a	Enjoyed the heck out of this game ,best pick up on sale but well worth your time ,great story and combat
3317	1	a	Your game is the single worst â¥â¥â¥â¥en peice of trash i have ever seen in my entire life. â¥â¥â¥â¥ looks at ypur game and says gee that looks â¥â¥â¥â¥. I love it  8/8
6378	1	a	This game is extreemely fun. At the time of its writing it is 99 cents which I have no idea why. It is worth way more than that. Just buy it.
5133	1	a	Use to be free for a weekend costed 4.99 (or 0.99) then now Free to play...         NO MONEY WASTED! :D
5159	0	a	PLS, Make me a favor, and don t buy this game, it s a poor â¥â¥â¥â¥
580	1	a	Very addictive!  If you want an old-school RPG with tons of quests, crafting system, player-decision-based story, and quick-reaction combat, this game is recommended.
1962	1	a	I love this game. I beat it on my PS3 with over 100 hours in and when I saw it on sale this summer with all the DLC I grabbed it. Do not overlook this game, good solid gameplay with a great story (even though the bad guy is voiced by Jim Cummings the voice of Pooh/Tigger, you just can't take him seriously xD). Behind Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy series, this is my favorite game of all time. I can't recommend it enough.
4010	0	a	Shoot dinosaurs, get bored. Ai is terrible, some graphics belong back in doom or quake and the gameplay is bland. There is a ton of content but it all feels empty.
5398	0	a	One of the ''WORST CO-OP GAMES IN THE WORLD''
6372	1	a	It's like skyrim with Dinosaurs
3294	1	a	Easily one of the most fun co-op games you can play online with your friends. Ignore the meta rating score that must have been many patches ago the game seems to have improved massively. I would recommend this game to anyone. 8 out of 10 from me.
795	1	a	More cartoon then skyrim but entertaining
3596	1	a	Ever want to kill Dinosaurs?? but you never had the chance because they're dead? Well this is a game for you. All you do is just kill dinosaurs and run around doing small task and kill dinosaurs!  10/10
5157	1	a	Very fun game . PVP , PVE and shoot shoot and shoot :) Nice upgrades , nice weapons . I love it . And Nice Dino's :)
5106	0	a	Although it is much better then Dino Beatdown, it is a poor excuse for a game still.
802	1	a	9/10
5035	0	a	Barely playable.
835	0	a	Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then. Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK. Even at its highest difficulty, 'hard', this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against. So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways. But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.
33	1	a	Poker and magic mixed in one. Interesting concept but bad graphics.
2570	1	a	this game is so good. i have a great time using the battlefield 4 guns. the graphics are better then real life view. there is a few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ places like riding the T-Rex.  i enjoyed the most to replace the guns! once in a life time experience
4682	1	a	didn't know i had this game 10/10
1915	1	a	I just got 100% of the achievements in this game. I'll be completely honest, the game itself RHEALLY likes to drag itself on, and on, and on, and on. The story progresses about as fast as an MMO. Which is not too surprising seen as it was first developed as an MMO. Alledgedly ( and kinda jokingly ) the people developing KoA got scared when they saw the half digested corpse of many-a-many MMO's lying in front of the cavern called 'World of Warcraft'. As such The caracters are non memorable to me in the slightest, then again I had the same problem when I was playing Skyrim, so I am not sure how they could have done this well in the first place. Sadly, the main story is somewhat of a joke and you are actually off way better digesting or reading a good book.  Sadly, there is not much in the way of challenge either, you have to make your own challenge I am afraid ( while still keeping it within boundaries of 'achieveable' ( phun intended ) ) Play this game on the hardest difficulty, and whenever you think you are dying too much go invest in some new clothes and/or weapons. I went though almost the entire game in a yellow armour set I think I got from the warsworn campaign, mirrorknives with a lvl requirement of lvl 9, and a set of chakrams. That is, untill I ran up till one of the last bosses and found myself running back to a forge ( I have been hoarding weapon materials like a true hoarder ) made myself some better armour and a shield that could actually block his magic attacks. and... well I pretty much wasted him, also because on the way back I seemed to have picked up some allies which actively fought with me against this big â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a boss. ( did I mention that this boss kept sending waves upon waves of normal foes at me if I took away 15% of his health when I was soloing the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ? I did not have much of a hassle with those extra adds when I was not alone on the field, go figure )  'So, what was your reason to play this thing then ?' I wanted to see if I could, simple as that. I got the game a while back and I decided to go actually play something start to finish ( including achievements if possible ), I made a list, and asked a random number generator to tell me which game I should play.  Needless to say, I won :)  Do I recommend this game ? yes, with a big pulsing asterix. That is, if you can actually stand free to play games and do not mind that they do not have a true ending, I would go play that thing. ( I heard Wildstar will be free to play soon enough, I can recommend that I guess, but I am a sucker for space-themed-fantasy )
2476	0	a	How to play : Play for like 2 mins max and delete

5643	0	a	Do like Dinosaurs, Jet Packs, Mechs, Tanks, and all sorts of other cool accessories? You do? Well guess what? Orion has all of that! But Is it any fun? No, It's not fun at all. The idea of blasting down Dinosaurs with you're pals is a great idea, It really is. However, It's prestented poorly with this game.    GAMEPLAY
2691	1	a	Epic 11* out of 10 i played free week and now i am going to buy it recomend for sure 'It implants Halo, Primal Carnage, Zombies and other games in to one whole dino action packed epic game for only Â£11.99!'
2909	1	a	This game costs 80p A 500g tin of chopped tomatoes also costs 80p  This game has dinosaurs  Chopped tomatoes do not  Logic = Buy this game 10/10 - if this game were a tomato, it would be the best tomato  In all honesty it's hilarious and a load of fun with friends Absolutely priceless, best 80p ever spent

3588	1	a	This game is comically bad. Kind of fun for short bouts of mindless shooting but it will never be the Halo it so desperately desires to be.

5097	1	a	Cool game but I'm preety sure you need high graphic PC to play this game but it's really fun had fun shooting Dnosaurs and teaming up with people to kill and last a long time against fighting dinosaurs.
715	1	a	I got killed by a cow. 10/10
35	0	a	Eh, it's basically poker.  The only real variations are you can have 5 of a kind and there are magic abilities which you can use the better hands you make.  The plot is somewhat interesting but not really that original. You basically suffer from amnesia and you happen to be the chosen one to save everyone.  If you like poker... I recommend playing poker. If you like the fantasy aspect I recommend any number of other fantasy games. Even if you like both having 2 good games is better than having one mediocre one.
2771	1	a	just had a LAN party. This game was one of the funnest games we played!
2617	0	a	This game is not worth it. Honestly, it will not capture your attention for long. ORION: Dino Horde is just another FPS that was quickly slapped together.
3444	1	a	Never Ever Play Versus on this - no autobalance means that if you choose to be Dino there will be 10 marines aganst you - Just totally unfair  Cooperative Play works somehow will be hard to coordinate while in the dinos are attacking - ofcourse after the wave ends it will be slightly easier.  I would buy this while this is now on sale when this was written - until major fixes are made this is only Co-op Survival Game and not worth to pay full price  But always better than Space Empires V. Never buy that game... or even look at it.

3056	1	a	Just like battlefield with dinosaurs. 'It's okay 11/10' - IGN
5708	1	a	only play this game if you are using a razer com...
1296	1	a	Interesting progression system on top of hack-and-slash styled combat makes for a pretty great game overall. The story keeps your interest while not going too far outside the boundaries of your standard RPG. Overall a solid 8/10

3723	0	a	4/10 It has its moments..Rarely
5053	1	a	Its a cool game i would buy it even tho its $1 but really fun game to play with other players co-op game 
1829	1	a	Highly recommended! This game is a lot of fun to play, there is lots of things to do, the game world is enormous, and the combat is very fast. Put about 30 hours in so far and only finished half the main story lines (guessing) and only 2 of 5 faction quest lines. Story is very strong in this game, as it should be considering the writer. A must play if you love Elder Scrolls games and wished the combat was better.
1140	1	a	I am really enjoying this game. It kind of reminds me of an MMO but completely solo and reminds me of Fable too.
1426	1	a	This game is everything that the Fable series promised to be, and so much more.  The combat and character customization is varied enough to keep your attention, and even provides some replay value. The skill tree is immense and gives players the opportunity to try different approaches. Maybe you want to try out a sorcerer? Maybe stealth really is the way to go? Mix things up a bit and find out.  All of those skills and weapon options provide for some interesting combat. Some may say it's a little 'hack-and-slash' but what fantasy game isn't? Luckily, almost every weapon and skillset offers something different, and the game allows you to switch between two different weapons, allowing for a little variety in your combat.  The game itself is enormous. I've read that with some dedication you could beat the main story line fairly quickly, but there are easily hundreds of hours worth of sidequests to play with. Also, keep in mind, the exact same thing can be said about games like Morrowind, which someone can technically 'beat' in seven minutes.  All in all, I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for some good old fashion fantasy questing.
1714	1	a	Ermagerd I love le game! :D 15/10 Coming from x-Box to to PC. Still feels fantastic :D
5357	1	a	Liquidy purified AIDS condensed into a mess. Took me 20 minutes untill I was searching up how to permanently remove it from my steam library. SUCC/10 Willl never achieve THICCness.
5271	1	a	Surpringly fun. The menu is absolute balls and horrible, but the actual gameplay is fun. Be warned the game is very sensitive to ping. Anything over 100 starts getting a little annoying.
3708	0	a	Wouldn't recommend it but can be a fun distraction. Depending on what you like you can find some enjoyment out of it.
766	1	a	First off let me start off by stating that my hours played on Steam doesn't represent my hours played in KoA:R by a long shot. I played at least eighty or more hours on the Origins version back when the game first game out. KoA:R is one of my all time favorite games, also one of the biggest disappointments to me as well in a lot of ways because I had such high hopes on the IP reallly going places and it's offspring becoming a contendter for WoW. Too bad that never happend, however that still doesn't stop the game from being a great RPG by it's own right.  Since I upgraded my main gaming rig to Windows 10 I found that my big screen TV seems to play better with my HDMI out on my laptop now so I decided to fire up KoA:R that I had on Steam and use it to as a gauge big screen preformance. Once of the problems I had with the PC version of KoA:R was FOV settings and luckily playing it on the big screen helps resolve a lot of those problems.    Game wise the game still is a beautiful game. Yes it has that WoW-like comic book feel to it, but I enjoy it personally over the more realistic Elder Scrolls artwork. No the combat isn't as good as TES and yes considering the writers involved the writing is a letdown but still the game is fun for what it is. It is a great lay back on the sofa / gaming chair and just goof off type of third person action RPG. It is overshadowed by other RPGs and yes it failed to live up to the hype and it was done in by legal issues but still years later it is a fun game by its own right.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it change the gaming landscape like I had hoped but still years later it is worth playing. It has me hooked again after a few hours now that I want to do another play though and see what look nooks and crannies I might have missed. All in all I still recommend it. I would recommend it though only on sale, and personally only on sale on Steam. I wouldn't pick it up on Origins.
5637	1	a	Game seems alright, but whenever I shoot, there is no animation for the gun firing. One of 20 shots works. I'll update this later if it seems more smooth.   I bought 4 copies for $3 so I still recommend the game, if I can squeeze 45 minutes of gameplay out of my investment, this game owes me nothing.
3016	1	a	The game is incredible, it have a lot of dinos to kill :)  Pros: Have multiple classes ( assault, support and recon ) Have multiple game types ( survival, conquest, duel and so on .... ) Have multiple vehicles ( car, jet, tank, APC and so on ..... ) And ofc the game is constantly evolving ( char-class lvl and the game it self )  Cons: few minor glitches needs menu interface polish :)  overall - 7,5/10 ( at least )
1694	1	a	Amazing game. I recommend this game highly :)
5728	0	a	Horrible
810	0	a	I really really tried forcing myselfe to continue playing but i simply couldn't. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ¢ starts off as a great concept and at first it seems like a really fun hack and slash with a lot of customisation and strong RPG-Elements. But it isn't. You'll find yourselfe spamming the same 3 combos all the time while getting annoyed of hundrets of MMORGP-like Sidequests. I heared you people love +/- Lists so here you go!  The Good + Character customisation. You really have a lot of options and skills to chose from. You can also customise the apperance of your charater but the options are very limited so don't expect it to be as complex as in TES-Games.  + Voice Acting. Honestly i haven't seen the entire game but so far i think all NPCs where well voiced. With one huge exception. Your own character. All your character has are texts you can choose in Dialoges and the 'uh' 'uah' 'ah' in combat. This actally doesn't bother me too much as it's already a common thing in a lot of RPGs.  + Open World. There is actally a lot of loot and other stuff to look for. Would be a huge + if the game was genarally good.  + Decisions. Yay! I cannot tell you how much effect they have on the world around you but at least you can make some.  The Meh ~ Enemies. Not much variety for such a huge world but many of them require unique strategies to deal with them without losing too much life. For many of them it's recommended to learn their attacks and how to counter them.  The Bad - Generic MMORPG feeling. The Quests are getting boring after the first few hours and even if there is a huge effort to make the Quests interesing, it still felt like brainless EXP-grinding.  - Tons of Sidequests. Wait, how is that a bad thing? Well if the game isn't fun at all you don't want to waste hours over hours doing minor stuff so you can keep up with the level of your enemies.  - Combat. If the combat gets dull and boring in a game build around combat nothing else can safe the game from a bad score. The combat it repetitive and boring. At first it seems fresh and fun but after a few hours in you'll see how boring it gets when you spam the same stuff over and over again with the wepons(s) of your choice.  - Bugs. Tbh i haven't encountered any but i haven't made it far enough into the game to get to the buggy parts of it. Quests cannot be completed if you do stuff in the wrong order and things like that. So a lot of save slots are highly recommended.  - EA Account. Yes, it's one of those games where you have to make a third party account and have to be online to play a singleplayer game.  - Inventory. A barely sorted List of Stuff, that you can only extend buying a limited Number of Backpacks from some NPCs. This is the Part where you clearly see that this game is a console port.  3.5/10 Because EA didn't pay me
5848	0	a	paid for this game now its free nothing special for what i paid nothing at all while every one els gets it free devs suck lol
488	1	a	Its like the Fable we always wanted.
2729	1	a	ive played 7 minutes of this game, most broken thing on steam. 11/10
2977	1	a	This game is really fun
5773	0	a	Just wasted my money (1$ + DLC, argh). Feels like a mobile / early 2000's cheap FPS. I would rather like to play Doom (of course)
788	1	a	It's good.
6252	0	a	Garbage not worth the $1.49 I payed for it.
3051	1	a	Game is actually better than Call of Duty, less hackers , even not really possible to find one. Great Graphics, better animations than CoD, good Rainy Weather, even COD doesnt have that one. Good gameplay, enjoyable game with Friends over COOP.  Able to make lobby, not paytowin game , easy to play.
3269	1	a	its not a complete or balanced game, but for a $1 it's fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play with friends. Also it has fire-breathing robot reindeer &amp; a robot santa claus in the santaslair map, how can you not give this a try.
371	1	a	I heard allot of good stuff about this game. It was kind of like the epidemic of everyone telling you over and over again to watch Breaking Bad. 'You don't watch Breaking Bad!!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!' and from 100 different people each week until you finally just give in and watch it and realise what the heck you was missing! This game was like that. Every corner I turn I was hearing 'Have you played Reckoning yet??' 'Dude you have to play Reckoning, Seriously!' So I finally said heck with it and bought it. And there has not been one single shred of regret. You may know how it is to have a ton of games you have purchased in your steam library and you play one for a while and get bored and go to the next for a while. And with so many games you can't fully get into one certain game. And kind of wish you was stuck with just one game so you would be forced to enjoy it without feeling like you are missing out somewhere else. Well this game here has pretty much did that for me. Because there is no other game out there right now comparable to this so my Steam library might as well only have reckoning on the list. One of those games where you are thinking about it constantly when you are out of the house and soon as you walk in the door you push the button on the computer to get it prepped for some playage. If you are an RPG and or Hack and Slash fan this game will be your best friend. You will be buying the T-Shirts and watching youtube videos and drinking out of a reckoning coffee cup you purchased from china off ebay. It really is a great game. So stop reading this right now and purchase it so you can go ahead and get the download started. I love you...er...where did that come from...sorry..
1083	1	a	I had a lot of fun playing through, it was pretty long and I stepped away for a few weeks in the middle, but it was fun picking it up again. I wouldn't suggest trying to min/max, just play it how you find fun. This is a solid RPG with lots of lore, but nothing groundbreaking. It has the feel of a lonely MMORPG.
1325	1	a	Massively underappreciated game. The visuals aren't something to super brag about sure, but the mythology is gorgeous, and map is gigantic, and the combat is really fun. Plus, the option to combine the three skill trees in any way is fantastic.
3912	0	a	This game is a bit like Halo meets Turok. My problem with this game is that the trailers, like most games, don't really do it justice. The trailer looks pretty awesome but it misrepresents the movements of the dinosaurs and the players. It is much more choppy. I would recommend personalizing the controls as well. One big thing that would make this a bit better are things like, headshots [either instant kill or massive damage]. I don't know how many times I drilled into a raptor's face and it was still chewing on my gun... Very frustrating. It has potential but it is not there yet, in my opinion.
531	1	a	What can i say..... its the best game ive played in for a while !
2197	1	a	One of the best Hack n' Slash RPGs ever made.
1385	1	a	The combat is incredible. This is what the Fable sequels should have been.
354	1	a	Hands on the table, I've yet to explain such a great experience as I have been having with this game, thus far. Amalur: Reckoning, has become a favorite in a matter of moments, to me.  If you are in search of a story-backed, heavily armored RPG, or something to bring an emotional (and nostalgic) rememberance to you. THIS IS IT! Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has brought back to me the same nostalgia of games such as, Fable, Morrowind, and other timeless classics that brought in a new era of RPG gaming.   9.3/10 Story 8/10 Graphics 10/10 Content 8/10 UI/Combat Mechanics 10/10 Replay Value  The story is unique and enthralling from my point of view as the player, many bonds formed in the game. Reckoning has an exciting amount of information to learn for almost every NPC character as well, there is lots to learn, and always a bonus!   Graphics are intriguing, lots of intuitive graphic inspirations which look and feel similar to games such as WoW, Prince of Persia, Fable 2, and The Last Remnant.  I could not ask for ANY more content from this game, personally. The content that has been provided, is incredible. It takes a keen eye to see all the little details put into the fabrics of this game, and there is a bountiful amount of things to do in this game, never boring.   As for the UI of this game, it's not 'clunky' or 'misplaced', but it definitely could have been shown off a little more.  Speaking for this in a comparison, it would land closer to an original inspired UI, such as Dark Souls. Relatively simple to navigate, and basically gets the job done. Could have been better, but I've seen worse.  Combat in this game lands incredibly close to that of a Fable game, the particles of Magic based skills/attacks are very similar to the style of that series. And the combat feel is smooth, and aaalmost clean. It has a bit of register and error when it comes to trying to scroll between weapons when you want to, and when you want to aim at an enemy while moving backwards, something that comes with most games. Just need to remember that these things occur. The actual skills and devices of combat in this game feel familiar to Continent of The Ninth Seal (C9 by Webzen), the skills are incredible and awe-inspiring!   I really feel at home with this game, and there is always something new to accomplish, or experiment with. Lots to tinker with, lots of different ways to go about doing one single thing. Always new possibilities for your character progression, and every class tree is fun to play with. Needless to say this game userped the throne of my RPG Top 10.  Feel like this game is for you? It should. It is worth the full price, believe me. It is always nice to get it on sale, just don't waste any time NOT playing this game :)
2550	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
5125	0	a	Heyyo,  I bought it because the devs continuously build onto the game and that's cool and all... but it's still sadly broken when it comes to the AI... lots of the AI can be easily defeated by just strafing in a circle and it'll never catch you... so with easy to defeat AI? I can't recommend this game. There's better Swarm games on PC like Hard Reset.
624	1	a	It says i have 2 hours but i've racked up 70+ hours in offline mode (i played this game during internet shortages etc), and boy. Was. It. Fun. I had alot of enjoyment doing the finishers from the reckoning mode and that made my day that massive bonus exp.  Its got its own pros and cons such as -Rather Small world +Vibrant Colours -Creatures get repititive +Great Combos, and I Mean GREAT. Combos. -The DLC Weapon and Armour Pack is rather weak, as it's more of early game. +The Two other DLCs provide an additional 3-4 hours of content, and rather interesting stuff too, i'd probably like it more if they also added additional races, that'd be sweet.
1766	1	a	One of the best RPGS I've played in my life. Only 11 hours into the game and haven't even explored half the map yet. Just loving it to the bits. Buy if you can, you won't regret it if you like RPGs.  
3047	1	a	Great graphics and yet terrible graphics, but it is one of the most fun games to play with friends, up to 10 people at the same time.
977	1	a	its like a colorful version of skyrim....but easier and less intense.
4469	0	a	Do not buy this game. No matter the discount, it is not worth the price. There's too much to go into, and I really don't care much. Just noticed that for some reason I had a positive review on here, and since it's on sale wanted to update the review to reflect the current game.
5284	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
5168	0	a	Selling tf2 key for a hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3616	1	a	I saw the rating for the game was a 36/100, but that was a bit of a lie. This game is actually quite fun and challenging. I highly recommend this game if you liked Killing Floor or Sanctum. It's a bit of both games.
3865	1	a	kind of simple still good
2374	1	a	Payed only 25 cent on a sell, 7 hours later, OH MY GOD BEST GAME EVER, I mean who the heck does not like dinos and halo like combat? The fact the developers stuck with this over the years shows dedication. Drives a jeep around in circles as dinos ragdoll under my wheels as I squeel about the lighting effects in the game. 10/10
3574	1	a	Glitch Simulator 2014 is an awesome game.  The overall experience is better than War Z. I give this game 9/10 because i couldnt find any dinosaurs! If the devs would add this, it would be Game of the year, all year.  Buy it, and give the devs extra monies via paypal!
2094	1	a	An overall Fun RPG took a bit before I got used to some of the weapons and to level up enough to fight some of the bosses but it was fun in the end. 7.5 / 10
452	1	a	really like this game...... I have only one thing I would change,the clothes for the female mages suck ,lol. The citizens or npc have nicer clothes and or armor as in rathir. I,m a dude but i prefer watching female toons when im playing. I have put a few hrs in an almost all have been in their under garmets because they all look like tanks in mage armor, thick heavy and bulky yuk..
5359	0	a	Never Did find any Giant Dino Turds.  Unless you count this game.
491	1	a	This game is the LoveChild of Skyrim and Fable. It acts a little more like it's father (Skyrim) and looks a little more like it's mother (Fable). But in all aspects of gameplay you can feel both of it's parents. I LOVE this game and I've only played for about an hour.
4310	1	a	There are SPOOKY dinosaurs dont play!  10/10 WOULD â¥â¥â¥â¥ PANTS AGAIN!
1375	1	a	great gameplay. combat systems, leveling up, armor and weapons and design top notch. but super sad that there wont be a sequel, but it just makes Kingdoms of Amalur one of its kind. played this in every platform.
5447	0	a	Wasted a dollar 10/10
6155	1	a	Orion is a neat little game, that tries it hardest to be something that's it not. It's a strange mix of cyber and military machinery competing against prehistoric dinosaurs for control over large geological locations. Whether or not the dinosaurs or humans know they're fighting for it, you still are.  There are enough weapons and gadgets to keep you occupied for a while as you figure out which ones you like the most, but I wouldn't invest too much time into it. If you're not playing on hard difficulty, it doesn't really matter, and most strategies are taken on rambo style. Body modidications increase health, increase firing rates, jump heights and more. I've seen the deathmatch in the game, but the lack of players leaves it hard to fight for any top player space.  It's not really good, but not really bad either. I like it, but not that much. There are lots of qualities that come up and can be taken advantage of to make your game even more fun, but there's nothing entirely worth mentioning. For the price, you should get it for sure. If you played it for a day, you'd be getting your money's worth ten fold.. but again, not much more than a day.  Definetly buy it and add it to your collection of games. At the time of writing this, it's one dollar. Can't complain.
3111	1	a	I bought this game when it cost Â£1.99 during a steam sale. Since that moment I can honestly i have never regreted my choice. This now under Â£1 game should not cost that much and i await the moment they put the price up and award themselves for the hard work they have obviously put into this. Would happily play Â£10 for this game as it is worth it. To any others that are looking at the game BUY IT NOW before they do what they should and make it cost more. Easily better than games such as Call of Duty and battlefield, It just needs more players and a wider community which it deserves
1189	1	a	Fun game, very expansive world. Great graphics and combat style. You'll love it if you like RPGs.
259	1	a	Awesome game . A lot of Tasks, quests and side quests to do,  a really good rpg game..   Well worth the money.  I recommend this game.....buy it :D Rating 8/10
5377	1	a	this game is amazing and fun 10/10
2515	1	a	Counter strike with Dinosaurs, do you really need anything more? You even get classes to buff yourself up so you can HACK INTO DINO ANKLES WITH A KNIFE
4053	1	a	What else do you want in under a dollar?  the good: -cards -its cheap -plenty of modes  the bad: -graphics -optimization -empty servers most of the time  Score: 5.5/10
190	1	a	i played this game on ps3, pc back in 2012. and i recently bought it again. this game is a masterpeice, people that wanted fable 3 but never got it will worship this game. its all you wanted in fable 3 and more,   3 years and a half after the release and still as good as day one.  pros:  -lots of content -Over the top combat system -Over the top class [ ability ] system -Good skills system -Stealth works really good -quests never bugged for me, -amazing Music and voice acting -ALOT of weapons and types of weapons -A good crafting system -A law system like fable 1  Cons : - ' for me ' the story didn't really move me at all -All characters that i interacted with in the story line look the same. so noone really grew on me -after 20 hours of the game i found my self skipping so much dialog.  this review might or might not be good. its the first i ever did so you might understand how good this game is  Diehard fans of Fable.. just get this game.   the studio that made this game went down. so the title right is held by a bank at the moment. and any company can aquire it. and i hope to see someone do. it is undoubtable a good game to make a sequel for. and will be seccessful in the right hands
2676	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
4198	0	a	after watching the first trailer on store page, and read the 'comments' in this video i thought 'wow that must be really cool- so much positive comments - and wow they say its like killing floor and borderlands and turok. wooow'. but it was not.  after few seconds on title screen the backround music makes you puke. then startetd the game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphic, â¥â¥â¥â¥ sounds, â¥â¥â¥â¥ viewmodels, no atmosphere. this game maybe good.....if you are 12 years old and we have the year 1997 and you re totally in halo or dinosaurs.
1781	1	a	better than skyrim. It's a must, even though it's not first person
3181	1	a	Well it had more than i wanted and the graphics are epic
5188	0	a	Polish a turd it's still a turd. Wouldn't recommend for anybody.
6286	0	a	The Source Engine would have been a better choice, doesnt make sense, poor aiming ability, promised big dinosaurs and big guns, world design :(
1681	1	a	I can't recommend this game highly enough. It's a Fable, Dragon Age and Guild Wars fused together to create a hidden gem that is called Kingdoms of Amalur. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!
1414	1	a	I got this game a day ago I have played a total of 1 hr so far. Hardly enough to know much about a game or its story. yet it beat all 3 fables in that hr and its even on par with how much I enjoyed skyrim. Such an underated game. 10/10
378	1	a	i've put about 20 hours into this game. I've never played a game so much in my life! Get this, you won't regret it!
934	1	a	One of the best RPG's I've ever played. 10/10 would buy again.
4013	0	a	this game is crap the quality sucks and the price is a rip off
6204	1	a	Another good PVE Co-Op shooter. Easier than the others I've played due to the implimentation of vehicles, but effectively this is Halo with dinosaurs.  Mech suits, lightsabers, and t-rexes. Lots of fun co-op.  The shooting is alright as well.
4235	1	a	  even though i tried this game for abut half an hour while it was free i love this game there are a lot of dinos and cool weapons and to make this even better this game is really cheap.   Definitely better than it was in 2012
5686	0	a	my teamate was a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot, pretty sure he was playing from the childrens hospital for being such a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot WHO WOULD NOT REVIVE ME.
2522	1	a	If you're like me, you know the meta-score is the first impression of any game. If it's between 70-80 and above, it's worthe considering right?  Let me tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is a good game. Maybe not so much the $15...probably catch it on a sale (sorry devs, but it's a consumer opinion)   ORION is pretty damn fun. Really great shoot 'em up, an original concept, and although it has a bug once every 50 play throughs, it's stable. You know how you're on skype with friends and you're all trying to figure out a game to play because you're all bored? You scroll down your games list looking for games you guys both have and wanna play. Well lemme tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is always a game that we agree to.  Check it our, join in, be a part of the community, and shoot some dinos!
2635	1	a	Quick review: This is 'Getting Attacked by Endless Impossible to Hit Flying Enemies: The Game'  Seriously. I can still hear the constant, endless, horrible screeching of the most annoying flying enemy I have ever encountered in a game. It's Cliff Racers from Morrowind all over again. I actually have fun playing this game despite the bugs, poor balancing, and lack luster presentation. It has charm, like B grade sci-fi. But those flying what-evers kill this game for me. The guns are so hilariously innaccurate that there is no way you can reliably hit them, forcing you to listen to their screeching while they peck away at your armor, bit by bit, harassing you to the point of insanity. Yes, my entire problem with the game is not the enumerable other issues that so many point out, but simply the fact that I spend the entire match beset on all sides by what amount to Cliff Racers. No one liked Cliff Racers. Not even the devs that made them.  If you like Cliff Racers, this game is for you. If you don't, then get the game when it's a dollar. Still worth playing with friends.
2034	1	a	Yep. After hundreds of hours playing this game I finally went legit and bought the game and all DLC's. I'm not proud of playing without paying but I really did enjoy this game so much. It has good graphics (for 2012 anyway), the combat system is nothing short of amazing and works really well, the story is interesting enough but the characters are forgettable (except Alyn Shir because DAT â¥â¥â¥).   8/10 game not bad
2307	1	a	Budget wise this is the best and most fun coop shooter I can think of! I bought this game for many of my friends since its so cheap and we always had alot of fun playing it. I dont regret a single second spend playing this game.   10/10 would buy it again.
5153	1	a	Fun, addictive game.  Arcade style shooter (think Counter Strike) with Halo fascia, and damn it's fun!   Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 8/10 Sound 5/10 (I've heard the music in other games, hmm..) Addictive 10/10  I can't wait to try out Team Deathmatch modes too (I've only played 2 'wave' type gamemodes, MANY different game modes)
2043	1	a	It's enjoyable! I would recommand to buy it while it's on sale though, it will be more worth it as it's not a rpg that STANDS OUT. But you know it's still a well-made rpg that has things to offer and that is fun. But wait for a sale, more worth it. I have good memories of this game still and hope that you will too.
2069	1	a	Amazing RPG. Fun without complication. It s not very hard and maybe remember too much of WOW.  But is a game very well crafted. Get it.
3763	1	a	A must have Coop game to play with your fellow friend, family and your lovely girl friend. -Character customization and gender! -Hot graphic! -Ton of vehicle to drive and fly! -Large map to run around! -Time cycle and Weather systems! -Big dino! ETC  Cant believe this game cost me just 1$! Where are the donation button. 
5830	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Congrats for stealing from other's work.   
895	0	a	Won't load at going in to the Laboratory...
2775	1	a	Burned three hours in one sitting since buying this game. For the dollar I payed for it I've already gotten a 33 cent per hour return on it. Keep in mind this is only fun with friends.
1636	1	a	Worth a second look. I just purchased this game on a Flash Sale. The sale will last till Monday 2/3. Download the demo if your not sure. Compelling story line, graphics are fine, give it a look. The time you spend is well worth the adventure gained.
2663	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥ was .99 cents.
1025	1	a	Very fun game! This is the game that Fable 2 and 3 should have been.
4260	0	a	Do not buy this game. I bought it when it was under a different name which was Orion Dino Beatdown that game was a buggy mess and so is Orion Dino Horde DO NOT be fooled by it's new name it is still the same piece of trash when it was first released. This game has a small community if you can call it that and the servers are dead the peak is about 60-80 players. The guns feel like cheap knock off BB guns and the AI is just bad then combine that with the dinosaurs getting stuck in objects such as buildings, rocks and mountains that sort of thing. This is by far one of the worst games I have had the horrible misfortune of playing sure the devs seem to be making a vague attempt to make it playable but with it's dead servers and bad gameplay with a dash of microtransactions make this game a slap in the face to the gaming community and hard working devs who produce top quality games. Do not support this product at all.
5335	1	a	I really love this game. here's why:  Pros: -ok to great graphics -wide selection of guns -wide selection of upgrades -LOTS of dinosaurs -pvp modes, which are really fun -meh to ok servers: in other words, there are lots of servers with people, lots without people -dinosaurs,dinosaurs...who doesn't like them?   Cons: -It is kind of buggy, sometimes you cant use your aibility,others you can't DO anything -dinos running away when you are down, and need to kill one to survive. It's just annoying -bug with infinite health dinos  and that's pretty much it.. so go buy this, it's totally worth $1. It should honestly cost about $100 though.. yes, it's that good.   EDIT: they fixed all the bugs, mnade the game look and play even better, and after the horrible mess it was in 2012, it improved to the greatest game of 2015. Think of your favorite FPS, and multiply it by a billiion. That's what ytou get from $0.99 Orion Prelude (or for you long term players such as me, orion: Dino horde). The game has improved so much it's unbelievable!
5928	0	a	I got killed by picking a gun up. 10/10.
5471	1	a	excellently broken. It a bit of a pain but a blast of fun. If you try not to take it to seriously it can be one of the best games you play. That is if you're with friends.
4565	0	a	not even worth the dollar i paid for it
1914	1	a	Fantastic game. Feels like a Fable game, from a time set before Fable with a great story, graphics, and gameplay. Definitely recomend to anyone who is looking for a good game to play in their down time!
3547	1	a	Worst game? think again. This game is probably the best game I ever played: It is totally worth it for the price, it's a lot of fun with your friends and it has more gamemodes than any game out there (and good ones, like gungame, the usual survival and 1v1). The game is perfect, I mean, I played counter-strike for a long time and I thought it was like really good and the same happened to skyrim, but this one is different, in this game you are gonna have twice as much fun as you would on any coop game or even not coop games, you are gonna have way more fun in this game than in games like killing floor or portal (those games are pretty good as well tho). What I am saying is 'buy it, and buy it fast' cuz it's probably the best game you'll ever play in your entire life.
5545	0	a	This garbage is worse than garbage.
3798	1	a	orion dino horde is realy awesome and i am going to play again 
3021	1	a	For $1 I could have done a lot worse. This game is a lot of fun for the price. Yes there are annoying glitches and sometimes crazy lag, I have very muc enjoyed my time playing this game and will log in a lot more hours. Way to make a fun game guys :D
3019	1	a	This is my first review, and I'm only writing it because of the low metascore that is highly inaccruate. If you like to shoot at dinosaurs and fly around with jetpacks, this is the game for you. Enough said.
6361	1	a	Played as a dinosaur. Ate a guy. 10/10 would eat someone again.
6045	1	a	If you've ever wanted a cheap, fun, multiplayer wave survival game to play with friends, this is it. It has some quirks to learn, and it's no AAA title, but my friends and I have gotten about 25 hours out of it so far, and we consider it well worth what we paid for it.
2249	1	a	I already own 2 copies of Renaissance - one purchased at Amazon to get the non-updated, non-broken version so I could finish the thing - and 1 of Resurrection - which I've never finished because of all the bugginess and the way the Undead Hordes are so underpowered and handicapped it isn't even funny. Even so, I went ahead and purchased this based on the positive reviews that indicated a lot of the issues have been resolved.   I expected simply a better working, better balanced version of the original but I'm happy to say that this is an entirely different game all the way around. Not sure I'm happy with the new battle mechanics, though, but I suppose I'll get used to it. I can already tell that the balance for the Empire army has drastically changed - not nearly as overpowered as it was, which gives me hope that perhaps the balance of the Legions and the Undead Hordes has improved so that they aren't so weak. On the other hand, I will probably not use auto-combat in this one as much as I did in the others. My army tends to get decimated if I'm not in control.  Another hope is that I won't experience as many crashes as before, although the game did freeze up after one battle. Once I got the game to minimize, there was a low memory warning on the screen that doesn't make sense since my computer is built to be a gaming computer with as much gaming power as HP could give it.   Also have to mention the opening, which is phenomenal. Much better than the original. The storyline seems much improved as well. Kind of makes me wish I could read Russian so I could read the book that was written based on the game.  Despite the nerfed battle system (only my opnion, though), I believe this is going to be $30 well spent and I do recommend the game.
2415	1	a	Best game I've ever played in my life 11/10
1335	1	a	An extremely solid and polished RPG with almost zero original features.  It's really great, and nothing special at the same time. I like it a lot.
2594	0	a	I got it for 99 cents. It's bad. Just.... bad. 
4288	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
4446	0	a	Dont understand why people are saying metacritic is wrong? The game is beyond broken, probably one of the worst games ive played. Rampage is the only game mode worth playing and thats just a flipping mess. The whole game is a mess, its in a sorry state and no update can fix this.  Its like the developers released a half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ alpha and said it was the finished product.
6040	1	a	It alright for a dollar i guess.
3112	1	a	I have to say that for 1$ is a really good game... And I REALLY mean it when I say that is a good game, considering you just spend the grosseries change on 1.5 GBs of pure FUN...  And I'm serious when I say that you have to give it a try! And let's be honest, at the beggining, everything looks blurry and you don't understand pretty much anything about the game, but after 2 hours this FPS becomes very promising! The game modes, the dinos, the weapons, skills and stores are fabulous!  You won't get dissapointed.
5605	0	a	i bought it 0.49$ so worth it for me LOL Uhhhh... this game need to devolope much things sort of AI and game play
6320	1	a	just look at it... how does that not look fun?
5646	0	a	usedto be great when it had a diff title now the ai is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ the graphics are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. and i paid 15 euros for this game while this is a 0,00$ version like i would be ashamed if i asked money for such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. gg dev team ope u hadfun with ur trolls please return this to the previous title STILL â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥
2792	1	a	nice fps games ... worth to buy
228	1	a	If you think this game like Skyrim. You come to the wrong place. Why everyone tell this game like skyrim? Just because Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston is a developer of this game. After that? Nothing similar to skyrim.  If you come here to play game that similar to skyrim. Don't buy this game. You can buy another games that similar to Skyrim. Open World in this game is suck. Not a sandbox game like skyrim. Quest is suck too. It's like MMORPG but offline.  But, i recommend this game because the Combat. Well.. The combat in this game is fun.  Well.. This is my opinion. Sorry for bad english(:
4035	0	a	they should give us back our money 
3541	1	a	The metacritic score is misleading. Orion: Dino Horde is a wonderful game. Its like halo: combat evolved with dinosaurs and hats. If you buy the game now, it will update into the new game by Spiral that is coming out near the end of the year. And make sure to check out the kickstarter for The Orion Project  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project 
3878	1	a	Join game.  guy asks me, 'Are you having fun?'  'No.'  'well then have a nice life f*** boy!'  gets kicked.  10/10, would get kicked again.  
4380	1	a	Negative review about a game for 0.79â¬ should be a crime ...
3044	1	a	Metacritic rating is very misleading. This game is quite fun: lots of guns, perks, and powerups to buy in each individual map, as well as a leveling system that applies permanent passive bonuses.
5117	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the â¥â¥â¥ with a bow and arrow and it died. 10/10
3246	1	a	Dont believe the meta score for a second. While this game lacks modern texutre graphics, it hugely makes up for it with gameplay. With regular updates, new features, and devs who actually care what the players think, this game is awesome. even at that its a TON of fun.
5379	0	a	I want my dollar back! Enough said.
672	1	a	One of those games that will pay off if you're an fantasy rpg gamer. Its cheap and will guarantee at least 200 hours of gameplay,  it has an incredible class system that allows you to create all kinds of mix class characters,  beautiful graphics (fable style) and more or less interesting story line (side quests are a bit repetitive but quest rewards are satisfying)
69	1	a	An entertaining poker + solitaire combo with decent production values behind it. Probably won't take more than a week to beeat, but I bet you'll have fun while doing it. I particularly like the music, and the combat is fast paced and fun... for a card game.
2966	1	a	Truly one of the best ever games i have ever ever played, the graphics are amazing and the gameplay highly enjoyable, minecraft has nothing on this shooter.
5484	0	a	Terrible game play. Terrible graphics. Terrible music that makes want to vomit. All for 1 dollor.... If you want a game that will last for about 2 hours, go ahead. But if you though that this will be anywhere near decent, I'd suggest just pass
391	1	a	Was a bit sceptic in the beginning regarding the controls, but as it turned out, it flows really well with the combat system. Weapons, NPCs, progressive systems, skills etc. are engaging and fun.  I'm a couple of hours in and i like what i see so far!
1365	1	a	Not as bad as people think it is. There is some fun hidden in this game
3863	1	a	ALL CAPS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  GOD DAMN  LISTEN TO ME.    THIS IS THE BEST VALUE THAT YOU CAN GET ON STEAM.
2182	1	a	  Even though this game didnt reinvent itself, but it had the most enjoyable combat mechanics I have played in a very long time
3267	1	a	So I watched like one episode of Sword Art Online 2 and if anyone knows me they know I like sniper rifles as much as I like swords, so I was reading this synopsis of one episode and I got really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that they imply the top sniper in an entire extremely competitive gun-based game was less skilled than some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that shows up with a sword, and then my friend tells me about how Kirito is using a sword in a gun game and how that was the class that was apparently treated as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and awful and he's automatically the best at it.  So it made me think of this game because one time I jumped out of an aircraft with a lightsaber and took out a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing t-rex in one hit with it.  *****. Best $1.00 I ever spent on a game.
1597	1	a	It's a fun single playthrough. I tired a bit of the constant, repetitious fighting. I guess that's what large scale RPG's are nowadays. Feels too much like grinding on an MMORPG. I have to admit that the fighting system is very satisfying. The combo moves, the various and well thought out ability types give you a very satisfying experience.   I think what kept me playing was the story. Such a large and well thought out storyline gave you the feeling of playing through a living, breathing world. Such a vast array of quality characters that you either love or hate. If anything this is a game that makes you feel like your playing through an epic tale.   Great story combined with a polished combat system makes this a must have for all you RPG'rs out there.
296	1	a	This game is like Skyrim if Skyrim was high on crystal meth. Fluid combat with an interesting skill tree. A massive detailed world filled with colour topped off with great boss battles.
2316	1	a	I got lens flare from looking up at the sky.      At night. 10/10
181	1	a	A damn good RPG with great art-direction, sound, music, combat, character progression, crafting...all top-notch.  One of Steam's most underrated gems.
2430	1	a	I think I shot a dinosaur and it moonjumped into space, came back down to Earth at break-neck speeds, and survived impact only to land in water and drown.  Why aren't more people playing this, again?
499	1	a	The game feels like a more modern version of the first Fable game, and is really what they should have evolved into. The story is fairly straightforward, but does offer the player choices, and while many choices are one off events, your actions do change how NPCs at least talk to you or initiate conversations with you. The game does also have some interesting new fantasy ideas, like the Fae, an elf like race that lives by the stories they tell and are destined to repeat throughout their multiple lives.   Combat maintains a nice balance, with different playstyles being perfectly viable, and some fights will require preperation to have a fair chance of getting through them, but there's no major difficulty spikes. Basic crafting trees like alchemy and blacksmithing are included, and blacksmithing has a nice touch where you break down loot to make into other weapons and armor. The world is large and about as open as Oblivion, with only cities and dungeons having their own instances. And lastly, the graphics have a very WoW like feel to them, but far more technically advanced and nicer looking.
1432	1	a	Great value for the price, haven't finished it yet but it's a good game so far.
2956	1	a	This is one of my personal favorites.... you get to kill DINOS!!! Not to mention you can run over other dinos with jeeps.
5618	0	a	Very laggy and slow. IDK if it's my computer or not.
782	1	a	If you like RPG's, why do you not have this game?
277	1	a	basically skyrim.. haha (although much cheaper)  would highly reccommend for any RPG lovers.
4873	1	a	I dont know .... like 7/10 -2 becouse the gameplay -1 becouse i waned to be DINOSAURS VS ROBOTS or something not BOTS DINOSAURS i want like in Dino d day .
1740	1	a	This game is not a revolution. However it is well balanced action RPG and fun to play. I like how this game manages to avoid most mistakes that similar games make. Well done. :thumbs up:
3860	1	a	Jetpacks, Tanks, Helicopters, what do we need more?  ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game which you won't be able to stop playing this. First few hours will make you flustered since this game does not provide you any tutorials. Especially, fighting with big-sized dinosaurs when you are a newb will drive you crazy. However, after you finish learning how to play this game(It'll take no longer than 3 hours), then the real fun begins.  Teamwork is the key point of the game. Without it, you and your mates can die before you even hit the round 5. The great point of this game is, 'teamwork' and 'dino' can create a great action movie. You and your squads will face hundreds of dinos coming toward you. After your squad captures the checkpoint. Most of cases Hummer style vehicle equipped with a machine gun will be given to you. Then, somebody will drive while others take the shotgun, or grab the machine gun and feel like his playing Call of Duty.  Not only because my English sucks, but it's just hard to explain all the positive elements which this game will give to you.  9.5 / 10.0  P.S. It doesn't mean the actual graphic is bad, but screenshots uploaded on the steam store page is way better than the actual graphic.
1282	1	a	Muh.... This game is OK.  I made a character who looked like voldemort and named him voldemort... Voldemort simulator 1983.\  The gameplay is a bit sketchy , but the story is OK.   This game is a Open World RPG. So you can travel to many different locations, do side quests, kill basicaly anyone you want, and do other stuff.  ^^^^ Talking about killing anyone you want, i kinda killed a whole village! ^_^  
5259	1	a	cool and good co-op 
676	1	a	The gameplay is very good and fun to play with the combination of weapons combo. The story is kinda meh, i feel lost after i got out of the first cave and the story does not really followup like the opening story which got my hope highs. The most fun about this game for me is the killing npc modes, idk whats it called, its really fun watching those guard helplessly fighting me with bow and sword. Overall its a good game.
2793	1	a	10/10 
2904	1	a	Mech machine can get on top of a helicopter. 10/10
1029	1	a	While not being flawless, the game offers strong narratives and fresh concepts with regard to lore especially the different houses and not quite reincarnation the fae undergo. I found myself using the same few moves which by the end of the game had run their course, but respecing is painfree and easy so you are able to try all the skills without starting the game over
4221	1	a	A very awesome game i Love the whole Dino feel and hunting them down i rate this game 7/10
5755	0	a	This looks and plays great!  Wait what do you mean this isn't an XBox Live Indie Game? Oh... Oh no.
4206	0	a	This Game is a Dinosaur.
1456	1	a	Got this on a Steam weekend deal. Got a totally unexpected gem of a game!
5977	1	a	It's sort of like the dinosaur child of Borderlands and Killing Floor. That said, it feels like it was made by a small team. This is not a problem, since the price is so dang low.
1902	1	a	I love this game! Very underrated rpg with excellent combat. Highly recommend.
6365	1	a	This game might not be game of the year material, but it sure is a fun game. You get to shoot, stab and burn dinos, what more do you want? Play as dinos? Good thing you can. It is the game I never knew I wanted, and I love it.
3633	1	a	Why did I buy it. â¥â¥â¥â¥
589	1	a	Excellent game, essentially a better Fable.
2236	0	a	I tried to play this game on few occasions, and it always makes me regret it. It's a barely playable mess. Reincarnation is a transformation of original Disciples 3, that tries so hard to be like Disciples 2, that it makes you wonder: why play this, when you have an excellent Disciples 2? Akella made the same game THRICE, and while Disciples 2 is an improvement to 1, Reincarnation is not even close to being equally good as either of the previous entries. They changed this game into a bad version of Disciples 2, worse in almost every aspects (if not literally every).   I can stand the unintuitive UI and sluggish controls, but I can't - for the love of all that is holy - bear the combat and that is my main issue with this game.  First, we have a leader that is completely useless. I don't even know if he will become a force to be reckoned with later on, he is useless at the beginning and dies from one or two hits, while dealing 1/3 as much damage as normal units. Then we have the overall balance of combat; it's INCREDIBLY hard. I don't understand how am I supposed to defeat even one group of enemies that have some overpowered units with hundreads of health and AoE attacks that two-shots my mages and heroes. It's not like they are not standing right in front of my base, guarding basic resources... Is this a game about exploration and looking for that one, specific group of enemies that will allow me to level up? Or is this a game about taking that one-and-only useful hero and a very specific combination of units? Neither of these appeal to me, and neither of these was mandatory in Disciples 2.  Hotseats (that can be played with AI) feels just unplayable. Campaign is barely more bearable, but equally not fun with the clunky, slow and random combat. I felt like they lowered hit chance to around the same, idiotic values as in Disciples 1 or even lower and one, just ONE miss can completely ruin whole encounter.  Mind you, I don't take into account the artstyle and music. It's good, art is even great, but a hit or miss sometimes. It can be gorgeous at times and it can be ugly on another asset or picture, but the overall design is what you would expect from the series: unique and very atmospheric.
2248	0	a	bland, unexciting battles, clumsy controls... really dissapointing game. You have to force yourself to progress, you are not drawn into the game.
4599	1	a	Team Fortress with dinosaurs, spawningdinos/10 would play again
4920	1	a	I buy this game and now it's free to play wtf DUDE i want money back please.
2643	1	a	It's less than Â£1/copy, with 4 copies for Â£2.... why wouldn't you buy it, even if it just sits in your libary as part of your collection.  The game doesn't run all too great, and feels very cheap/poor quality -hence the price- but if you want a game to play for just a few hours with some friends and have a laugh, this isn't a bad option.  It's a shame this game is the way it is and feels so cheap, I think it offers some really great ideas - jetpacking around fighting dinosours with a lightsabre style weapon, like what?!  People are complaining a lot about the company and their dodgey endeavors, I don't know too much about it, and frankly I don't really care to look it up. The game is so cheap, and has been for a while, why care about any of that lol.
4122	1	a	really fun game!!! 1$ now so get it 
3794	1	a	Really enjoy this game, they've hit on a great formula; especially the co-op conquest maps. It's one of those games with a very simple concept done flawlessly. Graphics are great too, I have a fairly old graphics card and this runs nice and smooth at full res.  Vehicles are great, the ballistic tank weapon is great. It's fun. I really like how when you go up levels you have a decent starting weapon too.
5352	0	a	Fun for a laugh but considerably less polished than co-op shooters like Payday and L4D.
4916	1	a	This game is an amazing exmple of great developers. A few years ago, this ame was everywhere on steam with the reputaton of one of the worst games to be made and sold on steam. However, the developers instead of doing what a lot of game designers do (abandon their game), they stuck with it. They knew they had an interesting idea and in there, they just neede to improve upon the game, and they did. This game is now one of the most stupid fun games I have. I the developer's new saying, Games cannot fail, only developers can.
2938	1	a	The studio made an AMAZING job on this game and the remake of it, I would recommend this to all my friends, and I don't understand how they make money by selling it for so cheap?!   In all seriousness, I spent less than a dollar for this game, and its more fun than most of my games in my library! It has a great feeling when played, I only have very minor complaints!  -extremely large gun models -Cliffs like being buggy -no direct Steam connectivity  Other than that the game is amazing!  8.4/10.0
5	0	a	I got this as part of a bundle and really tried to make it work for me, but it was hard to escape the 'solitare with animations' feeling I got from the game. I'm sure a greater enthusiast for card games will find something they like in here, but I could not recommend it to a general audience.
1067	1	a	great storyline nice graphic!  11/10
6298	1	a	Difficult to begin, but fun once you get going. More fun with more people playing with you at the same time.
1437	1	a	This game has a huge amount of similarities to Bethesda's Skyrim / Oblivion and Bioware's SWTOR / Mass Effect in my opinion, with familiar voice actors from these games, and a crafting system that seems like a mashup of all the games' systems (I really like the crafting system). The storylines have a distinct Bethesda feel to them, and the graphics and music have the recognisable Bioware signatures  Overall this is a really great game with well written storylines, stunning graphics, beautiful music, very nice voice acting, and hundreds of hours of playtime. The DLC's are equally as great.
3896	1	a	  Dinos, explosives and robot suits. What's not to love!   [The good]:   - Pretty much everything is balanced. The guns, the creatures, the vehicles. Nothing is overpowered to the point of being gamebreaking.   - Map detail is really pretty. A bit like Rust on low-graphics or Firefall. And the texture models for the dinos are quite realistic.   - Literally just about every weapon and vehicle you could imagine. Sniper rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, smgs of all sizes, heavy MG's, bows, melee weapons, mech suits, tanks, ATV's, assault aircraft. If you can imagine it, this game has it.   - Everything is nicely porportioned. Distances between objectives and timings between waves of dinos are quite fair but not tedious.   - The weather. Probably my favorite thing about the game. Realistic rain is almost impossible to find. The drops actually fog up your visor and add a small but amazing touch.   [The not-so-good]  - Animations. Though the artworks is pretty and all, its not uncommon to see both dino and human models with their limbs contorted at unnatural angles.   - Clipping. Suffice to say, its possible to get stuck inside a dino or a rock.   - Optimization/latency. Random ping spikes ^300+ from a ~80 avg. Random fps drops to &lt;20 previously running at ~50 avg. If you die while inside a creature, after respawning your weapons will sometimes not fire.   - Map design. Looks aren't everything. In terms of playability the 4 maps I played on had fairly dull gameplay. Mostly flat/hill terrain. Little to no high ground for snipers. Too narrow of an area for vehicles to do work, yet too wide for explosives to be effective.  - Hitreg. Even perfectly placed shots will not do damage and shots that really shouldn't hit, do.   - Economy. While the weapons themselves are balanced, the prices really arent. On medium servers, there are ~13 waves of dinos. Assuming you kill 50% of the wave, you're going to spend more than half of the game grinding up to buying some semi-decent weapon other than a starting pistol. (protip, always go for the c9 revolver if you cant afford a good rifle. its a 2 tap headshot and deadly accurate for a reasonable price)   - Drops/loot. Mainly the fact there is none. It'd be nice to have the occasional airdrop of ammo packs or something. Having to rebuy ammo every round is really tedious.   All in all, its a really fun game and worth the price. The devs could do a few things too improve it but as it stands it's totally worth the price.   Full disclosure, I did get the game for free.
625	1	a	Overall, this game is definitely worth playing, if you're into RPGs. The story is interesting. The game has excellent character customization with no preset classes and the ability to reset your character at any time for a small in-game fee. Combat is fun, though this is where the game feels somewhat like a console port. It's different from most games I've played, but it's fairly easy to get used to. Once you get out of the first area, you do not need to worry about money. This game is a loot fest, and you will soon have more gold than you know what to do with. Experience is the same way. I did most of the side quests and easily hit the level cap (level 40). I recommend getting the DLC, too. They provide completely new areas with new quests and story arcs which are fun to play through. The bottom line is that if you like RPG games, pick this up next time it's on sale, and get the collection version with all the DLC.
3599	1	a	Awsome game, very fast-paced and it can get overwelming at times, but once you get used to it you will enjoy it. now watch out for compies
3679	1	a	0.5 dollar play with 4 friends worth it.
1117	1	a	Fun game lots to fight for and plenty of cool adventures 
6114	1	a	Not bad for its price, a good spread of weaponary and boosts. I decent escape from the average FPS.
5729	0	a	had fun shooting each other until we found that the software is very glitchy and has issues in most of the multiplayer modes. Fun for the right price.
4427	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. terrible port. if you want to play alone you're good. but if you want to play online, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. this game can't multiplayer very well.
5421	0	a	Even for 40p it's utter crap. Unoptimized, boring and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics. That's all I have to say.
2486	1	a	has potential. if the creators did not throw the game, and will make a few improvements, will be a great game
344	1	a	A decent game with bright visuals and a long runtime. The story is confusing and forgettable, but decent for an RPG. There are a variety of environments, owing to the size of the map, and a number of different enemies to match it. The travel system is easy to use. There's really nothing that I disliked, but it lacks some content and systems that other RPGs have. Overall, well worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
4146	1	a	Its 99 cents, and its okay. I wouldn't say its bad, but could be better.
336	1	a	For myself, this was one RPG that slipped under the radar. I had heard about it years ago upon pre / actual release, but for one reason or another it never made my purchase list. Having bought &amp; played now for 35 - 40 hrs., I am actually glad I waited. My hardware runs this thing flawlessly now, but 4 yrs. ago when this came out, it would have been a struggle. Good game, story, combat, upgrade system; definitely worth adding to any PC players' action RPG collection.
579	1	a	Tight game. if you like story drivin solo RPG with well over 60+ hours, pick it up. I played this a lot on 360 and getting back into on PC.
1122	1	a	-Good Gameplay -Sweet Moves -Good Armor,Swords,Shields and Race designs  Suggestions: -Multiplayer  Thanks for the sweet game.
5770	1	a	If your reading this review it means you want to buy the game, if you want to buy this game it is because It is dirt cheap. If you are buying this game because it is cheap it means you are broke, if you are broke you have a garbage potato computer, if you have a garbage potato computer you can't run this game. 10/10 best game ever would buy if I was not broke.
2948	1	a	This game is somewhat like mixing CoD: BO with dinosaurs. You work together with teammates who help you in return with getting the giant T-Rex down for new weapons/attributes that you unlock with EXP and 'CRDT', gained after killing any reptilian creature that attacks you first. It needs lots of development, more weapons than JUST pistols but it has potential. Good luck devs!
986	1	a	Game Name: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning Developer: 38 Studios / Big Huge Games Genre: Role Playing / RPG   History: I first played Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning on the xbox 360 2 years ago about 6 months after it's debute. I loved it! I saw it on sale on here and picked it up. I had a blast playing though it a second time.  Story: You are the 'Fateless One' you start the game off as a dead body. You are dumped down onto a pile of bodies in what seems to be an incinerator room. Shortly after you wake up and find the place you are at under attack. As you progress though the story you find out how you came to be, and that you have no 'fate' and are able to change the fates of those around you. This leads you on a quest to stop the evil Tuatha Deohn, their King Gadflow and their God Tirnoch all of whom want you dead a second time.  Game play: This is where is game shines and also falls short. You can chose from any combination of three classes Warrior, Rogue, or Mage. You have many skills and a very well done progession tree. You can also redo your toon anytime you want at a fatewaver for a price. This is very well done to me it allows us the players never to be tired down to one class. If you want to be a mage and use a greatsword as your main weapon do it!! You also have a unique power to fateshift enemies. This grats an experience bonus and each enemy has a different fateshift death all of them are really cool. The monsters in the games quests level with you but, on the open world map they have set levels. This ensures that you can't get too far ahead as enemies will start to one shot you before too long. As for the games difficulty it's a very easy game. They made it way to easy to make your toon unkillable ( Unlike in skyrim where there is an armor cap making heary armor useless accpet for looks as you can never get past 80% damage reduction ) In this game there is no cap at all on armor or resistance. I had made my toon almost unkillable by about 20 hours into the game. That's where is falls short the first time. You should never have a 'no cap on armor or resistance' always cap them at least 80%. This also made to me all the sets of armor pretty useless. None of them could come close to what I could make just by socketing a few gems into dropped armors. This also sets the game up for you to have a lot of fun making your perfect unkillable toon though. By the end of the game when you have access to flawless blacksmithing you can in fact make a toon that cannot be killed. I had a great time making my unkillable mage with -100% mana costs. I had a blast just slinging spells left and right completely obliterating all that opposed my demigod powers!  Where is game really falls short is making the people and stories interesting. After the first few hours of gameplay I found myself skipping all the dialogue and just following the yellow circles on the map. The people are boring and the way they talk in that monotone voice set put me to sleep. Only a few of the main assist charactors have thier own unique models it. Everyone else in the entire game pretty much looks the same. I found this to be very boring. They could have used more soundbites as well... I hated running though adessa every single gnome says 'What!!' as you walk past and all the humans say 'yes, aye' just one trip made me mute the sound till I left the city. If they had made the toons more unique and added more soundbites it would have been so much better.  This game is still soild in the gameplay field 7/10   Graphics: The graphics are nothing special they seem to be really basic to me. They are cartoonish and fun. They don't try to make you go ohhhh wow..... they just do their job. That's really the best way I can describe them again just solid 6/10  Audio: This game is fully voiced although sometimes you mite find yourself muting the volume. The tones are so boring no emotion, everyone is like a robot. The soundtrack is decient The battle themes and town themes fit where you are and what you have doing. It's all really average. 6/10   Proâs/Conâs:   Pros Wonderful combat system Very well done skill trees You can fateshift enemies killing them in amazing ways. many armors and weapons to chose from you can make your own armor and weapons (to Godly Standards if you want) many, many quests!! there are some funny moments with glitchs in the game, like people walking though or getting stuck in walls that'll make you laugh.  Cons   I can sum up the only real con with this game. I will not remeber anything about it other than combat after awhile. Everything not related to combat was boring!! Compare this to Skyrim where I can tell you the whole story and recall most of the peoples names even after having not played it for so long. With this game that I beat just latenight I cannot recall the names of any of the people accpet Gadflow, Tirnoch, Agarth and Alyn Shir. Everyone else I have forgot as it just didn't hold my interest at all.    Overall: This is a wonderful game to play just to pass the time. If you are looking for a game with a Story and Characters you can really sink your teeth into to me it's not this game. If you are looking for a game where you can kill all that oppose you or protect all the weak with your godlike powers this is perfect. To really sum it up this game has amazing combat and that's really it, everything else is just average.   I give this game a 7/10   I had a wonderful time killing each and every enemy with my fateshifting powers.
1024	1	a	Great game all around.
4281	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
666	1	a	I LOVE IT!!! I don't usually write reviews...but for this game... well...I Just freaking love it.
1435	1	a	Very satisfying and rewarding to play. If you love RPG's and a good combat system, you'll enjoy this game. Voice acting is not that great and such, but the gameplay is very customizable. Strongly recommend.
310	1	a	This game has the best storyline/gameplay of all the RPG's I have played. This game make Skyrim look like a childs game.
1182	1	a	I bought this game online and paid for all the other items that could be added. Unfortunately non of the added item were there so I played the game anyhow and I really liked it; I liked it so much that I bought it again through Steam and all of the items that I was cheated out of in the last purchase were in the Steam version with a DLC added. I wish I purchased it through Steam the first time around because I have never been let down by this company and I have a library of 28 games to date.  Sincerely,  Kathaleen Wood
486	1	a	One of the most under rated RPGs of all time. The heart pounding, action based combat, with wonderful, rich skill animations. The MASSIVE open world, plethora of side quests, and truly astounding dlc. The story is full, decision driven, and breath taking. Truly a shame the company behind went bankrupt, as it is now unlikely we will see a sequel to this truly astounding game.
3135	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game for every dinosaur lover, star wars fan, jurassic park fan or a Halo fan. I recommend it to everyone of those people from the list above! My rating for this game is 10/10. Keep up the good work!
212	1	a	This game is unusualy easy. Even on the hardest difficulty it is not that complex. It has great character evolution and many magnificent items. Even though there is the difficulty problem this game is worth it.
4772	1	a	If you're a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like me who wants to invade dinosaur habitats and then slaughter them all for no valuable reason as they try to defend their home, then this is the game for you.  11/10 No need for meteors -IGN
1153	1	a	Great game. Brings back what Fable used to be and adds it's own touches.
2638	1	a	Alot of fun for an odler game. Fun with friends and the ever so not safe for work chat and in game voip. Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3   My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.
1977	0	a	Tips for noobs:  ~ Skills ~ -Alchemy, lockpicking, persuasion, and stealth are useless skills. -Up to 5 levels of each skill can be found or bought in the game (6 with DLC). -Detect hidden should be invested in immediatly. I've found Purples and Yellows in hidden chests. -Blacksmithing is incredibly OP. -Fateweavers reset all skills. Use this to maximize your training potential (You can be too overleveled in a skill to train it) -Mercantile is excellent for early game. Once you have 2mil+ gold, reallocate those points to something worthwhile.   ~ Combat ~  -Bows with the 7 charged shot ability can one shot bosses when fired at close range.  -Invest early in +health/second gear. This keeps you from overusing health pots.  -Weapon damage stats may be misleading. A Dagger with 30 phys and 30 piercing will read 60 damage. Another dagger with 20 Phys, 20 Piercing and 20 poison/5 seconds will also read as 60 damage. -Use Reckoning often; it's quick to recharge. Combine with experience potions for exponentially more exp.   ~ Misc ~ -Quests are black and white regarding moral choices. These have little repercussions. -You will outlevel the available gear considerably. -Many zones and quests will be skipped. -NEVER repair via a blacksmith. Always use repair kits, it's astronomically cheaper this way (even with 0 Blacksmithing skill) -Explore early. This aids greatly when fast traveling from redundant quest to redundant quest.  -You can buy back EVERYTHING you've ever sold in the game. Only sell to the Fence in Star's Camp. That way you can buyback anything you want (even if you stole it) if you choose to respec.
4394	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.
2252	1	a	If you like Disciples 2 then you will love this. they add a lot of things you wish 2 had yet they still missed a lot and the AI is 2 easy to master and out due even on Hard.
3759	1	a	the trexes are almost impossible to kill 
4269	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ tier game, how do you â¥â¥â¥â¥ up dinosaurs 0/10 would rather fist my own â¥â¥â¥
4240	1	a	this is the best dinosour game ever creatide  
1857	1	a	I was honestly surprised how much i enjoyed this game. It's basically a more open Fable 1.
2882	1	a	Half life 3 GOTY
2750	1	a	For $1 this game is awesome. Gunplay is alright, the auto-shotgun is satisfying, the vehicle combat is fun as hell. My only problem with the game is the vehicle spawning but overall for the price the game is amazing.
3406	1	a	Best game ever! 10/10 Worth the money, got a dragon fly and flew it to mars.
3175	1	a	Call of Duty: Dinosaurs  11/10
2046	1	a	A third person RPG with a decent combat system, pretty good character development, okay'ish boss battles and a generic storyline and lore. When you level up you choose from warrior like, archer/thief like and mage like abilities which can be mixed up for a very unique playing style.  Camera can be irritating to control during combat, fate can be built up for over powered kills with an experience boost (Fate moves can be used on bosses which usually one shots them) Lots of loot and side quests and the DLC is'nt too shabby.  Lots of playtime to be had here but overall nothing special. 7/10
4729	1	a	It is an ok game and it is definitely worth the fabulous price of 1$, it is pretty fun with multiplayer, there is workshop content and it can be played with a controller. It is laggy a lot but worth 1$, I had fun with this game. it is decent
2799	1	a	Glitchy for now... But it's AWESOME!  EDIT: 2015 This game... it has changed... from a Glitchy F@*% Fest.... into a formidable game... This is where my 2012 purchase went to..... it worth at least 10 USD....
2146	1	a	I recently bought the game for PC and haven't really played it much on PC, but on console i possibly could have logged 100+ hours when I played. I found out abou the game a few days after release, saw the cool armored characters and huge beasts to slay and immediately got excited. I looked up the trailer on youtube and was in complete awe. I love this game, highly recommend it. The combat is fluid, the quests are amazing, and the possibilities are endless. THe quests aren't repetetive like in other titles. The graphics are great for a game this old. Thankfully the game is being sold for $19.99, so now it is more available to others. I still have no problems paying full price for this game back in the day.
809	1	a	I want to start off by saying yes, this is a genuinely good game. 8.5/10 in my book. Nobody's getting paid to write all these positive reviews.  Pros:   -Excellent combat: It takes a bit of getting used to; because the game LOOKS so much like an MMO, you expect to just be able to hold down M1 and swish around. This is not the case. Combat takes a bit more skill than that, and honestly reminds me a bit of Dark Souls, just cleaned up around the edges a bit. You get several 'encounter powers' that use mana, and these come with every class. The ability to slip into 'Fate mode' is an awesome addition, basically everything slows down and the last thing you kill is smote in an epic slow-mo QTE.  -Great art style: The graphics kind of remind me of Torchlight, but if you could zoom waaay in on Torchlight and see all the little details. It's overall smooth, and, once again, reminiscent of your typical MMO. Overall the landscape is bright and colorful, and there's never a lack of things to look at even in the darkest, gloomiest caverns.   -Good animations: Overall the game flows. I suppose this ties mostly into combat, but I hardly ever see things chopping around. It's not exactly the best in show for animation, but only the occasional buggy-eyed townie and jump to another stance while in combat break the immersion, and the physics hardly ever seem out of place.  Cons:  Crafting: My biggest bone to pick with this game is the crafting system. I personally have had a difficult time figuring it out, and it really doesn't seem worth it. There are Smithing, Alchemy, and 'Sagecraft,' each representing weapon/armor crafting, potion crafting, and enchantment crafting respectively. Sagecraft is a bit like Torchlight's enchantment system, where you can upgrade gem shards into enchantments for your weapons. My problem is, I can seldom find weapons that are better than my starter (from a DLC I'm assuming) hammer, The Mountain, which lacks an enchantment slot. So I'm brought to wonder what the point of that even is. I haven't focused on Alchemy at all seeing as I can just buy potions, and am brought back to my Sagecraft problem when it comes to Smithing. Nothing I can fabricate is better than The Mountain thus far. Furthermore, the crafting skills all level with you, assuming you've put your one skill point per level into a crafting skill. There's no way to level them up besides this, which is probably just as good considering they seem to be fairly useless entities.  Music and Sounds: The music is fitting in most circumstances, but the sounds could have been done a lot better. In particular the grunts/squeals of the various characters and fauna; the action noises and other sound effects are just fine. Right off the bat though, you're met with strange grunting noises that seem out of place and repetative as your character decends from a pile of dead bodies. You can replicate this awkward, way-too-long performance at any time by repeatedly smashing the sprint button; if this is done right, the player character will take on the posture and personality of a large ape as he lopes towards his next objective, making strange gutteral noises while he does so. I also found the animals to have similarly small sound banks that tend to repeat themselves a tad too often.  Overall the pros certainly outweigh the cons, and for such a low sale price you'll get many hours of quality gameplay.

5411	0	a	Complete and utter trash. The guns are unbalnced, exploits every where, hackers,and servers with exp boost.
3375	1	a	why is this game so cheap??? It's game about surviving hordes of dinossaurs. Not that good, but not that bad either, let's say is so so.
3495	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.
1576	1	a	This game is amazing, I am having tons of fun. It is worth it on sale for sure.
1950	1	a	Lots of fun, lots to do, lots of freedom. 'Nuff said.
5544	1	a	Best game I've ever played.
4114	1	a	Game is a big surprise. Very engaging co-op. The dev took some serious â¥â¥â¥â¥ over this game when they rebranded it but it's a damn fun experience now. I'll be putting some hours into this with friends. Dont get it if you're a lonely man, but if you have lots of people to play with it's gonna eat up some hours.
5342	1	a	This game is fun, little old kind graphics but worth giving try, specially its just 1$ , for sure NOT waist of money !
4391	0	a	Wish steam refunds existed when I paid 14.99$ for this pile of garbage. Might be worth it at 99 cents but not at what I paid. I'd say the only real selling point of this game is that it has dinosaurs.
1903	1	a	Now this is a fun game. A bit limited compared to an open world like Skyrim but these two can't be lobbed into the same category. Kingdoms does do a good job at blurring the lines and so you feel the play area is larger than it is. I've played this game a few times over, so it's worth having in your lib. Needs COOP though!
4719	1	a	This video sums it all up.  https://youtu.be/zoHFWd1qi0c 
31	0	a	It's solitaire... it comes free with windows
6415	1	a	Im Happy I Got The Four Pack.
6141	1	a	This game can be a bit hectic if you thrust into it right away but it's fun, very fun!
620	1	a	Kingdoms of DMX: Shrekoning is quite possibly the best game in the ghetto.
5407	1	a	I no-scoped a T-Rex in the face.  10/10 Would 1v1 T-Rex again.
200	1	a	Awesome hidden diamond!!! Must play!
6039	1	a	its a great game 
681	1	a	A really good action Rpg that gives you tons of loot, tons of builds, and tons of awesome.
3422	1	a	To start off, let me say for only one dollar this is a must have game. I don't understand the hate in some of the reviews and in the metacritic score, as the game is very fun for just the survival and conquest gamemodes. In these modes you'll face waves unending dinosaurs, buying upgrades and guns along the way. And when you think you've got everything under control, prepare to face a T-rex, or maybe a tricerotops, either way it adds a great challenge you have to carefully approach. Lastly, mechs plus dinosaurs, what're you waiting for?
4633	0	a	you gotta kill the dinosaurs but like all you gotta do is get a choppa then its GG so don't buy this POS if you wanna play for any more than likeeeeee 2 or 3 hrs 4/10
5276	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
5318	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
2142	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. I still refer to this game when I talk about how combat should be done in current titles. It was far ahead of the curve and is still superiour in many ways. The closest thing on the market currently to it's combat style is Black Desert Online, but that feels clunky compared to the flow this game has. I so wish things had turned out differently and we'd been able to get sequels to this magnificant piece of art.
5803	0	a	Just... Just awful.
284	1	a	Good story, beautifull enviroment, adictive gameplay, freedom of character, this is one of my favorite games ever made.
3517	1	a	Shootin dinos with broselfs is dope.
5657	0	a	Now that it is free for a week you should definitely try it out. Afterwards, you can safely claim you have played the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. Jesus F**king Christ, this is absolutely garbage. Giving this game a 1/10 should be considered too much praise.
3213	1	a	Ruined my life. 'Just one more wave.' 10/10 would bang.
4970	0	a	i got this confused with primal carnage... this is not primal carnage.
26	0	a	i would not recommend this game at all - total snooze ..... everything is great except the game play mechanics.
3100	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. With guns. Also, Jetpacks. Win.
654	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Not quite skyrim, not quite WoW; somewhere in between, and I love it!
3254	1	a	I wasn't too interested in this game, but a friend bought a 4-pack for like $3. After playing the game, however, I can say this game is awesome. Its so much fun driving around yelling 'GTA MOTHA â¥â¥â¥â¥AS' while mowing down dinos. Some of the guns feel good to shoot, there are plenty of perks and guns to buy, and some of the maps are HUGE!  Unfortunately, I do have a couple problems with this game. Although there are 3 classes in the game, but I feel it is really neccessary to play the assault, due to the fact that dinos will quicky overwhelm you unless you can jetpack out. Walking around is not really a thing you can do, especially while being attacked from LITERALLY all direction. Also, vehicles can be overpowered (you can disable them though), and some of the gamemodes (that I have played), while fun, seem a bit lacking (too short usually). Some of these probelms may disappear with a larger group though (I've only played with 4), so keep that in mind  Overall, this is a really fun game though. If you think killing dinosaurs or flying around with jetpacks while killing dinosaurs is something you would like to do, then I would reccomend this game, especially if its on sale.  7.5/10
3681	1	a	If y0u like Killing Floor , then your g0nna love this game :)  Watch out for the T-rex   x
1594	1	a	A lot like the Elder Scrolls games, and just as awesome.
3545	1	a	Simple, Low Price, Dinos, BadG &amp; Laggy Menus.  IGN 11/10
3013	1	a	Woooooow...  A dollar well spent on the most ridiculous adaption of (Halo's) Firefight mode I've ever played. It's like a cross of Firefight, Planetside 2, and Dinosaurs. If you have a dollar that you don't know how exactly you want to spend, use it to buy this.   Best played while you're high on something. Seriously.
5032	1	a	Essentially, this game feels like Halo with dinosaurs and funny hats. And it's great!  Even by the time of writing this, I've not played much of it but I've already found it fun to play in. For the money you pay, the game is more than worth it. It's suprisingly solid for such a cheap game - the graphics are good, it has inclement weather and day-night cycles, there are pretty large maps, the AI work decently. It can also be pretty challenging in solo mode, plus it has multiplayer and co-op, so it can be fun for groups to play as well.  It's a well made game, albeit with a few bugs, but for the price you pay, why the hell not?  12/10 would dinosaur
5027	1	a	Somehow a game so cheap can be so fun. 100/10 IGN
4858	1	a	Wow... got this for a dollar, sooooo worth it. Funnest dinosaur game ever, and you can play as them, well how bout that ;)
5002	1	a	1$? Must be some cheap little game not worth the time. Right? No, not at ALL. This game is L4D, Killing Floor and all those other survival games with a bigger and better twist! You gain levels similar to KF but you fight not zombie, not mutants but DINOSAURS! Not just cookie cutter dinos either, each and every dino has its quirks, TRex will throw boulders at you and eat you whole. Trikes will charge you and slam the ground. Oh, and don't forget the fliers, they will pick you up and slam your face on the ground! Best 1$ I've ever spent and its gone thorugh a big upgrade since then. I would definitly throw the dollar at it, as it is literally the BEST bang for a buck.
4876	1	a	This game is awesome! The idea of the game is that dinosaurs are trying to eat your team but you all have a different idea! Blast your way to victory! I really like how you can do like in Halo and have one guy drive another shoot the turret and as many people as will fit ride along and shoot there own guns like mad! It is really awesome when a T-rex grabs your car in its mouth and trys to eat it with you in it! Eventually it just throughs the whole lot up into the air! Tons of fun and you can play with your friends! The gameplay is awesome and the grahpics are too, especially at maximum! I defenitly recmomend this game!
1110	1	a	Surprisingly excellent. Kind of a b-movie version of Skyrim or similar. The world building is quite different than the standard high fantasy you might be used to, and took me a couple of takes to get into but has a lot of depth. Combat is excellent, story is well-written and loooooong. Recommended :)
690	1	a	A must play, visualy outstanding and a great but short story line. also, if you want to have fun but the difficulty to at least high and don't cheat!
950	1	a	Beautiful game, wonderful story. A great example of a classic open world RPG.
6019	1	a	this game is not bad at all its got some lag to it but it is fun!!
4416	1	a	Very interesting 1 euro game. The game is nice but the achievements are boring... too booring.
6135	1	a	Cheap, fun, tones of guns and you get to to kill Santa Claus 10/10
1510	1	a	Fable and The Elder Scrolls all rolled into one
1115	1	a	Very fun game, The game is very detailed and has much story in it. Combat is very smooth and full of action. You can create your own class based on the number of points you spend in either Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue) or Sorcery(speaks for itself, right?). Depending on skills chosen you rise further and further into your skill tree. Hybrid class is also very possible.
2156	1	a	It's an action-oriented World of Warcraft with several classes/dual classing, fairly entertaining combat mechanics, an interesting crafting system, great sound, whimsical graphics, and good production values. It can be played quite well with keyboard or controller and ALL KEYS ARE REBINDABLE (â¥â¥â¥â¥off Fallout 4)!
3610	1	a	this game is everything i was looking for
3214	1	a	Its like skyrim with guns 9/10
5684	1	a	If this game was a fork it would be a great fork   10/10 would use it again
263	1	a	This is what Skyrim or Gothic should have been! Where other popular games failed imo, this game suceeds!  About the reasons: The graphics and the sound are great, the atmosphere is good, the story is interesting, the world is huge, the game mechanics are well developed, the gameplay is fluid, the battles are awesome, the controls are intuitive and the crafting is deep and satisfying.
549	1	a	This game needed more knowing that it got. Its a sad story what happened the the game devolpers...  This game is creative, and has combat that feels good.   If you like fantasy RPGs, try it. Seriously.  10/10
6326	0	a	This game can be, 'fun' but it really isnt that great. The graphics arent what they were portrayed to be and most everything else is just terrible quailty, do not reccomend.
5826	0	a	This just does not work, is not complete, may be labelled a tech demo or concept draft. Certainly it's not a game. May be jolly in 2014.
5823	0	a	This game is incredibly buggy and unfinished after years of the work, the dev is a hack who stole assets and actively stole money from the player's base via indiegogo.  This game isn't worth supporting ignoring all of the terrible things the dev has done, the game is unfinished, buggy and not fun.
3870	1	a	This Dino killing game is very fun to play, it is super cheap and the gameplay is satasfying.
5009	1	a	For 89 cents per copy, the game is totally worth it. If only for the ability to shoot dinosaurs- its fantastic. Despite a plethora of bugs, its the best dinosaur fighting game yet. That being said, the developers are pretty marginal as a business and studio. But for the price it is, the game is amazing.
5135	1	a	Nothing can go wrong with dinosaurs!
1224	1	a	Perfect RPG game! The only thing (2 actually) I hate is the Environment limit and Items Durability.
3377	1	a	This game is tons of fun! Got it on sale , but having so much fun playing co-op / survival with my wife that it would be worth full price. Pretty easy game to learn with enought variety to make it fun , but not so much to make it overly complicated. Love the fact that I can set up a friends only game with bots. Makes it fun with just 2 of us playing. ( Or single player ). Bots actually work pretty good !! Will heal you as well as get in vehicles with you. Graphics are very good and gameplay runs prettty smooth. Really nice game to just jump in and blow the crap out of some dinosaurs! Good variety of vehilces , weapons , maps , and augmentations. I was'nt expecting much for a game that was so inexpesive , but was extremly surprised &amp; happy on how good this game turned out to be! One of the best values for the money I've gotten. Would definately reccomend this game !!
5162	1	a	- Disclaimer I am here for the gameplay, not the Legal issues, the amount of games that have had copy right strikes are deeply loved and no-one cared.  -Review Time. I actually enjoyed my time on this game, especially for a 1$ game, it is fun, character is customisable, aswell as being able to play as a dino.
439	1	a	Great game, i have this game in my library pretty much since it was released and never got to try it out, but a few weeks ago i found a documentary about the downfall of 38 studios and found that this game was some kind of test for much bigger tittle that never come to see the light of day (one thing is certain, if it was better that this one, its a shame that never got completed). Im doing this review now bc the game is on sale right now, im at 104 hour in game and didnt completed the game yet (but i usually do every side quest, look every rock and that kind of stuff but didnt touch in any of the dlc story yet, so my money is already worth while).  This game is kind of the Fable Lost Chapter with few diferent combat mechanics, many side quests to do, tasks, some story choices that turn things out for good vs evil, and a very well scattered Lore behind all life in Amalur, and believe me, so much Lore, backstory, insane amount of dialogs that you could build another story just was much was rich was this one.  The combat is satisfying but there are a few things to keep in mind and avoid to ruin the experience, never enter dungeons before any task told you to, to keep enemy at your level and avoid overpowered character early in game, you cant really do nothing outside of them bc after while, doesnt matter where, enemys are much lower level that you, but dungeons, always bring enemys to your current level. Tasks are a good way to get money or materials since they never end and you can always get the reward for completing them since the moment you accept them.  There are so much information to be found in the world, that if you like this kind of background story like me, you have so many hours to get entertainement out of it, and even that the combat sometimes get a bit repetitive, it doesnt really detach you from trying to know more about everything.
409	1	a	I quit console gaming a few years ago. I had Kingdom's of Amalur when I first got my PS3 and had been playing on and off ever since. Between the PS3 and PC version, I probably have ~200+ hours invested and just about caught in progress in relation to my console play time. The core game itself has way more content than Skyrim with all of its DLC put together. No exaggerating, you're going to get your money's worth when it comes to content.  Kingdoms of Amalur is one of those titles that suffers from the gaming industry itself and faded into obscurity under its own weight. A shame too because there was a MMORPG in the works. But enough of the meta.  Essentially, the game is a single player ARPG that draws a lot from the Fable series and does it much better in most aspects. Combat is fluid, requiring timed button presses to block/counter or generate different effects from abilities and spells. Your character growth is based on three skill trees: Might, (your warrior) Finesse, (rogue) and Sorcery. (mage) On top of those trees, you have classes that are dependant on how many points you mix or match in the three trees. You can fully invest in one tree to gain access to exclusive abilities, split two trees into a formidable skillset or even split all three and fully customize a class to your playstyle, all with different bonuses as incentive.  The story is a bit hit or miss. There's a lot of that 'Chosen One' trope being overused, but the world itself is interesting enough when you get into the literature and lorestones you find along the way. You do, however get to make choices that have lasting effects withint the narrative. (or telling proclaimed by the Fae) Most of which will affect how certain NPCs react to you as the story goes on. Without saying much, consider how you go about doing things because different actions could create more desirable outcomes. At the very least, save often.  Definitely reccomending this to any Fable, Two Worlds, The Witcher, and even Elder Scroll's fans. While Kingdom's of Amalur doesn't have the depth of an Elder Scrolls and Witcher game, or the disappointment of a Fable or Two Worlds, there's a litte of something for everyone. I'd compare it to finding a nickel on the ground but finding out it's one of those rare coins that happens to be worth $500.
4048	1	a	Coop is a blast but the team vs team is wonky and needs to be fixed I found my self nearly unmovable on some maps as a dino.
3238	1	a	Very adictive Game
4309	1	a	Nice game
3229	1	a	fun coop with friends
4636	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. It got bad scores for coming out incomplete but has been updated a ton soon after. It's a good coop survival game to play with some friends.
4531	0	a	I decided to play solo, and I've been killed by a raptor who was at least 5m away from me. Then I decided to run a little test on their AI = basically walking heat-seeking missiles with claws. -10/10 would not play again
1923	1	a	A very underappreciated game, fun story and the DLC's are actually worth it.
2923	1	a	perfect blend of crazyness halo openish worlds and players
932	1	a	Its a good game, but it gets very repetitive, epescially if you like completing all the side quests.   The gameplay itself is very good (i'd recommend a controller, but mouse/keyboard works fine) as is the main story line. Character development is well tuned, pick your play style, pick your weapons and your good to go. Combat is fluid and well paced, and a lot of fun.  I'd recommend the base game, if you get to the end and want more get the DLC's but you may well have had your fill by then. Ultimately I got bored im guessing about 3/4 of the way through the main game and stopped playing, that was 80 hours worth doing most of the sidequests for the first half of the game then ignoring them after that. most subquest rewards are very generic, so dont burn yourself out with them. if anything look up a guide on character skill bonuses and just do those ones.
509	1	a	Came for the combat system. Stayed for the open world. Yahtzee called this game 'My First Skyrim' He wasn't kidding. Over 200 hours in and im still not done! Had a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blast with this. Can not recommend this enough!   P.S. Hey Rhode Island if you're reading this, work out a deal with a publisher. Or just cut your losses and sell the damn IP already! We need mods ASAP!!
4907	1	a	nice coop shooting game, they made the graphics better even.. well worth the euro 
1470	1	a	It may seem a bit dull at first, but when you get enough levels and skill upgrades, this game really begins to shine!
3904	1	a	Body turned cold.
4903	0	a	the trailer made this game look like it was going to be a spinoff of ARK: Survival Evolved... but it turned out to be an arena game. At least it was only 50 cents! 
943	1	a	KoA: Reckoning is about a guy who used to be dead but isen't dead anymore, that just woke up and was totally fine. In fact, he was better than he ever used to be, considering that he woke up from death with the skills of a warriorninjawizard. After very widely escaping from a magical hit-squad trying to make him re-dead, he goes on to wander into a guy that tells him he exists outside the system and that he can do whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ he damn well pleases. He goes on to solve the problems of the people, killing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of anything that gets in his way one way or another, and occasionally breaking someone's fate, effectively changing it from âHappy lifeâ to âBrutal bloody death via me.â because he can. After learning how to do this, he goes on to do a quest for Zelda for the womanâs equal rights movement. He's so awesome, animals feasting upon their prey completely don't notice him until he's stabbing them in the face. Anyone with a brain should not play this. 5/5
3132	1	a	ORION: Prelude is super glitchy and half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... but for some reason, it's really fun. It was $0.99 when I bought it... perfectly priced.   Buy a copy for each of your friends, have a stupid amount of fun playing with them and laughing at the game... don't ever play it again and still feel like it was money well spent.
4237	1	a	(Going to update this as time goes by, but just know that the dev does update the game to this day, and it's really good fun! I'd suggest the reason a lot of people don't like it, is that it's in a different gameplay style than they're used to. But seriously it's a 8/10 for me.)
4231	1	a	  Sure, it might not be the greatest game ever and there are some funny â¥â¥â¥ glitches at times. And sure, maybe there are many FPS games that are funner to play. And sure, maybe one of the dinosaurs i ended up looking inside of.  But you know what, i enjoyed the wackiness of this game and plus the developers seem to have no problem admitting the faults of the game either! So yeah, you could say this game grew on me....a LOT. I would highly recommend buying it since it's so cheap, but if you can't buy it, than maybe you could get a friend to gift it to you like mine did.
2910	1	a	Get in the car Ram the T-Rex The car flies in the air 10DINOS/10  
3048	1	a	Amazing game! Love the graphics!
3620	1	a	This game isn't exactly one that has deep gameplay but well, shooting apart a bunch of dinosaurs with friends is just plain fun. If you grab it during a sale you'll probably get your money's worth.
3669	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
4852	1	a	Great game play it with friends :DDD
1986	1	a	If fable and skyrim had a baby, this would be it. I find myslef doing every sidequest not because of the xp, but because the dialouge is so engaging and tthe story is so well writen that i cant help myself. A must have game!
4965	1	a	A few things that make this game a damn good multiplayer: 1. You get to play as a T-rex and a Spinosarus 2. You get the same kinda gameplay as Halo and other high tech shooters 3. You get to fight said T-rex and Spino with mechs and tanks 4. Im The Bay Harbor Butcher  And yup those are all the reasons why you need this game
1071	1	a	This game is absolutely fantastic! The controls are easy to use, quality character customization, great story, visually beautiful, and loads of fun to play. If you like Elder Scrolls Skyrim it's hard to believe you won't enjoy this game too (if it's possible, maybe even more).
4361	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced. The dinosaurs were photorealistic, but I guess you would expect that from a top quality studio like ummm... whoever makes this bloody game. 10/10 very good. btw i love the jurassic park movies if anyone has a spare copy of jurassic park 1 id be happy and id probably blow you. Lots of love Adolf Linkin.
3749	1	a	I don't even own this game!
5327	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
994	1	a	Such a shame that 38 Studios went down under after the release of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. I believe this is what Dragon Age 2 should have been, while it may lack in some parts of its narrative, there are all kinds of things that can get you immersed, I do believe this is a great game to buy, preferred when its on sale.
5289	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
5922	1	a	-rep Activision for trying to remove this beautiful game from Steam because they are idiots who want all the money.
2794	1	a	Brief: An extremely underrated dinosaur survival game well worth the small cost.  Pros: +GRATUITIOUS DINOSAURS! +Play as a dino or a human +Bots for offline play +Various game modes +'Avatar' style vehicles +Various weapons/cosmetics +Decent graphics with nice effects +Skill tree per match +Endless survival mode (or maybe I'm just too rubbish to reach the end)  Cons: -Gameplay gets a little stale after a while
6121	1	a	$1 to get rekt so hard by a dino you break the map 10/10
3168	1	a	dinosaurs, lasers, guns, futureristic,lightsabers,jeeps,hover vehicles,and drones what more of a cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥ can u ask for  1000/1000-MGN would play again
3779	1	a	Kinda like Primal Carnage, but different. Really difficult with out a team, but add in some friends and its really fun.
6237	1	a	Honestly, this is great fun. Get a few friends, yell, shoot dinosaurs and probably get straight chomped by a T-Rex. Also, there are tanks and mechs and such. The game is pretty janky, granted, but it's fun as hell.
4279	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1032	1	a	Pretty good game, sad that they couldn't make a multiplayer which would have made this game amazing. At least a co-op
946	1	a	This game is AWESOME! I love the fact that you can upgrade your character as the game progresses and the scenery is awesome. I am a big fan of open world games and character customization! The DLC to this game is amazing as well. Easily a game you can get lost into. (^_^)
5214	1	a	ORION Dino Hord is a firstperson shooter/survivel game.You need to protect a genarotor while surviving you gest it hordes and hordes of dinosaurs. The way you look is like halo and you acn bye cooler armor to make your person look better. in all this game is a 7/10 and maby not worth evry peni but a good game!
3613	1	a	Besty game 2010 cooldnt ask 4 betr game to b made, jk! This game peice of crap in bumhole! Cant even no scope nothin caus guns only pistols god damm jesuz plz! orio prelube is 0/100 even for 1 dollar is still squabbly to play. Cant even get startd to play be4 i die to DAMM RAPTORS OF DEATH! dc approved this game because of marvel iron man. plz ackowledg me cause i really good at leegue of leggings.
1101	1	a	I had more fun playing this game than any other RPG since Oblivion. I thought the graphics, sound, NPCs, character development, and quest lines were great. I waited about a month after release to buy the game. I installed all the patches and had no issues with bugs. I was very surprised the game did not do better during it's initial release.
1165	1	a	Single player MMORPG.
2544	1	a	team duel - the most fun i've ever had gaming - 5v5 using only lightsabers, bows, temperary stealth and super jumps... need i say more... no, no i don't.
5813	1	a	'ORION: Dino Horde' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous and survival-based cooperative gameplay, 'ORION: Dino Horde' features intense, retro-inspired and over-the-top PvP competitive action via 'The Arena' in which each mode focuses on a specific homage or battle-type.   Can you survive the Dinosaur Horde?
4270	0	a	NO DAD I DONT WANT TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF
226	1	a	7/10   This open world single player frpg is no Skyrim(what else is?), but it has the potential to engross you for many hours if you like this type of game. The game suffers a bit from feeling like it was a template for an MMO more than being designed strictly as a single player frpg.    PROs +Lots of content -- skills, items, quests, zones +Action combat +Open world (sort of) +Fully voiced NPCs +No significant bugs encountered +Fate weaving was an interesting game mechanic  CONs -No jump key -Narrow zones in lieu of a true open world -Cartoony graphics reminiscent of WoW. Low polygons with vibrant coloring -Mildly annoying inventory management, (mostly)mitigated by fast travel. and an in game stash -A little slow at first   +/- The lore in the game was fairly deep, but I personally did not find the lore(or story for that matter) particularly compelling. ymmv.  +/- Not particularly difficult. Some may say too easy.   Conclusion: Holy crap,did you really read everything to this point? cough.... If you are between AAA games, can find this on sale, and have a hankering for a big single player frpg, this may be a game you should try.
3457	1	a	Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!  This is a First person shooter game.    Interface/Menu/Settings
5837	1	a	You run around and shoot dinosaurs, teammates optional. WARNING! you may see senses that look like direct outtakes from Avartar, if you don't like that movie, try not to think about it.
632	1	a	It says i have 2 hours but i've racked up 70+ hours in offline mode (i played this game during internet shortages etc), and boy. Was. It. Fun. I had alot of enjoyment doing the finishers from the reckoning mode and that made my day that massive bonus exp.  Its got its own pros and cons such as -Rather Small world +Vibrant Colours -Creatures get repititive +Great Combos, and I Mean GREAT. Combos. -The DLC Weapon and Armour Pack is rather weak, as it's more of early game. +The Two other DLCs provide an additional 3-4 hours of content, and rather interesting stuff too, i'd probably like it more if they also added additional races, that'd be sweet.
628	1	a	i recommend this game to all my friends its a really good game to play
1533	1	a	This game is as fun as you'd want your RPG. IT has all the clasic elements of a good RPG, but at a quick pace where it makes you feel like you are conqueering the entire universe with the with only the tip of your own â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is because you have that power. Only you.    In all seriousness, it is actually different from the normal boring RPG where you are some orphan or something and you find out you ball have some special power. YOU DIED. Thats how the game starts. i am addicted to this game and I'm about to go play again. Click buy. beleive me. don't be a wimp  
4454	0	a	This is so bad, not even worth 49 cents.
1846	1	a	im addicted to this game it reminds my of my first time playing fable 3 :D
699	1	a	its sooooooooo good game amazing mmo rpg so mush fun time ....you could spend so mush hours just on sidquest
2208	0	a	I was a fan of Disciples 1 and 2 but all the Disciples 3 games seems to me inferior and not fun at all. The comparison to  Heroes of Might &amp; Magic  is very misleading because, in  Disciples , the level up of your units is so long that you have to keep the same 4-6 units for a whole map and grind slowly with many small battles without an ounce of tactics. The art is not as good as in Disciples 2. And the highest graphics settings don't do any good because of a very mediocre engine. Conclusion : Highly disappointed. I can't see any redeeming quality for this game.
3988	0	a	It's really bad... its confusing, ugly, pointless and crashes all the time
4568	1	a	I got the option to make a review for a game I never played    The trailer looks cool,might pick it up
3464	1	a	love it all the wasy but sometimes a little lame when you bye your self fun with other
5841	0	a	give me my Â¢.49 back
2035	0	a	The Story:   I found out about this game after doing some late night googling on Salvatore. 20 years ago I started reading his books and was amazed that I completely missed the fact that he worked on a game and it immediately went on my wishlist. The main story was okay, I don't really have any complaints but I didn't really feel any Salvatore coming through and I am unmoved. Anyone could have written/helped write the world and I wouldn't know any difference.   The Art:   Simultaneously I found out Todd Mccfarlane had some play in the art and I have an entire box of Spawn comics. My favorite childhood artist and writer together for one game, holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. The color is great in the game but the lack of detail is mind boggling. Todd put so much detail into spawn comics and seeing character models without fingernails was just disgraceful. The graphics and animations are rather plain and nothing here is an artistic achievement. At one cutscene I recall a female soldier being shot in the back with an arrow and I think they tried to animate blood coming out of her mouth but it just looked like it was pouring out her face. Mediocrity is the theme for the art.   The Gameplay:   Through and through this is a single-player MMO action rpg. You could take any free to play mmo, remove the multiplayer and nothing about this game would outshine any of the uncountable amounts of games in the genre. Pretty much each zone has a town, each town has npcs with exclamation marks giving out fetch and kill quests. Each zone is linked together by a passage. There are basic tradeskills with the classic WoW style herb gathering, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing (except the last two you get regeants from chests and not nodes) and you don't need to invest in any of them although healing potions are the end all-most powerful item in the game as you can just spam them like Diablo 1. The skilltrees are decent, on par with something like diablo 2. The combat is mediocre to bad for an action game but better than an RPG like Skyrim. The main storyline is about 12 hours long and 'literally' 70% of the time you will be walking from one point to another like a really bad mmo, 20% of the time you will sit in inconsequential conversations and 10% fighting. The final boss was terribly boring/uninspiring/unchallenging and the entirety of the game was not challenging except at one point my main quest enemies became red (as opposed to neutral level enemies that are yellow, just like any mmo) and they were mostly unkillable. I went back to the surface leveled twice off yellow monsters (the 'open world' monsters scale to your level) came back and walked through the rest of the game without even trying.   Verdict:  Theres a lot of game here.. You could put 200 hours into fetch and kill quests if you wanted to and you can respec your skills as much as you want. If you (like me) have a history of playing mmos and you have no desire to grind out fetch quests ever again for the rest of your life just avoid this less than mediocre ftp-single player-mmo action game. If you have never played an mmo, or you love fetch and kill quests this game is ripe with them for many many hours.
4366	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was only 49 cents!
1535	1	a	Good times right here.
2159	1	a	Fable meets Skyrim. If you like both, you'll love this game. Highly recommended 9/10. DLC is worth buying as well.   PS: Beware the Chicken Overlords.
3765	0	a	Why am I constantly strafing left?
2645	0	a	I played this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.Bad graphic
3643	1	a	This is the greatest game I've ever played.
3492	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
983	1	a	I bought this because of the outstanding reviews and wasn't sure what exaclty to expect. I'm no game connoisseur but I can get lost playing Skyrim for 24+ hours straight and I have high expectations for a open-world/RPG type game...this hasn't disapointed me yet. It's has a complex system of crafting, abilites, classes, weaponry... The multitude of weapon choices is probably my favorite part. It's everything you would expect from a game of this genre and then some.  It has a fantastic story line that vaguely reminds me of lord of the rings. The graphics remind me of my WoW days with a hint of Fable III.   I love that fact that there is a quickbar (something that annoys me in many games), the ability to switch between primary and secondary weapons, an awesome skill build system, and really just the ability to take control of every aspect of gameplay. It's almost like a awesome marriage between some of the best games but with it's own twist. The lock-picking/stealing and sagecrafting is what really sold me as I started playing, this game really does have it all. There's usually issues with any sort of crossover to PC game, but this has handled wonderfully on my system (which is by no means a top of the line build) and I didn't have to adjust the graphics down to be able to play comfortably.   Just buy it. At times it can seem a little bit childish or PG but it's never long before something jumps out at me and scares my pants off. You really won't be disapointed by this.   As a huge skyrim fan: 8.5/10 As an ADHD kid: 10/10
3604	1	a	There are lightsabers.... 11/10
2800	1	a	Briliante Game'a :P recommend it :)
1604	1	a	This game is well worth the $12 price for the game and all the DLC.  Hack a slash RPG that gets everything about the combat correct.The story is a little bland,but still well worth playing with how massive it is.
629	1	a	This game is great, pretty heavy actually but who cares the game is well made, nice graphics, smooth gameplay its interesting because its no like some games where u pick a class and its the almost the same as the others in this game the 3 set of skill or abilites that u can choose are unique they all have their own style, on each skill tree u can choose diferent type of weapons which u can use to create a lot of unique combos. The history its interesting sometimes i can't stop playing because i want to know what is going to happen when i finish the quest, plus u have different type of side quest, not only the usual side quest but faction quest to that can help to get some permanent bonus when u finish the entire quest or quest that u can repeat to get make some cash. The game itself its all around u can picks the paths in the story and depending on ur choice u might get different rewards or results. something that i really like its the balance between the classes it is actually balance. I strongly recommend this game if u like long games with intresting story with different paths lots of enterteaning quests and nice gameplay not so fast but not that slow its just the way it has to be.
6229	1	a	The game is actually really fun despite its lackluster graphics and off physics. Theres a decent enough array of dinosaurs and the game does get challenging, the vehicles are fun to drive, theres a good assortment of them and overall its a fun experience. Its definetley worth the $15 price tag, and i was lucky nough to have gotten it for only $1.50.
5018	1	a	Guns and dinosaurs? Much wow, such bite, much pain, so hospital, much swag, much death.
6314	1	a	Great game for the very low price (depending when you buy it) Dont trust the metacritic score
5906	0	a	this game is garbage. the ai is bad and the teradactals are s op you usually die from them.Also the guns are garbage and the dinos are just focused on the genorator and if it goes offline you loose.  so dont waste the dollar this game is this game should be .0000000000000000001$
713	1	a	Buy it its worth it nuff said   10/10
4159	1	a	Great concept, lots of options, nice co-op, it's a keeper!
3023	1	a	Best game I ever bought for $0.75
2893	1	a	10/10 not expected games that cost 0.74$ (summersale) are bad, but not this one
4905	1	a	Don't go out and buy that packet of Doritos!   Spend it on this, it's amazing! Be sure you have friends you can play with though. Then you can 1v1, survive hordes of dinosaurs, or 5v5 pvp and even lightsaber duels!
6090	1	a	dis, dis is a good game, buy it, it cheap,buy it ,it is like aneling youurself with a fineliner 
5050	0	a	Wait times are too long to get into the fun. You join a game, have to watch other people play for 5+ minutes before any fun starts.
3834	1	a	Chum is fum
4128	1	a	Its horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
1276	1	a	I enjoy this game because of the character costomization and wide veriety of weapons
2076	1	a	One of the best action RPGs of the last 4 years on PC. Very long game with an epic story line, excellent fight mechanics, great blacksmithing/crafting, fun DLC....pick it up now!!! You won't be disappointed.
4359	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
729	1	a	Fun, a sort of Skyrim light. Neat stories and quests, but the voice acting gets kind of repetitive despite how good it is.
1214	1	a	In the words of my favorite youtuber northernlion... 'It's real good'
5878	0	a	I believe beep is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. This game completely changed my life. I was going through some rough times and the 30 minutes I spent on Beep changed my life. This is the best game ever it stopped me from drinking the full 10 ounces of bleach in order to kill myself. The complex and emotional story had me in awe. The bonk engine made this game look like it was real life. The vibrant colors and effects makes this game look on par with games like Battlefield One. If you do not already have this game buy it RIGHT NOW.
3360	0	a	Too expansive for 0,49 cents. Horrible, and isn't shiny. :&lt;
3387	1	a	i dont even know where to begin 10/5 would not play again
4085	0	a	Ok, so this game is a bit misleading... 'The metacritic score is missleading' Notice none of these quotes have actual citation... Because noone but the developers said it. Don't be fooled by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t comments. Good thing it's on sale. This is the most revenue this game will ever generate.  WHY IT'S BAD: Ai is terrible, gameplay is simplistic and boring, artwork is meh. Don't waste your penny's. I fully intend to ask for a refund because I bought the 4 pack to play with friends.  1/10 (Because every game created deserves a little credit)
967	1	a	Hands down one of the best RPG games I've played - topping along with Skyrim and Fallout-series.  I noticed a lot of people comparing this to a Fable/Dragon Age-hybrid, however I think it stands out from either of those with its own unique style - still maintaining key elements to making the game highly fun.  All you need to know about this game is written below (you can thank me later...)  - The graphics are noteworthy for its 'comical' - even somewhat childish - scale, but that only sweetens the pot. - The gameplay (in terms of combat/skills/ability) it's fluently vigorating and superbly executed. Combining both weapon-combos along with spells/skills, you can create a butt-load of different ways to dispatch enemies. - Reckoning mode - enough said - Combine a great arsenal of skills and spells from 3 different class-types - Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue/ranger) and Sorcery (mages) - progess to the top tier of any of those 3 styles or even combine 2 - hell - even all 3 into a staff-wielding, trap-setting, Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Hook-pulling, Hammer-smashing God(!) of power - The loot - so many items, so many sets and crafting combos. Damn, son! - Voice-acting/sounds and music - it's solid, not anything revolutionary, but solid - Keeps track of how many chickens you kill    Highly recommended  9.2/10 
4571	1	a	You can ride an entire mech ontop of a VTOL in this at full speed - it's seriously ridiculous fun.  It's unpolished, but the old reviews don't take into account that this game has gone a long way through updates.  It's cheap, with lots of content and gamemodes sure to keep you playing for many hours.  While it has buggy animations and other small problems, it's still a really fun game and the scale of fighting huge dinosaurs is fun - refreshing from the zombie game crowd.  Lots of gamemodes, maps, and things to do.
3973	1	a	Fun. Cool too.  I want that song from the third video.
922	1	a	If you decide to play this, make sure you skip most (if not all) side quests. Otherwise, the story is too drawn out and the game becomes unchallenging from over-leveling.
352	1	a	 Here's the tl;dr at the top of the post: Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is absolutely worth your time.   Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG created by the unfortunately defunct 38 Strudios. After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a  lot  of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that  feel  like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.    Let's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:   - Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.   This bullet is not exaggerating with the 'hundreds of hours' bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.  One of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.    Okay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:   - Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.   Kingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.  If you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.    Lots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:   - Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.   - Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.   The combat system is a hybrid of  God Of War  and the  Fable  series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.  Combat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say 'softly' is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.  Spells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.  The 'Fateshift' mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!    Alright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:   - Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.   - Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.   When it comes to character classes, there are three main choices:  Might  (Warrior),  Finesse  (Rogue), and  Sorcery  (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.  Also, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.    There you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters. Good luck in Amalur!   http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1403.msg22646#msg22646 
4832	1	a	this game needs a steam workshop for mods. NEEDS.
159	1	a	Pretty fun game. I bought it because someone told me it has a massive game world and is fun to play - both of those things are true but the game world is split into pathways, so not quite as open as you'd think. A lot of the areas in the game just feel like hubs with different strands and pathways leading out into other hub areas. It's pretty weak to be honest and not a patch on something like Skyrim which feels like a vast, breathing world. The world here is dull, lifeless, populated by NPC's that are only really there to serve you. A shame, as the visual look of the environment is really lovely, but because of the design of the paths you never really get to appreciate the vast cliffs or forrests or deserts or anything.   The game boasts a metric tonne of quests, which is good, but really this just lends itself to feeling even more lifeless as it just feels like NPC's are kinda waiting around to have a chat with you about the rats in their house. Most quests are a bit of a waste of time and only the main quest line has anything worth paying attention to. I just skipped past most quest dialogue, sadly.  The combat is really fun. It operates on a combo/button combination basis and I thought it was a blast. Levelling up makes you feel genunely powerful as levelling up your different powers adds visual effects to your attacks and even special moves - it sounds gimmicky when I describe it to you here but somehow it kinda works. I had a pure mage and managed to level her to the point where I felt pretty godly. A lot of RPG's these days miss this feeling of superiority so it's nice to see a modern action RPG do this again.  I guess I really enjoyed the game - I did play it for 15 hours after all but also, it kinda felt more like a 3rd person Torchlight than anything close to Skyrim or any other RPG's you like. But to be fair I just thought it was quite mediocre in places. If there was a 'meh' rating i'd put that but i guess a thumbs up will have to do.
3835	1	a	A Dino? Go Get my sniper rifle!
5567	1	a	good game, ive not played it a lot, but it cost 9.99 â¬ i think. i bought it for 0.99 â¬ and the default price is now 0.79 â¬? what the quack? but anyway its a good game with dinosaurs .  8/10
157	1	a	i can't believe it's taken me this long to discover this game. if i had known about it when it came out, i would have been all over this. it's sad that the dev has shut down and this game won't see a sequel, but it seems like there is a HUGE ammount of content to get through in this game as it stands. the world is really thriving, and i haven't played an RPG before where i've felt like the world i'm in is really varied and dynamic.  also, the magical gameplay is second to none. if you're like me and you salivate over anything remotely magical, GET THIS GAME.
5792	1	a	Have you ever wanted to feel the sensation of stepping on a rusty nail with your bare foot? Then this is the game for you. I tell ya, Oreo Prelude was a great way to curb my hunger. Unfortuantely, it really spoiled my appetite as I played this at 5:30 PM and I normally want to eat dinner at 6:00 PM, because of this I was unable to enjoy my pizza ravioli platter. The milk mechanics in this game are almost real but in the end you just remember that it's all an illusion: like actual equality in America. Some people may be lured in by the low price of this game, but I'd say you're better off going to see Pixar's 'The Good Dinosaur' because the word 'good' is in the title and will never be used in conjunction with this game, also it's always great to lather your hand with butter and rub one out during a kids' movie. 6/10
843	1	a	If you like MMO's but are looking for something a bit different with an amazing combat system this game is for you. it is a bit repetitive but the character development is interesting and makes you feel very powerful. i highly reccomend this game for endless hours of fun  side note: the DLC's are worth it!
4230	0	a	This game is so broken. I haven't experienced any actual bugs, but the Dinosaurs are so overpowered that all the gamemodes aren't even that fun. Survival is okay for a couple of hours, but it is the only DECENT gamemode. All the others are just boring, overused by most games, and if there are dinosaurs involved, considerably unbalanced. For this game to go on 93% to get some sales just shows the desperation of this producer...   I would give it a 4/10 at most, and that is being generous. This game is pretty much a waste of a dollar, so unless it is on sale that much, I highly recommend not getting
1247	1	a	I really like the game! I've never really been into RPGs, I played a little Oblivion &amp; a little Skyrim, but thats mostly it.  But for some reason this game just sucked me in. I can definetly recommend this game if you like lore, and side quest and just in general way to much to do.   Only negative point is the inventory space, see I'm a hoarder. As soon as something is rare I won't throw it away. But there is an easy way to work around this problem. Google is your friend.
367	1	a	Wonderful game! Underrated gem. GRaphics are a little toony, but gameplay and combat mechanics as a dual wielding fae-blade guy it so damn nice. ONe of the first games i look forward trying again!
1959	1	a	excellent game game of year 
1770	1	a	Contains many quest really kills time
6006	1	a	very pretty, very flashy, very fun with freinds. it's as if halo classic was remade with dinosars. the animations are meh, and the previous versions were a mess, but i think this one is juuust right
2312	1	a	I knifed a pterodactyl while jetpacking over my friend who was fighting a T Rex with a bow and shotgun
4462	0	a	I just got this game. I don't know wtf is going on but I can't connect to any servers. It either takes me back to the main menu or doesn't do anything at all. It won't even let me play solo mode. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
4236	1	a	i actually bought a skin for my character in this game with my hard earned cash. immediately regretted it  10/10
2003	1	a	Game for people who like to search for chests and defeat monsters on their great adventure through the Amalur!  I have played this game as a non-steam game and as a steam game so I have more than 400 hours of gameplay in total, I think. The game is a good game for people who like adventure games (such as Skyrim or GW2) and for people who just simply like to smash people (God Mode?).  Good: +Good graphics +Interesting story +Character backgrounds +Customizability of the character +Many weapons and different paths you can choose +Is a bit different on each time you play it  Bad: -Has a tendency to crash sometimes -The combos do not work properly sometimes
2526	1	a	At first this game didn't seem that apealing, but when I started eating it I kind of liked the taste.
865	0	a	There is a game breaking bug that they know about and never patched. I knew it was an EA title and figured it couldn't possibly be a waste of money for six bucks. I was wrong. set your money on fire instead.
6253	1	a	Super fun game! The co-op gameplay is freaking awesome, i brought this game for $1.50 and it's worth more than that for sure. I also host an Aus server when i play so feel free to join me.   7/10 for gameplay 1/10 story (there is no story) 4/10 Animations(they are pretty bad on raptors) 8/10 FPS  Overall 6/10(For steam summer sale 10/10)   If you are thinking of buying this for steam summer sale you will not regret it
6164	1	a	you got my respect game
3889	1	a	Very good game and a lot of fun for not much money :) recommend for everyone that want to grind some prehistoric animals.
3418	1	a	A good game and it plays very well for the size of the game
5163	1	a	when people ask me if i like to play orion: prelude i look at them and say 'I CAN'T STOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP' DOO DOO DA DOO DOO
3116	1	a	If your looking for a game to chill with this is one of my favourites. Well worth buying when its oin sale :D 
3575	1	a	Would be flung by T Rex again and make love to on dark nights. 24/10
3480	1	a	You can be a futuristic guy or black guy or girl from the future and kill other guys/black guys/girls from the future or you can kill dinosaurs with your friends or alone. And you can wear hats. I got it for free and not gunna lie its pretty fun and entertaining if I've got time to pass (unlockables would be nice). I guess its worth it though. Buy it unless you're scared
2601	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
3760	1	a	better than sex
3891	1	a	ONLY FOR 0,49 eur, seriously WTF??!?!?44! Nice game brooooos!
2175	1	a	A great underated game.
3085	1	a	This is a very silly game, for very silly people. All of this is in my opinion, keep in mind.  Graphics: Lovely Fun to be had: Lots Punching of the dino faces: Rediculously fun  I've had one game crash when I joined the server so far, so keep in mind this could be a problem,  but you can easily host your own public (Or friends-only) server in-game without third party software or paying,  which is a plus in my book.  It's Â£1, buy it, do it now (This only applies to the sale this review was written on, and possibly any future sales), although, for the full price of Â£12, I would find it a bit hard to recommend, but something to keep your eye on.
6322	1	a	only words.....................awesome!
103	1	a	(Played over 300+ hours non-Steam)  This game belong in the pantheon of the greatest RPGs ever created!  The combat is pretty much Fable, Skyrim &amp; God of War put into 1 game with a wonderful execution, the most enjoyable combat system that I have ever come across.  The world is huge and encourages you to explore it - there is a lot of lore present &amp; quite a lot of interesting characters too. Also, the characters have a LOT to say, and it seems that every voice (which are a lot) are all different &amp; it brings out a lot of immersion. A lot of variety in the areas you can visit too, you have deserts, plains, marshes, canyons and what not.  Almost nothing bad about this game, perhaps sometimes a bit texture pop-in, some boring fetch quests &amp; characters that look-a-like, but the story is thick &amp; it has literally 1000s of side-quests. You can buy houses, explore big cities, craft &amp; more! Everything you want in a RPG!  It has a great ton of customization that allows you to change your skills &amp; magic abilities on the fly, always be able to go with per example a Templar - using Magic &amp; Heavy armor, or a Sorcerer, fully magic specced with robes &amp; chakrams (Xena's weapons!) or a Thief, wielding light weapons with hints of magic - it is literally ALL possible!  There are many weapons too, Daggers, Bows, Fae Blades, Greatswords, Hammers, Sceptres, Staffs, Chakrams, and more that I cannot remember. It has any weapon you could think of in an - and I did not even mention the magical abilites which are very numerous &amp; work well together.  It also has a GREAT crafting mechanic that will have you searching all corners of the world for things to use, and as I said, it encourages it. Combined with the crafting mechanic itself is also sagecrafting - that allows you to create gems to use with equipment to enhance stats.  All in all, this is probably one of the best RPGs that I have ever played.  It's a truly, really commendable game that every RPG lover should play!  Personal score: 9/10  Best regards, Dukhat
4032	0	a	The gameplay is boring. In the PvE mode dinosaurs differ mostly by size and HP amount. Their AI is closer to Space Invaders. Real dinos were smarter than that. The guns are uninspiring and gunplay doesn't deliver.  Looks like something from 2003 with some effects such as motion blur and depth of field slapped on to mask the ugliness.  Wouldn't play even if I was paid to.   If you want a good co-op game look at Payday 2, Left for Dead 2 or maybe Killing Floor.
1561	1	a	Great GAME lots to do, lots to find, lots to KILL, lots to explore. Metascore rates it 81, I think at least a 95.
4397	0	a	 Worst Game Ever!  [static2.wikia.nocookie.net]  
493	1	a	Slow to start, but I have faith in R.A. Salvatore's story writing skills. Excellent graphics and gameplay.
4601	1	a	This game is VERY FUN! I would highly recommend it! 8/10
4610	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are terrible and the best computer can't handle it weith the worst graphics on possible. And the game is just laggy and glitchy. This is the worst game to ever be in existense. The dinasours just like to fly around and attack you while you can't see because of the laggy peice of shot game â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tits.
3009	1	a	Very fun, it has some server problems but it is evolving.
2621	1	a	great game hope for new updates
490	1	a	Fantastic game, wish the studio was still around to give us more.
5719	1	a	Left4Dead but with dinosaurs. 10/10 
1685	1	a	The story is deep, but I found the world a bit lacking considering how much went into developing the universe. The combat is quite fun. Very underrated game in my opinion!
3813	0	a	This game is poop.
5963	1	a	This game consists of killing hoards and hoard of dinosaurs, its great, it has a solo or an online mode
4150	1	a	It is now allmost free,soon,soo im giveing this a like
1713	1	a	this game kicks â¥â¥â¥, yes it had no multiplayer option but if you are just in the mood for killing and looting and slaughtering then this is definatly the game for you. -TZS DrunkRussian
1162	1	a	A hidden gem of a game! The best part is the action oriented combat!
2471	1	a	love the game, wish i could delete all my progress so i could experience the thrill again from leveling up and getting stronger doing so.
5941	1	a	  this game was shared with me [ AWESOME GAME ]
2333	1	a	The name will have probably changed by the time I post this, but Super Mega Dinosaur Slaughter Adventure: Space Explorers is not that bad of a game. It's 99 cents, and, while certainly bad, its fun to play. If you have a dollar thats burning in your pocket I'd suggest picking this up
587	1	a	I love this game  it has a good crafting in game  you do not have to stay as a wiz or ,,,,,,,,  you can mix and mach as you go throw the game 
6409	0	a	played this with a few friends for about 50 minutes, and we all got a lot of frame drops, easy to learn and understand if you have played things like killing floor with a few good extras. but over all its just annoying getting damaged costantly especially by the flying dinos and you either can't hit them because your frames have dropped so much you have to stop playing for a second or that they are already too far away to hit. Didn't enjoy
5681	0	a	ORION: Dino Prelude Beatdown Horde is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. And anyone who willingly spends money in this virus of a games microtransaction store needs to be sent to a Mental Institute and evaluated. Even though its priced less than a dollar, don't buy it, its a trap, what seems like a dumb joke becomes an immediate regret. Run, while you still can, and avoid this game at ALL costs.
2448	1	a	Ignore the metacritic score. It's freakin' awesome. I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.  In essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades. There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade. That's how they work though, accomplish an 'acheivement' and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the 'acheivement' granted you.  I won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun. Not to mention, look in their 'recent updates' area of thier Steam page: 'Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!' Read it. Enough said.  Buy this while on sale and you won't regret it. If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's 'Sales' section got me again.  It's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.  Buy it. Play it. You won't regret it. At least try the free 2 days!
2000	1	a	I enjoyed this game quite a bit the game play is a hack and slash the only problem is that its a very short game but its still a good game and if you have the time and money give it a shot you wont be disapointed.
3153	0	a	Here is what we have learned from this game: Dinosaurs and Killing Floor do not mix. At all. They just don't. The people who think this game is good are lying to themselves. If you check the public multiplayer servers, there are many. Many barren, unused servers. It took one try for my friends to find the game that I had joined through the server list. That is not what I want in the game. Neither is a dinosaur Killing Floor knockoff. I guess that's what I asked for when I bought this game for a dollar. Yeah, don't buy it. Save your dollar.
386	1	a	Please note that I played about 3 hours of the demo and though that only brings the total playtime up to about 8 hours, I'm writing this review while KoA is still on sale.   Overall a very fun game; refreshingly fun.   I am playing as a Varani Rogue, a stealth-based character and I'm loving it.  Definitley worth the money!
2902	1	a	This game is awesome co-op is done well,it reminds a lot on Halo and Borderlands  Everyone should try it  -There aren't much servers
122	1	a	I could kick myself for not getting this game when it first came out. The game is very good. Beautiful graphics, the main story has a good concept, but poorly written, music is repetitive and short. Pity what happened to the Dev company, I would have liked to see more from them.  The plot is interesting, your character die and comes back to life and start changing people's fates, while being hunted by those wishing to destroy you. Combat is so satisfying, the weapons and armor is good, the leveling system is ok could have been better, alchemy system is one of the best I've seen in an rpg, voice acting is tolerable.  There are factions you can join, quests to do, locks to pick, treasure to find and lore to learn. KoA is a gem of a game and a pleasure to own. 8/10
1630	1	a	Well worth it, especialy when on special, good Combat RPG it strongly reminds you of Fable and God of war cross breed with some Darksiders for combat, very big world to explore especialy with the good DLCs, you'll get at least 200 + hours of fun from it without trying to clear everything there's up to 400 to 600 hours of content if you want to clock Everything. The RPG system is very felxible and interesting gear/ enchanting/ ect Crafting is well done and fun. The only downside of this game for me is maybe the fact that the characters in this game tend to feel like generic fantasy and the story line kinda feel this way as well but for 12 dollards on special with all the DLC WHO CARES ! :-) have fun OH yeah GAMEPAD not neccesary BUT STRONGLY RECOMANDED FOR COMBAT!
2529	1	a	I had a difficult time choosing if I wanted to buy this game or not. Sure, it's only a dollar, but I guess the guy behind it pulled some shady dealings, so I couldn't decide if I was okay with that.  After much though, I came to the conclusion that a buck was worth giving the game a try, and I'm glad I did. While there are still a few bugs in the game, it's fun and refreshing. I didn't realize just how much we really needed a dinosaur game!]  If you can overcome the moral arguement of the game dev, and overlook the outdated metascore, this game has a lot of potential.
2894	1	a	Honestly, if my PC wasn't â¥â¥â¥â¥, i'd play this more
3641	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot. Truly the best experience one could hope to have killing dino's with advanced technology.   And at the low low price of 1$ (during the steam sale) you would be an absolute fool to not buy this game on the spot and giggle in glee as you and your friends shoot and destroy dinos with various vehicles and weapons.   Game of the year 2013/2014/2015.  Buy it now.  9001/9001  2 1337 4 M3
5252	0	a	its currently $0.99 i would reccomend you spend that dollar on a burger from mcdonalds...yes this game is that bad
5750	0	a	i payed for this game and now its free to play, i want my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money back
3940	0	a	There are a lot of things to do, a lot of modes to try, and a decent selection of weaponry but overall it is very boring, glitchy and slow.
2768	1	a	This game is awesome. the .99 cents you pay is worth it, because you get a fast paced gun game with Dinosaurs. If you want to fork out more cash you can buy special custom looks for your character. Great maps and the graphic style is like that of borderlands. This game is a 8 out of 10 for me.
5048	0	a	Not only has this game changed its name 3 TIMES. But its hasnt changed anything in the game itself, infact with the new 'and improved'''''' Prelude update, NOTHING is different from what have i found. I paid 15 dollors for this. Now its less then one..... Lie honestly. i dont have many hours in this game because it honestly sucks, like seriously. It looks like it was made on the unity engine, The gameplay is terrible, and the new 'horde Bots' that theyve added are reeally just random characters FULLY decked out with all the pay to win gear, plus, they dont even get attacked barely, It would be as if the dinos dont see them and come straight torwards the player. The screenshots are nothing like the game itself, it shows itself as a fun and enjoyable game to play with friends. WHen in reality it goes as follows ' Hey dude you get Orion?' ' No it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥' ' so what play it with me, il even buy it for you' I buy it for a bud, we play and after 20 minutes we give up, because its just that bad of a game. Multiplayers a drag, the guns are basic. The guns look all futuristic and that they shoot lazers..... No.... Its just bullets. No lazers or any of the sorts. The stuff that you buy in game affect the game in absolutely no way possible, There just ' Hey look at me i look cool i spent 5 bucks in game, Wait no one plays this game.' ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE IN PURCHASE ITEMS, AND THE LOWEST PRICED ITEM IS MORE THEN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF. IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING. RIDICULOUS. Dont buy the damn game, after this review I uninstalling as i just spent 10 minutes in the game. NOTHING IS CHANGED. just the name, for the third time. The meta score is right, it sucks. Even the loading images are the exact same. the class pictures are the exact same. the dinos are the exact same. the maps are the same. The AI is still the same. It is still the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ ass game it was a few months back when i regret paying like 15 or whatever bucks for a game. Stay away from this. Seriously, unless your absolutely bored and u have less then 2 GB of storage to mess with, along with a mouse that if you can click 16 shots in less then 1 milli then your absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ed in online PVP matches, run by the little kids who think there cool Because they host a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ listen server off there parents internet. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥, im out
1061	1	a	For free game, this game is pretty damn excellent. I put a decent amount of time into it, the graphics are pretty amazing, and the storyline is above average considering it is a free game. It doesn't feel l ike it is Pay 2 Win.  It is obvious the developers and marketing team put a lot of time, effort and money into this.   The game has some serious flaws however, like not being able to drop unecessary quests for irrelevant factions, and some pretty serious bugs. ALl that can be excused when taking into account, yes, this is a free game.
3869	1	a	This game is so much fun, when you make fun of how bad it is with your friends.
220	1	a	What an amazing game! It's so weird it's not mentioned often when talking about RPGs. This game should be in top 3 atleast!  The game is huge, there's tons and tons and tons of things to do. The storylines are fun and easy to follow (even for me, who usually doesn't care about stories too much). The scenery is simply stunning, there's so many different areas and regions and each with a different style. The combat is fantastic, so many different paths to follow and builds to make. I'm sure there's something out there for all of you.  The only downside is that it's abit easy but then again, I'm not a fan of games that get so hard that makes me want to throw my pc out the window.  Would I recommend this? Yes, absolutely. 10/10
6065	1	a	For 50 cents, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, not a bad game.
4019	1	a	Fantastic game! â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off? Go kill some dinos. Wanna punch a dino in the face? Go kill some dinos. Trying to impress the girl of your dreams? Show her how well you kill some dinos! A great play for any day!
1497	1	a	I honestly didn't expect much out of this game. But once i started palying it i found my self in a trace. This games is really fantastic.
5190	0	a	I died of a brain tumor playing this game. Support my ghost by not playing this game.
938	1	a	Excellent and truly underrated fantasy RPG. Beautiful world, impactful choices and awesome gameplay. I would have loved to see a sequel on this one !
1881	1	a	Very entertaining RPG. I got the 4 pack on sale and its def worth the money. I play with a 360 controller hooked up to my rig and love rolling around saving the world and such. Interesting storyline, fun gameplay, varrying levels of difficulty, flexibility in your character (might, finess, sorcery, or a combo of two or all three!)
133	1	a	Before playing KoA, I had read reviews that tried to pit it against Skyrim for some reason, an odd choice considering that the gameplay and 'feel' are at opposite ends with both of these games.   One thing you really need to ask yourself before you purchase this game is ' Do I have a lot of time to invest in another long drawn out RPG'. I asked myself that before I bought KoA and just ignored how much time I do actually have to commit.   Though I havn't finished KoA and I bored of it at about the 70 hour mark, I did enjoy the exploration and the way the game felt to play. It's not exactly open world or a sandbox but there is a lot to see, lot's to explore. I found myself swapping out specs because playing the one style got tedious and my time got taken up with a lot of travell.   Otherwise, I'm actually glad a bought this, I may finish it when I have more time, up to the point I've played was enjoyable, just a little burned out. If you do buy this, be prepared to commit with small amounts at a time.

6112	1	a	It is awesome you can play multi-player single player co-op. i have played it for 23 hours in total. that is good for 79p      
2833	1	a	My friends told me 'you could buy a bag of chips, or this game' and you know what? I would rather have that bag of chips. Honestly, this game is crudely-made and minimally optimized with gameplay inferior to Killing Floor.   However, if this were 2008, I'd rank this game a solid 9/10.
4439	1	a	Cool
1129	1	a	Initially I disliked this game - the camera was instantly annoying. As one reviewer put it 'Your biggest fight in this game is with the camera'. I found myself doing 360 degree spins just trying to view enemies. The auto aim with ranged weapons was unsettling and took some getting used to. I also found multiple clicks to navigate through my inventory painful - perhaps there's some shortcuts I'm missing. I found some aspects of the game could have been documented or explained better, like how best to use reckoning mode.  However, I persisted through these minor issues and have ended up enjoying the game. Things like the auto aim that I initially found unsettling turns out to be quite useful when attacking multiple enemies. I've gotten used to the camera. There is reasonable graphics and music. Some of the game areas remind me of areas within World of Warcraft - there is a fair amount of scenic detail in the game world.   The story and quest lines are quite in depth. There's plenty of equipment, spell and ability upgrades to keep one interested, plus crafting. You can choose to pursue the main quest line or build experience via various side quests.  I've found the combination moves with fights are interesting and entertaining. Sneaking up and backstabbing opponents is a quick and easy way to take down an opponent.   There's enough variety in this game to keep any gamer interested. I'm changing my initial opinion to thumbs up.
467	1	a	In KoA you play the fateless one. Basically, you start off rather crappy and everyone either loves you or wants to smash you to bits. :P The game is not difficult but is very VERY extensive with a deep lore..  There are just so many quests and side quests and tasks and stuff you could do, it some times gets kind of tiring to play. This makes the game very worth your money as it could last forever if you are big on quests on the other hand, you may get sick of the overwhelming number of quests and decide to dump it.  I have not completed the game as of yet, but I believe that it has great replay value just because there are so many weapons and skills you could try out. You could be a chunky 'warrior (might)' type or sneaky 'thief (finesse)' or sparkly 'mage (sorcery)' type or even your own special hybrid. This is really want I feel makes the game so interesting.
4846	1	a	very aweseom game buy buy
5235	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
1483	1	a	This game is a hell of a lot of fun to play. I recently went for all the achievements and it didn't feel like a grind. I find myself continuously creating new characters to wander through those starting areas as a noob again, planning out my character's levels as I go.  I love how at any moment in-game you can visit a Fateweaver and change all your stats and abilities for a small fee relative to your level. If you're unhappy with your current build, bam, make a new one! I had the most fun with a mostly Warrior longsword / greatsword with some Finesse thrown in.  Combat is fun and rewarding in that you unlock combos as you level up so you can hit off a dodge roll, combo after parrying, delayed attacks etc. Each weapon has unique attack patterns and it's fun to experiment with all different types of weapons.  Don't even get me started on the amount of content. Jesus God. There are 5 faction story lines in addition to the main questline, and then add the *awesome* DLCs and all the side quests ... if you like finding new things to do, Amalur will always have something ready for you. Honestly I liked the DLC storylines a bit better than the main storyline.  It's easy to feel overpowered as you can craft pretty epic equipment for yourself and if you go back to do earlier content you completely destroy. I went around this by creating new characters all the time but I know the feeling of being too powerful. Another way around this is to play on hard &amp; limit your gemcrafting and blacksmithing.  I really had a lot of fun playing this and I highly recommend giving it a try if you like action combat and if you have an xbox / ps3 controller (I find it more fun to play using one). I bought this game 2 years ago for $54 with both DLCs and I have found it totally worth it. After 100%ing the achievements I still want to create a new character and jump right back in!  9.5/10
770	0	a	Originally developed as an MMORPG, Kingdoms of Amalur is sort of like playing a great online game on your own little private server.   The advantage of this is that you don't have to play the game with any MMORPG weirdos. So if RPGs are your go-to for immersion, nobody's going to mess with your little fantasy here.  The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.
3931	0	a	Grab the smallest vehicle, the biggest sniper and rock the dinos hard. However, it is pretty much the same every single game. Defend this, capture that, return and defend. Over and over and over again. It gets pretty fast pretty boring. I played it for like 4? hours?! And i guess I have seen everything. I took the advantage of the free-days-to-play, but I dont bother buying it even for 99 Cent ...
2288	1	a	For the sweet price of $1 there is little to comlain about.  I've bought $5 sandwiches and spent only 3 minutes on them. This I've spent over 5 hours. That's like 60 sandwiches.   10/10 Would have more sandwiches.
3672	1	a	Great game so far!
4093	1	a	Oh Dino Horde. I love this game, one of my reasons to join steam. It has a few flaws, what game does not, but in the end it is a very fun title that will give you a lot of happiness and will let you loose, as much loose as you can be while charged by HORDES (title does not lie) of prehistoric Reptiles that try to either get you or crash the Generator you have to protect. This game is built on team wok, so it is going to be based on what people you play with either you going to have a lots of gunblazing fun or running back and forth fixing your generator while being munched on by some compy, because other players have left to do whatever. Beside that, the only other thing that can spoil your play time is an occasional lag (hopefully they have fixed that since the last time I have played). So yeah, if you would buy this game, it would be great. No seriously, it is 0.99 right now, and it has Guns, Dinosaurs and awesome vehicles, go get it.
785	1	a	Great Game
4801	0	a	didnt grabet me on first plus but i have to say that this game was the first game that i see a ''team vs monster''game
5666	0	a	buyed this game to play with my friends in other country, but it is not possible to connect to oversea servers. and my freinds cant also not connect when i open a sever in europe. okay, it was just 1â¬â ....but a wasted â¬.
2500	1	a	Jetpacks, guns and dinosaurs. What more could you want? Tanks? yup, got that. Multiplayer? What else IS there? Fancy devouring the corpses of your vanquished foe? Got that.  Best game ever, 10/10
1932	1	a	Just like any RPG games out there. Character development, equipments, quests, dungeons, and other RPG stuffs. But there is one thing that this game excels at, the combat. The combos are great, flexible, and pretty easy to land compared to, well, skyrim and the witcher at least. The control is so responsive too. I mean, you can just break a combo and dodge to dodge enemies incoming attacks.  The ability tree and char type are not much different from other RPG. Might/Strength, Finesse/Agility, and Sorcery/Intellegence.  For the equipment, it's very similar to Skyrim. you can buy/sell, loot, craft, and add gems. and yes, there's a skill that affects one's crafting capability and result.  The storyline is actually good, but the side quests are a bit repetitive and might be boring when travel such big open world. well, there are tricks though to lessen the boredom by abusing dungeons dynamic enemy level.  overall, this game is very good. I highly recommend this. Skyrim RPG and open world style and Darksiders combat style, why not?
1329	1	a	Irish accents for the win.   'Dher Haouse of Weenta!'
3204	1	a	'This game feels like the hand of the lord has stroked my genitalia.'
3845	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes..... all the best parts of Halo, L4D, and Borderlands combined into one epic co-op multiplayer survival shooter. Hopelessly addicting, endlessly fun.
1973	1	a	This one of the best RPG i have played in a long time. Personally i like the story line and it kept me hooked. You will spend a lot of time in your inventory deciding which piece of armor is a fraction of a present better then the one you already have but that's pretty much every RPG. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of RPG or fantasy games
6174	0	a	Seems like if turok and halo had a baby (the first or second halo of course, because the graphics, i think that i could even run it on my celeron). The blood is bad as s**t, but... it was 0.99â¬ and is the type of game you'll give for your girlfriend play when she on her period, she'll love it!
2472	1	a	This game is T-Rexcellent.
6113	0	a	Wow this game is bad..... 
1865	1	a	Only been playing afew hours, but I played the demo quite a bit, but to be honest I didn't know they actually released the game. Looking forward to this game.
6401	1	a	They misspelled 'Died' 10/10
3071	1	a	My first experience of the game went something like this:  Waste loads of money on deciding which pistol I want (whilst not realising I can get a primary or secondary) Clicking more times that I ever have before in a panic to kill the dinos Hardly knowing what to do Dying within minutes 10/10 Would do again  If you didn't gather, my first experience was freaking amazing and I really found it enjoyable. I absolutely love it.
6104	1	a	Perfect game for $.99, Lots of fun with friends.
3380	1	a	sick game you choose one of three classes and get different weapons and abilaties based on your class help your team or be a noob and steal all the kills do whatever you want just by it for you and your friends.
1264	1	a	Got this game while it was on sale. No regrets. Really great game. As of typing, I clocked in 42.6hrs already and I'm not even halfway done. I give this game 9/10  Cons: - Difficulty is easy even on Hard Mode - Quite easy to level up (even on higher levels) - Crafting at Master level gives you godly equipment. Seriously. - The amount of side quests in this game is overwhelming - Day/Night/Weather is really bad. It almost never rains and I can't tell whether its day or night unless I check the time.   Pros: - Fluid control options. You can switch between keyboard/mouse and controller instantly.  - NPCs actually do move around and do their own things. Enemies have a predator/prey relationship. - Although repetitive and generic, the environments are lovely. - Love getting into in-game lores? This is the game for you. - Exceptionally long play time
5949	0	a	Killing dinosaurs is such a lame idea, and the game is boring.
4264	0	a	Im kinda angry that this went Free, but Im also not surprised. It feels like baby's first gaming project and a lot of the stuff in it just feels absolutely atrocious.  Good for drunken nights of fun with friends but just a mess of a game, I cant reccommend it.
1779	1	a	Got an achievement for speaking with someone while naked.  10/10
2437	1	a	36 Metascore, everytime for 1 Euro... Dont care about that... The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome!
2149	1	a	R.A Salvatore the writer of the Drizzit series provided the lore for this game. This game felt like a huge MMO but your the only person running around. Kingdoms of Amular is all about loot and exploring. If you don't enjoy that you will not like this game. Sadly the company that made closed down due to financial issuues and a follow-up game was never made.
4156	1	a	dis game is good, had a rocky start with dino beatdown, but the developer has stuck with it and made it an actually good game, i had alot of fun playing this and its dirt cheap now, so there really is no excuse not to have this in your library!
5323	1	a	best, good game, idled for cards
54	1	a	A neat game with a mix of strategy and puzzle fighter. love it!
5171	1	a	mlg seal of approval
6255	1	a	This game is a fun FirstPerson shooter with a destructive force of dinosaurs. Will you join me in the endless waves of killer monsters?
1160	1	a	This game is pretty fun for the first 30ish hours, as the faction quests give you choices to make at the end(do you want to save the person you're supposed to kill, or simply do as you're told and kill that person?) and the world is varied enough with side quests dotted throughout to make the game a fun experience.  however the game outdid itself in terms of size, it's too big. The story is very linear and the ending is very unsatisifying, so the only thing that kept me going was the DLC and sides quests. But after you finish the 'fun quests' and the main story line, the game just doesn't have anything more to offer. The combat is stall, the side quests are mostly fetch this kill that, and you really feel no sense of joy playing this game past the ~50 hour mark.   conclusion: this is a OK game, there are enough to do to keep it fun for the first 30-50 hours, but anything after that the game just gets boring.
3792	1	a	I keep seeing reviews about steal this and theft that, who cares. 'In today's news, company sells stolen game for an entire dollar! 49 cents on sale!! What happened to this world???'  This is by far the most fun game i've ever played in this price range. A friend of mine bought it for our group of friends because it was so cheap, little did we know that it would be damn good fun.   Classes, plenty of weapons, vehicles, upgrades, lots of modes, and dinosaurs. Though i admit the graphics aren't top notch but honestly not bad, lighting and shadows aren't bad, the dinos look sorta low res but who cares. And glitches galore but thats all part of the fun if you ask me.   The only downside i can see is that probably not many people host lobbies, not sure for certain. And that all the visual upgrades for characters is handled through a slew of microtransactions, but this game is only a dollar. Atleast its not like Rockstar's wonderfully overrated and squeezed for every last penny with microtransactions GTA 5.   AAA studios take note! This is genuine fun for the whole family.
1166	1	a	8.5/10 Grabbed this in a sale, have to say best 150 hours of gameplay so far. Completed the main storyline &amp; I have to say all skeptism about this game was eliminated past the first hour playing. I love the amount of flexibility given to build my character &amp; how the option is to switch between 'classes' is readily avaliable.  Visually the game looks awesome, gameplay is pretty awesome as well seeing how it got me hooked for more than 100 hours. If you're a fan of fantasy RPGs or just RPG fans in general I would definately recommend buying this game.  The only thing I had to nitpick was like every other RPGs (looking at you TES games) inventory management is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2376	1	a	The Devs are extremely devoted to this game, and after seeing what they have in store for this game, i have nothing but gratitude towards these guys. I used to have a bad opinion of them after seeing some bad news on them, but it seems to have been nothing more than some raging internet idiot posting lies. I say get the game, and since it goes on sale so much for $1, you shouldn't have much financial problems from picking this up. What the devs have in store (Orion Prelude) looks amazing, and they'll evolve the current game into a much more beautiful and refined game for FREE. The devs are also producing free dlc, nothing you have to pay for. If anything, it would be the dev's devotion and effort to build this game into something beautiful and amazing that caught my attention and encouraged me to recommend this game.  tl;dr - Great game, great devs
1812	1	a	I love this kind of game. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. This game is a fantastic RPG. The combat is some of the most fun I have ever played. Graphics are good, world is big, and story is....Okay. The Story is...OKAY because I couldn't relate to ANYONE. But it was about as good as any standard MMO story, even if this isn't an MMO.  Like I said the Combat in this game is very very fun, there are combos that you can do like in a fighting game, there is magic and stealth if you like those things. The boss fights could be better, they all have a easily found pattern that doesn't make them very hard. But when you are fighting the actual enemies and not the boss fights, it becomes a lot more diffcult as you progress in levels. And the loot system is the greatest part. When you complete a quest almost always you will get a great reward, unlike some RPG's that I have played.  The Open world itself is very pretty, but nothing we haven't seen before. If you have played world of Warcraft then your jaw won't be dropping at the sight of this world.  Overall I would say that this game is very fun and worth the money. Gameplay: 9.5/10  Graphics: 6/10  Story:6/10 Final score: 7/10 I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good hack and slash RPG
6342	1	a	A great gift for friend you want to torture  this game is like bad rats    not even worth 99C
4941	1	a	So many people complain about such a failure the game used to be, just stop complaining and play the game for FUN, and not constantly talk about business within the game. Try it for yourself if you think you'll like it, thats why the price is down.

5221	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
482	1	a	Underdog detected :)  PROS  - Truly HUGE world. - An amazing amount of quests, a lot to do - Three classes with that play very differently because of their skills - High polish and optimisation  CONS   - Weird to say but the game is so huge that sometimes it can be discouraging :) But this is not really a con, mostly we have been playing short games for so long that we lost the attention span required to play a game for weeks. - Some of the lore can be boring sometimes. I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.  REVIEW  This is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.  I am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title.   I only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.  Some advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.
1100	1	a	Buy this game. Buy it, or swarms of Scottish gnomes shall descend upon thee as Irish fairies complain about global warming.
5553	1	a	Gameplay is awesome but the game makers have an issue in programming skills or something cause game is really laggy and flying dinos just appear in sky and i dont have time to kill them if everything laggs and i am on extreme difficulty. PLEASE FIX GUYS GAME IDEA IS GOOD BUT UPGRADE THE GAME BY ITSELF CHANGE GAME CODE TO LESS LAGGY AND GIVE US MORE WORLDS AND BETTER OBJECTIVES!!!!!
5913	0	a	The shiittest game ever.. boring. shiit graphics.. etc etc.. dont waste 10cents playing this....
3524	1	a	It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs
306	1	a	It plays like God of War. It has a loot system like Diablo. It has a crafting system and exploration elements like Skyrim. And looks like World of Warcraft. Unfortunately, it does none of these things like the games listed. It's a really fun game, but could have been much cooler with more care taken in these elements.
3617	1	a	We all bought this game as a joke because of the price and we had read the reviews of how terrible this game was. At one point, yes, this game was probably the worst game on Steam. Whatever the developers did in between then and now, it actually turned out to be quite fun. The graphics are actually pretty good (especially the weather effects), the controls feel solid, and it's fun to shoot dinosaurs.  There aren't are lot of classes (four) but the ones they have are unique and fill their roles admirably. The maps are huge and the vehicles are a blast to drive.  This game is 100% better if you have a small group of friends to play to log on with and just joke around killing dinos. For $0.99 everyone should probably own this game.
5704	0	a	3/10 is just boring

6021	1	a	Interesting Type Of Game
902	0	a	its not that bad but its not great, honestly its not worth buying it is a really difficult game not much of a learning curve and it gets boring pretty quickly.
4848	1	a	Its like Skyrim but with dinosaurs! 10/10
4419	0	a	Even at a dollar this 'game' isn't worth it. Developers are shady, gameplay is ancient. Level design is a joke. Nothing is intuitive. This company deserves no support what so ever. They even turned off comments on their facebook. i want a refund.
775	0	a	My first reaction to the game was: Graphics weren't what I was expecting, polished combat and extremely well made. But I quickly felt like there was something missing in this game. Something uncoherently mistaking. The combat feels really arcade as do the graphics but besides that there is areally polished RPG factor in it. You might say: that would be a positive thing. But I can't help but feel it does not match well together. Atleast for me it does not. The way I see it Kingdoms of Amalur is quite a big game, not seamingless, more like zones connected to each other. But the bland quests, not really appealing story and on the other hand good looks and superb combat makes me feel like I can't land my feet and immerse in the game.
2119	1	a	Overally, it is a game worth playing. However, the combat system is a bit boring and the world is too big to explore on foot. It wastes a lot of time travelling, it will be perfect if there is a mounting system
5312	1	a	You can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and machine guns. 11/10 - IGN
2655	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
2270	1	a	This game is simply Amazing.  The graphichs and the combat mechanics are excellent. The 3d models are extremely detailed and the maps are colourful and beautiful.  I fully recomend the game and especially in its current price is a burgain!
2603	1	a	God damn autistic as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 11/10
571	1	a	An enjoyable, 3rd person, action RPG.  + The voice actors did a good job. + The writers did even better - NPC dialogues are wonderful. Metaphores, philosophy of life/death cycle, contemplation. + Story idea is refreshing,   it is as if there is a static story from a book, but then the strange element or 'you' is thrown in it. And, maybe you are not the only 'dynamic' power in the book's story...   + Nice combat with easy controls, with a bit of playing around you can combo things up. + Big game world, playthrough can be lengthy if you like to sidetrack.  - The world might seem a bit MMO-ish (but that is only because of our perception of things). Good part is, nobody can stop you from running to some dangerous areas of the game right from the start. - Too much eye candy - turn off post processing and enjoy the game.  ~ If you are a person that skips every NPC dialogue and 'rushes', you will find the game dull. ~ Recommended to play on Hard.
4027	1	a	Fun Game Like Halo 4+ Dino's Great game but OK Graphics and audio 7/10
356	1	a	I had heard that this game was too similar to an MMORPG without actually being one to be fun, but these claims were wrong. Certainly, the quest system is a degree like an MMO's, but it was nowhere near as monotonous, and I went through the game doing every quest for every region, and only became tired of that when I had went through every piece of land on the lefternmost (see: largest) continent, and was about 40 hours in. The combat is fantastic. I only played as a warrior, but the moves were so stylish, and made you feel so powerful, that I never got tired of fighting. The challenge is kept consistent all the way through, and the gameplay and character customization overshadow the admitably awful story and characters (that fortune-teller dude that follows you throughout the game is badass, though, as is your gnome buddy). I strongly recommend this. One playthrough, including DLC, will get you 50+ hours, and it is certainly replayable.
2045	1	a	Solid, lengthy third person RPG. Avoid blacksmithing like the plague, though, because it'll make the game way too easy.
404	1	a	Great game all around. Give it a try. Watch Day9 and Alicia Day play  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MngZF7uqQJs  
5742	0	a	Cs 1.6 all over again
2287	1	a	Perfectly Simulates Jurassic Park If It Was In Russia.
3635	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
3359	1	a	Okay - One of those blind buys, because it was cheap. DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! I have so much fun rolling around and blasting dinosaurs with my friends, I'd say that everyone should have this game - go buy a four pack and gift your friends and let the carnage begin! 10/10 would buy again.
4199	1	a	'11/10 like League of Legends with guns' - Carlos Donger
4163	1	a	Killed T-Rex.  10/10 would save the Earth again.
1936	1	a	Absolutely loving the game, bought it with all the DLC and it is just so vast with so much to do, you can find yourself getting lost for hours just doing side questes or even wandering around aimlessly but having fun doing it.  Character creation and skilling is great you can craft your character how you like picking and choosing skills as you need them, or want them.  Despite coming from EA this is a great game.
2767	1	a	Awesome game for the price!.
784	1	a	A mostly failed IP that began life as an MMORPG. It shows, but in a good way, honest. The easy-to-pick-up action RPG-ness of the Fable series meets the world and character design out of World of Warcraft's playbook taste excellent together.
6158	1	a	Nice graphics good team playing game like tf2 but instead of player enemys its dinosaurs!!!
4442	0	a	A â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor game with laughably bad mechanics, a lot of bugs, guns that feel like a weak ejaculation and ugly looking graphics. Not even worth it if it were free.
4047	0	a	Terrible, just really, unfortunately bad. Laggy and buggy controls, poor gameplay, just not nearly as fun as it should be.
3236	1	a	this game just has the best 'cost/benefit ratio' a game ever had
2773	1	a	great game
377	1	a	Definitely one of the best ARPGs that came out recently.  The combat system is really well done. Not only the control feels smooth, you are also given so much freedom to find your own play style. You can equip any two weapons and four spells at a time, and you can mix them however you want in combat. Not to mention the weapon crafting system and the gem crafting/socketing system that further enchance the customzation. Either you want to be Gandalf or Geralt of Rivia, it's all up to you. There are also classes, or Destinies, for you to choose and change at any time.  One thing I don't like is the dodging. It's hard to find the right timing to dodge an incoming attack, at least for me. I think it is caused by the slight delay before your character makes a dodge, or I just suck at dodging. Hey, guess what, I can also block with my shield and it doesn't take a weapon slot.  The blend of sword and magic and the stylish art style remind me of the Fable series. As far as combat goes, KOA:R definitely does it better than the Fable series. However I don't find KOA:R's story is intriguing enough for me. 'Wow your fate is blank' 'You'll save the world' blah blah blah. I still enjoy the gameplay, at least.  One last thing, you can hide your helmet!! 10/10
1033	1	a	Save your money. Salvatore and McFarlane are hacks, and the sheer deadness of the story in this game + reptitive game play makes this game a waste of time and money.
4836	1	a	You NEED to have this game compatable with mac. all steam games should be for that matter.
5787	0	a	Clunky. My laptop can run DA:I, Mass Effect, and other much more demanding engines with ease. However, this game still runs like molasses.   The premise is enjoyable, however. For a game that proudly calls itself the worst game out there, a great success.
3776	1	a	The game may have bad reviews, how after a few updates it has become a much better game, I say this from the free play weeks not from owning, but the game is still rather enjoyable.
5491	1	a	Have some weird bugs and really lame shooting animations but other than that it's an okay game where you get to shoot dinosaurs with a bunch of other people.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkzAVf8x9_8

3551	0	a	Bought it for 93% off, one dollar, and was still disappointed.  At least the sound track is good. That's really the only compliment.  PS: They have a cash shop where they sell taunts and other stuff that is majorly unrefined, and is a blatant attempt at your money.
6356	1	a	Yolo
3580	1	a	I get it. You're looking at the Metacritic and going '36?!'  This is a SOLID game. It reminds me of Halo's horde mode. There's vehicles, jetpacks, perks, and giant dinos trying to eat you alive.  Many times, a game that is garbage is released and left to die. Not these guys. They kept working. After 2 years, they finally have the game that they promised.   http://artistryingames.com/spiraling-control-incredible-journey-spiral-game-studios/ 
5167	0	a	Its like a vegas wedding that you cant remember
2131	1	a	It looks like most people have sung this game's praises, but I'll add my two cents to this game.  First and foremost, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fun game. You're a man/woman with no Fate, and as such can choose your Destiny out of 7 available styles. In addition, you have access to Reckoning Mode, where your attacks do more damage and you can finish your opponents by pressing 'A' or the corresponding key and mash a randomly selected button/key to gain extra experience.  The combat is in real time, and requires you to think on your feet. You've got 9 different weapon types, each with different moves and strategies required to rule the battlefield with. You can choose Primary and Secondary weapons to switch up your gameplay on the fly, which is really helpful. In addition, you can put 4 spells/skills into your slots and use at any time.  You also have access to a wide array of non-combat skills that help you create powerful weapons, craft helpful potions, and persuade the masses, to give a few examples. You'll want to stick with 3-4 main skills to level up, as you only have 40 levels to work with. Personally, Detect Hidden and Persuade are essential to see all the cool stuff available.  There are 5 main areas in Amalur, and each are unique in their appearance and ascetic. Each area has a lot of quests and places to explore. There are also 5-ish factions, each unique and fun to play through.  Due to your Fateless nature, you create Twists of Fate during big moments in the story and during faction quests. These Twists will benefit your stats, and will potentially change the faction you're working with for the rest of the game. These faction Twists have two paths you can take, meaning you have to play the game twice to see what both Twists offer.  Now this game, despite how good it is, does have some flaws. To begin with, there are some quests that have a chance to break, and will keep you from Fast Travelling if that happens, so save often. Persuasion has a percentage chance o work, but even at full Persuade, the highest chance to work is 95%, meaning you'll probably want to save if you are going to use that skill.  The targeting system is really bad, considering the nature of this game's combat. It's very difficult to change targets during combat, and sometimes you'll want to attack someone else during Reckoning Mode, but still keep wailing on an opponent who is already at the prompt. This game also has some quests that require you to escort/'ally' with NPC's that will fail your quest if they die. However, it is really easy for them to run off and get themselves killed while you're trying to fight off an opponent. It really doesn't help that enemies love to attack teammates, and I can't seem to find a way to draw aggro consistently.  In addition, the game's length, even if you skip the factions and most of the side quests, will still take a long while to finish. This can create fatigue, especially during the final haul, where it might feel like it'd be best to run past every enemy rather than deal with all the encounters you run into.  The DLC is also good, with Teeth of Naros being the best of the two expansions. The bosses in both are challenging but fun, and the areas added have plenty of content.  I bought this game and the DLC for $9.99 during a Sale, and I believe that the game is worth the initial $19.99, but I'd wait until the DLC's price goes down during another Sale to pick them up. This game can be frustrating at times, and I don't think I'll be playing again for a while, as this game can fatigue you with it's length. But Kingdoms of Amalur is a really fun game that you'll clock many hours into.
2426	0	a	I got this game for free.... and I want my money back.
1448	1	a	What you wished Fable 2 and 3 were actually like.
5870	0	a	Baby's first UDK game, but it's cheap and you don't have to think while playing. Keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed. (Edit: Also, the devs are thieving hacks.)
3357	1	a	This game packs alot of punch for a game the costs almost nothing, this game is 79p thats less then a Â£1 and you get so much content and fun for this amount of money  with 15 or more game modes.  theres co op modes, player vs player and player vs player vs dinosaurs.  There are also lots of vehicals from jeeps to tanks to hover bike things to walking robots.  Whats not to love for that price for somthing that awsome right still not sold?   If you could also play as 10 diffrent dinos would that make you want it? well you can.   theres also a dynamic day night weather systme one minute you can be stolling to work at the kill all dino corp office and then it can rain and storm or blizzard if your in the artic any time day or night  the worlds your play in are wide and wonderfull with lots of places to go explore there are also loot chests to find.  so you have guns weapons and cars to drive what about a lightsaber? yes it has one to.  if you feel like flying ther ptreadactol will pick you up and drop you to your doom.  ok now lets talk about the other bits of the game graphicly its not gona win any awards but they are smooth and remind me of halo  where the graphics do shine is during its dynamic weather the freezing on your visor and the rain during the night look stunning :)  The controlls smooth easy bog standard fps controlls.  the xbox controllers work well :) just wish there was a sensativity option for it.  ok youv heard alot so far but for a small price its worth it.  so theres always servers going theres a nice comunity and its fun to play.  Another Pro is the game has devs that care its very rare :) here are some of my favriot moments so far  i Got picked up by petrdctol and droped to my doom wilst falling i managed to finish off a t-rex  i was driving around ran 100 little dinos over hit a tri cerotops and i flew across the map with all my buddys in the car and we drove off in perfect condition   so if you like what iv said so far then go get it if not look at the discription and see if theres anything iv missed about this game as it might sway your vote but hope you enjoy :) this game for the small price you pay you do get a lot of fun
6044	1	a	It has dinosaurs Otherwise, really laggy, no story, repetitive. 12/10-dinos
1091	1	a	Awesome combat and story line :D Definetly recommend buying it
6344	1	a	why have u not brought this already?!  Trust me, it's amazingly, fantastically, utterly, brilliant, over the top, fps, giggles a second fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.  Oh and you can eat people as a dino &lt;burp&gt;
1175	1	a	Its like skyrim and fable had a baby. It takes a lot of skyrims open world stuff but waters it down and it takes fables combat but makes it unbelivably better. The combat is godly as long as you can handle the camera right which can sometimes be a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the start of battles as it has a habit of not zooming out and next thing you know you have a spear up your â¥â¥â¥.   Downsides are there is less extra stuff to do as there is in skyrim or fable and the side missions for the most part the same old kill x to get y and dont get me started on how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying it is to do a 2 hour quest only to get about 2000 gold â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU RANDOM NPCS ILL TURN OFF SAFE MODE AND KILL YOU ALL.  Overall a good game  12/10   
6136	1	a	I had so much fun with this game that I played 2 hours straight without knowing the f*cking objectives.  other than that the third person view is awkward as balls.  either way 8/10
1866	1	a	This game has the best combat system I have ever seen. I'm not just saying that. I've given this some thought and I can't think of a game where combat is more fun. There's something very satisfying about finishing that boss with a massive, glowing, magic weapon. WHile the visuals aren't absolutely breathtaking, they are fairly pretty, in a Torchlight kind of way, and give a nice break from the dark realism of RPGs like Skyrim and Dark Souls.  9/10
1790	1	a	Amazing game, ruined by a glitch which makes your character stop and start when running. A pity as I throughly enjoyed it up to this point.
5230	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
5378	0	a	What a terrible game
4420	1	a	Honestly the best 50 cent game I think exists. Literally paid for itself from all the laughter and fun between my friends and I.   9/10, worth it.
2777	1	a	very good for this price you can pick it!
1584	1	a	Great combo-based combat, large maps, and vibrant environments make this game a pleasure to play; story's also not half bad. I really wish that somebody's able to pick up this IP and run with it for a sequel. I recommend this game for people who like Dragon's Dogma.
17	1	a	This is a unique solitaire game where you arrange your cards into poker suits to set up combos and blast your opponent. It's fun. The story starts out interesting setting things in real history, but with fantasy troops around, but it quickly becomes kill the bad guy, and the dialogues tries to be tongue-in-cheek too often
2168	1	a	I started playing this on PS3 and really liked the game, so i figuered that I would get it for the PC. if you're a big fan of action RPG's this is a game to not pass by. there is a lot of content that will keep you playing for a good long while.
1236	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is in all aspects an average RPG.  it's not bad, it's not really good, but it can keep you decently entertained for a while.  Pros - graphics are decent and it seems to run smoothely even on my encrypted laptop - world ... it looks good, has a unique feel and every now and then there's a real eye catcher somehwere - combat and skills ... easy to learn, not much fuss or complexity  Cons - weak story - combat and skills ... too easy for anyone looking for a challenge. - too monoton - cut scenes are really bad   if you're looking for the next Skyrim, this is not it. but if you want a solid action RPG, this might be your choice.  get it if it's on a sale :)
816	1	a	Like Skyrim with more classes 10/10  
2061	1	a	In almost all RPG games that I play, I take a warrior trade. I prefer to just take hits and hit others back twice as hard. This game has completely changed that for me, I do not want to part with any abilities. It makes the rogue, the warrior and the magic aspects so much fun all at one go. Factions are also very interesting. Highly underrated. Don't think, buy, play, a few hours of your life that you won't regret.   I'm still going on with the game and I am still loving it.
4046	0	a	nothing new...
4099	0	a	This game actually sucks. Bugs, bugs and more bugs. DONT BUY
4364	0	a	While the game might well be worth the dollar price it dropped down to, I cannot recommend the game simply because of the actions of the developer. The game was buggy, simplistic, and took a few tries to get to work, but was an amusing dino horde game. I'd be the first in line to recommend it for a few bucks.  However the name has been changed twice in an effort to throw off previous negative reviews, and I've heard numerous stories of saying the developer didn't propperly compesate his employees. If you don't care and just want a cheap dino horde game, this might be for you. Personaly I'll wait till the next one comes along.
5297	1	a	Really fun for a bit, but I get very bored very fast, which is not the best of things to happen in a game.
3209	1	a	Forget about what all the critics say. This game is suprisingly good fun! It may be buggy and a tad rough around the edges but its very playable and you will have alot of fun with it for sure! So I reconmend you give this game ago!
1436	1	a	I bought this game for about 12 dollars on a weekend deal or something. It included all of the DLC. The game was well worth it. I spent nearly 80 hours completing this game to my satisfaction and it was pretty fun. If you plan on getting it I suggest you plot getting your trainers early on and make sure to plot how you will get your backpacks as soon as possible. I didn't attempt the DLC until I was max level. You should be aware that if you do not plan your training you will not max every skill, but it's not terribly important. The game is easy street even on hard to be honest.   It reminds me of Fable a little bit as far as difficulty and game style, but it has a little more depth. If you enjoyed any of the Fables, then you will likely enjoy this game.
4641	0	a	you gotta kill the dinosaurs but like all you gotta do is get a choppa then its GG so don't buy this POS if you wanna play for any more than likeeeeee 2 or 3 hrs 4/10
5329	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
3032	1	a	this game literally isnt worth any amount of anyones time not even for the price I got it...
292	1	a	When I first saw Kingdoms of Amalur : Reckoning I thought 'Oh great here's another Fable. Another try hard, no hype RPG.' I saw it on sale for $5. Realized my mistake and consider myself lucky to have experienced such an incredible IP. Then I learned the studio went under because no one bought this game. Why...why oh why didn't we buy this game?
2185	1	a	Its a good game, the grafics are good and as an interesting history. I like the part that you can create various combinations between Might, Finesse and Sorcery or you can choose to follow one role. You can create your own weapons and armour wich is nice and you can add enchantements to the weapons like fire, ice, thunder and poison. Its a pitty that this game didnt get a sequel because i like this one very much.
3156	1	a	Still not sure what this is a prelude to. 9/10
3058	1	a	drove my friend into a t-rex 10/10
6351	1	a	Wait? I thought I bought 'ORION: Dino Horde' - maybe I was dreaming ...
1206	1	a	Worthed Game for that value
3000	1	a	Great fun with friends :D
1260	1	a	kind of like Skyrim - alot of fun so far about 20 hours in.
1419	1	a	Excellent. Despite a few rough edges here and there, Reckoning delivers alot. While it's roots in fantasy story telling are apparent it tells a unique enough story anyway. All the ways you can build your character are both fun and viable. The biggest plus for me personally was the fact melee was more involved than in the Elder Scrolls' series. You get a huge world, fun action combat, crafting, and a well written story. It's nice that the writing is consistently good all the way through instead of falling off in the last act.  The games flaws mostly stay out of the way of having a good time, but the lack of control over the camera is dissapointing. You'll often wish you could zoom out more or expand your field of view. I experienced some odd render problems where menus would render off screen or item windows would not display in the right place. This didn't keep me from having a great time but it is indicative of shoddy console ports. It's a shame this studio didn't get more time to polish, or the chance at a sequel. Even with it's flaws this is Elder Scrolls' equal.
4623	1	a	This game is so much fun, and so under rated. Don't pay attention to the metascore because if it was me scoring it, I would probably score it maybe a 83 or something around that, it has decent graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and i'm sure that a lot more content will be added in the future. Let's help this game grow and get even better than it already is by supporting this game. It is awesome.
4922	1	a	Paid Â£5 for a free game 5/7
992	1	a	Pros: 1. This is a long game, probably the longest RPG ive ever played at 100+ hours with the DLC (i bought as a package on steam)   2. Good world for such a large game, nice voice acting, face animations and the towns do feel lived in.  3. heaps of enemies, loot and quests. wonderful range of ways to craft items, one fo the best crafting mechanics out there.  Cons:-  1. the game is not well balanced, on hard, the second half of the game is a stroll. loot became redundant once you max blacksmithing, the items you create are few levels more powerful than legendary items.  2. quests are tedious, most if not all the quests are about fetching smoething or killing someone. pair this with the game being too easy, a lot of quests becomes very tedious.  3. story is almost non-existant, nothing really happens, even if it does you dont care about the character.  i would say that this game offers great value, you can kill a lot of things, loot a lot of stuff and have plenty of quests. Sadly this great value diminishes or dilutes the gameplay, its like drinking very cheap coffee during an event. you dont really like it, but it offers something to help you stay awake 
246	1	a	Great combat. I found some mage thrown weapons and now I'm in love with chakrams, they are beautful and are amazing when actually in combat. They have great range and good damage. I'm going to hold onto my shock chakrams even though I love the fae-blades and whirling around like a lunatic in battle. Wee!   ~Character creation is quite nice. Different races, jewely/ acessories, hair, gender, ect.  ~Art style feels a bit reminisent of TorchLight and Fable. While the game play feels like a mix of Fable and Skyrim. Lots of freedom of choice for quests and morality. I typically go chaotic-good if I can.   ~Main and secondary weapon slots, with ease of access and use, and a nice hide helm option in options.  ~Different armor types for different classes/ play styles. Heavey, medium, light. Lots of different item types and item looks/ designs.   ~I heard about being able to buy a house and upgrade it, much like in Skyrim (sorry, really getting into and playing Skyrim recently).  ~Story is turning out to be quite interesting. Not too strong of a pull to do main questline though, because of how open and free choice the game is.  ~Different crafting types (poitions, smithing, shards) and you can learn potions by randomly combining ingredients. You can dismantle non magical gear for crafting mats, but I'm not sure about doing the same with magical gear and I would love to be able to dismantle magical/ higher tier gear and get magical crafting mats.  ~Multi-classing is quite in depth, but not too complex from what I've seen so far.  ~Nice voice acting and artwork     My only complaint right now is the sign into EA servers nonsense when loading up the game.
5566	1	a	Really cool game, loved the gameplay. It would help to have a tutorial system that explains the controls while using a controller
1147	1	a	You absolutely should give this game a try. It does so many things very well, and is a lot of fun to play. I have played most of the popular, recent MMOs and RPGs, and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning holds its own, and ranks among the best.   Story The story is very well written, and wonderfully intertwined throughout the game. The authors did a great job of telling an epic tale, and keeping the story interesting and engaging for its entirety.  Graphics The graphics are just as good as any AAA game out there today. The maps, scenery, characters, and animations all look great. The interior spaces such as houses, castles, and dungeons are very detailed and finely crafted.  Setting The setting is more of a fantasy setting, as opposed to a realistic setting as in Elder Scrolls. It feels like its filled with magic with a lot of graphical touches that look magical.  Quests Quests are given by voice acted interactions with NPCs. The quests are story driven, and closely related to the overall story and background of the world. Every quest you do seems to have meaning, and is important in some aspect of the game. There are no junk âkill ten ratsâ quests. Instead the quests either further the main story, or provide interesting background to the characters or world.  NPCs The NPCs have interest, character, and look great. I think every single NPC has a different look - not like the cookie-cutter clones in so many games today. The faces in particular are very detailed and show character.  Voice Acting This has got to be the best voice acting of any game I have ever played. It is outstanding, and gives the quests that extra ambiance.  Classes You can mix and match your class trees as freely as you wish between magic, melee, and stealth skills.  Combat Combat is a blast. There are dodge, block, and combo mechanics. You can cast spells, use ranged weapons, and melee weapons. If you play on hard mode, then fights can be a good challenge, and you have to be alert in order to survive. The combat is easy to learn, but takes practice to master.  Leveling I took my time, and had so much fun doing everything, that leveling happened naturally at a good progression. There are 40 levels total.  Crafting Crafting is pretty simple and basic. The good thing is that you can craft some of the best items in the game yourself.  Character Models The character models are actually better than many games out today. The faces are very detailed, and there are many varieties of armor.  Music Like everything else in the game, the music is top notch.   Length It is a big world with lots of stuff to do, and will take a good while to get through everything.   The game is awesome, and I highly recommend it.
5627	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
140	1	a	The very definition of a hidden gem.   The premise behind this game is that it's an offline MMORPG, you wouldn't think it could work but ,boy, it does. Its story is nothing new and fetch quests abound but the lore brings everything to life. The world is interesting and every map-space is unique. The combat system is amazingly fluid. Plus, the game allows you to essentially rebuild your character mid-playthrough, thus saving the trouble of multiple playthroughs to try all the character builds. The difficulty is funny though, you can get pretty broken pretty quickly in this game. Then again, you're the chosen one after-all, why shouldn't you face-melt everything you meet? lol. If that's not your thing though, there's the YSA mod that will fix the difficulty issue, making it more fair. The 2 DLCs [Dead Kel + Naros, let's pretend the armor bundle doesn't exist] are worth getting as well, both introduce a new world-space to explore that are equally unique in their own rights.   To sum up, would have been the next Skyrim if not for the existence of Skyrim.
2306	0	a	Stop stealing you s**ts.
1782	1	a	Fairly good game...with lots of contents...but kinda linear  Could have been bit more non-linear...
4698	0	a	A poor quality game, poorly optomized, barely functional, and all around garbage. Everything that this game does, is stolen from other games, which do it a hundred times better. I mean this game isnt a -20 out of 10. but its like a 1 out of 10. its not even so bad its funny, its just dreadful. I got a four pack of this game for like 3 american dollars on sale, and I want my three dollars back. Id rather buy a soda or something.
3559	1	a	You can run dinosaurs over with a tank 10/10 
4939	0	a	this game is as bad as me being alive.
5017	1	a	Really cool game its like playing Halo with dinosaurs on it
6285	1	a	Aside from the basic graphics, pretty bad characters, dialouge and design... I had fun. I love 'horde' type games, and slaughtering Dinosaurs is a rare treat... In the end, it's not a very good game, but it's fun, and usually $1 on sale. Pick it up on one of those 90% off, or cheaper, but other than that, paaaass.
3532	1	a	I think this game was a smash hit a real 2/10 effort. whoever made this game did a great job with the following: putting dinosaurs in their game. i found myself on the edge of my seat as the T-rex's would throw boulders at me and charge at a break neck pace, and with a great storyline you cant go wrong. you will find after a solid playthrough along with the only other 1 person in the world that plays this game will enlighten you on how to fight dinosaurs with ridiculously strong weapns with zero recoil. i rate this game a 4 out of 5 out of 10. I hope to never play this game again within my lifetime. if someone held a gun to my head and told me to play this game, I'd choose death.
2392	1	a	Great game, very fun to play!   Only problem is losing your arm to dino, which really sucks.
2946	0	a	Taking a bloody â¥â¥â¥â¥ would be funner than thhis game
2199	1	a	Finally! It comes to Steam Store...  Reincarnation is the real Disciples 3. It's Renaissance+Resurrection, with refined tactical system and magic. Its combat is more like an advanced version from Disciples 2. The Combat area is smaller now, and every unit has their own limited movement and attack range, which makes formation extremely important. Ships and thief abilities are back, too! How could a old Disciples Fans miss all these features!!?? Although there are still a few balance issues (poor Alliance QAQ...), and a little bugs as well (we have some non-official fix. don't know whether the steam version has fixed them or not), the game has the whole mechanic remastered and fixed all the buggy and annoying problems from the old 2.  Moreover, Reincarnation is very mod-friendly. It provides map editor and file-export function. Players could make mod themselves in a very convenient way. Don't miss it! (Really hope it could provide Workshop support  Although, not sure if I may see the Clan back agian in this series.... I really don't want to see them just stand in the wild to give you experience like the green skins do....... Anyway, let's hope the Reincarnation may be the reincarnation for the series... and 'reincarnation' enough to bring us the Clan back in the future...
4481	0	a	Huge rip off. I paid about 80 cents for the second time this was released (this is now it's third release and it's free 2 play now). Wish I could get those 80 cents back.
1674	1	a	It is a very simple RPG, and the fighting get a little repetative...I still found it very entertaining though.
4594	1	a	bought the game for 50c, got trading cards sold for for 80c. Profit :)
4060	1	a	When someone dies everything goes slow mo and it sounds like the inception sound effect  wabawaba/10
3227	1	a	Orion Prelude is fun very fun game overall and the price is even better this game has by my opinnion the best developpers a game can ever want.  I have some slight requests for the devs. :  1. A graphical improvement wouldn't hurt considering the fact that we gamers, in 2015, have powerfull PC's. 2. Character customization system (a bit like the TF2 system but less complicated maybe). 3. Customizable weapons (Scopes, muzzles, etc.)  I know its a big demand but im sure our caring developpers wouldnt mind making huge (maybe) 3 year celebration update with these cool new addons.  Thank you
5519	0	a	just pure garbage. for little kids and not even. this is just stupid.  Dont bother commenting if youre butthurt. I will delete your comment and block you. This is my review my opinion deal with it.
3393	1	a	'Optimus Prime in the teens fights buggy dinosaurs.GOTY!' - Gamestop 'Like Halo with guns!' - IGN 'IT'S 1$!!! I LOVE STEAM!!!' - 12 yo boy
6348	0	a	THIS STUPID GAME DOSENT WORK I HAVE ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND IT DOSENT WORK
4074	0	a	This game sucks in short. It has improved sence the last free trial but this game only live between sales on steam. The loby is broken and in total disrepair, the dino AI is crap and, the objectives are hard to find. At best this is a early bata game but not a finished product or worth $00.99.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct92YOQE3Ks 
3625	1	a	A bad clone of killing floor mixed with a bad clone of unreal tournament mixed with a bad clone of jedi academy. What's not to love?
6035	1	a	Basically Jurassic Park. Those huge dinosaurs are super freaky.
5143	1	a	Fun and Hard meat Boy stile but chaotic wih friends
148	1	a	This game is great with lot of stuff to do and combat is awesome.
1870	1	a	Graphics: Amalur has a very vivid, cartoonish style that looks quite nice and suits the story well. It's nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad either. Think along the lines of WoW rather than single-player RPGs.  Story: Everything in Amalur is bound by destiny except you, and that gives you unique powers. A very interesting concept is how fate is a real, tangible substance that you can manipulate to great effect against your foes. Despite this control of fate, you really have no options on changing the story, which is slightly dissapointing. The concept for the story starts to grow a little old by the end and I never really ended up caring about the main characters, much less the ones in side quests. Despite this, the narrative wasn't particularly bad, and I enjoyed it for what it's worth.  Gameplay: A blend of The Witcher 2 and an MMO, where you can cut and shoot and dodge your enemies, but they only aggro at a certain distance and the difficulty is almost entirely level based. It's actually a lot of fun to go slashing up your enemies (I preferred a two-handed sword), and the combat really kept me wanting to go back to this game. If you decide to complete as many side-quests as I did, however, you'll lend up being rather over-leveled for the end boss fight, making it much less epic.  Conclusion: A very good game with a lot of content. I picked it up on sale and i'd highly recommend you do the same.
5261	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
1940	1	a	If you like RPGs then get this game, the story is fairly good with a lot of lore.   I have sank 66 hours into this game doing 172 quests with over 42 still to do. Plus about 17 endless tasks. I can't recall a point where I felt bored or like I was grinding (I HATE GRINDING IN RPGs) at any point which is amazing. The game play is nice (other than you can only jump at curtain points!) combat looks great. You can do flashy combos very early on and it's not just down to one button attack ether. Changing type warrior, mage, rogue is quick and easy you can multi class to without being punished too.  Difficulty wise it is not that hard even on hard if you like your RPGs. Sometimes it punishes if you try and advance too quickly but hey a level 6 shouldn't play with trolls right?  The main problem with the game is the world map not showing you all the quest locations only the one you are tracking which can lead to a bit of back tracking but it's not game breaking, just annoying. But given some games problems it's not that bad.  I would give this game a solid 8/10 (if they fixed the map a 9/10)  Like RPGs? Get this game. Want to clock some hours in a good game? Get this game. It's on sale get this game.  
2658	0	a	Crashed starting a solo game. Turned all the details and everything down to minimum, still crashed.
4747	1	a	the best thing is if they will come with a dino mode where you can play as a dino vs the humans  
67	1	a	A nice turn-based RPG with a playing-card/poker mechanic. Lots of options to allow for various strategies.
4946	1	a	10/10
2921	0	a	it dose't woke on my windows 7   WTF I wrote this review when i was seven. My friend got me this game to play it but it is not working. I am gonna try to fix it bye reinstaling it but I cant stop laughing about the â¥â¥â¥â¥ review I left/
6080	1	a	There's no reason not to buy it when its not on sale. You shoot dinosaurs.
1521	1	a	great game beat on the ps3 awhile back got a descent laptop and have turned my head against systems , i have beat the game two times on old ps3 now beating again on laptop so yeah its good
1966	1	a	This is a game that deserves its ranking.
2273	1	a	After reading the reviews I picked this sucker up. A much improved version from the last as it seemed sooooo buggy and unplayable. No problems playing and haven't enjoy the game so much since the original and 2nd games.
905	0	a	After playing for three hours I have had enough. The combat is terrible, the AI is laughable, and freedom within the world is utterly restricted.
90	1	a	If you like poker, this game isn't bad, unfortionatly I can't run it anymore since I upgraded to windows 8. Like I said unforttionatly. Well anyone who likes poker and has windows 7 or less go for it get the game
2370	1	a	Do not listen to the metascore!!! This game is awesome and I've had so much fun playing this game so far, if you are thinking about getting this game for the $.99 get it! You won't regret it.
5554	1	a	Great game, the survival mode in single player is the best part. Dino's and Guns! How could that not be at least a little fun. Worth the price!
5835	0	a	Don't buy, This game is a waste of money. If you do you will lag out like hell.
198	0	a	It's a good game. Anyways you will be killing the same damned monsters from the beginning of the game to the end of the game, it's absolutely ridicoulous, there are like 6/7 types of monsters so let's repeat the killing again and again and again.  The good part is the character evolution. You can upgrade your champion in many different ways...  A good game for 6$ but it would have a lot of potential with other monster types
1764	1	a	Fantasic game, great depth and visuals, topped by a thrilling storyline and compelling battle system
6301	0	a	Don't believe the hype! This game is still as crappy as ever. Even free, I regret that I even wasted the hard drive space on it. I normally don't write such scathing reviews, especially about indie titles because I loves me some indie development, but honestly, nothing good to say about this title.   Models = crap level design = uninspired crap skins = crap dinosaurs = unplayable crap Sound desgin = stock crap  This title is best relegated to the dustbin of Steamdom.
1472	1	a	The combat system is very satisfying (seriously, it's great). However, the invisible walls needs getting used to and the world seems small. Regardless, it's much fun. Highly recommended. Just don't expect something massive like Skyrim.
5920	0	a	My thread was deleted because I hurt the Steam Community's feelings but here's my review saying that the Steam Community voting this as a discount from 75 cents to 49 cents makes it the dumbest community on the internet:  The Steam Community voting this as a discount from 75 cents to 49 cents makes it the dumbest community on the internet. And I don't care what you have to say. Your opinion, unless it agrees with mine, is invalid based on the fact that you voted for a game to be 26 cents less. A game no one plays.
2044	1	a	The combat is amazing and fluid, The biggest problems I have with it though is... it's the Jogging Simulator RPG edition!
4732	0	a	What a waste of 99 Cents.
4759	1	a	Worth a dollar. In all other regards-... god awful.  Glitchy mess, feels like premade unity assets.. controls in general feel muddy. Could also really do with a tutorial.
5776	0	a	This game is basically ebola with aids just mixed in there.
3484	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
936	1	a	If you are ever bored and want a game to kill some time on, this one is definitely it. Huge world, tons of weapons and awesome DLC will keep you on this game forever. Yes the crafting can be a bit lopsided once you max out blacksmithing and sage crafting, but to challenge yourself, stick to finding rare unique weapons and you will be just as happy and also dont have to worry about looking at a crafted weapon that is not easy on the eyes.
2225	1	a	dunno what to write. I love it, its as good as disciples 1 and 2 and the new combat system is also a refreshing new aspect. The difficult is hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and unfair in the most parts, but it wasnt any different in the previous games, so this is ok for me :)  Finished the first Campaign and cant find any bad aspects for now. Buy it if you like the previous games
575	1	a	I have played quite a few rpg's before, and many of them I find amazing. This game being one of them. I'm not a fan of rpg's that contain difficult controls/require you to use every key on a keyboard. I find that the most amazing rpg's are ones that spend more time on story, characters, and immerse you into the world that the creators are portraying. So far I haven't played this game for long, but I can tell that it will be an experience I wont forget. Controls are easy, plot seems interesting, and graphics are a little outdated but once you get past that, this game is a lot of fun. I recommend this game to those people who love rpg's, and for those who are just getting started.   9/10
3921	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
1587	1	a	A hybrid between World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls. Having plenty of quests makes this adventure seem robust, however as with all things, quantity over quality seems to be a true balancing act. The quests are not as interesting as Elder Scrolls, but you do find an occassional gem. This is a good game that I can recommend, but you'd be better off than me if it manages to hold your interest and spark your imagination.
4267	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
3780	1	a	Such a fun thing to play with friends, definately reccomend giving it a try. I got addicted.
3788	1	a	i recomanmend this game i played its beta thats why so i think its awsome i think u shoud try it thats all for now see ya :3 
2311	1	a	Step 1: find VTOL Step 2: That's it, you win.
2098	1	a	One of my favorite RPGs of all time even with its lackluster execution on the story/character side of things. The game plays like Fable meets God of War, so its easy for me to forgive its faults. Played and beat every hour of this on 360 and had to buy it again.  9/10 Would buy again.
1858	1	a	This game is amazing. It at first may remind you of skyrim. It was a competitor, and (in my opinion) surpassed skyrim in the following criteria: -World Color: The game world is colorful, vibrant, and lively. Skyrim tends to be dull and gray. -Combat: KOAR blows skyrim out of the water. Think God of War style combat. -Menus: The menu system in KOAR is clean, easy to navigate, and isnt terribly confusing. Anyone that's played Skyrim knows how poor its menu system is.  If you can find this game on sale, get it. It's worth the money, and it's a shame that tools for modification werent released for it.
4779	1	a	THIS GAME SUCKS. I PLAYED 5 HOURS AND I DON'T LIKE THIS. IT CAN IT MY NUTS. WHY SO BAD? WHY? PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME! PLEASE!!!
2265	0	a	Mouse cursor issue - Game unplayable See Support Forums
4466	0	a	This game is a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was gifted to me..so thank you for the gift...but my god....no...nononononononononono
4421	1	a	Im not a graphics guy so I dont care but, the graphics were meh.  But besides it being rushed, and not really telling you what to do, its a fun game!
4118	1	a	Just awesome, i have no idea whats going, just press play and kill every damn prehistoric motherhubber you see. Damn Turok wouldve been proud.  Just awesome.  Ah yeah ps:  â¥â¥â¥â¥ pay2style systems.
483	1	a	The game is well-paced as an action RPG. But, because it was formerly an MMO in development, the whole structure suffers, somewhat, from a multitude of bland quests. Later in the game I've noticed some botched up voice acting too. However, these are just the flaws put up front, the game itself is glorious in it's features.   The storyline also happens to be quite good, although the end is totally expected yet not disappointing in terms of combat. All things considered, the game is a long trek for completionists, one which I hope you will find enjoyable too.   Have fun!
4816	1	a	Needs mor of that japanese puss puss
2834	1	a	Unknown game blew my mind. Plays like HALO!!!! Kill dinosaurs like TUROK!!!! Vehicles work great, leveling up gets addicting. Within the small hour of gameplay I blew a pack of Compy's with a grenade, a triceratops rammed me and knocked me back across the map, stepped on by a trex, ran over a pack of raptors and got picked up by a damn Pterodactyl.....while I was driving a freaking warthog! Instant buy 4 pack for me and my buds.
3639	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
3703	1	a	If you ever thought 'Man, I lreally ike Halo, but what it was really missing was some dinosaur action' and then they took away all the Covenant and Flood, all the story, and added nothing but dinosaurs that seem to want to eat power stations, and your job is to commit genocide on the dinosaurs....  Then this is the game for you! p.s. If you paid more than 99 cents for this game, then you paid too much
1987	1	a	This is easily one of my favourite games. I know I haven't played it much (36 hours at the time I write this) but this is no doubt an extremely fun and replayable game.  The variety of weapon types is excellent and they feel like they have their own unique roll but once you get to the mid-late game stages there are some very cool weapons to be bought and found. The unique/legendary weapons are very powerful but they also feel balanced at the same time and there is a beginner pack that gives new players to the game some good early game gear w/o being too powerful.  The DLC is definately worth buying, you can play them at any time in the game and they have a great storyline. Overall each DLC lasts around 4-6 hours of gametime but that didn't stop me from buying them. The DLC's also add new gear and weapons that aren't too overpowered and they are good for leveling your character if you can't find any side quests to do.  The main storyline is also very well made and probably one of the best in video games. However, there is 1 area where I could just skip a part (I don't think this was a main quest) where all I needed to do was hit a wall a couple times with chakrams and it would open.  The combat is also a very fun aspect of the game with the so called 'destiny' aka class. You can be strictly a warrior, archer/assassin or a mage or you can mix it up a bit for some more fun or you can put all 3 trees together to become a Jack of All Trades. The camera can be a bit annoying at times in combat but I can cope with it.
1362	1	a	Get the camera fix and don't mind the few bugs you come across.  This game is great..
3385	1	a	So this is how the dinosaurs became extinct... 10/10, would force species into extinction again.
622	1	a	It's really insane how overlooked this game actually is. It should be up there with titles like Fable and Dragon Age, and yet I have rarely seen anyone bring it up in fantasy RPGs discussions. Great maps, stunning locations, captivating storyline (both the original game's as well as the DLC's), good voice acting, beautiful OST and replay value.   
3586	1	a	This game is soooooo underrated its not even funny. I bought i for myself and three other friends and played it. I have to sa that i didn't expect to play it for 5 hours straight. Its amazingly fun and has many game modes. I was also impressed witht eh amount of detail the developers put into the game, the simple fact that you can play the newly added map and have to worry about your visor getting iced up is so funny and cool. The game is much better than the meta-score entails. If u read this before the free week is up try it out, and definately try out conquest. I would say more but i would be here for a while :D
2276	1	a	Love these devs.  Not to often you see a dev making fun of themselves. 'In 2012... We released the worst game ever'    The game is pretty fun overall, glad i got it to support them :)
56	1	a	If you like mixing poker with adenturing around, this is a good one for you.
2495	1	a	ORION: Prelude  Would totally recommend this game! It's a fun dino FPS that's great for playing with friends. You capture bases, buy weapons, get upgrades, and fight off dino hordes!  PLUS if you like getting achievements there are tons that come really easily, mostly from just casually playing the game.  Picked this up for $1.50 in the steam summer sale and would give it an 8 - 10
3239	1	a	I purchased a 4 pack of this game while it was on sale, not expecting much, but man, was that the best three dollars I ever spent. If I would have purchased this game at the full price, I would still not regret it. This game is loads of fun by yourself, but grab a couple of buds, and it gets just 10x better.If you are debating wether or not to get this game, I would advise you greatly to take $15 out of your wallet and throw it down on this game. Seriously. You won't regret it.
2067	1	a	A game with an awesome combat style, the it's story fails to interest me lackluster charcters, bit overall it's a awesoemllme game
4385	0	a	What could have been an awesome game is ruined by bad performance and even worse FPS mechanics. It just isn't fun.  Verdict: PASS
4745	1	a	It's a fun game, simple, slightly stupid, and way more fun than I had expected from it. It's worth the 15 dollars you can usually get it for, but I've seen it on sale for 93% off a few times, and i'd recommend you stock up on a few copies for you and your friends any time it's on sale.
5164	1	a	After seeing the price and the screen shots and game videos I knew I had to get it. Gameplay is great. Although I do wish their were more waves with bigger/more bad â¥â¥â¥ dinos. My only critic of the game is that it is extremely hardware intensive. Most games i play make my computer temperature around 40 at most but this game made my GPU almost at 56 at some moments.
5240	1	a	The best firest P shooter ever made and whith DINOS
2222	1	a	'Just one more turn' game. And for this game it is completely true. It was very difficult to end it and so I spent a several long nights with it. AI is not much but fortunattely no totally dumb and for pre-scripted single player it's clever enough.
6178	0	a	Also just 3 â¬ in the summer sale were too much for this game....
875	0	a	great combat bland world so so game find a diffrent time sink
3540	1	a	trex scope acoos map 420\10 would rek dinosaurs again
2059	1	a	I have one regret... Why did I refund this game... 
3399	1	a	You may get what you pay for in terms of functionality but the game does seem to run ok with only minor issues, but I mean come on..dinosaurs..guns..JET PACKS what more do you want? lots of fun
3837	1	a	Fun to Play with friends
1492	1	a	Ok, this game is simply amazing, i dind't really played that much through the other classes elements, but as a rogue-ish thieve-is archer, is just awesome, the story is great, really nice time shifting stuff, and the way the story runs arround the main character is also really great. The way you manage your inventory, your skills and your abilities is very complex, yet simple to use. Well, i really like open world RPGs with nice story, so i might be overestimating this game, but i think it really is superior to similar styled games.
4370	1	a	Dinosaur heads that run around, pirate dinosaurs, soldiers riding dinosaurs and idiots, your teammates who will better camp on a rock than revive you. 10/10 would die again.
4387	0	a	'we will not be pursuing legal action...'  ...because we would lose so fast our heads would spin.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ DEVs that steals assests, lies about it, gets caught lying, then gets all defensive and self righteous when the whole communbity turns his 'evidence' upside down on his â¥â¥â¥â¥ filled head.  for the record, those photos which 'prove' he didnt steal assests have been pretty much proven to be lies as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s of better non biased photos showing clear copying have surfaced.  for the record, I think Activision are a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s too, but at least they put the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a nice silver platter for you to see before you eat it. and they don't rerelease the SAME game under different titles to try to cover up negative reviews...this is now the 3rd or 4th name change since 2012.  oh, the game you ask?  .... it sucks.   it has and pretty much always will regardless of all the stolen COD/starwars/other assets.   (keep in mind I paid 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars for this garbage back in EA) *(working on refund for Gaming's sake)* deleting it regardless to make my own point if it fails.  gonna go play a GOOD game, like ARK.
2842	1	a	Onion:Shreklude &lt;--- thats how i feel about this game. &lt;3
4006	0	a	If this game was paying you to play it then maybe it would have been worth the install.  This game feels worse than some of the 'Starseige: Tribes' mods I played more than 10 years ago.  The character animations are very clunky, most of the UI looks like it was made by a 14 year old in paint.  Weapons have no semblance of balance, the knife is the most powerful weapon in the game by miles.
1233	1	a	Very good game. Wish skyrim had a similar combat system for melee combat
573	1	a	I love yjis game. Prettiest RPG ever. And I love the fighting system!
1502	1	a	Great older RPG! It reminds me a bit of fable but with better combat and much more to do. Levelling up seems to take forever but that's okay. Overall great!
5472	0	a	this game sucks
1460	1	a	If you loved skyrim and oblivion and want something similar then this game is amazing. needs another 3rd person camera angle though.
5281	1	a	  Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ that hurt to play.
4527	1	a	This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of our universe has to offer.  10/10
3531	1	a	Dino Horde is the best horde
5247	1	a	i wish if u can be a dino it will be so awesome
2080	1	a	This is a fun, immersive game. I enjoy it's combat and the depth of skills. The class system is also different from what I have played before. If you enjoy action, combat, fantasy, or RPG games I recommend this game.
3164	1	a	Fun for while. Jokes for a while. Id reccomend of youre bored. 10/bored
4094	0	a	This game has its moments, and it might be fun for the first 7 miliseconds but after that it gets rediculous, sadly the game had some potential. It has exciting graphics, and thats it! Don't even get me started about the 'eaten mechanics'. The game also suckers us (the consumers) into buying it with its few over-average screenshots. Please dont buy this....
1639	1	a	Very under rated...this is a really fun game.
2023	1	a	Love this game and everything about it!
2715	1	a	Many dinosaurs, weapons and game modes ! To take urgent !
2813	1	a	Awesome game especially for not even a buck Orion &gt; McDouble
1927	1	a	A great action adventure role-playing game with a vast open world to explore and many quests to complete. Plenty of skill trees to try out and crafting to do, from potions to blacksmithing to enchantment. Suffers from clunky interface and at times it can feel grindy. All the characters are however, well voice acted and can bring a lot of life to the game. Finally, all cutscenes (and dialogue) are skippable. So yay to that. Worth purchasing during the sale, at $10 for base + all DLC.  Perhaps the greatest cons that are holding this game back in my opinion, is the very clunky interface when it comes to inventory and quest management. Instead of pressing, say, 'I' to open up an inventory screen, you have to press ESC to go to the menu and access your inventory from there. You can also only track one quest at a time, and can only view other quests on your local map provided that you're in the correct zone (this took a bit to figure out, but once it was figured out the single-quest tracking no longer posed a problem). Any other quests outside of your zone will not show up on your minimap. The game also has lots of loading screens, though they are rarely more than 10 seconds each, split between instances and interior / exterior transitions.   The game's combat can be very fun, a hack and slash sort of feel, with contextual 'moves' to use (i.e. pausing just before a second attack and you will launch enemies into the air) and the variety of skills to invest into can really mix up the gameplay. There's also a fate meter, which is essentially an execution bar where you go into a rage and deal extra damage whilst everything around you moves in slow motion, then you can execute enemies which kills all 'knocked down' enemies around you, whilst granting you bonus XP. You have your wizard, rogue and warrior skill tree. You have two weapon slots to quickly switch between as well as a 1-9 spell slot (casted by right clicking). The control might feel a bit console-like at first, but it's no where near as bad of a port as some other games have been (i.e. dark souls). Simply put, very playable. The graphics also look aesthetically pleasing, no real complaints.  There's a lack of 'open world' things to do beyond questing and hunting mobs, though there is more than enough dialogue to fill in each city / town / hub as well as letters and books to collect.  A revamped interface (as in, an actual in-game UI inventory screen, quest tracker and similar, would be significantly more palatable than its current clunky interface) and the addition of a few mounts could really improve this game.  Probably an 8/10. Definitely should pick this up during the sale (currently at 10$ for base game + all the DLC, which are worth the money).
1156	1	a	easy to play rpg
231	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur combines everything I love about role playing games with a hint of fighting with combos from games of my youth. I love the music, game-play and the lore. I find this game highly addictive, with instant gratification and flexible play style. I would reccommend this game for any players looking for a fresh RPG.
5995	1	a	Actually enjoyable and the for the price you get alot.
2085	1	a	A good but not great RPG. I was looking for something to play and stumbled upon this. First impressions were great, but my opinion went down a bit after that. The world is enourmous, and there is tons to do, but unless your a completionist I would recommend not bothering with a lot of the sidequests, there are to many of them. I don't regret buying this game, I had a fun 20 hours, however the midgame is stretching on so long I have soured to it, and it's quite unlikely I finish it.
6015	1	a	This game is bad. BUT it is also  fun . There are many horribly bad games that you can enjoy, especially with a friend. And this is one of those games. Just grab a friend or two and play without thinking about it and you will find yourself having a good time even though you know that you shouldn't enjoy it.
5503	0	a	This game is actual â¥â¥â¥â¥. but thats just my opinion. as soon as i started it up 1 my game lagged so bag on the title screen. 2 the game was fine in the actual game? idk why. 3 flying raptors? huh 4 dinos walking sideways. basicly flipped on there side walking on a invisible wall. 5 Lag 6 me and my friend where playing and there was a dino walking across the sky box... 7 sliding dinos with no walk animation. It might be worth it to some people but PLEASE do not waste your money.. because i can guarantee you will want a refunt in under a hour..
6363	1	a	Stupid fun. I mean that literally. A weekend dollar well spent. Get your friends, kill some dinos, use a jetpack, laugh.
4927	1	a	Orion Prelude is a weird game, you either like the game or completely hate it in every way, but for $1 i had to try it out and in my opinion its a decent game. Its not utterly terrible, but its not an awesome game, its an all around fun dino shoot em up. If you have a couple of spare bucks then by all means try the game out, if you like Halo and Dinosaurs then this is your type of game.
406	1	a	An under the cover game, dwarfed by other releases such as the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, this game should be viewed in greater light and strength. An addictive expansive world fuelled by a real fantastical scenario and setting, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning brings strong RPG elements to an otherwise uncomplicated genre. Though this game is stuck between an MMO and a traditional RPG, its combat, crafting and magical elements make this game a strong condendor for anyone looking to play an addictive, massive world game. The downsides to this game may be considerable for some: the purely linear main campaign, the massive open world with no fast travel and lack of considerable and ultimately interesting quests. Nevertheless, it makes up for these pitfalls in interesting dialogue that is both well tohugh out and witty. It is a real blast for any gamer. 8/10
2763	1	a	Great game to play with friends. Not too difficult, enjoyable multiplayer and a fun concept. The announcer is one of the best features of the game, would recommend.
4489	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a great game that i got for only Â£0.99!!!! i was amazed at how good it was as i had never heard of it before, it has a great singleplayer and multiplayer experience and the graphics are phenominal!!! 100% must buy!!!!
1096	1	a	The most under rated game of all time! This game is amazing in so many ways i cannot even begin to describe it! I don't know how this one went under the radar but it got everything right in terms of what an rpg game is. This game should be used as a benchmarch for any company that is thinking about making an rpg game. Simply amazing! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a rpg fan, you need to play this! :)
3888	1	a	This is a great game but I feel that the fight to survive feature is not good because you CANNOT kill a dino with a pistol.But still the game rocks :D
6188	1	a	5 Gabens/10  This game still looks a little rusty but it wont avoid making you a freaking addict to it.  Chased a T-Rex got surrounded by a swarm and died, would chase again.
3098	1	a	donno if its just me but its super laggy, can't see the dinos or anything else. I also played it on a friends PC and was great   9/10 great game
5328	1	a	This game has awesome co-op! They seriously have improved so much since last time when I played! Go and get it, It has beautiful environments, and has Multiplayer go fight against players and friends  I. Am. Now. A. Huge. Fan. Of. This. Game. You. Should. Be. Too. :)
5408	0	a	Want my money back since now it's free and I paid like $4 for this game.
3965	1	a	This is the best $1 i've spent since i boned ur mum
2409	1	a	It's pretty much Halo: Reach but you're killing dinosaurs instead of screaming children.
3879	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous, survival-based cooperative gameplay and retro-inspired Arena Combat, 'ORION: Prelude' features massive, Open World Cooperative and PvPvE.
1430	1	a	Its a fun game, until you realize that its super hard with a play style that doesn't involve shooting fire from your hands and poses no challenge when you do.
1664	1	a	Fantastic RPG Game! with alot of contents! I luv it! Highly Recommend it! ;)
2507	1	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun its unreal. There is a survival horde mode and PvP. A solid 10 hours of fun AT LEAST
4529	0	a	its not even like they genuinly tried, its just such a lazy game.
4794	1	a	This game feels like halo 4
1733	1	a	The combat. Good Lord, the combat. Polished, slick, and smooth with just the right amounts of visceral brutality. The Destiny system allows for less restriction between magic, melee or ranged archetypes and allows for great customization options. While the storyline is a bit cliched, it possesses a quaint feel, and it, along with the charmingly designed overworld, makes you feel like you're the star in your own Disney Pixar movie. Well, one with copious amounts of blood, that is. GET.
652	1	a	Great RPG but the fact that it is a console port hurts it. The controls and interface could have been done better in the PC version. The combat is very satisfying, though.
3007	1	a	Good, fun, addictive game, great to mp with mates
318	1	a	A good game with tons of content. If you're a completionist like me, you'll put 100 hours into this easily. The art style is kind of WoW-ey but that has allowed it to age well. It's challenging without being artifically difficult, and the DLC adds a lot of content.   Pretty standard plot, you're a special guy/gal that needs to save the world from ancient evil. But if you like exploring a (mostly) non-linear world and killing baddies for loot, it's a good game and certainly worth the time.
3160	1	a	First person shooter game sets in Dinosaur survival cooperative, big maps setting, survival mode waves with few objectives task to finish it. Killing dinosaurs to earn credits, you can buy upgrades, weapons or items. There a three class in this game, Assault, Support and Recon. The Assault has the ability to use his jetpack to easily escape from the dinosaurs as well going through unpassable obstacles. The Support has the ability to heal his teammates and also can heal himself and perhaps can act as a tank in the group, the last and finally. The Recon is my favorite class since the ability itself can cloak invinsibility to save herself in the trouble or revive her teammates, i also forgot to mention. There are alot of maps, game modes, etc.   I bought this game and i really enjoyed alot, even though there are minor bugs. They will always fixed the bugs and go for the updates, i highly appreciated of what the developers did because they listen to the community players. Take note that this is an Indie Game and its actually a small company who made this game. Some old low reviews came from Orion: Dino beatdown predecessor so there are lots of changes in the gameplay.  Rated: 8.7/10
4973	1	a	Fun for a few hours with your friends, and is incredibly cheap, so I'd buy it just to play for one afternoon
3438	0	a	With so many back of the box mechanics, how on earth could I possibly not recommend this game? Dinosaurs! Jetpacks! Mechs! Character progression! What more could you want?  Well, as it turns out, quite a bit.  From my mere hour impression of the game (and it might come alive later, I wouldn't know) the game feels like an absolute mess. Sure, they've crammed a ton of stuff into here. But I couldn't make out a *game* anywhere. It's hard to explain, but I just couldn't get a sense of what I was supposed to do, let alone why. I couldn't get any traction in this game, I coulnd't make any sense of it. Shooting, movement, everything feels loose and just *meh*. so there weren't any moments that felt satisfying.  I can't even try to comment on visuals, ripped off mechanics, or anything like that. I was just too frickin bored to even bother with anything beyond these meager first impressions.   If you can get it on sale, you're sure to get your money's worth. But if you buying games to actually play them and not just for the sake of buying them, at least wait for another free weekend so you can try before you buy.
5999	1	a	Basically Halo maps copied and pasted with a ton of dinosaurs added in. The fact that it's 59p makes that okay. 
3179	1	a	This game isn't too bad, and I know I say this with a very low gameplay count, but it isn't THAT bad. I definitely think that this game has improved, although I hadn't played the older versions, hearing it from other players, it seemed to evolve a ton. The developers seem fun, seeing as they called their old game 'the worst game ever', which is always nice to have good developers. I bought the fourpack for my friends, still haven't given all of them away though.  Let's start with the graphics. When I first launched the game, the title screen was okay, and then I joined a game and the graphics seemed a little... strange, not too well done. Then again, I'm used to ARK graphics, which is most likely why. As I went deeper into the game, I ignored the faulty graphics and I think it's still enjoyable.  Onto the gameplay. When I started up the game, I went into a server to see what everything was about. Wow, I never thought I'd be so confused - I went into a random gamemode, chose to play as a Dilo, and had no clue what I was doing. I started spitting everywhere and a human crawled up next to me and blew me up. That was that for that server, so I went into the Survival gamemode with a few other players. Man, that was certainly a plus. The survival gamemode is fun, waves of dinosaurs of all types, and it's decently challenging when you have everyone come after you. It took me about 5 minutes to get the hang of it (which I am a fast learner, sometimes), and all was good. I followed my teammates to see what was going on, shot dinosaurs, killed a pteradon. Overall, the gameplay I've had so far has been decent.  Honestly, this game is good and all, but don't have high hopes. But then again, for $1, the price of a can of coke, this is worth it, definitely. Sure, there may be glitches, the gameplay may be wonky, the dinosaurs kill you every two minutes, but if you manage to look past its faults, Orion: Prelude is a wonderful game. I'd rate it 7/10.
3801	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde doesn't look special at first glance. However, the gameplay is extremely fun and the developers CONSTANTLY add new content such as new game modes, new dinosaurs, new maps, and new weapons. Highly recommended.
4606	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this â¥â¥â¥â¥
6217	0	a	Only good part of this game is buying a vehicle and racing your friends. The dinosaurs are â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1816	1	a	 KoA:Reckoning  is a fantastic RPG. Fans of Skyrim and the like will probably be somewhat irked with it, as it's not open-world and the quests tend to be rather repetitive in their layout, but it offers a lot of things that are brand-new to the RPG scene, from entirely new perspectives on characters (like Fae and the four varieties of giant-kin) and exceptional game mechanics both in leveling and playing.   That said, the storyline is amazing, the lore is rich beyond belief (I'd say it's about as deep as Skyrim's - and Bethesda has been working on TES for a lot longer than this game had), and the combat system will simply blow you away: It's fast, fluid, intuitive, and fun. I, for one, have not been able to play Skyrim after playing Reckoning simply because I get bored with Skyrim's mechanics. It has a feel that, I agree with 38 Studios, there is no better word for than 'storybook': Where Skyrim is a gritty reality, Reckoning is a land of fairy tales none of which you know and all of which are fantastically created. And yes, fellow Grimm's fans, not all of the stories are as light as Disney; in fact, almost none of them are. If you're a lorehound, be sure to get the DLC; when it was clear that the game wasn't doing well enough, lore got packed into both the DLCs, though 'The Legend of Dead Kel' got most of it. And there is a lot of lore to get, even huge amounts hinted at having been fleshed out without being actually explained in-game like the Dverga and Varani societies.   More minor issues with the game are mostly things like not being able to jump except at certain jump down points (though the jump down points become a fun mechanic in a lot of places), not being able to collect all the unique armor pieces or weapons or all the armor sets (though the DLC both adds more and helps a lot by adding more collection opportunities), and the fact that even though the game was clearly designed for it and it's even mentioned in one of the opening cinematics you can't actually play as a giant Jottun (though you do get to fight them and it is fun). Also, the storybook nature can be irritating to a lot of people; you will recognize every character in the game from somewhere else, including the hypersexualized elf chick with a confrontational attitude.   Overall, not The Best RPG Evar, but worth a helluva lot more attention than it has gotten, and even if you're not a fan of its style worth at least one playthrough. It's certainly  my  favorite RPG.
379	1	a	A great free roam game that incorporates strategies and battle movements as well as a dynamic storyline to make this game more than just a hack and slash game.
205	1	a	Oh ya great game and get a 9.5/10 from me very few bugs/glitches but not gonna get into that cause it really dosen't get in the way of the gameplay. It's on sale I say if you like other rpg's at least check it out its control on gamepad and kb/m are very responsive. I have made a combo class mage/warrior and it works great lol I love it. I have been away from it for a while but gonna get back to it soon but ya a great rpg and worth a 75% off price maybe even 50% off but thats up to you to decide :)!
3740	1	a	Great dinosaur arena game eventhough the meta score is low i love playing it with friends. There are ten different types of dinosaurs and six different types of vehicles. You have to make it threw a few rounds and capture a couple outposts to win the game but all in all it is definantly worth the money it costs!
3496	1	a	Good Game But With One Major Problem.......The Lag Can Be Overwhelmingly Bad With A PC/Laptop Of Around i3, If The Curators Of The Game Could Fix It Then I Might Give It A 9/10
2714	0	a	When I first contemplated buying this game, I though: It's so cheap. It's like buying a can of coke, surely this will be more enjoyable. I was wrong, this buggy, spasmy game full of rubberbanding is not only more repetetive than a pendulum, but is actually less fun than watching one. The graphics suck, the game lacks animations, the sound is lofi. Even the announcer is laughably terrible.   There you have it. I should have gone with that can of coke.  3/10  Also, can you get refunds on steam?
4162	1	a	Amazing amount of fun for the steam sale price, why did this game get only a 36 on MC?
3930	0	a	Terrible texture,animation and model quality, 90% of servers are either lagging too much to be played at or empty/full of afk players, over 200 useless achievements which is probably the place where the budget went(kill 100,500,1000 enemies with 'insert weapon name here'). Not even worth your bandwidth, more-so your money. 2/10
2136	1	a	Running Windows 10. Summer sale bought it for PC and love the amount of content music and stories in the game. For 5 euros so much worth.  You can setup your character in anyway you like with whatever weapons and trees you want to follow or mix. SO gives a lot of choices.
5688	0	a	This is trash look at all the reviews no one can handle more than 10 hours of this crap on average i mean like really what did i expect from a $1 game all my friends said oh so good played 1 match they were saying how crap it was and cheaply made want a good game with dinosaurs get ARK survival evolved or something better atleast please don't fund the devs stupidity.
2505	1	a	gameplay 1/3 story 9/1 graphics 2.14/6 moms 8/4  Overall 10/10 Game of the last year
3982	0	a	The metascore is NOT misleading, the trailer is. Do not get this game, even if it is on sale for .99 cents. DO NOT listen to the quotes in the trailer, those were probably from the devs of the game. Seriously though, this game really sucked hard and there were so many bugs and issues with optimization. Not to mention the animations of the dinos, which were some of the worst animations i've ever seen. Don't get this game.
5251	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.. It doesn't ever want to work whenever i start it up. It loads for a second then stops working when i try to play solo. It also doesn't let me join any online games. 0/10 no joke.... i paid money for a game that should be F2P since it doesn't work 
1826	0	a	Having STUPID sound issued and not a single way of fixng I can't recommend this game...  I thought this kind of issued had been solved but nope...   
268	1	a	Amalur is still as fun now as the first time I played it. High quality game with heavy replayability. If your on the fence as to whether its still good to pick up...buy it.
3504	1	a	The Godfather of video games
5042	1	a	I want a death match where a team is made ââup of dinosaurs
184	1	a	This game is often compared to Skyrim, for a reason. Both present a huge, open fantasy world with hundreds of quest which can be taken in no particular order. This is, however, where any similarities with Skyrim end.   Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has stunning and very colorful visuals that had me hooked in an instant. I pay a LOT of attention to scenarios in RPGs, and Amalur probably has the most beautiful I've ever seen. The forests, ruins and towns really give you the impression of a world full of things to explore.   That being said, there are a bunch of things that feel 'off' in this game. The gameplay is just fine: not brilliant but not bad either. It is not a challenging game and most of the time I just found easier to hack and slash my way to victory than to use spells or rogue abilites. The way your casting is interrupted by literally any attack is really annoying and counterintuitive. The most powerful AoE spells take a long time to cast, and should be more useful against several enemies, but chances of being interrupted are huge and therefore said spells become useless. Like I said, the melee strategy was the most efficient by far for me, which is a little underwhelming since I really like using magic.   Another problem with Amalur: questing. 90% of quests will reward you with gold and experience. The quests have some cool stories and lore behing them, but being rewarded with the same things over and over agains becomes tiresome, especially considering you won't need that amuch gold.  There's also no reason NOT to use the 'fast travel' ability, which makes exploring the world less interesting as well. You won't get cool random events like in Skyrim, ever. 90% of the experience you get comes from quests as well, so fighting monsters is not a reason to backtrack ON FOOT (because there are no mounts).  To be honest I think Amalur should have inspired itself in Skyrim even more. Maybe it didn't had the budget to do so, I don't know. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is crazy about fantasy and cool scenarios (like me), but be mindful that most of it's problems are glaringly obvious for players who are used to play lots of RPG games. That being said, Amalur does provide a satisfying experience under its own limitations.
2178	1	a	This game was a lot more fun than I expected. Great action RPG. I really liked that you're not locked into a class.
931	1	a	This is an underrated gem of a game. While it is true that the developer went bankrupt, it wasn't from this game. The fact EA continues to publicise and sell this game speaks of its appeal.  With the use of Widescreen Fixer to adjust the over-the-shoulder viewing and the endless hours of content, this game is well worth playing. While the graphics are a little more World of Warcraft like than Dragon Age, there is some depth to the fighting system. I would call this an open world RPG that is a pleasure to explore. You can build your character as a pure warrior, a mage/warrior hybrid, a warrior/rogue, or go full fighter/rogue/mage. I am in the middle of a second playthrough and the last one took 70 hours.  If I were to list the cons, they would be that combat can get rather simplistic, the dispel mini-game gets old, some items in your inventory cannot be dropped permanently reducing your potential inventory space and a few dialogue timing mistakes here and there.  Since the item drops scale to your level, I don't recommend wasting money on the weapons and armor DLC since it matches the level you play when you obtain the DLC, which is level 1, and the items are mostly useless by the time you can access them.
1252	1	a	This game is fun, just plain and simple. The mechanics are simple to learn and not overwhelming. The graphics are pretty decent and it's very engaging gameplay.
1219	1	a	nothing terribly original here. but the foundation is solid and everything from the questing to the combat is tight and fun. i found the story to be rather compelling as well. definitely pick this up.
5043	0	a	This game is so broken it hurts.The dinosaurs glitch around,the animation is garbage,the game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my high-end PC on the lowest setting,and the fps keeps dropping and increasing every five seconds.Really don't buy it.Buy ORION instead.It's better in every way
4117	1	a	GAME OF THE YEAR 2013.
5101	1	a	holy cow the uninstall button really works best 1 dollar ive ever spent 
5714	1	a	bset game ever, and this should cost 60 euros! and more! Great graphices nice gameplay best game I played
2666	1	a	The Best Way to play this game, Is to play with freinds.
5041	1	a	I AM CRAZY TO THE GAME
736	1	a	I am better than you at this game.
3321	1	a	awesome game get it while the special last, you will be hooked trust me.
5319	1	a	One of the fun and funniest game that comes with good price
1518	1	a	wow awesome game! i wish i could see the true completed version but we may never get to see it. overall this is the baddest 1 player rpg hack slash / loot game ever unique items are epic .
2297	1	a	Its Halo 2, but with more dinosaurs
3010	1	a	Its a fun game and totally worth $1 i say get it and just enjoy the fruits
2985	1	a	Would deffinately recomend this game! It plays a lot like borderlands and horde mode from gears of war. Really fun and challenging, especially with a couple of friends!
5216	1	a	Great game with dinosaur fighting and good stratergy :D
5887	0	a	Stolen game, shameful display by the developer. Do not support with your sheckles
2990	1	a	I was rather worried about all the bad reviews, and the awful metascore this game had recieved, but given my interest in games like Killing Floor and Halo, I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, how bad can dinosaur killing be, right?  I downloaded the free trial, and WOW was I in for a surprise. It was just good, clean fun. It didn't feel as tight as Killing Floor, or as 'Next-Gen' as Halo usually does, but the combination of those two, and lack of real seriousness about the game make a fantastically fun time sink, and an extremely enjoyable game.  Within 15 minutes, I decided it was worth the $0.99 to pick this game up, as I had already had more fun playing it than I have had in a game like this since Killing Floor, and I do not regret it one bit, especially at this price.  While there are a few bugs here and there, such as dinos occasionally flying up to unbelievable heights, and arrows hovering after they have fired and hit a target. But there doesn't seem to be much of anything that gets in the way of the actual gameplay.  While to this point, I have not strayed much from the Players vs. Dinosaurs Survival mode (which is truly fantastic when you get a good group of people playing with you), there are many other different gameplay modes that provide good variety. Also, there is a pretty good selection of weapons in this game, catering to many different tastes, and nothing seems to be TOO over powered, with weapons seeming to be rather well balanced. The different 'Augmentations' are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to play to your own strengths instead of always having a vanilla character.  TL;DR:  Overall, this is a really good game, and has changed a lot for the better from the game that recieved a 35 metascore. Definitely worth the $1 it is right now, and probably even the $10 or $15 it is at full price.
1738	1	a	Huge world, lots of content with epic and smooth combat that could've been taken straight from an action game. I could never wish more!
1047	1	a	Its like fable 2, but not crap
5231	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
4762	1	a	This gud game make me happy, fun playing with friend.. ( can i get spiral coin without paying real money? maybe i can get it with complete a leve? )
546	1	a	Definitely a hidden gem. Lots to do, engaging combat mechanics, boss fights keep changing until the end of the game, so you do not just always fight the 'same' boss with similar mechanics. Amazing game, highly recommended.
5285	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
5951	0	a	&gt; starts game &gt; ((wow the graphics are great)) &gt; no tutorial or hints &gt; finally figures out how to play &gt; starts private game with AI teammates &gt; is having fun for 3 minutes &gt; realizes game is extremely unbalanced and literally nothing is fair &gt; tries to give the game some growing room, hoping i'll learn to love it &gt; gets a vehicle &gt; pauses game to â¥â¥â¥â¥ &gt; unpauses &gt; vehicle blows up and my entire team is dead  -10/10 would play again
3557	1	a	Mant people say this isn't a good game but it actually is. Give it a try and see how cool is to fight those dinosaurs with friends :D
600	1	a	Great game. Own it on steam and Xbox.
3892	1	a	It was a fun game in its original form, had many flaws though. But after all of its failures it came back as an amazing game and is a great example of developers being able to turn a game around for the better!
4418	0	a	  Cool game but i dont play it very often.
6329	1	a	Bought It a long LONG time ago, Its still looks amazing and trust me, It Is amazing!
5806	1	a	How can I review this game I don't even own it.
93	1	a	Fun game. However, needs a few things to be really enjoyable.  1. Autosaving. This game has NO autosaving. I found this out when I closed the game and reloaded, only to find I had no save data available. There were three hours of work. 2. When I stack together a straight flush or a royal flush and hit my opponent, the game really ought to have some cool super attack special or something. I felt miffed when I got royal flushes time and again, hitting for a whopping 50 damage, and it was the same piddly animation as always.  That being said, it's a fun Solitaire+Poker+RPG, and I rate it a solid 9/10.
2108	1	a	One of the few games that managed to keep me entertained for hours. A must play for anyone who loves RPG games
2622	1	a	10/10 it's ok
3853	1	a	Vass: 'Have I ever told you the deffinion of insanity?'  Me: 'No, but I have played ORION Prelude so I think I know it'
5275	1	a	Surpringly fun. The menu is absolute balls and horrible, but the actual gameplay is fun. Be warned the game is very sensitive to ping. Anything over 100 starts getting a little annoying.
1124	1	a	Really enjoyed the game, great scenery and great graphics, enjoyable and well thought out storyline. The combat isn't the most incredible or challenging thing I have ever played but it was still fun and is worth playing.
1985	1	a	This game is seriously lacking in climbing gear.
3591	1	a	Sold a duplicate Portal 2 trading card to get the money for this game. Went in, played, and was eaten by a t-rex.  11/10
3270	1	a	Got gangbanged by chickens, 10/10
5334	1	a	A co-op shooter where you fight waves of Dinosaurs. Very similar to Killing Floor. Would murder waves of extinct animals again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v44GiUhVAbw 
3050	1	a	Firtst off all Outstanding... Met score WTF this game is amazing why would anyone not want this game.. if you think about getting it.... wait why the F*** are you THINKING about getting this game. If your PC can run it get it! :) Here is a list of postitive things. 1) So Addicting  2) Great Game to play with family and friends 3) Great Open World DINO MURDER HELL YEAA!  Here are some negitives 1)Sometimes when you kill a big dino such as a spinosaurus it may crash, this has only happend to my twice and has only happened because my pc is a load of A hole. 2)Animations could be improved (But who cares right?) 3) In game Purchases, such as spiral points that I wish you could earn by leveling up. WHYYY.  Thats it! I rate it... 8/10 (Still some flaws; such as animations and in game purchases.) Addictive rating: REALLY GOD DAMN HIGH!  I love this game hope you do too :) Bye!
2721	1	a	One time, my girlfriend had this dream that me, her, and all of my friends were riding this huge pterodactyl. We were armed with assault rifles and flame throwers, soaring through the sky. There were many raptors and lions beneath us, which we were mowing down by the ton with our guns.
5587	1	a	Better put some prelude on that, you dinoâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5930	1	a	I love the idea of the game, and i definitely recommend it IF you have someone to play it with. It's still worth the money
5706	0	a	I found that this games graphics were lacking and the humans were underpowered and the dinos extremely overpowered also the weepons were very unbalanced
2081	1	a	Great game with a bright crisp art style.  Combat is fun and smooth with blocking and countering easy and clear, though you may find yourself fighting the camera to try and see everything that is around you. Being able to change your experience points at any time to change your class and play style is a great feature for a game as big as this one so you can mix and match to suit you.  how ever the term 'walking god of destruction' comes to mind in the late game as you can (with the right specs) can become so over powered that nothing can stand before you. so play on the hardest difficultly setting for any real challenge
1207	1	a	My brief take on KoA: I recommend this game if you enjoy action RPGs in fantasy settings. Having said that, I should point out that I haven't actually finished the main quest, and have been on a hiatus from the game for a couple of months, but I am looking forward to getting back to it in the not too distant future. I've started the game with a couple of different characters in order to see how different choices and character builds affect progress, and I feel like doing that has been reasonably rewarding, although there are not many choices with significant ramifications (they typically relate to which reward you get for completing a task or side quest).   I do recommend you wait to get it and its DLC on sale.   My less brief take:  For me, this game's strengths are an open world that's fun to explore and nicely designed, a combat system that encourages players to try different combat styles, fairly engaging stories within the main quest and the factional side quests, and some interesting/funny NPCs, particularly in those factional side quests. I'm sure I could have finished the main quest in the amount of time I've played, but I really liked doing the factional quests and spent a lot of time on the Legend of Dead Kel DLC. That was among my favorite storylines in the whole game, at least so far, which is why I recommend getting the DLCs in addition to the base game.  The most noticeable weaknesses are that the simple side missions can get repetitive, inventory and crafting could have been designed better and crafting is not very useful until you've leveled your crafting-related skills up somewhat, and there'll come a point where your character and weaponry is leveled up past the point where combat is very challenging in most instances. (On that last point, take a look at the article on the Amalur wiki that describes the 'Area-Level Cap' - apparently you can compensate for this to some extent if you want to amend your play style to do so.)  I bought a discount bundle containing Steam keys for the base game and the two story expansion DLCs from another online retailer; I paid about 25% of the current full price of $40 for the collection. I certainly feel I've got my money's worth so far; I'm not sure I'd recommend paying full price for it, but it does go on sale on Steam pretty often, and it's definitely $20 worth of entertainment if not a bit more.   If you're considering buying the game, you may be wondering why the game doesn't have a great deal of name recognition, and whether that lack of recognition reflects the overall quality of the game. While it has shortcomings, I think the game was unlucky in that (a) it was somewhat overlooked upon release because it was viewed as competing with Skyrim, though the two games are pretty different in terms of tone and overall experience and (b) the developer went bust in a very public fashion not too long after release, which I think cast something of a pall on the game's ongoing reputation, or at least did not help it any. If you like open world action RPGs and are willing to overlook some minor flaws, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this game.  If someone buys the game's intellectual property, I'd love to see either a sequel in similar format, or further development of the idea for the MMO that was supposed to succeed KoA.
577	0	a	I spent hours playing this game, hoping at some point that it would get better. Sadly it did not.  The action in the game is quite good, one as to be on their toes when fighting multiple monters/enemies. But sadly it gets repetitive.  The monsters that you encounter in beginning will be the same ones that you encounter at the very end. All they do is call them different things. Example: 'Weak boggart in the beginning versus Strong Boggart' in the end.   The characters are forgettable, some of them really even have no business being in the plot.   The quests are fun at first but then they just devolve into 'go here, kill 5 wolves, come back'   The plot is interesting and seemingly original at first but by half way into the story it just turns into total garbage. The main antagonist isn't even that interesting. His dialogue is terrible, one dimensional, and repetitive. The voice acting of him is done by what sounds like a sick old man.  And everyone talks to you as if you have NO POWER at all, despite the constant acts you carry out that continually prove that you have god like powers.  I literally killed a demon the size of a 6 story building in one part of the story, only for the antagonist to talk to me afterwards as if I was some weak puppy that had the strength of an ant. Even one of your friends in the story acts like she could beat you down any time she wants, even though you constantly kick 500 times more butt than she ever could.  The endgame is no fun, not even a challenge. Once you get past a certain level and can make your own gear, you pretty much sleep walk through the late stages of the game.  I did my first playthrough of this game on HARD and I killed the final boss in 4 hits... yes you read that right, 4 hits. The difficulty on this game is a total joke.  I would only recommend this game for kids, if you are a seasoned RPG or action game players, this will be a serious let down.
5509	1	a	Dear Developers [clears throat]  Make this game free,Just for the banter.  
2745	1	a	For 1 dollar, it's damn worth it. Make sure you play on prehistorik settings (kinda like an advanced setting, where you can change more stuff) to get more experience faster.
3883	1	a	I paid for this and now it's free. Volvo and GaybeN, explain plz
6338	1	a	Ask yourself this, can you really go wrong with a 99 cent game?
3174	1	a	This game is really fun for a cheap game and I enjoy it! stop for looking negative comment you should try it!
5349	0	a	If you major in psychology than Spiral Game Studios is perfect subject for Dunning-Kruger effect study. So it might be worth your time - it's fun to watch, to read forums and to laugh at devs. Self-confidence boosted by vocal minority. Isn't that cute?  The game itself is not worth mentioning. It's your typical 'rip-off-everything' made by complete amateurs. Yeap, you may play it and even enjoy it... if you have absolutely no taste, your IQ is lower than 50, you are 6yo and it's the only game you have at the same time. And even in that case you'll be bored in a half an hour. So buy yourself some iOS game instead.
5698	1	a	Step:1 buy game  Step:2 install game  Step:3 play game  Step:4 ask why cant this game with pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics run on low with more than 5 fps this is on Radeon R5 with an AMD A8-6410 cpu  Step:5 ask your self this why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did i buy a 99 cent game on steam about killing dinosouars i could of donated that to charity Step:6 uninstall game and request a refund get denied for said refund  Step:7 save another 400 dollars and buy a cheap gun in real life Step:8 shoot your pc Step:9 insert gun in mouth  Step:10 regret that you bought a cheap flintlock and you only bought 1 ball  Step:11 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and whine in a review
2951	1	a	Spawn into halo-ish world. Have no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to do. Have a gun. It fires laser balls. Get into a car with tractor wheels. Run over 27 dinosaurs. Stegasaurus tail-whips car across map.  Jump out. Buy flamethrower. Go insane. Get picket up by flying dino â¥â¥â¥â¥ and dropped from the sky.  27/10 Recommended.
6037	1	a	really fun would reccomend to others thrilling game modes and detail.
4984	1	a	Be the only dude with guns to kill dinosaurs  They realize how good I am  Everybody in the server team up on me 1434/10 would play again
3409	1	a	IT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3873	1	a	Lots of fun to play with friends but not many people play so the servers are kind of empty.  All in all though great game!
408	1	a	Surprising how well made this game is; the detail and attention and expansiveness is just as deep and impressive as with skyrim. Very well made high quality game that is just as worthy of being played as skyrim.
333	1	a	boy is this game a hit or miss relationship. it has buttonmasher gameplay that is extremely satisfying, and a story good enough to keep you going. the graphics arent the best but they are stylized enough to still look good. the world feels empty though, and i think that is because it was originally intended to be an mmo. i would definitley snatch it on sale.
6380	1	a	Really fun. IF you have friends to play it with.
1623	1	a	I fell in love with this game as soon as i started to play it. Now i know the quests are super boring anmd generic but i just love games that let you be anything and dont penalize you super heavely if you want to be a magical swrodsman or theif that can toss fireballs like a mofo.
2814	1	a	Best Coop Game that i have played in a while
2440	0	a	This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usally found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game  just  went below average.
2808	1	a	The real questions is...  Would you pay $1 to pilot a helicoptor firing missile swarms at a Tyrannasaurus Rex?  Why, Yes. Yes I Would.
5565	1	a	top notch!!!
25	0	a	WIll not open on mac.
2590	1	a	Stupid amount of fun, especially with friends. Worth it for the price no doubt
2195	1	a	The title Kingdoms of amakur: Reckoning does not sound very promising. It sounds like the most generic pile of garbage, and in all honesty I expected it to be â¥â¥â¥â¥. However, it turned out to be quite a bit better than I expected.  The highlight of the game is the combat. It's fluid, fast and fun. Nothing special about that really. It's a lot like a fighting system from a hack and slah game. The game does get REALLY combat heavy towards the end, which get's kinda annoying. The fighting can also get repeative, because it's not that complex, and there is just so much of it overall.Actually, my main problem with the game is that it's simply way too easy. I can count all of my deaths with 1 hand, and no, my hand does not have 36 fingers or anything like that. However, I do like the big world, and all the places that you can visit. I really wanted to explore the world and see new places, even though a lot of the tombs and caves are really bland.  On the other hand, the story and characters are really uninteresting. I never really cared about what was happening, and I barely remember any characters, Not exactly a good sign. I am also not a big fan of the visual style, just because it doesn't match the tone of the game at all.   This game is quite lengthy overall. I took me about +30 hours to finish, and in that time I almost got to the max level, and I beat quite a lot of the side missions, so that is pretty neat. I have heard that this game has enough content for over 100 hours, but I personally have my doubts about this. Many things in this game kinda give me the impression that this could have become a new fantasy RPG series, but that will most likely not be happening.  This game is not great, but it's not nearly as bad as I expected it to be. Even though the story and characters are weak, I still had a fun time playing through this game. Generally my feelings towards the game can be summarized with: It's fine
6377	0	a	If you got the 99c to spend on something you might play two or three times, go ahead and purchase. I wasn't really into it personally. There are very few servers to play on and they're very laggy. The fact that you have to pay 99c for a game that could easily go on the free to play list (considering there's an in game shop) just seems like a bad business tactic. Maybe I just joined the wrong servers, maybe my internet was bugging out, maybe it's just not my type of game but I wouldn't recommend this one when there's sales on much better games out there.
4674	1	a	The Best Halo Games on pc lol just kidding  Orion prelude its a good game for just 1$  if you have a spare money on your wallet you should check this game out
5969	1	a	It's like a killing floor, pretty much but with more tech and dinosaurs. Much more mobile than killing floor too. For 74 cents (During sales or even lower!) or 99 cents this game is hard to pass over. Think twice before you judge a game due to it's low pricing. Although killing floor has more of challenge to it. This is fun and somewhat challenging. I'd buy this instead of killing floor to be honest.
335	1	a	This game is awesome, it took me almost 70 hours to finish. I'll never regret about it.
394	1	a	This game is great on so meny levels the combat is fun and easy to use the story is really good. tons of side quests and a huge world to explore makes is one of my all time list top games to play. Classic must have RPG's of all time.
4408	1	a	The idea behind the game is awesome! The game itself ... not so much... Support the KickStarter they are bringing up i think on the 27th i have high hopes for this company and expect them to do well!   But this is what i think of Dino Horde  Buy while its onsale for 1$!! Not for 15$! Why?  The game is poorly optimized for one, the crosshairs on weapons are the same color as the winter enviroment so it's difficult to even aim at anything unless you are using something you can hip fire with the PvP is bad because any sort of lag just is killer lag is handeled very poorly. The 'Open' World map they released theres no sense of freedom in it all it is, is a bigger survival map with nothing to do between points i did run in to a t-rex once out side of a point that was fun but out of every other time i played i never once ran in to any real engaging fights.
2221	1	a	Game made with a soul.. good graphics, pictures, maps and creatures..   I've found one negative aspect: computer AI. Enemies is realy stupid in buttle..
3028	1	a	Great game ^^
980	1	a	This will be a LONG review, so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an open(ish) world RPG. At least, that's how most people see it. The biggest downfall of the game is that the public image of the game is so far offset from what the game actually is. Many people dismissed it at first as a Skyrim-clone, which could not be any further from the truth.  Skyrim focused on having deep RPG stats, and sacrificed the prospect of having enjoyable combat to make sure the stats were deep and balanced. Most of Skyrim's combat boils down to 'run up to something and click repeatedly until it dies', which made the combat wear over very quickly on me. Instead, Amalur focused on having fun combat first and foremost, and as a result some of the stat building is not as deep or complicated as Skyrim's. Instead of having deep stats and simple combat, Amalur has deep combat and somewhat simple stat building.  Amalur's combat systems are inspired by character action games, such as Devil May Cry or God of War. You have a primary and secondary attack (which are determined by what weapons you have equipped. Different weapon types give you different movesets), a dodge, magical abilities, and a Devil Trigger, which is called Reckoning mode. You can juggle some of the game's smaller enemies, and there are some advanced systems in the game such as dodge cancelling, which will come naturally to any character action fan. It feels fun and genuinley rewarding to try out the dozens of different weapon combinations, though one of the most effective weapon combo is introduced in the game's tutorial -- Longswords have a built in juggle, and you can juggle enemies with a bow and arrow. It's a fun combination, but far better ones exist if you experiment with the combat system.  The fun combat is further aided by the fact that you can build your character in almost ANY way and it's valid. Wanna build a Rogue-Mage hybrid? It's a thing. Wanna do a boring, straight Warrior? Unimaginitve, but it works. Wanna be a mix of all three classes? YES, you can do that! This is one of the few RPG's I've ever played where you can build however YOU like and it'll work. Most RPG's have a feeling that there are only one or two classes which are the best, and you shouldn't bother with anything else. But in Amalur you're free to build however you want.  I also enjoy the character building more than Skyrim's because you get two different types of skill points every time you level up. You get skill points for leveling up combat abilities, and skill points for leveling up other abilities such as lockpicking or crafting. Remember in Skyrim how you'd level up and then you wouldn't actually get any more powerful because you put your skill point into alchemy or something instead of one-handed? That isn't a problem here. You will have constant character growth both in terms of power, and crafting abilities. I feel like you start out weaker than an average skyrim character in this game, but you gain power FAR more quickly. It's a rather fast and enjoyable pace for character development.  The enviornments are a little more of a mixed bag. They're far more varried and beautiful than Skyrim's enviornments, but you aren't allowed to freely explore them like how you could in Skyrim. Try to explore too far into the world and you'll be insta-killed by enemies who vastly overpower you. But, once you do get to those better enviornments, you'll marvel in their extreme beauty. Some of the vistas I saw were jaw-dropping.  The music is also an upside. Ever head of Grant Kirkhope, the musical composer behind Banjo Kazooie? He did the music for this game, and it's just as good, if a little more serious than Banjo Kazooie's wacky toons.  Now, for the downsides. You level up very quickly, and there's an abundance of side-quests in the game so you can reach max level without even trying. This is especially true if you buy the DLC's. The DLC's are very well made, but don't increase the max level at all, so it becomes even easier to overlevel if you buy them.  Remember those skills I mentioned which aren't combat oriented? Some are far, FAR better than others. Firstly, there's little point in leveling up lockpicking, because there are TWO lockpicking skills (lockpicking and dispelling). Even if you're a master lockpick, you won't be able to get all the chests in the world, because you're not a master at dispelling. Meanwhile, if you max out blacksmithing, you can make armor BETTER THAN A FULL LEGENDARY ARMOR SET GIVEN TO YOU RIGHT BEFORE THE FINAL BOSS. With blacksmithing AND sagecrafting maxed out, it's possible to have so much health regen that you can never see yourself take damage. Which brings me to the main bad point of this game...  The game is too easy. Play on Hard mode first. Even then, the game won't be especially hard. I've heard of mods that make the game harder, but I can't personally speak to their effectiveness. If you're here for an immense challenge, you won't find it.  Additionally, to those of you who enjoyed how open Skyrim was, Amalur is a little more confined. Instead of being a huge open world, there are about 20 or so large zones which're broken up by linear paths. Imagine it as a group of small, diverse worlds to explore, as opposed to one huge one which looks mostly the same. And exploration of some zones is locked off by main quest progress.  Speaking of the main quest, the story is rather run-of-the-mill. It has some very good concepts, but execution is rather lackluster. You probably won't care about the story much, for the main quest or sidequests. Though, it's worth mentioning that some characters are VERY well written. Your main motivation for reaching end game won't be beating the game, but instead to kill your nemesis who is built up very well throughout the game.  TL;DR  Did you think Skyrim could've used better, deeper, Devil May Cry like combat?  Do you hate when an RPG forces you to choose between leveling up combat abilties, or crafting abilities?  Do you like the idea of being able to build your character in any way and still having it be a viable build?  Are you okay with a game having amazing music and breathtaking vistas, at the cost of a little less of an open world?  Are you okay with the fact that this game won't be very hard, even at the highest difficulty?  Then Kingdoms of Amalur is for you.
1127	1	a	I've played this before for the xbox but then saw it was on offer on steam, with its DLC and thought i'd pick it up. I wasnt dissappointed. The character creation in terms of the physical appearance of your face is rather simplistic in that there's only a few presets to choose from. Four diffference races to choose from determines the apperance of your character with each giving a starting bonus to some skills. From there you go to change hair, skin colour, eyeshadow, lipstick shade, tattoo and body jewelry.   The leveling up system is simplistic too. There are base skills like lock picking and blacksmithing which let you interact with the world better and the combat system is split into three sections, finesse, might and sorcery with players being allowed to invest in each one if they wish which really allows you to customise your playthrough; something which alot of RPG's tend to overlook, either you're an archer or a mage... you cant be both.  The open world means you can do as you wish, or not do as is my case sometimes. Each area is populated with monsters at specific levels so be careful to not wander too far out early on but then again, why not?  The controls are little fiddly to get a hang on first off and I would definitely recommend setting the 'run' key to toggle rather than hold.

3430	0	a	HOLY CRAP! This game is amazing. There are no words to describe the fact 1$ and so amazing. And, it's on Unreal engine... so that results in stability.  I unfortunately at this moment, cannot recommend this due to the fact it currently doesn't have linux support. I'll be able to change this when it does.
5238	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
778	0	a	Moderately â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game with far too easy of a combat system / gameplay, a storyline that tries to be rich and complex and detailed and just ends up being uninteresting while throwing far too much information at you, and graphics that feel like the entire thing is taking place in oldschool Ashenvale in World of Warcraft. Honestly. Areas all have a tint to them, and the first major one is pretty damn purple.  I've never regretted paying full price for a game more (Save maybe Fable 3), but that's what I get for buying EA.
4311	1	a	Imba gameplay and gFx  A must for all Jurrasic Park Lover's &lt;3  Unlimted fun !!!!!  Just go for it
2254	1	a	Much Better than Disciples 3 Gold
5307	1	a	I Paid for this game when it was first released and now it's free to play. No Bonuses for buying it either.. Thanks....  Game play is good though.
602	1	a	if u are looking for a good RPG then you found it
2906	1	a	You kill dinosours with guns 8 out of 10
5295	0	a	Listen Ok I really enjoyed this game it was pretty fun but not for the price I got it for you guys got it for only a buck do you know what i got it for 15 dollars the only reason i wouldnt recommend this game is i didnt get my money back if i get my $14 back I will recommend it
6224	0	a	I was told by a friend that this game isn't that good and I didn't believe him. Till I played it on my own and it isn't that good at all. The gameplay just doesn't seem right, the first thing the enemies do is jusr charge at you no matter what. Even though they're dinosaurs. It doesn't seem to have a good plot to except to protect certain stuff and kill dinosaurs. The graphics are fine, but it doesn't make up for how I think of the game. I don't recommend this game. 5/10
3701	0	a	This game is literally not even a game. Like, what gives, dude. I played for thirty minutes and could not join a game and it would constantly crash. Then, I actually join in a 'game' and see nothing and I have to run 2500m to get to the 'playing' area. Then, there were dinosaurs and they
5344	1	a	I cant believe my eyes, this game is so wrong, ITS JUST SO RIGHT! From crappy animations to poor voice acting and not to mention the godamn frame drops even though this game looks its straight out from a Wii game. Cant believe my friend made me buy this game. This game is so good, I CRIED. 10/10
4672	1	a	  Not a bad game. It runs well on my ancient box too. I wished we could play as dinosaurs though.
2950	1	a	It's nice to get your head bitten off by a T-Rex!
5790	0	a	Best black screen simulator of 2016  -10000/10 IGN would die again waiting for zis game to launch
5630	0	a	great game, but nothing i hate more then that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fight to survive 6/10
2384	1	a	In short this game is almost free, gets updated all the time, has dinosaurs, a ton of modes/maps and is one of the most fun online FPS games on Steam.  And even if you don't like it, it's not like you're wasting a substantial amount of money or anything. Just skip lunch for a day and you'll be able to buy 2 or 3 4-packs of the game, you fattie. But I doubt you'll not enjoy it (I mean, you can kill raptors with a giant robot).  I've heard that a long time ago this game sucked and was full of glitches, but apparently they pretty much remade the whole game from scratch, so don't worry about it.  Oh, and you can play as a T.Rex. &lt;- this was the major selling point for me  Buy it.
4186	1	a	Not only is this game the best of it's time, but its mechanics and gameplay is remarkable. The fact that it tells me to press 'E' and it does absolutely nothing causing me to die is a game feature that itself is a deal breaker. And the fact that it's a PC exclusive and not optimized for PC makes me leave this an 11/10
1622	1	a	If you are wondering 'is this worth my money' The awnser is an undoubtable yes . This game is a rpg lost to its time. A creative story created by great authors, and a fast paced unique combat style that speakes for its self. This game uses a difrent aproch to classes. The game allows you to create your class any way that you want. It has a similarity to D&amp;D type of custimization, but is far more simplified, and dosn't lock you in a decision. If your playing as a rouge and want to change it, you can, and still be just as deadly. You can even blend skill type; like a warrior and rouge, to unlock awsome hybrid classes. This game was way ahead of its time. The only problem was that it was released at the same time as Skyrim, so no one heard about it. This is not a cookie cutter hack and slash. Its like fable, skyrim and D&amp;D all put together.
2609	0	a	This game has brought me enjoyment it is true; from its derpy triceratops to its 'laser swords' that definitely were TOTALLY original. This game has brought me joy, not from its gameplay but by the pure BS that the developers have pulled to make this game into the guano it deserves to be.   The graphics look like they should run on a potato, maybe 2 potatoes if they are small. The guns are ripped from other games and it is frustrating to see that there was a complete lack in creativity during the development of this game.   I bought the game on a whim because all I would be losing was a dollar. Is this game worth what I paid for it? Not entirely based on the fact that the servers always dropped connection or that it took several minutes to boot properly. After playing this game for the amount I did, I am not sure if it can ever 'run' properly. I laughed at the shear derpiness of the dinosaurs rather than enjoying the game itself and that is worrisome for me because now it just sits in my library. This game just taunts me now and I wonder what else I could have done with that dollar.
1627	1	a	Awesome game but it could be much better if it has mounts in it and a little bit support from ea but its cool anyway 8.5/10
2737	1	a	Cool game :)
4765	1	a	Buy this game , if you want to waste your money.
996	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I tried playing it once shortly after it came out and for whatever reason I couldn't get into it. Tried again a week or so ago and I'm hooked. It feels very much like a Fable/Skyrim combo to me. It's very simplistic like Fable, and the graphics are more similar to Fable, but the open world aspects and a lot of the character design process feels more like Elder Scrolls (of course one of the designers is from Oblivion, so that makes sense). The game isn't complicated at all, but there's enough quest variety and the combat is fun to keep me from getting bored.
5269	1	a	AWESOME GAME!! It is one of the best games i have ever played, and for you who is thinking about getting it do so.
942	1	a	Excellent combat system, in-depth and interesting lore, and a solid character customization system. With the expansions there is around 100 hours of content. I highly recomment this game for people who those who are unsure about the RPG genres. RPG's are not my cup of tea, but I loved this game. I've played through it on my PS3 twice and again on my PC.
4695	1	a	This game has gotten some bad reviews but I actually enjoy this game. While the lack of documentation or tutorials was a poor choice, the combat mechanics are similar to Borderlands 2 or Payday and my friends and I (after the initial issues getting to connect together) had quite a bit of fun in it. I feel it's worth the price while on sale if you enjoy quick action games with some replayability (although the same maps over and over will get old after a while). I mainly play it for the co-op and not the competitive styles (but the Rampage mode where one side can play a dinosaur is entertaining).  It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy games like Payday with repeatable missions and a persistent leveling system for unlocks it's quite an entertaining little diversion.
6167	0	a	Cheap game, so can't complain. It does feel like it was developed by some people who got bored midway and still decided to release it.
4543	1	a	This game has improved a lot since it first came out. It is a very fun game now, especially when you play with friends. A fun game+giant boss dinos that tower above you = Recommend.
3288	1	a	its a great strategy game that you can battle dinosaurs! and beware in the map hell where you randomly fight the pumpkin king. hell map is best for assault as you can use jetpack to get on a cliff and take some potshots at the pumpkin king! good luck dino hunters!!!!
4974	1	a	Good Waist of time, and money...
3193	1	a	I recommend this game for countless reasons   Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 respect for David Prassel 900000/10
1568	1	a	Fun game. Good story, enchanting graphics and the music is AMAZING.
3741	1	a	Doesn't take itself seriously at all and doesn't really need to, either. Basic but fun.
2991	1	a	Lots of changes from the previous version... Keep up the good work. Looking forward to see another great updates
402	1	a	Fantastic rpg! Deserves more love!
6131	0	a	A terrible shooter that not even dinosaurs could save.
2851	1	a	I recomend it becaus its trully fun to blow stuff up especially when its alive though i would like to see more oprimizations for laptops and 'not so good' PCs.
2402	1	a	i love this game you must buy and play with me ^.^
4488	1	a	Had this game for a while now,  10/10 would always recommend
3037	1	a	It's like call of duty meets dinosaurs.. but not exactly. It's really fun and addicting!
4262	0	a	To be fair, the games not too bad. But thats it, its average AT BEST. Sadly its not horridly broken which wouldve honestly made it more enjoyable as sometimes glichy randome events are fun but thats not the case. I only gave it a negative review becasue i spent like $0.40 on a 4 pack of codes, which are now completely worthless. Thanks Spiral Games.
4867	1	a	DO NOT BUY. I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR 99 CENTS AND ITS NOT WORTH IT
1704	1	a	This is an amazing action rpg game that never get enough attention from the media. Please support this game. Though I heard that the developers already closed down, I still hope there would be a sequel.
4650	0	a	  THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME BLOWED MY EYES AND CAUSES TO ME A MENTAL PROBLEM
5412	1	a	THis is one the worst FPS I have ever seen 
2104	1	a	This game seriously is my all time favourite RPG :D it's highly addictive, great stories in game, easy to control in game and mega hours of fun :D it generally is easy to play and the in game tutorial whilst playing the game is easy, i mean if my mates 4 year old can play no problems im sure you'd all agree by that sentimet that this game is easy to play :D
5595	1	a	Really fun game specially with friends. Not the most extreme epic graphics and textures but the game is still very much fun all around. A must have as part of a LAN party pack.
186	1	a	I've played the crap out of this game and it is awesome. The storyline is rich, the character creation wasn't too in-depth, the skills are freakin awesome, and the quests are numerous. Definitely has replay value since you can choose different skills to level and options to take in conversation. I wouldn't call it revolutionary but it's certainly fun to play. Good mechanics with very little bugs, even though I can't recall any at the moment. The voice acting is not cheesy so it doesn't ruin the game. I'm a fan of single player rpg's and this one got me. Epic battles.
3093	0	a	Bad Game, worst Server Browser. Canr recommand this Game to anyone.
1763	1	a	Think the fluent combat of God of War, packed in with a tiny bit of Fable, and a dash of Morrowind. This is far from perfect, but after a few hours in, you'll get immersed in the quests. Unfortunately, the story peaks unevenly, going from surpreme creative genius to ludicrous, but overall KoA:R delievers what it can from a new studio, and stands well as an RPG in a tough crowd of AAAs.
1601	1	a	Wonderful game that was extremely underrated in my opinion. The size, stories, combat, and graphics all make this game worth every buck.
4434	0	a	its awful, simply awful
767	1	a	It's pretty good. Recommended.
6214	1	a	Amazing Game! Is very replayable meaning you wont regret buying this game a week later. Plus you can kill a stegosaurus with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tank! In my opinion this game is right up there with killing floor, probably better. A must have!
2235	0	a	Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss   Unless you don't want to see a lot of this when you play, then stay far away from this game.   It tries to be Heroes of M&amp;M but the combat is just terrible.  Don't be taken in by the nice graphics and reviews, this is a bad development team based on what I have seen.
3627	1	a	i love the game but every time i try to play multi player it frezes right as it loads the map
2776	1	a	verry good to play but it's lag
5517	1	a	Must  Keep  Playng
5665	0	a	I can't play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game without barfing everywhere.
5149	1	a	This game is so silly. Play it with your friends without any expectations and laugh at how bad everything is. Hint: grab a car and run over veloceraptors and watch their bodies fly into the stratosphere. I'd avoid ramming a triceritops, i did it once and my car exploded, jettisoning me into a mountain and my friend into another time zone, dead on impact.   Buy this game for a dollar and enjoy a few hours of fun with your friends, then never play it again.
897	0	a	its not that bad but its not great, honestly its not worth buying it is a really difficult game not much of a learning curve and it gets boring pretty quickly.
1650	1	a	This game is in my top 3 RPG's of All-Time. Insanely good story and beautiful visuals. The gameplay is one of the most fun I've experienced with a rewarding climactic ending to each fight. Utilizing 'Reckoning Mode' makes you feel like you can best any foe in battle, and surely that is also the truth. The game's enemies are challenging when playing on normal, if you're planning on playing on a higher difficulty than that then you'd better get ready to rage a lot and use up all your gold on healing potions!   The 1!! thing I have a problem with in this game is the lack of a JUMP button.... All you can do is dodge but whenever I want to pass like 3 flat rocks on the ground I can't because I can't jump :(  9,5/10 [Must Play!]
2299	1	a	This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, 'I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,' remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.
1301	1	a	While this game was a simple impulse buy, it was one of my best. This game is the Fable 2 that should have been. I've beaten the game twice and I still dont know the plot. But you know what? That's totally OK for a game that brings the nostalgia of Fable 1. I dont remember if you CAN skip the dialog, but since i dont know what the story is about, you probably can. Thanks for satisfying gameplay, Devs.
427	1	a	this is amazing! i love the story, and it's incredibly expansive. the combat system is really well done. camera takes a bit of getting used to because it's connected to the mouse but once you do get used to it there's very little in the game that trips you up.  Definitely worth your time :D
4913	1	a	This game is okay...   16 Hours worth of okay. 
4548	1	a	Perfect
2255	0	a	A quick disclaimer: I've only played through the tutorial. I think this is enough to review the game, but some may disagree. It's obvious that this is a failed attempt to move Disciples 2 almost verbatim into 3D space, so I'm comfortable laying this out here.  They tried so many times to make Disciple 3 the game it should've been, but it just never lived up to 2. I understand the desire to move the game into 3D, but all the wonderful visuals I loved from the first title were sacrificed in the transition. They changed the battle system to hex-based from static turn-based, like every other game in this genre that felt stale years ago (AoW, King's Bounty, HoMM, etc). While the audio wasn't perfect in the original, it has even less impact now that it did before.
5487	1	a	You can ride the backs of T-Rexes while stabbing them with a sci-fi knife. Pretty hard but you'll learn it.
3774	1	a	this game is great fun, shooting and being eaten by a dinosaur is amazing and for just a low price it is amazing.
1513	1	a	Defintely a lot better than most people made it out to be although main story wise it is VERY SHORT. It took me less than a day to complete the main storyline. ALTHOUGH with the DLC and side quests it does make a longer experience. Definite buy if it is on sale.
979	1	a	Well, you'll possibly beat some hours into this game... However I would probably not buy it at full price, I'd wait untill it is on sale.
2930	1	a	I found Barney the dinosaur, I gave him 10 hugs. and by Barney I mean T-rex and by hugs I mean rockets to the head
4136	0	a	Very bad graphics and the game is still lagging, a lot of bugs, boring game (and yes even with friends) i'm sure that you can buy something better than this game.
2428	0	a	horribru
5095	1	a	  DOPE game for 99 cents....
1550	1	a	For those of you having issues with getting the game to start - bombing out after the little screen with the orc comes up, try disabling virtua mvp control panel (or similar apps that 'optimize' use of both intel processor based graphics AND discrete graphics on Z77 chipset etc. Worked for me.  Fun game thus far.
995	1	a	This is the best single player MMO you will ever play
4926	1	a	  This is a great game for only 2 quarters, it has actiojn, custom characters, good gameplay and nice graphics. This seems like you could charge like $20 for this. I really like the game and i highly reccomend it
3081	1	a	You can shoot a Tyrannosaurus with a lazer shotgun while flying with a jetpack... WHAT ELSE DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?!?! In all seriousness, I got this game on sale for 0.99$, (which it goes down to rather often) and I thought it was completely worth the price. At full price, I'd try to check out the game somewhere else first to see if you like it, but it's definitely worth a look. It has quite a few fun modes, and the gameplay is fast paced and fun. One of my few critiques though is while there is class variety (A soldier who can fly, a medic who heals, and a spy who can cloak) The distiction doesn't show up that much, and they're basically interchangable classes (So it's best to pick the one who can fly). Overall, a reccomendation to look at it, because you'll probably like it. It involves shooting hordes of dinosaurs while flying in a jetpack. Sometimes you can stab them with a lazer katana.
1193	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur, also could be called the poor people's Skyrim. The game itself is decent at most. Not a game to buy at full price however, wait for a sale is my suggestion in the highest form. HOWEVER, the game has it's pros and cons, as does even the best of games. Here's my review in my, now normal, manner of doing this.  Character customization: The character customization is limited to really race, gender and face. Very little body change outside of gender. You have two versions of human and two versions of elf. You have your face changing and your tattoo, piercing and hair and hair color. The usual facial change. Now, the difference is you can change it any time outside of console commands after you get your first 'home', which is nice.  Gameplay: Gameplay for combat is general hack and slash, not much to say about it, only distinct feature is pressing X or whatever the console equivalent is to trigger fate mode at full bar where you deal extra damage and can kill a person for extra xp after a QTE which is also used in boss fights. Otherwise, hack and slash with bow use. The leveling system you gain three trees: Might, Finesse and Intellect. Honestly, this is basically Fighter Mage Thief tree. Finesse for thief, intellect for mage, might for fighter. You can multiclass as well up to all three trees being used. The more points in a tree the better stats you get for it. You also have your general skill points in other professions of sorts. The armor is restricted by level and tree so you can only use an armor if you have so many points in a tree.  Story: Haven't finished the game but the story from what I played is decent at best, some plot holes like HOW you got the abilities you have and it starts with the entire bit about you dying, it can be assumed you being brought back is how, but doesn't really explain it much.  Graphics: It's cartoony looking. It's much less graphically intense, so might be easier to run for the comps without a good graphics card. The sights are decent as well as character design.  Difficulty: The difficulty never changes. You have to do it manually. You get higher level and it never gets any more difficult. After awhile, you get so high level, it doesn't even matter anymore.  Over all. There's not really a way to recommend or not recommend KoA. It's a decent game if it goes on sale, but not a game to invest too much time into.
5499	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbtXwbkZU9w   all poeple who like this game are like this guy
2738	1	a	NIce game for 0,27 $ ! Love to killl Dino with Friend !
1686	1	a	Amazing Game! Time consuming, but what do you expect from an RPG.
5148	1	a	HOLY !@#$ THIS GAME IS THE GREATEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. DISREGARD THE METASCORE!
1212	1	a	One of the utmost fantastic hidden gems you'll ever scavenge upon the Steam marketplace.

478	1	a	An excellent RPG with tons of hours to spend on.
5731	1	a	this game is a very good game many fun i have had with other people meeting the community it's fun yeah buy it.
3345	1	a	It is a serious amont of fun, join a game fly around blow up a T rex with a rocket turrent run over little dinosaurs in a car. USE A TANK !!!
4997	1	a	It's certainly fun, however at the moment the current playerbase (very small majority but enough to notice) is either rude or constantly being vulgar towards (usually new) other players. -- hopefully the movement over to Free-to-Play will settle this down since there will be new players almost every day.  Otherwise, I recommend.   NTM it's going F2P, support it while you can.
5154	1	a	I highly recomend this game. there are dino's to kill people! bring this game back from the dead! as in there isnt many players nowadays.
2079	1	a	Aye so I was saving a pretty penny like, got this in a sale and everything. Mam woulda been well proud. Anyway so let's get serious, this game is a proper cheeky little number like.   So apparently I've been dead and come back alive right, but I proper know that ain't true. Ya can tell the characters just come out of a proper fat ket hole right but that's not the point.  I head into this town and there's this canny gnome like. I told her I'd smash her back doors in and break her hips like but unfortunately she's a gnome and im a human and from experience... it's like banging a kid. Proper tight as owt and a lot of crying.  Im gonna go kill something.
4428	1	a	  Play nice and have fun environment Rating 9/10
5195	1	a	Well firstly,I thought is S**t,then i bought it and it was really cool,i do recommend this game
38	1	a	This...is one of those games I'd pay good money to have on my tablet. I love the mix..rpg+poker = can't loose Have nothing bad to say about it at all..well besides that it's not on my tablet ;) Soooo Devs!..take this old gem and turn it into an app in the store pls..we wantss it..preciousss   Seriously, it's a nice game worth the money, pick it up if you like poker with a twist.   
2540	1	a	This game needs better optimization but its good. I wish this game had a better explanation of the gamemodes, and it had more unlocks. The game dinos just seem to be repeating and have very bad sprites.
1484	1	a	This is a good solid third person over the shoulder RPG. It is similiar to Oblivion and Skyrim but not nearly as complicated nor as long. The humor is quite good and the story is interesting. The animation is a little colorful for my tastes but still less cartoon like than others. It doesn't take long to level up so that means it can get too easy when it comes to the fighting. Best to change your fate and try different classes in order to freshen up the game. Or change weapons as there are several different kinds. I would recommend paying no more than $20 for it as it is a little short even with the two DLCs. But I definitely recommend the game as fun and enjoyable.
5331	1	a	Because this is our heritage... if it wasn't for our forefathers, the dedicated shock troopers they were, Dinosaurs would have taken over the universe...   This is a piece of history and I demand it be recognized! -MURICA!
1992	1	a	If you want a singleplayer MMO-like expirience with some interesting combat mechanics thrown in, then this game is for you, there's really not much more to say really. Personally, I really like it.
10	1	a	This game was a surprise! I was expecting something like Fairy Solitaire, but has much more the RPG feeling and the RPG elements. And on top of all, keeps my poker knowledge fresh:)  I can definetely recommend this game as a Casual, Relaxing, Adventure with nice visuals.  and for 1,80euro...it's a steal!
3129	1	a	A fun little game which doesn't really feel like it's that much special but it's a great game to play for a few hours with a bunch of pals.
1589	1	a	for $6 bucks? What a steal!
156	1	a	Pros:   - Story (ofcourse R.A. Salvatore) - Combat mechanics - Musics - Level design - Character design - Challenging bosses - Art direction  The one and only Con:  You're running waaay tooooo much. Running to everywhere! And no mount.
1195	1	a	6/10, but a fun 6/10.  Mechanically, the game is perfect. Combat is way more kinetic than other rpgs. Weapons are creative in conjunction with abilities, especially the Chakrams. The game world is huge and every area looks epic. Story setup is great. I loved the direction they took with it. Your character is a god because they have no fate.  Now for the bad stuff. There are many elements to combat, and fast-paced mechanics and a couple of fun weapons are only part of that. There is a good variety of enemies, but I never found myself having to change tactics for any of them. There are only 2 cool boss fights. Final boss sucks. It's not hard, it just sucks. Random looting system sucks. Game would have been better with predefined loot. Game has horrible difficulty scaling, and gear level balaning is way off. I'm using end game weapons which requires level 18, and my armor requires a finesse skill of 25. I'm level 35 with a finesse skill of 102. There is no better gear.
2701	0	a	This game is great......for a good laugh. Though the laugh is not really worth $1.
376	1	a	This game has bad rep for how awesome it actually is. It is a really fun RPG that is on the list of 'must plays in order to consider yourself a PC gamer'. It really is an incredibly fun, unique and enjoyable game worth getting.  
689	1	a	I reckon this game is fun, if the map weren't so gosh darn huge.
2884	1	a	So much fun, so much god damn fun and violence and dinos all together.  When to buy this: If you like fun If you like more fun If you like killing stuf If you like running like a little girl If you like fun (yeah, again) If you like being chased by big â¥â¥â¥ dinos If you like shooting stuf If you like FPS (should be first, but all the other stuff is moar important)  When not to buy this: If you don't like fun If you don't like killing stuff If you don't like being chased by dinos If you don't like having a god damn lot of fun while killing â¥â¥â¥â¥ while being chased by dinos while having a lot of fun trying not to die. (there is no syntax error on this sentence, read it right and you will understand what it says)  Ahcro.
5200	1	a	The physics are terrible- in a good way!  The gameplay is exploitable- in a good way! The premise is stupid- in a good way!  A game so bad it's good. Dinosaurs are over the top and fun to fight. The visuals apart from the dinos are almost ripped from Halo (Which could be good or bad depending on if you like that) and has vehicles almost ripped from the same source (which once again, could be good or bad depnding on your opinon of the vehicles from that game) It took the jetpack, medigun, and stealth from Tribes and a gameplay very reminiscient of Killing Floor to create a game that is so unoriginal it is completely original. Too much fun not to play.
1010	1	a	Maybe one of the best games of the decade in my opinion. Story by some of my favorite authors (you can really tell in most cases), gameplay executed in a simple, easy to figure out setup, and visually appealing. I've put many hours into this game on the Playstation and I'm glad it came to steam for me to buy. If you're looking for a simple, story driven RPG with a customizable combat style, this is probably your game.  Just want to point out, though, that many people are put off by linear stories anymore with how many sandbox type RPG's are out there, but don't let that fool all of you. Get this game if you have a chance.
5869	1	a	One of the Funniest COOP Games EVER!!!!! Recommended 10/10 (Play with Friends only)
1924	1	a	Pretty good game. Nice gameplay. The story is not that good, though.
2459	1	a	EPIC dino killing!!! Ps. the METACRITIC Score is WRONG!! its for the old version, this is Mk2, all new and improved!!
1938	1	a	This game world is HUGE! I can see why EA wanted to make this an MMORPG as it would have been a helluva mmo for sure. So this game was basically a cancelled MMO turned into a singleplayer release and you can really tell. The world just has that mmo feel. This is by no means a bad thing and many of the quests in the game represents that mmo feel.   Anywho the game itself is hella solid. Combat is great no matter what class you play, and the missions are basically infinite. Don't be suprised when you check your game time and see that you put hundreds of hours into this because I bet that will be the case. I've put maybe 30 hours into this game already but it feels like I've just started (and I think that's true, Feels like I just scratched the surface of the main plot in the game as all the sidequests have kept me busy). Lots of customization in terms of equipment and skill trees so you play the way you want to play. This is for sure a gem of a game that EA has put out. Even if it is a one-of for the series it manages to stand on its own as a great action rpg.  Definitely get it if it's on a sale, and if you miss one then you suck :[
2741	1	a	A game that has everything you've ever needed: Guns, dinosaurs and pizza.
4526	0	a	The only good thing about this game is driving your teammates off a cliff.
5703	0	a	This game was a waste of time. I am glad i never baught this game
91	0	a	5 battles in and the repetitiveness of the game has already turned me off to it. Not to mention there is no volume slider to adjust the sound just on and off buttons. I'm not adjusting the computer sound and all of the background things I have going on just to hear the sound on this game.
413	1	a	I love this game so much, and I feel much sorrow for the developers as they have gone bankrupt. This is a great game with a lot of free-roaming, the world is full of awesome quests and sweet gear. It's to bad there will be no more updates or games.
219	1	a	This is an amazing game. The combat is satisfying and fantastic, the story is interesting, and the universe is intriguing once you get into it. The downsides to the game include less good character models, and the graphics aren't Skyrim level. I would, however, put this game above Skyrim in the categories of combat and stability. The game world is huge, but the game itself runs extremely smoothly and I have yet to run into a glitch.  My friends who enjoy a good RPG gaming experience, this should be on your list.
5067	1	a	i have never seen a company care so much about there players. they pump out updates every almost every month and there completely free. This game also has some of the best co-op of any game i have played. Keep up the good work guys!
3141	0	a	10/10 would not play even if it had a naked super model at the end
5756	0	a	How am I able to write a review for a game I never played?? 0/10!
1403	1	a	Just overall blew skyrim out of the water. the monsters and combat system are just way better.
2442	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
2770	1	a	Many reviews say this is a bad game, I disagree. The gunplay feels good, the graphics are very good, the maps are nice and the gameplay is fun.  I haven't seen many bugs at all, it seemed a fairly seamless gameplay experience.
3189	1	a	Hello its me, Ive been recomending games like this since black ops 3 to go over everything, For only 1 dollar this game is such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ steal, BUY IT NOW OR YOU WILL SEE, HOW BLACK OPS 2 IS MW3333333333333333, AND I recomed this game
3221	1	a	What do you when we gain access to a time machine that allows us to go back in time and visit dinosaurs  Why we shoot them of course we want to make them go extinct before the astroid does  6 dinosaurs out of 10 dinosaurs
3362	1	a	this game.. oh man.. this game is AWESOME. it's a nice little pearl.  At first view it may look quite bad, but give it a try in the PROPER manner and this game is super-addictive. The infos you will need to get the fun out of this game are a bit 'hidden', because no tutorial is going to show you, so you have to guess yourself or learn from other players.  For example, exping is SLOW if you just play on servers. solution? make a 'surival\conquest' &gt; 'pre-historic' lobby (or solo room) and set the parameters to get up until 1400% (or maybe more) exp multiplier! you can literally lvl up from lvl 0 to 40 in 40 mins if you keep a ~1000% multiplier.  There are many, many other tricks and strategies to be succesful on this game, but they will require you to play for more than 2-3 matches and experiment a little. (for istance: EMP granades can activate vehicles shop even if you disabled vehicles in a conquest match!)  Furthermore there are many game modes aside from coop. Unfortunately the servers are a bit empty! But if you start some good lobby players will eventually join.  Again, this game is fast, relentless, furious.... and it also comes bug-free (at least no big bugs), has a solid co-operative mode, cool weapons, cool maps, it's not P2W (the store is only cosmetic).  Futhermore the devs seem to be in love with their child and they take care of it. I suggest this title especially to players who liked Unreal Tournament (1997) cause it's that kind of GOOD.
2453	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play Halo 3, or Borderlands but you were too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stingy? Well Orion Dino Horde is the game for you! Bungie, and 2k obviously stole many aspects from this game. Including the borderlands vehicle controls, the second wind, actions, and many other aspects from borderlands. Now on to the halo guns, textures, hornets, and character models. Great Game! This quote perfectly shows this game 'I paid $3.99 for this game, and its better than most of my other $60.00 games.
2510	1	a	Okay, Metacritic failed the score for this game! I got this when it was on sale for $1, but I still recommend it at its $15 price tag. Basically, its killing dinosaurs with mechs, and on a lot of servers, you can BE a dinosaur.  Hours of fun, so buy it now. Overall rating: 88/100
5754	0	a	  Someone needs to build a wall around this game and make the Devs pay for it.
6242	1	a	It's a cute game. Who doesn't like to kill dinosaurs?
4617	1	a	its an fun amazing chaotic game!
721	0	a	Well, this one is quite a hard one for me.   For starters, it was a blast, like discovering a jewel that has been sitting in front of you all of the time without you noticing it. I was like, 'Why didn't I know this game did exist at all?' And so I was really hooked to it for a couple of hours. A couple of dozens of hours.   A really pretty game. Big and stable (at least for me). WIth a funny and fluent combat system (I would dare to say in the likes of Dark Souls, Darksiders or Blade: Edge of Darkness (things tend to get dark when combat systems are cool, it seems)). With a slightly original setting from your usual fantasy RPG and inmersive too. Decent crafting, voice acting and music...  But then it started to feel a bit shallow. As if you were playing an MMOPRG, but without the social interaction. Quests started to feel repetitive, the NPCs less charming, the story not that interesting. Everything was a bit of a chore.   Worst of all, I felt no challenge at all. Even when the combat felt right and was funny, this has to be the ONE game for me in which I NEVER died. Not once. In the whole of the game. Not a single failed combat situation, and let me tell you it is a long way to complete it. I know there are roundabouts for this (both patches and even set paths to keep you a wimp for the whole of the main story around the web), but this is clearly not right.  So, at the end, I wouldn't recommend it. It gave me plenty of hours of enjoyemet a the star, but left me empty and a bit angry by the mid-end game. If you can get it on sale (not very often, I think) go for it, but else, I wouldn't do so.  Cheers,
4983	0	a	As decent as this game is, it continues to randomly decide that I don't own it, and tells me to re-purchase it. It is in no way worth it's full price, but if you can snatch it for a buck, then you'd might as well.
6246	1	a	Stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a Lightsaber  10/10
3654	1	a	A decent and simple game, basicly you just shoot dinos :D it's a lot of fun
1512	1	a	Overall I find that this game has been everything I had expected it to be. The graphics style is stunning and for me personally one of my favorite aspects along with the quality of the voice acting which is above par. The combat is definitely interactive compared to other RPGs, depending on what difficulty setting you play on and with regard to your class (mages are complete faceroll at end-game). The 'Reckoning' mode in the game is bitter-sweet, the slow-mo and brutal finishers that it enables are well and good, but by end-game you're just using it for its massive damage increase as you will have seen the finishers by this point a million times. Some people find the camera angles to be frustrating in the game and I admit on occassion they can be, but for the most part they are forgiveable. As for controls, the default keybinds for this game are decent/good but there are some tweaks that you will likely want to make. The main quests are decently written, however the side quests typically offer mediocre background info into the world and are often the generic, 'Find and Return 'This'', 'Kill 'X' amount of this', etc. The map is fairly large with varyingly unique regions and if you purchase the DLC then even more so (naturally). You are presented with the oppurtunity to own I believe 3 different houses within the game, with at least 2 of them being renovateable. Overall, the game is definitely classic as a standard for an RPG, with the few things hindering it being some 'bug' and game mechanic nuisances. There were on a few occassions places where the music/audio seemed to drop (usually during combat if this happens). Your pet/familiar (if you have one) is registered as a physical entity and sometimes it blocking your movement can be annoying. Leaving a dungeon can be annoying, as sometimes you may have to loop ALL the way back around to get to the exit (you can't just fast travel to leave). The most annoying mechanic in the game, THE USE OF 'Jump Points'. There is no true 'jump' button in the game and this means that in some instances you will have to 'walk around' edges etc, instead of just jumping off a slight ledge. Finally, the weapon/gear itemization in this game sadly is mediocre, if you don't craft your own weapons you will likely go large intervals before finding upgrades.   My final comments on the DLC and game in general; the DLC provides new quest lines,map regions, and access to a pet stable, but is absolutely by no means crucial to the game experience. The Legend of Dead Kel DLC was completely underwhelming in my opinion. However, the Teeth of Naros DLC does have an interesting quest-line and introduces you to the race known as the 'Kollasae'.  ***Personally, I would only buy this game and the DLC if it were on sale. The game is worthwhile if you're a fan of RPGs in general, but otherwise there are definitely better games. ***
421	1	a	Well worth a play. Very simlar to Dragon age and the like but Ive found it a lot more accessable and more of a good old hack and slash. Gripping storyline, enjoyable flowing combat and a nice varity wepons and play styles.
4474	0	a	I never asked for a 90's shooter.
2779	1	a	This game is amazingly fun for how cheap it is.  If you want some quick laughs, buy the 4-pack and gift the games your friends so you can play together and share the insanity!
322	1	a	This game is like Skyrim if Skyrim was high on crystal meth. Fluid combat with an interesting skill tree. A massive detailed world filled with colour topped off with great boss battles.
1695	1	a	Awesome, this is game is a steal! Although i am getting tired of the WoWish graphics plagueing most mmo's these days, this is definitly a great game!
3170	1	a	pretty amazing game. i got it for .99 so that makes it even sweeter. good game play great graphics would recomend it to others
3995	1	a	IS SO GOOD MYROM PLAY IT
3297	1	a	Well for a dollar its worth it
206	1	a	While many seem to think Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a poor game (Just google its name and prepare for the hate!) it has a great storyline with a lot of action, quite a few twists and a truly unique setting.  In the world of Amalur, all living thing has a destiny, a fate. And all follow it, even if they don't know they do. Fateweavers, people who study fate for years, can see its threads and as such can tell someone else's, or their own, fate. Wether anouncing to a prisoner his imminent and unexpected release or telling a young man he will die in his prime due to an accident, what a fateweaver sees always holds true. For no one is above fate itself.   No one but you. Yep, you read that right! The player character in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a recently diseased person brought back to life through certain experiments and their recent return to the land of the living makes them fateless. Supposed to be dead, fate holds nothing more for you. Soon, and without knowing this, you are sent to see a fateweaver. Not remembering your past life, you hope he can bring you answers. What a shock when you get there to discover that not only does fate not affect you, but YOU in fact affect fate itself! Your actions, as they are fateless, are purely up to you, and nobody can predict them. Because of this, you can change anything: Kill someone and the fate of their whole family, or even of the whole land, might change. Save someone else and a family supposed to disapear might survive and go on to do great things. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is truly a great game which I found myself getting lost in for hours on end, trying different types of characters and gameplay, having fun simply wandering around. And if you think combat is a little boring, try to sneak-kill everything you can, I can promise that up the difficulty! And I haven't even talked about the DLCs, which brings even more fun to this party!  All in all, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, filled to the brim with fun and free roaming, loads of side quests which are all interesting, and characters whom have their own lives, relations and problems. Definetly worth every penny... Now what are you waiting for? Play the game and write your own fate!
3565	1	a	For others I guess it could be ok, more in F2P way. For me was a bad game overall. So I'll be never going back into playing this. But maybe you can check this and see how it suits you.  This seems to be the kind of game you need to try and see the results.  
3578	1	a	Now, I'm not going to say this game is great. It's pretty good. I enjoy playing it. But only the survival mode, usually on my own aswell. The rampage mode, where you play as the dinosaurs aswell, is buggy as hell. Humans are way too op. Can't wait for the Prequel, but right now, I'm not amazed. Still good game doh.
4666	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
9	0	a	I feel that this would've been more fun if the spells and abilities were more than just 'do damage', also as the game progresses your sole upgrade is more HP/MP, without any increases in damage potential, so battles at the end just end up being a long slugfest.
6389	1	a	Hours of fun if you have awsome buddys to play with. i give it a 10/10 if there was a rating system!
370	1	a	This is a great game and definately worth picking up if you're a fan of action RPGs. Probably averages about 50 hours of gameplay if you do most of the sidequests and have the DLC packs.
4637	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
5576	1	a	Crazy, stupid, but FUN!
440	1	a	This game briefly felt like everything fable was promised to be by Peter Molyneux. I often fondly remember the fun I had in this game, lamenting that this is a story that will never be finished.   An heavily story driven, action hack and slash RPG, with some over the top, beautiful animations and spell effects.  If I had to equate this to something, imagine if Dragon Age met Fable.   Pretty good, definately worth a look if you enjoy fantasy games.
2931	1	a	Just 5 hours in and I've already got the game by the throat, and then it goes and throws me for a loop all over again, something that doesn't happen to often. It's a great game to play with friends and laugh as they get eaten by dinos, and then get laughed at when you get eaten by the same dino. Easy to get a grip on, tough to actually master, the A.I might not be the smartest, but it still makes you work, no matter what weapon you have in your hand(s).  Give it a go, you can't go too wrong with this, plus who hasn't wanted to grab big guns and slaughter thousands of dinosaurs?
3961	0	a	A horrible, unfinished piece of buggy trash. Not worth $0.99. Broken animations, terrrible and boring gameplay, typical class system with a unfinshed upgrade store, just avoid. Run, run while you can.  -1000/10
410	1	a	Man, what a unique concept. The entire game storyline is gripping. The writers really outdid themselves.  The gameplay is pretty standard in between fights, but the combat is stellar. Alternating between two weapons is seamless, combos get more varied as the game progresses, and skills/spells are easy to use and useful.
119	1	a	The most awesome flawed RPG gem of all times. It could have been one of the most successful franchises ever but well... The real bad - the infamous running bug started at approx. 50h of gameplay. The good - the game is so great that I kept playing like this for 100h more. This bug won't be fixed because the original team is gone long time ago. At first, it was ruining my game experience until I got used to it. (Some claim that if you reload a previous save you could fix this movement bug but I had no luck with this). Regardless this, it's one of the best A-RPGs I played - fighting combos, superb story with little stories with catchy dialogues, gorgeous visuals, crafting, mini games, tons of loot, it has it all and it never gets boring. There was never - and it won't be - a broken game that I will play till the end, and then some. All in all, don't hesitate picking it up for a bargain price - you will at least have 50h of fun
6030	1	a	cant get my money back 10/666
1144	1	a	One of the most underrated game. I â¥ this game since it have deep grinding system and great story.  8/10
1520	1	a	fantastic graphics that oftentimes remind me of looking at Kinkade paintings. I would recommend the price point on that point alone, but the combat system is a lot of fun, the questing is non-linear and abundant, the world is huge and traveling it with the simple teleport system is genius. If Skyrim hadn't come out, this would be the number one game on the RPG shelf.
5055	1	a	take jurassic park into your own disgusting neckbearded hands
4754	0	a	WHERES TUROK ??
2367	0	a	I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.  They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.  Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.  Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!  Enemies? All the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.  Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with onomathopeyas.  Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is 'the most fantastic game' anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. 'So cool I love it'? Now that's a cool quote. 'The metacritic score is misleading'? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.  Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're: -A hipster -A game collector -A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.
2608	1	a	Killed a T-rex with a pistol before I revived my fallen caped crusader who shot me with a med-gun as I jet-packed over the next stegosaurus. I now wear the T-rex's head on my head. No â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4244	1	a	Not ground-breaking, but not bad either. The devs have been really nice to the community, making continuous content updates and patches. It's fun to play with friends.
3426	1	a	its a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ but i love it
1972	1	a	Amazing. Everyone that disses EA because the games are incompleate, play this, and apologize. The only technical issue i found was while playing this on Xbox, and the game would not start after downloading a DLC. I would rate this game 95/100.
6223	1	a	great game to play with friends :D
3601	1	a	omg, this game is my game of 1994, the graphics are amzing, no bugs and a huge amount of servers to choose from with an active community.  10/10 would run on vista again.
4212	1	a	This is an awesome game I really like the idea of the game but its a bit overpriced :D Recommended if the price drops
564	1	a	From what little I've played of this game, one thing is for sure: I wil certainly be playing it a lot more. The world is beautifully designed and quite a spectacle. The combat and gameplay are incredibly fluid, something I was skeptical about but was quickly reassured. The gameplay style itself is very unique, and it works very well. It combines an Elder Scrolls feel while playing like one of the Fable games.  The combat is more or less very close to 'God of War' and 'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow', but you're always excited to get into a new fight. It's not a chore to battle your enemies, and the use of certain combos and combining skillsets make every battle a fresh experience.  The story isn't anything to laugh at either. It's quite interesting, even from what little I've played so far. I will be replaying this game many times after I finish it, just so I can create new characters and try out new combinations.   9/10
3261	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. Its only .49 cents, just buy it and have fun for a couple of hours.
4824	1	a	Fun and super cheap right now
3518	1	a	it is like Orion: Dino Beatdown only worth the price
2803	1	a	An amazing game, especially for the low cost. A good game of dino survival with a few friends and you can't go wrong.
1608	1	a	After playing this game for a few hours I came away very impressed with the pick up and play style of the game. Think of it as Dark Souls but the game isn't trying to kill you. The game is a couple years old but it still looks pretty good with awesome lighting. The best part of the game is the combat. Its fast and very responsive to button presses. There isn't any lag when switching weapons either. No matter what the enemy is there is a move with your shield or a roll away that can get you the advantage. Leveling up and upgrading your talents or armor is very accessible. The week end sale ended but its still a great game to get at its current price.
1347	1	a	This game is quite the amazing. The combat is what drew me into this game. The best chakrams swirling, Faeblades slicing, daggers dicing, long swords â¥â¥â¥â¥ing things up, shield bashing, mallet pounding game you will play. The combat is so rich and it's really easy to switch it up. I really hope of kingdoms of Amalur 2 is coming out because I will be very interested to see it.
6311	1	a	First wave I played my head got chewed off by a T-Rex.  1O/10
1321	1	a	I'm not going to say that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, because there are issues that prevent it from earning that but it is a good game.  The character creation tools feel lackluster to start but the system of choosing your class and being able to respec for fairly cheap makes one character incredibly replayable on top of the many paths availible in the game to all kinds of playstyles you can easily swap character abilities to meet any challenge.  Combat feels boring because you kind of just mash the attack key and you either infinitely hitstun your opponent or they do the same to you. The fancier things you can do come from things like spells or abilities that, while flashy, never do as much damage as a basic attack with a good weapon.  The story is amazingly well-written and going out of your way to find more Lore is actually fun to do with the Lorestones. I enjoyed listening to the stories they told and the setting is a certain kind of western fantasy that hasn't been touched on a lot. Faerie lore, the Sidhe and other such things I mean. The main cast is mostly forgettable except for Alyn Shir (the dark elf you're trying to bed) and Agarth (your best bro). I'd say the voice-acting is a B+ at most with some cringe here and there.  There's a lot of potential in this game for enjoyment but it is by no means better than games like The Witcher but it does offer an interesting 30-60 hour experience (depending on how side-questy you feel).  I give this game one thumb up, one thumb sideways, two potatoes, some spare change and a nice country cabin in Yorkshire out of 10.
4374	1	a	A great game . Very addictive . Would get chomped by TREX again 10/10
6195	1	a	This game is very fun when playing with a friend or more than one. Not that graphics matter, but when I turned all my graphics to low, everything still looked magnifique. REALLY FUN GAME TO PLAYYYYYYYYYYYY~
6230	1	a	A better game than it may at first appear, with a group of friends it can be a lot of fun fighting off the dinosaur hordes. On your own the game can be a bore but with the right people it shines.
1964	1	a	In a nutshell I loved this game.  Notes: ~Fun game to just jump into. ~I found the 'wowesque' graphics to be a tad tired and offputting initally but I have found I apprecaite the style. ~Storyline is not super rich or alluring but again more like a cartoon its fun and you get to beat the bad guy.  I wholly reccomend anyone play this game. 
1203	1	a	The game has held up over the years and still looks great.
6263	1	a	The T-rex's roar is earsplitting.
719	1	a	10/10  Would like to jump again... oh wait nvm
1883	1	a	very fun game i enjoy there take on magic, heavy quest based game but you can free rome. main problem is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of spiders and my lady has severe arachnophobia, other then that i recomend this game very fun
6125	1	a	Dino's are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cool!
5609	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
6267	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.DO NOT BUY,WASTE OF MONEY,NEVER BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME,IT SUCKS,TETRIS IS BETTER THAN THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T.
3778	1	a	i love dinosaurs,when i was 5 i had a jurasic park themed bd party i had a shirt with Jurasic park logo,tons of plastic dinosaurs (i still have them) and a huge scaled jungle model now i have this sht and what can i say? just amazing,the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ t-rex ate me alive,tons of raptors and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ one that spits venom,plus the small ones(i think they re Compsognathids) that come in hordes of 10 or 20,too small to shot and too fast! 30 minutes of pure action scenarios are big too you can roam around and shot around the jungle to get objetives ,the folliage helps you and them to hide(like in real life) and you feel like a prey special effects are cool and weapons are nice pistols are my fav cheap price,great game
1859	1	a	Very fun because you get to choose your own playstyle on the fly...even in the midst of combat
4547	1	a	I remember when it was dino: beatdown and it was 15 dollars... So â¥â¥â¥â¥.
662	1	a	This has everything a good RPG needs, AND the fighting is awesome.
4443	0	a	Your connection to the host has been lost.
2591	1	a	I had this game for a while. It is pretty damn fun. Think Killing Floor with Dinos in the far future with vehicles and you get the idea.   Also while its on sale for 99 cents, why the hell not!?
5011	1	a	Why is this so godamn addicting
4576	1	a	7/10
3191	1	a	This game is solid. The price is right, even better when I picked it up for 49 cents. If you like shooting things and fighting dinosaurse you will enjoy this game. If you dont, get off my internet.
3522	1	a	This game is entertaining and fun. You get to shoot dinosaurs. It's not the most fluid game I've ever played, but it's well worth the money.  7/10.
3159	1	a	i punched a T-rex in the balls  10/10  would punch again
5771	0	a	I don't even own this game lmao
3755	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
6088	1	a	Brilliant. Dinos + unreal. One of the greatest PC games of all time, also the cheapest game I've ever bought (was even discounted for multi-buy). Amazing. 20/10
6247	1	a	its exactly what it looks like
1090	1	a	DO YOU WANT TO BECOME A BADASS WITH A HUGE SWORD OR A SNEAKING NINJA WITH DAGGERS OR A NINJA WITH A HUGE SWORD?!?!?!!?!?!?
3113	1	a	This game is awesome... best FPS I've seen in a while.
5206	0	a	This game for me was too laggy. Can't join or play. Even if I could, the gameplay wasn't as fun as one may think. Sorry, but this game honestly isn't worth it.
5864	1	a	Although clunky and unresponsive at best, with repetitive gameplay blatant animation errors EVERYWHERE, it's a breath of air from the drones of modern military fps games left and right. Plus it's only a dollar so you can't really complain.
270	1	a	I really like it, reminds me of a cutesy Elder Scrolls. A nice Casual RPG adventure, job well done and good controller support.
4171	1	a	I bought this game for 99 cents. I thought it would completely suck. It turned out to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. Buy a 4 pack and give it to some friends. You won't regret it.
1777	1	a	Pretty nice fable-like rpg, recommended if u like quests equal as grind. be aware of location level system.
4776	1	a	This Game Is Great It Has Alot Of Bugs But they can be forgotten as its gameplay is great and for $1 its a great deal
5139	0	a	never let me go into a game i just looked at people and things run by
5158	1	a	-Installed the game because my friend said it wasn't as â¥â¥â¥â¥ as it was before  -Joined a game  -Halloweene themed  -Fight a couple of dinosaurs and having fun  -Boss battle  -Friend says it's a T rex  -Same friend suddently starts screaming and yelling â¥â¥â¥â¥ we can't understand  -Keeps repeating 'PUMPKIN!! PUMPKIIIIN!!!''  -Turns out boss is a giant pumpkin that throws you in the air  -Pretty intense battle with jetpacks and a lot of reviving  -Boss has still almost full health  -Teleports on a mountain and rains giant fireball on us, killing us.  10/10 Spooked out of my mind.  (Actual game is pretty fun tho if you get with friends. Kind of a shame that the whole character customization is a cash grab)
1446	1	a	Graphics are excellent - Gameplay is smooth. Been awhile since I had this much fun in this style of game!
4487	1	a	A glitchy buggy mess of game with broken ai and Laggy hitboxes. They were smart to make their tagline 'It's only 99 cents!' And to their credit... It is only 99 cents.
3318	1	a	This game has the right plan, cheap games with good amount of stuff to do = good profit
738	1	a	One of the best, despite being the easiest, RPGs I've ever come across. The combat system is basic and refined, it's not as twitchy as most other Action RPGs because it still requires a proper strategy when engaging enemies. The graphics are great, not too overtly realistic yet it's not as cartoony. Kinda reminds me of World of Warcraft, and for that it kinda makes me sad. Because I miss WoW.
2748	1	a	this might just be the funnest game i have EVER played. im talking better than cod advanced warfare
142	1	a	Pros: -So much to do -GREAT music -Quite a few interesting characters -A lot of different and diverse quests* -You can reset your skills and perks any time -Loot adapts to your class to a certain extent and always to your level -Huge world -Interesting combat for all classes -Story might not be the greatest of all time but it feels consistent and hasn't let me down -Steady and rewarding progression level-wise -Mixing different class skill trees gives awesome results (supported by the free class system)  *Although there are a lot of 'Go kill X' and fetch quests the great atmosphere and world design makes largely up for those  Some cons: -Balancing, late game criticals just face-roll everything, while for example slow warriors are helpless and slow -Humans look like clay dolls; especially facial expressions are just awful -Some funny depth of field and lightning effects sometimes when out in the woods -Level cap at 40 feels a bit low with the steady progression, hybrid jobs cannot reach the highest skill tier -A lot of skills are just worthless in their normal class and become only slightly useful for hybrid builds -Your inventory is gonna get clogged like your toilet after that one chili-taco-chipotle evening (AND THE STORAGE DOES NOT HELP) -Some areas feel awfully empty -Most ruins and caves look the same -A few bugs with NPC interactions  Overall 9/10 I love it
1798	1	a	Excellent Game! A dream to play! Very well polished, beautiful and awesome gameplay. So many weapons and magics. I am overwhelmed with all the great stuff :D Challenging on Hard difficulty. It takes a little while to get stuff and to get into but once you get going you wonât want to stop playing!
5308	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
2318	1	a	Where can you go wrong with this game? It's very cheap and super fun. Honestly, I'd buy this game for $10 or even $20. I highly suggest trying it out or even getting the 4-pack so you can play with your friends. How disappointed can you get when it was only a dollar?  10/10 would watch friend be eaten again.
5058	1	a	dinosaurs for a dollar what not to buy
4960	1	a	It's on sale 24/7 jesus just buy the damn game it's decent for the price
5091	1	a	For $.99, 10/10,000 BC/AC (In what year is this again?).     While flying I killed a flying dinosaur, then I landed to kil some walking dinosaurs, and then a person from the other came to sabotage our reactor/core/whatever it is and f***ed our team (but I don't care, I killed taht b***ard anyways). [/spiler]  
5140	0	a	This game has good gameplay, but the idea of having to WAIT in order to respond, is simply ANNOYING; I'd rather be the dinosaurs and hunt the soldiers, instead!  But no; the GAME DOESN'T LET YOU CHOOSE TO BE ONE! Not in Survival mode, at least. This game is a decent deal for 3 bucks, because it currenty acts like cheap overrated shovelware. So, for effort, the designs and music are great, but waiting for SEVERAL MINUTES makes the only fun of waiting, being a 'troll' by making cheesy puns and jokes. If the game doesn't allow you to do that, then I'd be having much more fun, by playing Xbox 360 'kinect' games; as long as the controls work okay, and the gameplay is ACTUALLY FUN!  My advice? You can probably find better USED games for less, from certain 'bargain' stores; heck, I even found a copy of Freedom Force, (which still has the code, on the back of the CD case) for only 1 dollar! Heck, if I can't find a patch to make it work on Windows 8, I'd probably have to buy it on Steam, so it WILL MORE LIKELY WORK!
831	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning poor game. fix bugs.
633	1	a	Recommended. It's a solid RPG. The art style bugs me a little, there is an amazing about of lore in the world (Fueled by R.A. Salvatore), it can be a bit of a hack fest and it pretty easy, but It's worth at least one playthrough. It's one of those games that's on the edge as far a opinions I've encountered: a good 50/50 of like/dislike, but no outright hatred.
6321	1	a	Worth the money when I bought it (1â¬)
659	1	a	I r8 it 10/10 mates.
189	1	a	Summary: I highly recommend Amalur for anyone looking to scratch that high fantasy RPG itch until the next great title comes along. For the full purchase price of $20, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid purchase. For $6 when the game goes on sale like it is now, it's a ridiculous bargain.   Background (or why my hours played is so low but the review remains relevant :P ): I originally bought this game a month ago through Origin (don't hate, back then it was seven dollars there vs twenty here) where I clocked in over 90 hours of game time and finished the game. Well, currently Steam has the Amalur Collection on sale for $12 that includes the core game, both DLCs and a weapon/armor bundle. Back on Origin the DLCs cost $10 a piece so I just went ahead and bought the entire collection here. So on to the review!  Pros:  (1) This game is massive. And I mean MASSIVE. I stopped doing side quests about 1/3 - 1/2 way through the game because I wanted to see how the main quest line would end, and it still took me 90 hours to finish the game. So if you're a completionist and you decide to explore the entire map and do every single quest my guess is the game offers around 200 hours of game time. For six dollars that's... kind of crazy. And yes, you can continue adventuring and discover/finish side quests after completing the main story line. :)  (2) Combat is fun and fast paced, with fluid animations, nice particle effects, and charge ups/combos galore. There are three schools of combat skills available (basically mage, warrior, thief), but you can explore any and all of them without restriction and for a price you can respec your character any time you want through a number of vendors in the game.   (3) The voice acting is solid. One of the worst sins a RPG can commit to kill immersion is to populate their world with terrible voice actors. Luckily they avoid that problem here. You might still meet the random side quest character who could have put in a little more emotion here or a bit less ham there, but all the main characters do a fine job carrying out their roles as do most of the secondary cast.  (4) The game world is well developed. A good RPG needs an immersive game world to lose oneself in, and Amalur does a good job on this front. First, the world lore is well fleshed out with books and lorestones (think audio books) scattered throughout the world providing history, context and even humour. Second, the game world looks nice, especially for a two year old title. The stylistic approach they took is very high fantasy, with colorful and vibrant settings, so if you're looking for an overall darker/perpetual winter type environment you might be disappointed.   (5) The game is stable and bug free. In 90 hours of game play, I've only come across one bug. Unfortunately that bug did force me to load up a previous save game to proceed in that side quest, but 1 bug in 90 hours of game play is pretty darn good. For those who buy this game and are curious, the bug takes place right before your conversation with Sir Sagrell on the House of Ballads quest line, so just save before then and you should be golden.  (6) You get to support the state of Rhode Island! After Steam takes its cut, proceeds from Steam sales of Amalur goes to RI, not EA. Well, okay, if you hate the state of RI I guess this would be a con. I've never visited RI, but as the tiniest state in the US I have a soft spot for them. Guess it's just me rooting for the little guy. :D  Cons: (1) No more support. The company that developed Amalur is bankrupt, and its assets scattered to the four winds (or RI in this case which was the company's largest creditor). So there aren't going to be any sequels, or patches, for this game. Ever.   (2) The camera is too zoomed in and you can't manually zoom out. This REALLY bugged me when I first started playing this game. The camera automatically zooms out in combat to fit all the people on the screen as well as during special attack animations, so the game is fully capable of zooming in and out. They just decided to be lazy and not implement a manul zoom function for the PC. -.- After a few hours, I got used to it but chances are it's going to bug you too if you're a regular PC player (apparently this is a console port issue?). I've read you can fix this by using Widescreen Fixer, but I haven't tried this so YMMV.   (3) The story is just adequate when it could have been so much more. At its core, the main story itself is derivative of many other fantasy tales. Their focus on the interplay of Desinty vs Free Will offers it a refreshing change of pace, but the game never takes that extra push to make its stories truly emotionally gripping. For example, one of the more interesting and sympathetic characters I ran across was an antagonist who has been condemned to play the part of a villain in a never-ending, repeating fairy tale for all eternity. So yes, she's a villain, but she's a villain who is doing these things to break the cycle where she is condemned to play the villain forever, and forever. And while the game lets you choose her side in the end, the resolution just never reaches any kind of deeper emotional crescendo or pathos like they could have if they dug just a little deeper.  (4) The depth of your relationship with other characters are just adequate. This, similar to the story, is an issue of wasted potential. Like the story, the personality of the people you meet and their relationship to your character is portrayed in a perfectly adequate matter, but it never progresses beyond that. We learn that our character had a past relationship with some of these people, but the relationships never really evolve in the here and now. Sure some of them greet you differently after you've helped them, praise you, even call you their lord, but a true emotional connection or investment just isn't there. Contrast this to titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect where it was your relationships that basically made the game so great and.. well... so... much... potential... :(  (5) Some of the dungeon layouts are not very optimized for fun. Barring its many flaws on release, one of the things Skyrim did very well was their intelligent dungeon map layouts. Every dungeon was set out so that it would either loop in itself or end at another exit so you didn't have to track through an already cleared dungeon to leave. Amalur does this for its main dungeons and most of the side quest ones, but they neglect to do this for a noticeable number as well which, well, is just dumb. This might not seem like a big deal, but when you're talking about a 200 hour game with countless dungeons, it gets very annoying having to backtrack through an empty dungeon just to exit.   Conclusion: All in all, this is a solid RPG romp through a well developed and entertaining land of magic and adventure. And at six dollars, or even twenty, I would give it a solid recommendation. So get out there, craft your own Destiny, and happy questing! :)
4490	0	a	I purchased this when it was still called 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'. It looked very promising. It turned out to be the worst game I had intended to buy.   If any difference came in 'Prelude' then it should be celebrated because changing literally anything about Beatdown is a positive.
1244	1	a	The Best game I ever Played .
1119	1	a	Nalif played this once and now he doesn't make videos anymore.   But he was good and this game is good so i'd give it a buy.
5737	0	a	minecraft more funny then that
84	1	a	I love this game. It's just a bit short. Got it as part of a bundle but it is probably worth a few quid
3330	1	a	It may not be a triple a title with insane graphics and intense story(it doesnt even have a story) but for pp cens, it is hands down the best game ever
2513	1	a	this is a fun game and at one point you can be a dino yourself 
5013	1	a	A very under-rated game that with a few friends is a VERY enjoyable experience
4750	1	a	When this game is on sale, it is TOTALLY worth it. Its a fun, fast paced, easy to get into first person shooter. I bought it for $0.49 and it was worth every penny. I have only played about 2 online rounds but still like it a lot and will be playing it more.  If you're looking for some kind of long story line, and tons of depth, this isnt it. Its meant to be SUPER easy to get into and get out of.  Although, it is buggy and I think the dinos get way to close to you and its hard to see them. But all the settings are there, FOV slider, textures, AA, so forth... Like it is going to get more and more attention as more people buy it. But it is not meant to be this super realistic game, just meant to be fun.
1544	1	a	Absolutely amazing, it plays like a AAA flagship game.  I can't believe how beautiful the maps are, and they're so big you find yourself getting lost again and again (but it's really fun to get lost in this game)  The thievery system of this game is super addictive, and while combat is easy it's still exciting. It's definitely casual gaming but sometimes that's what you want, right?
3642	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot. Truly the best experience one could hope to have killing dino's with advanced technology.   And at the low low price of 1$ (during the steam sale) you would be an absolute fool to not buy this game on the spot and giggle in glee as you and your friends shoot and destroy dinos with various vehicles and weapons.   Game of the year 2013/2014/2015.  Buy it now.  9001/9001  2 1337 4 M3
2271	1	a	The hexagonal battle system is a bit different from the rest of the series- graphically the game looks decent, and gameplay wise it's somewhat repetitive but still has potential, unfortunately this lacks some of the variety of it's predecessors- namely in recruitable units and expansions.
3322	1	a	Run into dinosaurs Kill dinosaurs Get credits Spend credits Kill more dinosaurs ... Get a fancy hat  Superb game, loving every round and match.  Only downside is that from all the different game modes they offer, I only ever see Survival and Conquest servers. Which is basically the same thing...
4484	1	a	So bad its good. Pretty much just a crappy halo but with dinos as ur enemy would say u should play it with group of friends or else it may not be as humerous it just a silly game u can mess around in with friends, ull have more time laughing than actually bothering about wats going on
3353	1	a	10/10 -IGN  'Like Skyrim with dinosaurs.'
6289	0	a	I got this game for .99 cents.. Its worth that much to be honest. Don't buy this game unless its dirt cheap.
1180	1	a	really really good game highly reccomended.
4324	1	a	Dinosaur halo for $1? Why the hell not. Fun game, still a little rough around the edges though.
3718	0	a	Well it turns out that my review of 'Don't buy this it's junk.' wasn't helpful. So here's a more in depth one.  ----  Don't buy this! Even at 0.79p it's to expensive! The net code is rubbish. The leveling system bad. The AI terrible. The guns, well, not to bad actually. It just feels unfinished and slow even on my over the top PC.  If you want to spend time on a computer game you can find much better ones out there.
1752	1	a	It's funny I actually prefer this game over Skyrim. The pacing is good and combat just feels MUCH better while still having a large world and a lot of character specializations. Skyrim just feels like it takes its time with every little thing and I found myself getting bored pretty quickly. I'm glad I bought it super cheap so I don't feel too bad about it. The only reason I haven't finished Amalur is because it's a really long game, especially for the 'do everything'-type of person.
2999	1	a	This buggy game is actually pretty fun when playing with friends!  This has a 5 player co-op.  i find the original price to be too high, I think this game should be around $5.00.  However, me and a lot of my friends only paid $1.00.Worth every penny. :D
3130	1	a	this game is great
4802	0	a	The single and only shitest most unbalanced laggy peice of crap that I love for no reason. Now I'm off to uninstall.
2546	1	a	I probably paid somewhere around $10 for this game when it was actively being worked on. It was one of the first early access games that I purchased and my friend and I had a blast killing dinosaurs. You used to be able to purchase vehicles as well as weapons. For whatever reason they took out the vehicle purchasing building. There are still vehicles, but they are spread out across the map in little outpost like areas. You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less. I would recommend this game, if you you have a friend that would like to blow away a bunch of dinosaurs with you. Well worth the $0.99.
130	1	a	Shame the devs got â¥â¥â¥â¥ed in hte â¥â¥â¥ and went belly up because this game did not get the approval and attention it deserves.  Sorry to say guys that the likelyhood of a sequel to this is not possible.  If only someone could see how glorious this game is and pick it up to not let it die in the background.
1274	1	a	Probably one of the best combat rpgs, however the story isnt interesting, the game seems to have you run around quite a bit and do nearly the same quests, collect this item, kill these guys. And you wouldn't really expect much from any OTHER game, but the thing is that this game is so lacking in the story department, even in repetative quests there could be a wonderful story much like TW3:WH where every little detail that can be added to any quest, any mission, any character you speak to, is added. But this game I feel like is good if you really enjoy a nice challenging battle, 'bosses' are cool becasue it is just a big monster you run into, they don't really hype it up at all. And finishing moves are interesting as well, though with some enemy types they become stale, but you don't use them too often so I guess it is fine, all in all this game is.  overall - 7/10  combat - 7.5/10  story - 5.5/10  might not seem like much but it is a good buy on sale. not worth 20 bucks I'de say.  again, don't go out of your way, however the game is a good game to buy for an ok rpg fan.
1951	1	a	A solid game. It's a fun action rpg, and i'd certainly recommend it, especially considering it's often on sale. Not a fantastic game however, so don't go in with too high expetations.  - Story is nothing spectacular, some interesting stuff to be sure, but nothing special. It does stroke the player's ego quite a bit, what with all the 'Chosen One' Themes, the NPCs are consistently impressed with your perfomance.  - There's quite a lot to do, thought the side quests can get repetitive. Once i reached the level Cap i couldn't be bothered to do most of it, specially considering i could craft much better gear than any quest reward at that point.  - It's definitely not a difficult game, in late game i was able to stomp everything in Hard quite handly, and i'm only a mostly competent player at best. seriously thought, by the end of the game all but a single type of attack (piercing, i believe) did any damage to my character, he literally could not be hurt from almost anything, on Hard.
4607	1	a	ORION: Dino Hore is a action packed RPG MMO with robots. It is a forth person shooter with many different guns to choose from including, My favourite, the pistol. The Graphics are revolutionary for the dinosaws moths move and even when you die you get a very good insight of what a dinosaws digestive system looks like there for it is also educational. You can play many classes such as the mage, the rouge and soldier or even the random guy who does not do anything and still win by pure luke. Now i know what you fink, Meta score ist bud but screw the sustem. What the lego movie taught me, dont trust the government for they give you false information 99999999% of the time. I give this game a 11111111111111111111111111/1 in my opinon. The specil ting bout dis gam is you can play as a dinosaw which everybody wanted. Overal, ds gam is gut and i prefer th tim i cilled a dinosaw but relized it was my friend with a hat on. 
4472	0	a	Prelude to what? Oh god, what am I playing?!
745	1	a	Love this game. Never understood why it got such harsh reviews. I enjoy going back every so often just to re-roll and do things differently. Lot of fun!
4249	1	a	This game's change soo much! Multiplayer with your friends is a blast. Killing the dinos is always soo satisfying!
2088	1	a	KOA is honestly one of my favorite RPGs. It's not completely perfect, but the great combat system and incredible art style more than make up for its minor flaws.
1356	1	a	WOW, stumbled upon this game, took a punt when it was on sale and was nervous as the demo didn't work, but it is amazing, loved every moment of the main quest and 2 DLC's, more please.  if you liked skyrim i 'RECKON' you will like this, super pretty,, nice music, not as free roaming, but way more stable, well done big huge games.
3569	1	a	Funny. I liked it very much! :D
6362	1	a	Great value for a great game, sure it has its problems but they are being fixed by the devs and the game only gets better as time goes on and for 79p you wonât find a game like it. Great graphics and a great selection of modes to play from Survival (Objective)  Slaughter (Duration), Rampage (Playable Dinosaurs), Prehistoric (Custom Variable).  As of this month the ORION: Prelude Developer SDK Beta is going to be released so the possibilities of what you can do is endless thanks to the steam workshop support.  Overall a good game and a great value, though don't let the low price put you of from buying this game as it is well worth it, there are plenty of reviews out about this game so I have kept my very brief but I give this game an 8.5 out of 10.
2897	1	a	Fix the damn multiplayer bugs and this game would be lots of fun
1875	1	a	After the headache of installing and reinstalling the game just go get it to work, I can say that I'm glad I did.  I have put countless hours into this game and there is still hours and hours to go. I would describe it as singe-player WoW/Fable hack-and-slash hybrid. The story is interesting (if not confusing at times) and the ability to customize and recustomize your character allows for a lot of variety in the gameplay. The skill trees provide unique experiences depending on which path you take, the weapons and armor are varied from one to the next, and all in all you can truly play this game in whatever way you prefer. And then if you change your mind, you can change your character around and try it in a new way.  I really can't say enough positive stuff about this game. It has been endlessly entertaining so far.
830	0	a	Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.
2524	1	a	Fun game for the price! I feel like I got my monies worth.
731	0	a	-Did not keep my attention for long -World feels enclosed/empty and superficial (like playing in a giant bowl) -Combat-oriented; inappropriate/out of place hack-n-slash combat system for an RPG  -Felt reminiscent to a mediocre MMORPG without all the players (shallow quests, for instance)  +appealing visuals and aesthetics  +despite combat system feeling out of place, it is rather satisfying +skill trees presented cool abilities and freedom of playstyle; you do not have to spend points on a single tree to benefit  Final Verdict: I want my $5 back.
2332	1	a	This game is absolutely marvelous, a gem hidden in between triple A games. Not only are you able to express your burning desire to warn someone for a sniper, man. They added a whole other game mode for free! In this gamemode you're able to shoot pre-historic creatures back to extinction while driving vehicles that don't obey the laws of physics.  I would totaly recommend this game if you need a hour to kill.   
5236	1	a	I love this game even if my computer can barely handle all the awesomness, its like I'm choking on minor lag multikills with the adreneline weapons (my comp's fault not the game). I give this game a solid 10.
4796	1	a	Why'd you make it Free2Play? It's a total waste of my money!
726	1	a	This is a great RPG. The only problems with this game are the voice acting and some quests. Its pretty obvious that Kingdoms of Amalur was designed with MMO in mind (before EA forced the devs not to make it an MMO). The voice acting in the game is pretty bad. It feels like the voice actors were pulled into the booth, and told to emotion, but none of them did. All of the voice acting feels forced and emotionless. Quests feel a bit like generic fetch and combat quests. However, this is made up for with the massive map and gameplay. Gameplay is fun and I feel that each hit feels powerful and fun. There are 3 skill trees to go down, a Sneak based tree, a magic based tree, and a warrior based tree. The game recgonizes that some people like to take all 3 trees, and offers perks for going down all 3 trees. The maps is massive, with loads of content to explore. The DLCs offer even more to explore and fight. However, I can only really recommend it if you can find a sale, and I don't think you should buy the GOTY edition. Stick with the regular edition, and only invest in the GOTY edition if you have spare money to throw around.
2672	0	a	Dinosaurs. What's not to love, right? Right?... In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds.   In my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery.   The game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color.   It isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it. You may have better luck.
5010	1	a	If you ignore the politics over game assets then this is a fun game!
2093	1	a	This game is pretty cool. So far i've invested 58 hours and i'm no where close to finishing it, so if long games are your thing then this is the one for you.  A Pro is there are tons of quests and you can just keep going one right after the other. The Con is that some of the simple quests can get somewhat repetative, just with a change of scenery. Another thing is that the amount of items you get is staggering, getting set items and unique items is like getting presents on christmas. This brings me to one thing i didn't like.  If your a collector that has to have...and keep every item, this game will be hard for you. I'm an item collector in games and for this game i run out of space after every quest and have to choose on what to keep. My personal stash and shared house stash are almost full, and like i said before, i'm no where close to finishing. Another thing i didn't like is the combat system, it gets pretty repetative pretty fast and seems like your just pressing the same button over and over. But that's only if you choose to upgrade your weapon mastery first (it takes a while to upgrade all weapon masteries) instead of getting abilities first.  All in all a good game to spend your time and money, especially with Steam marking the price down to 75% at times with all the dlc.
5082	1	a	This is a very interesting game. I've only played it for a little, but I think it could be interesting. However, right now it seems a little rote. Perhaps the more I get into it, the more I will like it.
5270	1	a	  I LOVE THIS GAME SHOUT OUT TO THE CREATORS IF YOU EVER MAKE A NEW GAME PLEASE MAKE IT AS COOL AS THIS ONE 
3661	1	a	I love this game, better then tripple A titles such as AC Unity and Arkham Knight. 7/10.
363	1	a	I don't know where to start but this game is best RPG I've ever played. Please don't ask me about Skyrim this is my personel opinion. Whatever, let's start:   â¢ 4 races to play. â¢ 3 skill trees Might, Finesse &amp; Sorcery. (You can be three of them if you want) â¢ Fighting system like Darksiders. â¢ Epic boss fights.  â¢ A great story, never got bored while playing.  â¢ A huge world to explore. (Better with DLC Packs) â¢ Amazing animations.  â¢ And the best part, insane finishing moves while in Reckoning Mode!   So, you MUST buy this game if you wanna feel the real action. Trust me, you won't regret it!
1273	1	a	Amazing RPG. Beautiful world and the combat is super fun. Dialogue and story are engaging. Found this game more enjoyable than most of the popular RPGs out at the time.
1393	1	a	A mixture of World of Warcraft, and Fable type gameplay, with Mass Effect style Dialogue options, all set in a game world that surpasses most other RPG's in size.  However, with no Multiplayer (even LAN), many may find this game lacking in the Depth that an MMO can bring.  That having been said, for those who Love WoW and Fable, this game can be a pleasant diversion from the MMO grind.
763	1	a	Recommended if you love exploring a vast world, a CRAP TON of loot, new lore, and action RPGS. Not if you love an overly long, incredibly repetitive experience. I give it a 6/10.
6036	1	a	- Fun for a buck.   -The opposite of how it feels to buy a slice of gas station pizza in the middle of nowhere because you're hungry, and as you eat it, begin thinking clearer about what just happened; you went and paid 3.50 for a slice of pizza (which was the only slice left in the warming display) that you would normally not eat unless one of your buddies gave you 5 or 10 bucks on a dare, because the thing is so dried up and stiff you could more feasibly use it as a shield for being attacked by an aggressive cat with KHAJI'IT-sharp claws rather than consider it a source of nutrition.   Don't let my play time fool you, I really had fun after the whole Prelude update, I could see more life being breathed into the game. It seems the devs are very active, the community has a pulse, for my brief experience the rounds played at a fun pace. Likely, I'll play much more one day but I can only focus on a limited amount of games at any given time, and I'm more of a single-player, grind to get achievements, story mode gamer.   It's a freickieng dollar when it's full price. Just get it because, you can pay 10-20 times that amount for a game you will NOT EVER enjoy as much as this game!   Or, don't get it yet- It's going to be a dollar (or less), forever!   
2998	1	a	The metascore may leads to misunderstandings. It's not a very good game but at least not bad. i play in a lobby and it's really fun. it's exciting and some kind of interesting but still lots of problems  such as this game has the worst music ive ever heard and this game need more test. Anyway highly recommend if it is on 1 usd again.
6082	1	a	This version is just awesome, enough talking, I need to play more...
4931	0	a	I hate it
2096	1	a	This is a great game. R.A. Salvatore is an author I adore, and the richness and detail of the world live up to Demon Saga and Forgotten Realms -level storytelling. The art is fantastic, and the gameplay is addictive. I've played through it a few times now, and I never tire of it.  The main premise (you are 'fateless', with no pre-written destiny) was apparently not written by Salvatore, and that's nice to know since it makes no sense. Sure, you get to write your own fate, but so what? in any RPG you get to choose your own 'fate'. It seems like the storyline missed an opportunity to incorporate the struggle between a game's inherent linear story (if you want to complete the game, you DO have to follow the storyline, so you aren't really without destiny, are you?) and the idea that you are a character without a destiny. That aspect is never explored, and yet you're constantly being told throughout the game that everyone's really amazed by you because you have no pre-determined fate.  Aside from that, the game is perfect. The combat is FUN, the RPG elements are solid (in fact, you can change classes and skills quite easily), and the world is huge with lots of side quests. Highly recommended.
3091	1	a	not historically accurate, stegosauruses (stegosauri) were pacifists and did not partake in violence.
6175	1	a	great raarrrr action some of graphcs dump than priminal carnage some of better.
4564	0	a	the shop is so bad and the overall of it is not fun and it is for like 5 secs and then it just gets so boring
5347	0	a	would rather buy winrar
166	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur sure feels like a refreshing wind after trying out a bunch of different mmorpgs and rpgs.  This game combines the combat of many console-esque titles like God of War and Darksiders, with the lore and rpg-aspect of games like Dragon Age and Vampire the Masquerade (roughly speaking).   Lore  After playing around 12 hours I was feeling fairly immersed in the world of Amalur. Bit for bit you learn more and more about the lore, machinations of the world and all the colourful characters that inhabit it. You can go further by looking for 'lorestones' across maps and reading books/scrolls that will teach you more about the Kingdom of Amalurs history, alas it is not mandatory for those who prefer to avoid lore alltogether and focus on the other aspects of the game. But for those who love lore like me, you'll notice that there has been placed a lot of thought into the this aspect of the game. I'm not aware if it's R.A. Salvatore or someone else who wrote the story, but it seems well thought out in overall.   Size of game-world  The game itself seems to be fairly large - the worldmap is quite grand &amp; you travel between subzones on it. 'Clearing' each area can sometimes take a couple of hours - so this game isn't really lacking content as to say. This game has easily 100+ hours of content to go through.   Quests  Some people voice concern that the game is too 'grindy' and compare it to games like World of Warcraft where you kill x amount of wild boars, and then move on to kill x amount of kobolds, etc. Amalur has these kind of quests too, but they are well mixed among very different and personalized quests which in my opinion makes the former ones bearable to a larger extent.   Visuals  The visuals look good, even if you find odd low-res textures here and there which isn't as bad as it might sound as long as you don't expect ultra setting Skyrim ENB with high res textures-quality. Kingdoms of Amalur can also utilize the ENB-injector technology and give the world a more vivid look which I recommend for everyone who aren't satisfied with the default visuals of the game. You can grab it off the Skyrim Nexus site.   Classes  One of the games absolute strongpoints is the 'class'-system that Kingdom of Amalur has. You have a lot of options to combine and customize your own 'class' - mix and match skills of different kinds. The game has the classic 'Warrior, rogue and sorcerer'-theme, but you can create hybrids of all combinations - and the ability to respecc for a sum of gold gives you a chance to try out different kinds of gameplay without having to create a new character every time.   Combat  The combat is fast paced and fun. You unlock and learn new kinds of attacks and 'combos' as the game progresses and you level up your character. The many kind of enemies and their behaviour means that you can't just spam attacks all the time (if you play on hard-difficulty), but you actually need to stop and block, or dodge attacks to be able to win. Thinking ahead is key, for example when positioning yourself so that all the enemies get in a big line infront of you, prior to using that powerful sword-attack that hits everything in a line up front.   Minor flaws of the game  My only gripe so far with this game has been minor annoyances like the FoV (which you can modify using a widescreen modification - google it!) and things like weapons sheathing too fast, both in and out of combat. I'd like to see more RP-aspects and abilities for the character, but seeing it being a single-player game - it's forgivable. The game is also not open-world, but rather 'instanced'. Still the 'instanced' areas are often pretty large, way larger than what Dragon Age had for instance - thus making it forgivable too.   Conclusion  In overall this game is fairly good if you're looking for decent story, engaging combat and many hours of gameplay. A little polish wouldn't hurt here and there though as I earlier mentioned. Unfortunately since the studio behind this game went into bankruptcy we can't be expecting any more updates, which is sad since the title has potential and I would personally be interested in purchasing a sequel if there ever was one.   Rating  Giving this game a 8 out of 10.
5090	1	a	GET THIS GAME!!!! I have played this game for 100+ hrs over 2 accounts, lvl 29 and 39. and its only a dollar, so u dont have to spend forever saving up you money if you are younger.
2856	1	a	10/10
3428	1	a	Orion: Prelude (Or Dino Horde, when I had this game) is a game where, you guessed it, kill dinosaurs. But it doesn't just stick to slaying gigantic creatures. You also get to pick from a hefty variety of gamemodes that change the pace of the game, sometimes entirely!  Would I recommend someone to play this game? It's $0.99. How can you NOT buy it?
3650	1	a	great game.
5549	1	a	it is buggy (the movents) but if you have friends with who you can play it it should be fun, not as in i am looking to play something by my own then i advise not buying this.
4414	0	a	Don't buy it. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on almost every level, and no where to be worth $8.99.  Bggest issues are sound cutting out, constant crashing, horrible and ugly UI, dumb AI, god awful animations for everything.. etc. Another reason not to buy is because the guy who created it is a crook.  That is all I have to say.
4560	1	a	An enjoyable way to pass time
2462	1	a	You get Halo, CoD, and one heck of a FPS for .99 cents
5181	1	a	U like killin dinos? Well i certainly did, funny game, though wont be fun to play solo or neither to long at a time.
3087	1	a	I got this game out of the blue thanks to the steam sale. And if it wasn't for that I wouldn't of found it. This game is awesome period, its player movements are nice and smooth and the dinosaurs give the game a different feel. The weapons are great and nicely balanced so far. If this game goes on sale again I recommend buying it. Its a rather fun game to play.
327	1	a	The game seams a bit simplistic the combat is arcade style and a bit styalized. I like the graphics but the world doesent seam to be as 'open as they suggest in the intro. I expected an open world to explore. The controls seam to work ok and the dialog is interesting if you like fantasy adventure I would recomend this game. My only dislike is the charachter creation process and tutorial in the begining which you cant avoid if you want to play the game through as a different charachter.
4084	0	a	The trailer is right: don't believe the Metacritic review. 36/100? I don't understand where they got all those points from..  If you enjoy things like: Loadout customization where your Primary Weapon choices are: 'Connection Error' and six other blank slots Bleeding ears after the T-Rex roars 20x louder than the rest of the game Crash on alt-tab Graphics from the 16th Century A wide variety of 3 classes that all spawn you with some kind of generic block thing Running 3000m to start the game  Then I would recommend this game for you, you stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3178	1	a	You can either get that 2$ chicken pizza burger taco or buy 2 copies of this for you and your friend to shoot dinosaurs (and other prehistoric things not to be racist) for hours on end.     If your hungry you can always become the dinosaur and eat the human, probably tastes better then that chicken pizza burger taco.  I rate 1/1
1188	1	a	Nice game, Best killing moves, yet bad map and okay story. 8/10
1185	1	a	If you're a fan of RPG's your only issue with this game will be that you haven't played it sooner. I have been a long time RPG fan and claim Diablo 2, Baldur's Gate, and Elder Scrolls to be among my favorites. Now KoAR joins that list. It's well worth the price and while its not without its flaws, it is a must play for anyone who enjoys action gameplay and in depth storyline.
5908	0	a	Forest Gump runs better than this
3768	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played and i suggest getting it. 
4985	0	a	its ok, crashs more than I would like and a lot of server drops.
4061	0	a	Hardly any servers to go on, single-player is boring as hell, and the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. 4/10
584	1	a	Amalur is a brilliant game to get lost in. I found myself wandering the world embracing all the unique landscapes of regions in Amalur. The aesthetic and colour to the game is magnificent, and I always found myself appreciating the variety of regional areas the game had to offer. Each has it's own lore, story, quests and tales, beautifully dictated by the lorestones scattered about the world.  Lorestones are superb, and I found the voice acting brilliant for specifically the lorestones. Although it lacks in dialouge and it is apparent that many voice actors were reused for several character, which I understand due to the vast world Amalur has to offer. There's hundreds of unique NPC's with unique dialogue to keep you interested, and Amalur never lacks in conversation with NPCs from region to region.  Each region is unique, but I feel like I need to elaborate on this more. Every place you go to has it's own unique story and urban legends, many containing quests pertaining to these. Some of my favourites and ones to look out for are Canneroc (a spider infested town, with a strange woman at cause) and The Red Marches (a strange cult has swooped in and slaughtered an entire town, why.) These are just two instances of what makes Amalur a great game and examples of the hours of content you can obtain from it.  Another thing is that the lore is huge, and you have to earn it. Lorestones are the main source of knowlege throughout Amalur, although their are quite a few books located throughout the world containing information also. But Lorestones are convenient and a nice addition as you don't need to read an in-game book and pause for a few minutes to learn something new about Amalur. You also get a small bonus for completing a 'set' of lorestones, which encourages you to learn the full story.  Then there's the combat. The combat in Amalur is so fast-paced and exciting, with so many combos. I love it. I played as primarily a warrior on my PC playthrough, but I remember how satisfying been a mage was in this game, which is what a lot of games tend to miss out on. Also, stealth didn't feel that overpowered for once, as, while you could one shot normal creatures, been undetected the entire time was hard to pull off.  Amalur is not without it's flaws though, as their are many bugs in the game. Especially quest bugs, such as dungeons respawning as soon as a quest is finished...while still in the dungeon. This can potentially break certain quests or bring characters you've just completed a quest for to their untimely demise. Another bug I ran into during my PC playthrough is that audio would cut out during Reckoning mode, and stay that way occasionally. Only a restart seemed to solve this problem.  Another problem is that the main quest is pretty drab, The main quest has it's high points, but the entire premise is cliche (you're the only one that can save the world, you're the only one who can control their own fate, save us all!) But, I found the characters quite likeable, but I felt like they could of been fleshed out a little more. Amalur kind of feels like an MMO with the tons of quests but very little fleshing out of characters. It feels as though everyone is insignificant to you, which I guess they technically are if you think of the main quest plot.  What amazes me about Amalur the most though is how it can appeal to all sorts of players. When I originally played the game on XBOX all I cared about was the combat and the boss-fights and all the unique weapons and armors in the game. But when on my PC playthrough I took the time to learn about the story of each region, and the overall lore of the world. This made me appreciate the game a lot more, but made me realize that Amalur can appeal to both the casual and hardcore loremaster players that are attracted to modern RPGs.   Amalur somehow makes a blend of fluid combat, an expansive world and interesting lore to appeal to the adventures, fighters, and scholars in each of us. And it's  fantastic. 
5266	0	a	It's so bad -3/10
5617	0	a	It sucks i got this game along time ago and guess what the first minute of gameplay it sucked IT SUCKS it sucks at sucking thats how bad it is IT SUCKS 
6240	1	a	Amazing game. Would recommend to anyone. Dinos and guns, the childhood dreams.
5895	0	a	I would rather masterbate with sandpaper and glass shards than play this game for 1 more minute.
1698	1	a	This game is an overlooked gem. Fantastic gameplay, and immense campaign. The game is almost too large.
6184	1	a	This game is awesome i wish more people played. Id like to see more upgrades and modes develope.
4045	0	a	A long time a go, I bought this game, 4 pack, because my friend also request it, but it turns out only 1 who really want it, so i keep the other 2, for trading purpose, but that was a mistake, nobody want this game, time after time this game price is decreased from 15$ into 1$, that was shocking, THAT WAS A HUGE LOSS. well, if that wasn't crazy enough, this game is free to play now, GGWP 10/10 will never use a game as investation again                                                        
3201	1	a	I played it once before it was free for a few days i loved it.  What i like :  - You can be a dinosaur and â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. - You can â¥â¥â¥â¥ the dinosaurs and steal theire babies. - Has COOP and Online. - Can pick a few dinosaurs that are funny like the one that suicide bombs. - I like the graphic personally.  What i don't like :  - The fact that it dosn't have alot of players cause IGN rated it bad and same as the other.   I like this game but it has no one.. You could get it at a discount for 50 cents i got it for 73 cents i think. I reccomend it but don't buy it at the moment it dosn't have alot of players i want this game to be Popular again.
2939	1	a	After countless failed attempts, finally joined game. Lagged horrifically. Did nothing. Got achievement for being useless.  10/10 would be useless again.
3684	1	a	This game is really, really bad, but it's also pretty fun.
4784	1	a	I play this if im downloading a steam game but OMG ITS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AMAZING MUCH SIMPLE MUCH WOW
725	1	a	Yes. Beautiful grphics, excelllent gameplay. Excellent replay value, with a very refined skill system. 10 out of 10.
783	1	a	Sprinkled with Fae dust and magic, it's a beautiful single player rgp with the best combat mechanic of any traditional rpg style that I have found. Only loses out a little on depth of character. If you stay on the main quests it's a really rewarding and enjoyable 40 odd hours of sword play and spell adventuring.
764	1	a	The story is amazingly deep and rich and the gameplay is fun and rewarding.
6168	1	a	It's definitely worth 99 cents. Not many people play this game. I think every game I joined we had at least 2 bots on a five man team. It's fun for 99 cents, but after playing for a bit, I can definitely see why it is 99 cents. I don't know, give it a chance I guess. You might like it and you would add to the player base because it is lacking. I guess I will recommend this because it's not terrible, and you can't beat it for 99 cents.
3962	0	a	If you like hearing really loud beeping coming from your PC, piecingly loud, and enough to upset the whole family with no way of turning it off, your going to love this game.
2026	1	a	Was Good but Graphic was not URLGH
3901	1	a	Best. Full with actions. Recommended.
1428	1	a	The studio that created Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning may have gone out of business, but they left behind the legacy of a terrific game.  I first bought KoA for the XBox 360 a few years ago. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy playing in the living room where the console was (I don't keep a TV in my room), and didn't make much time to play the game despite having enjoyed it immensely.  When I saw it was on sale for Steam about a month ago, I decided to buy it.   I played it frequently over the following few days after the purchase, and fell in love with it all over again.  The main aspect that drew me to KoA was the combat system. The combat system is incredibly fun, and there's plenty of variation. Would you like to be a mage, a warrior, or a rogue? Well, you certainly can be any of those. Or you can be a combination of them. Want to be a warrior-mage with the ability to swing around a giant sword or throw chakrams and magic in enemy faces? Or a warrior-rogue that can sneak up behind people for stealth kills, but still turn into an armored killing machine in close quarters? You can be anything you want to be in the KoA world. The possibilites are seemingly endless.  There's also an entertaining skills system, which allows you to become an expert blacksmith (make your own weapons and armors, sagecrafter (gems for gear), or alchemist (potions galore).  Unfortunately, while this game had an engaging combat system and hours of game play to be had, there were some flaws.  You don't feel very invested in the lore or the characters. Quests are unremarkable, and you'll only do them for the XP most likely.  The game is easy, and doesn't take all that much skill either.  There's also a lot of glitches. I've had items stuck in my inventory that cannot be deleted or deposited. This sucks, since you only have a limited amount of inventory space.  There's little-to-no replayability. I love the fact that you can customize and respec your character however much you want, but this means that there's no incentive to repeat the game by making another character.   Despite these complaints, there are several hours of excitement to be had. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good RPG game. Just don't be too sad that there won't be a second.
2837	1	a	To be honest, this game is bad aesthetically. Its animations are rudimentary at best and the gun animations are out of sync but what do you expect from a game that costs 0.99 freakin' cents?! The gameplay is repetitive but somehow it keeps me playing for a few hours (I just go straight for the mech during the later waves) but again 0.99 freakin' cents! I recommend this game solely because of the price. The game is fun with some friends and you owe it to yourself to try it out. It isn't the best looking game but it is a hell of alot of fun once you get the hang of it.  PS: There is microtransactions in the game but only for cosmetic items so if you are one of those people who love buying virtual items using real life money... go ahead nobody is stopping you (or you could buy the items to support the developers ;-) ).
5128	1	a	this game is awesome enough said
5396	1	a	I've never shouted 'WHOOOOOOOO!' so much while playing a game.    Ever.    10/10.
5680	1	a	I want a refund (most of people won t understand)
2099	1	a	This was a game I expected to be a 5/10 and ended up being 10/10. Great story, fun game play, and doesn't pigeon-hole you into one style of gameplay. You won't regret this purchase.
2184	1	a	If you like action RPGs this is a must buy. Great story, good graphics &amp; animation, the dlc's are quite good as well (especially the Giant one). A bit on the easy side, so if you are a veteran aRPG player crank up the difficulty to hard at the start.  If you are a completist, it will easily take you 100+ hours to complete everything. Well worth the money. Nominated for the hipster game award, e.g I loved this game before it got an award.
2626	1	a	in this game, I used a jetpack to fly up to a t-rex's head, and hit it in the face with a lightsaber. and its usually 99 cents! Does anything else need to be said?
1161	1	a	Great storyline and lots of fun. Graphics have a certain charm to them, though I feel they area remniscent of World of Warcraft's art style.
6305	1	a	As â¥â¥â¥â¥ing silly as this game is I love it! The multiplayer action is fun and combo kills are rewarding and hilarious.   If you like L4D/L4D2 than pick this game up.   If you like killing tons of Dinosaurs from Tiny to Small get it!   If you don't want to disappoint Jeff Goldblum BUY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINO HORDE!
2162	1	a	Fantastic Game, one of those games that kind of got lost in the fray, but well worth a play. It plays like an MMO with fantastic Combat and a huge Story!
6210	1	a	IDFC why it have just 36/100 but its fun as hell...
4868	1	a	Selling gift of this game, invite me, we will make a deal! :)
2612	1	a	This game is awesome fun with friends, would recommend this game to anyone.
5239	1	a	Ad a campaing
915	0	a	Just wanted to play single player and offline and yet needed to jump through EA hoops to make an online account for a game on Steam...
2176	1	a	This is one of the best hidden gems out there. Combat is amazing and the world is bright and beautiful. Character customization is on par with other games in its catagory, but gameplay surpasses most others.
1702	1	a	This game for some reason cought my attention when it was announced, i actually purchased it at full 60 dollar price (pre-order) I played a fair ammount of this game due to its fantastic combat system and mechanics. I spent hours playing this game just killing mobs because it was so satisfiying, the story was not bad either sometimes it felt awkward and wierd but it had great story telling and writting. This game felt like what i wanted the fable games to be but better, for 20 dollars its more than worth it and if it goes on sale you should at least give it a chance.
5603	1	a	Tank you so much for my refund
3312	1	a	This offers a wide variety of dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus, Raptors, T-rex, Triceratops and many more for you to play as or against. Which is neato  Obviously you'll pick and play as the dino master race though, rather than dumb humans.  Overall dino scores: Includation in the game: 10/10 Looks: 7.5/10 Sounds: 3.8/10 Animations: 9/10
480	1	a	Don't let my low game hours fool you. I played this game for over 100 hours on my xbox before I wiped it. [Slight Spoilers]  Pros: +This game lets you play whatever build you want to do.   -&gt; Do you want to be a Mage and surprise people by slamming them to the ground with a massive warhammer? Do you want to play a Rogue who uses Daggers for assassinations but can hold her own in normal combat by wielding a Longsword? Do you want to play a Warrior who's only goal is to destroy people in insane combos with a sword that's twice their size? If you answered yes to any of these, please keep reading.  -&gt; Each class has a set of weapons and armour associated with it, as well as abilities. A Rogue, for example, is built on skill points invested into Finesse and uses light/medium armour that gives bonus critical hit damage. Rogue weapons are the Bow, Daggers, and Faeblades. Their abilities are varied between sustaining mana to apply poison damage to all of their weapons to raining arrows from the sky.  -&gt; The Warrior class is built on skill points invested into Brutality and can use Longswords, Greatswords, and Hammers with the heaviest armour that improves damage resistence and blocking ability. Their abilities vary from an adrenaline surge to deal massive damage when close to death to lifting all surrounding enemies into the air and slamming them all down.  -&gt; The Mage class is built on skill points invested into Magic and can use Staves, Septres, and Chakrams with Robes for armour that help improve mana regeneration. Their abilities can vary from chaining lighting to summoning a meteor to crash down on enemies.  +Gives the middle finger to restricted builds with the Destiny system.  -&gt; You are not set to one way of playing the game. Just purchase a reset from a Fateweaver and suddenly, you can rebuild your character in their entirety! Go from a Mage in robes with a Staff and Septre to a hybrid Warrior/Rogue who uses a Hammer and Faeblades!   (Keep in mind that there are many abilities to each class and you can do more than one class, or even all of them at once if you wanted. When you level up, read up on everything in your abilities tab and decide how the game should work for you.)  +Super satisfying stealth gameplay.  -&gt; Say you were spotted by a Jottun (a reverse Dwarf as I like to call them.) You can teleport through them, throw a smoke bomb down, jump on their back from stealth, and stab their neck to oblivion only to backflip off as you watch them bleed out. It's not just the massive enemies that are satisfying to stealth kill! You can sneak up on a Bandit and in quick succession you can trip them, making them land on their back only for your character to cover their mouth and stab their chest. The sneaking mechanic itself is a little bit wonky but oh my gosh it's still amazing to assassinate half of a Tuatha scout party and have the last few left â¥â¥â¥â¥ talk you only to get torn to bits by open combat; speaking of which, my next point is close to this one.  +Fluid combat system.  -&gt; My favourite build was on my character named 'Lorabella.' She was a Warrior/Rogue hybrid that used a Longsword and Daggers. In the span of a minute, she can roll behind an enemy in stealth, backstab them, and immediately turn to the other enemies that spotted her afterwards. From here she can toss a smoke bomb or use an invisibility potion to get more stealth kills, or she can hold a weapon's attack (you can only equip two weapons at a time) and use the charge ability to launch herself at the nearest enemy, starting an attack combo which kills them quickly. After that, she can block with her shield at the right moment to deflect an enemy's attack and turn it into a combo to kill them quickly. I could go on and on about how many different ways you can play the same game and still be satisfied, but I will spare you from that.  +Fateshifting.  -&gt; In a tight spot? Too many enemies and you just want to go to the next area quickly? Want to get bonus XP for doing what you already do to kill enemies? Just do itâ¢  +Fast Travel!!!  -&gt; Seriously who doesn't like this feature?  Some cons:   -The game can feel very repetitive.  -&gt; Bandits, Fae, some Gnomes here and there, Jottun, Etten, Spiders, Kobolds, and so on. There's not much for diversity in enemies to face, some are just slightly different reskins of the base creature that does something different. See: Kobold Savages are Kobolds that throw their spears instead of try to poke you with them.  -&gt; A lot of the game's quests are a variation of 'go here and kill these things for me' and while the combat system is very fun, there's only so much that can be done before it feels like a chore.   -Short story.  -&gt; Excluding the time spent running to the new locations, the Faction quests as well as the main quests feel a little short compared to the size of the world given to the player.  (Overall, I would say this game is absolutely worth buying. I haven't gotten to the DLCs yet though I do look forward to it! I hope this review helped!)  -KEM
1929	1	a	This is a really great game. Of my 16 hours playing this game, I have probably only done 2 of the main quests, because of the fact that there are so many fun side quests and side story lines to do. That includes the time I spent to beat the DLC, which I would say is worth the money spent on them.  The game allows you to chose your fate as you go. You earn skill points, which you can put into Might, Finesse, or Sorcery. After putting a certain amount of skill points into those skill trees, you unlock fate cards, which grant you bonus perks that will help you with the skills you unlocked in the Might, FInesse, or Sorcery skill tree. The best thing is that they have 6 fate cards for each skill tree, that you unlock as you put more skill points into your respective tree, but you don't have to only put your points into one tree. They also have 6 fate cards for each of the hybrid classes: Might/Finesse, Might/Sorcery, and Sorcery/Finesse.  For certain quests, you will also obtain Twists of Fate, which grant you permanent bonuses which could include extra XP, more health, more physical damage, etc. As you progress through the game, you get more of these, which all stack, so you become more and more powerful as you do quests.  The actual gameplay is great as well. It is a Hack 'n Slash sort of game where you can string together different combos that you unlock from the skill trees. It is also a Button Masher, but I like that about games, so no complaints from me.   The Story is interesting so far, but from what I said, I haven't played too much of the main story, just because of the sheer vastness of the side quests. I mentioned that I played the DLC, but there are so many other side quests and factions excluding the DLC. The game allows you to venture off as soon as you finish the tutorial area, and you are free to explore and do any side quests you want before playing the story.  The graphics are pretty good, but not amazing, and the voice syncing is kinda iffy, but the voice acting itself is really great.   The game is also somewhat easy to play, so I would suggest playing it on the hardest difficulty in order to have a decent challenge.  Overall, I would rate this game a 8.5/10, a must get for any RPG and Hack 'n Slash fan alike.
1683	1	a	I love this game. It is really fun. The combat is smooth and engaging. The world is absolutely beautiful. The weapons are interesting. I have never seen any other RPG that allows you to use Chakrams as a weapon. I would give this game a 9.5/10. It's not absolutely perfect. But I love it nonetheless. Definitely would recommend it to any fan of RPG's.
5260	0	a	I hated the first ten minutes of it.
5909	0	a	This was the launch title for the Ouya but got ported to steam by mistake. Please write the Ouya company to refund the buyers.
756	1	a	Skyrim with a less open world and infinitely better combat
2309	1	a	I got ripped off, I spent 1 dollar to buy it, now it's free.
4304	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥
3079	0	a	99c? Not worth it. Atleast I saved 14$ with the sale. After it I bought 14 packs of sour skittles with the other 14$ I burnt my mouth. That experience was better than this game. The game -1/10 the skittles 11/10.
3195	1	a	Wow This game is Really good, it only needs a tune up on the visuals and maybe a couple more classes. and boom HALO for 1 doller+ jurasic park.
3806	1	a	Spawend and a Dinosaur immediatly bit my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. 25/24 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ing have my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ torn off again.
5264	1	a	THis game is so awsome! You can even be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaure!
1660	1	a	played on another console and enjoyed most of what came through, so i decided to buy it on stam
4704	0	a	One of the worst games I've played in a while. Worth about $1. Maybe. Player has one life and that's it. When you die you lose ALL progress. Every weapon you purchased, every augmentation and you start over at the beginning of the game. That's honestly worse than the arcade games I used to play in the 80'S. At least with those I could put in another quarter to continue.
4207	1	a	this is such a awsome game but i wish the performance for it would be better on my laptop :x -highly reconmmend dont worry about the meta score its false the developers are doing a awsome job adding new stuff to the game so far ; 0
3279	1	a	Fast, fun, and infinitely better with bros
3475	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
1981	1	a	good, exoansive world with lots to explore and loot galore! Still gets old after a while.....I put it down before finishing the main quest.....
1644	1	a	Seems quite nice. Large open world, craft system, and other nice things that I would not explicitly state here to avoid potential spoilers. The game has its spirit. If you liked Gothic series - this is The Game!
3155	1	a	It's fun. Pure, simple fun and the developers are really cool guys whose devotion really payed off.
470	1	a	A review for this game may be pointless now. But I feel I need to praise this game for the immense enjoyment I got out of it since purchase. I will say three very positive things about this game.  1 Combat balance: While it is true this game is super easy past level 20 or so, the 'balance' I am talking about here is the balance between warrior/mage/rogue play styles. Unlike many other fantasy type games I've played, where your mage character usually gets much less choice in equipment compared to warrior/rogue types, here in this game, mages have the equal amount of variety in both weapon and armor selection, and some of the mage weapons are the most interesting ones I have ever played in any game. Reversely, in many other fantasy games, while warrior and rogue characters got more choices in equipment, they got shafted in spells they can use, this is again not true for this game. The rogue and warrior have a lot of interesting abilities they can cast around just like mages. This balanced playing style makes all three schools and any combination of the three feel refreshed and extremely fun for the majority of the game. And if you are like me who feel mages should have as much choice in equipment as other characters you are certainly going to love this game.  2 Art style: Kingdoms of Amalur is probably the most gorgeous game I have seen for a very long time. While many mordern games may have better 'graphics', they don't necessarily look any prettier. I am in the camp that firmly believes a good art design and style is more important than graphics and constantly find games from 1990s look better than games released in the past 10 years. And while the very particular bright and colorful art style of this game may not be for everyone, it is definitely the preferred style for me. And the game maps is carefully designed so you end up in many majestic positions in game to appreciate the view. Each major city in the game is grand and elegantly beautiful, each region has its own unique charm while all look amazingly appeasing all the time. In summary I think the art style is perfect in this game, if you love it at first sight you will love it for the remainder of the game.  3 Sound track: While not many of the soundtracks stand out on their own, the magic thing here is that each of them goes along perfectly with the scenary. Good soundtrack in video games enhances the atmosphere and by that standard each music piece in this game is considered superb. Whether if it is charm, grandeur, danger or mystery the music in this game brings the mood out perfectly.  To sum up, this is one of the most fun and beautiful game I have played in a long time. I hope whoever read this review can enjoy it as much as I do with this piece of epic gem.
2568	1	a	Just buy it
2917	1	a	Why spend $10+ on a game you will play for a few hours and quit. This game is only ~$0.99 and you can easly put 100+ hours into this game. Best bang for you buck end of story. Love this game. Highly recomended!
6394	1	a	Fun and alot of bang for the buck, not saying that it is good compared to the price, but good in general!
6095	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!    Too much to read?   Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   *this game in a nutshell  Community Created Artwork for ORION: Prelude By: Grayscars (original artwork uploaded by Grayscars!)
2618	0	a	Don't spend a penny on this game, the servers are terrible, the graphics leave much to be desired, the attack animations are non-existent. Did they even try? It's good for a short while, but never leads up to your hopes. Please spend your money elsewhere.
6081	1	a	79 pence, it's actually a good game!
4678	0	a	This game is full of glitches and problems and should be labelled early access with a disclaimer. When I shoot, I don't see bullets coming out of my gun and when I use a vehicle turret the screen just shakes, with nothing coming out of the gun. It somehow still does damage to the dinosaurs though. I would not recommend buying it, even at the price of $0.75 unless you just want to get the trading cards or something.  I was wondering how the game got a rating of 'Mostly Positive', but after looking at several other comments, I found out that this game has been removed and re-added to Steam several times due to terrible ratings, so I wouldn't expect long-term support for this game either.
862	0	a	I would like to give this game a positive review. For all the good points, please go read any of the many positive reviews. I agree with most the other reviewers' points concerning sound, combat, UI, etc. There are two reasons this gets a thumbs down from me. 1) Remapping keys doesn't work. Well, it does, sort of. You can add new keys to binds, but you can't remove the old ones. The default key bindings don't go away when you make new binds, and there's no way I've found to fix that, and if you bind a new function to a default-bound key, you get the default bind plus the new bind. EG, by default SHIFT is used for blocking. If you bind sprint to SHIFT, it will now block and sprint, mutually exclusive functions since you can't move while blocking. Yeesh. And yeah, 'block' is on the SHIFT key and sprint is on the CTRL key. Double yeesh. You know what games use SHIFT for sprint? EVERY OTHER @#$% GAME EVER MADE. Fortunately you can use a controler, which is the option I went with, rather than messing with decades of muscle memory. The second reason I'm thumbs-downing this game is because, on Windows 10, on certain boxes, it crashes to desktop randomly and without warning. A search of the net led me to a horde of disappointed gamers with the same issue. The usual tricks, running in compatibility mode, disconecting peripherals (the game goes loopy if you've got a graphics tablet plugged in) didn't help me, and since the devs are no longer, there will be no patches. I'd hoped, in vain, for a 3rd party patch, but couldn't find one. From what I have seen during my anywhere-from-five-minutes-to-an-hour-before-crashing game sessions, the game looks great. It would be nice if it was playable.
1235	1	a	What a surprise of a game. A bit of a gem.
761	1	a	Nothing earthshattering or unique, but definitely a game to pick up if you are into RPG's. Not a bad game, especially if you pick it up on a steam sale.
1087	1	a	This was a really great game! The combat system doesn't have a steep-learning curve and becomes thoroughly enjoyable once you do. This game was originally going to be an MMORPG, which is why the world is so large and the quests are so 'MMORPGish.' If you're like me and find yourself soloing through MMORPGs (and confined to PUGs for dungeons and such), then you'll really like this game.   Pros: Great combat, good story, difficulty scales well. Cons: Sluggish story parts in the beginning, quests in the middle can be tedious, crafted gear can out-class loot at the end if you max out crafting early.
41	1	a	RPG with poker mechanics. I hate poker.  Why not rummy mechanics? 7.5/10
3070	1	a	Fun and great to play with friends
616	1	a	Amalur is a well-polished game with it's base game being extensive, easily offering up 40+ hours of gameplay and up to 70+ if you explore all side quests. Its colourful, with well scripted dialogue, some unique combinations of standard fantasy concepts without being too aggressively unique, and placed an interesting spin on the undying character (with an idea as interesting as Assassin's Creed's Animus). However it fails to maintain interest during the late game as quests and challenges become all too easy, leading up to a disappointing ending that would have been far more interesting if it had more impetus. Boss fights are also poorly executed with a variety of standard RPG tactics being utilised, and no unique inventive ways to challenge the enemies provided. Many of the Bosses attacks, have been done in previous games before, not a problem if you're new to the genre, I suppose, but problematic for 3rd person action RPG veterans.  Amalur does provide an interesting levelling and skills tree progression, that allows for limited customisability, but does shine in its simplicity to understand, and ways to play around and discover effective combinations of skills from its three separate progressions. It's most definitely a fun game to play and waste a few days on, but won't offer much depth either in combat or narrative, so will always be a rather dismal second to its far more developed and innovative competitors.
4709	0	a	I remember playing this game on launch. Multiplayer was unplayable, singleplayer was barely playable. Since then it has come a long way, now I can call it a game without feeling too bad about myself. BUT saying it's a game now, doesn't mean it's good. Weapons sound like peashooters, graphics are washed out and ugly (this is what happens when untallented person gets hold on an Unreal 3 engine) and the general gameplay is not very entertaining. But it is much more stable now and you no longer see raptors spinning in place, so that's a step up.  There's just one more thing that needs to be mentioned: the game has changed it's title multiple times, it came from Orion: Dino Beatdown to Orion: Dino Horde to Orion: Prelude. Why is that? To escape the bad reviews it's gotten in the past? To trick people into thinking it's a different game?
1688	1	a	Righ now this weekend this game is on sale. Very rarely does it do so. I give it a 8.5 out of 10.  This is a vast open world rpg that is .....did I say vast. It plays and reminds me of vanilla WoW.  It has a deep and vast story. Decent combat system for melee. And so-so crafting. I highly recommend . The cons of the game are: Your toon has very little facial anamation in dialog scenes, camera angles in dialog scenes are sometime at odd angles.  
1969	1	a	Game is amazing you can be mage rouge warrior best thing about this in my opinion that you can still use magic :DDDDD this games 60$ but its worth it trust me!
696	1	a	one of the best RPs i've ever played. a big world, tons of quests .. looks great, and has its own feeling.
646	1	a	loved it on the xbox was able to buy at a good price with all the dlc on steam.
291	1	a	 A cohesive narrative and vibrant visuals bring the world of Amalur to life.   As I glance through some other user reviews I see a lot of positive comparisons to some of the leaders of the RPG genre: Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, Fable, Diablo and Torchlight. Personally I saw the closest resemblance to World of Warcraft with its visuals and questing system. However, this is no clone of a game. It has a unique identity that, in part, is made from borrowing successful traits from these other titles. What stands out most strongly to me about Kingdoms of Amalur is its narrative and world lore. It presents fresh ideas and throughout my 95+ hours (including 210 quests completed) with the game it always felt consistent, like the developers shared a unified vision of what they wanted this world to be.  Without discussing any specific plot points, I'll say that things begin on a high note and intrigued me right off the bat with a mystery surrounding who this character you are playing as is. It is a special feat in my mind to be able to have a personalized, voiceless protagonist that you are expected to project yourself into also have a predetermined, very interesting back story of their own. Too often these types of characters are just a boring blank slate.   My sense of progression through this world was wonderful. Your journey begins far from a major warzone and consequently you merely hear stories about it. As you advance closer you begin to see more immediate effects like sons and daughters gone off to fight or altered local economies. Eventually you'll see large refugee camps causing overcrowding problems and burned down towns before reaching the warfront itself. By and large, the settings you visit along the way stand apart from each other both visually and in local story. The exceptions to this are some of the dungeons that look and play very similarly, just with different layouts and quest objectives to fulfill. For a game already so big I think it would have benefited from cutting some of them out.  All dialogue is voice acted and of good quality. There is some noticeable reuse of voice actors among NPCs, but that is excusable for a game of this size. I would rather see good voice actors reused than bad voice actors brought in in greater numbers.  Combat, unfortunately, is just adequate. There isn't enough depth here to stay compelling throughout. There is a nice mix of weapon types that all control very differently, but you're likely to pick one or two early on and stick with them. Magic brings some cool spells to the fray but are very limited in number. Leveling up is a good, customizable system that does gradually add new abilities, but not enough to keep things from going stale. To be clear, I never got to a point of hating battles. However, a combination of things getting too easy by the end, the long length of the game and repetition of enemy types eventually sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of it. I will warn you that it is possible to become over leveled if you do all side quests as you find them. Google 'Amalur Wiki overlevel' to find a guide for avoiding this.  I'll wrap things up with a few more minor critiques. Loot is dealt out in such volume that inventory management becomes a chore (similar to many Diabloesque games). Despite this abundance of gear it was surprisingly infrequent how often I found something better than what I was wearing. Also, before long I had more money than things to do with it. I play most games on Normal difficulty, including this one, but didn't find enough challenge here so I suggest playing on Hard to most players. The orchestral score was competently produced but lacked the artistry to make it memorable.  Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fantastic, expansive experience that could have benefited from seeing its great length reined in a little bit.
1048	1	a	Very underrated RPG. Totally worth giving it a play through. Has plenty of hours of gameplay and even more with the DLC. Thumbs Up.
1103	1	a	game was fun, repetitive in a few places and i never finished it. But i dont believe that was the games fault, it was well put together and the classes felt different. Enjoyable 
3338	1	a	it was a real fun game! i enjoyed playing it!!
6291	1	a	I get so wrapped up when I play this game. I do wish there were more dinosaurs though, but I'm sure they will come along eventually. Also I wish there were more gun choices for primary. I love the SMG, it's my favorite. It's difficult even with a group of friends, lol. Those pesky little dinos &amp; the flying ones, ugh! But all in all, I REALLY like this game. Doesn't help that I got it for .99 cent ;)
5911	0	a	Finally got into a match and proceeded to fall through the floor multiple times
4024	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs
2101	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a great game that I would recommend to any RPG player. Yes there are some flaws, and storywise it is no Witcher III, but for most part, it gets the job done. Also, I have a problem of trying to clear every single quest and area before I move on, so some of the downsides I mention of the game is probably due to that.   Although I've played for 40ish hrs, I think I have yet to reach the halfway point. The beginning parts, when you start to get to know the world and explore, figure out enemy patterns, is a blast. I just couldn't stop playing. However going towards the middle the pacing slows down, and although I am sure the game will pick up its pace, I am very slightly bored. This is largely due to my play style, but there is also the big difference in quality of story between side quests, faction quests, and main quests. Main quests and faction quests have intriguing characters and somewhat novel plots (especially the faction quests since I've barely finished a few main quests. I also didn't find myself invested in the protagonist). However, the side quests do not have much substance and the effort to build a compelling story around the usual kill things or fetch things falls flat in those cases.  There is also quite some running to do even with the help of fast travel and me trying to optimize for running distance as best as I can (main reason I try to finish all quests before moving on). Almost all the 'dungeons' have a related quest, which is good and bad because on one hand there are no filler stages (but there are filler quests), but on the other hand it potentially makes you run around more.  This game is not supposed to be Dark Souls, so the following is just something to note rather than criticism. The combat itself is pretty good for a normal action RPG. But enemy patterns are a bit repetitive once you get a hang of it. Enemies usually have two main patterns and even with more patterns or stronger variations of the patterns, the attacks are quite predictable even when facing new enemies.
5685	0	a	its the same game it was befor hense the 59 pence, if u have a very bad pc, and u can not get good fps on most of them games out there, this is for you. but for 59p (GBP) u can not complain, be sure to see this on andriod lol their last market
1230	1	a	Like skyrim with colours, badass sh!t everywhere. Awesome weapons. Unique combat. The bosses are somewhat challenging, but that's where the challenge ends. Cool story. Good graphics.  BUT YOU CANT JUMP! ;_; 45+ hrs and I was 3/4 to the end of story.
2082	1	a	great game! mix between fable and skyrim
5871	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥...
1952	1	a	Not a great storyline, but the gameplay was quite satisfying!
6058	1	a	This game is by no means a sophisticated shooter. It is however a fun spray and play kind of game. Ideal for a LAN and to just shoot and drink a few.  Bang for buck, most definitely!
717	0	a	The combat is okay, but magic is straight up better than the rest of the trees (which are broken up by your standard warrior/thief/wizard) and while there is a 'lot of content' most of the side missions are repetative and boring. The people who give those quests are almost real people, but I feel like while there was all this time put into the world could have gone into more of the gameplay itself.  I can not recomend this for the current $20 price tag, and I wouldn't recomend it at a lower price tag. I would say there are probably better options out there, especially if you don't want to use a controller or are not a fan of bad camera.
1402	1	a	The game has a huge amount of immersion, the combat is interesting and engaging, and the customization is different from any other RPG I've played (and the genre dominates my collection of games). I paid the full price for this game when it came out, but if you can get it for a lower price now, absolutely do it.
4820	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
400	1	a	Underated gem. Lots of fun, lots of weapons, lots of quests. It's an awesome game if you like dope fantasy RPG's.
2781	1	a	playing alone by yourself this game will be boring and you will regret buying it playing with friends however provides a really fun experience. this game is actually quite fun the leveling perk system is unique and gives you a nice rpg feel to it and wide variety and weapon types is also good ive been playing this for awhile and i find it fun reminds me of borderlands and halo almost with a good horde slapped on i play this with my buddies alot and we have a blast this is really fun if you have friends that are interested go for it you guys will have fun so far im enjoying it.
837	1	a	Killed everyone in every town. not in jail. im rich. IGN 10/10
3305	1	a	This game is amazing, tons of fun. fighting dino's with friends, and stabbing friends in the back with an t-rex egg in gungame. i really recomend you to buy it. a litle bit buggy but that doesn't really matter.
4170	1	a	Possibly one of the best Survival Genre games i have ever played
5080	1	a	good except I CANT CHANGE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CONTROLS PROPERLY. â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FIX IT. IM TRYING TO CHANGE SCORE BOARD TO SELECT BUT IT CHANGES JUMP TO SELECT
1640	1	a	Surprisingly a good game, but sadly not giving the recognition it deserves. The gameplay is really fun and the story is not that bad. Just got a negative light put on it due to EA and the capsize of the studio who made it.
6219	0	a	I've only been able to play 2 games. Almost every time I try to join a game it crashes.
4124	1	a	Metacritic's 36 is for a very early version of this, and is way too low, considering Dino Horde is as good as most of the popular FPS games on steam. It's like COD Zombies/Spec Ops + Halo Firefight + Turok.
3698	1	a	If you love Horde mode, and you love dinosaurs, get ready for the ride of nothingness, because this game is terrible.  EDIT: OK, it's currently a dollar. You can't NOT buy it for a dollar. You and 4 friends can get down for less than having 5 on it. You put FIIIIIVE on it. Dino Horde; get Steam Keys. You put FIIIIIIVE on it. Play it on that low end riiiig
5076	1	a	they changed the name 3 times now.
2494	1	a	Like this game came out of nowhere. It was truly outrageous. Phill Fish really knocked it out of the park. Cancelling Fez 2 was worth after he made this magnificent masterpiece. Truly the best game i've ever played in my entire life.  à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤
3002	1	a	A game so bad, it's good.  I bought a four pack of this for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles when it was on sale (90 cents a pop). Sent it to a couple of buds and started playing. There are so many mediocre elements in this game it's mind boggling.   LOOKS: At a glance the game looks kind of good. Until it starts to move. Animations are laughably bad, with characters running in comic fashion, kicking their heals against their butts as they run. Torso's not moving and turning as if on a swivel. Jumping looks equally terrible, with characters bouncing up into the air without bending their legs to push off. Dinosaurs movement is OK-ish if you do not count the bad AI creating what my friends and I ended up calling, 'Dino-trains'. A conga line of dinosaurs in all shapes and size, being kited across the battlefield as if connected to the player by invisible strings.  GUNPLAY: Weapons in this game are completely bland and unrealistic. From sounds to looks to feel. None of them stand out. Cross-hairs are obtrusive making aiming down site an awful experience. All gun sounds scream stock wav file.  BUGS: So many bugs, weird AI mess-ups, bad design choices (like having to run back and forth between a generator and the weapons caches in horde mode), clipping issues, getting stuck, spawning under the terrain. The list goes on and on.   GAMEMODES: PVP is a joke, with dinosaurs controlling like drunk trucks being driven by blind drivers. Horrible hit detection on their attacks and impossible camera angles making it even worse. There are so many invisible walls and clipping bugs in this game I started to wonder if the devs ever played their own product. Until I killed a dev and got an achievement (which was kind of cool).  This game has one redeemable game-mode, which is Survival (horde mode). This mode is the game's single saving grace. I wasn't expecting anything when I went in, but playing this with a couple of friends is a total blast. The constant upgrades in weaponry and vehicles between waves of enemies and their ever increasing size is just fun. Plain and simple fun.  Would I recommend this? The crazy thing is, yes, yes I would. But only if you can get it for a buck like I did. Spending more on this is just not worth it. Unless you're really into bad B-games and dinosaurs. It is good for a lot of laughs because of the over-the-top badness (is this even a word?), bugs and crazy physics. Survival mode is genuinely fun though. So at least there's that.
3206	1	a	If you enjoy FPS games and horde action games   Orion: prelude is for you. All you need to know  Kill dinosaurs. Survive. Kill more dinosaurs.
777	0	a	no jump / no auto run / messed up hot key system = fail for me  but if u dont care about those things then its a great rpg.
5209	1	a	it was a good game with freinds but alone its boring
2212	0	a	This game is okay, other than the mindblown fact that they released this game for purchased on steam without giving any serial code/keys to unlock the toolkit. If you guys are planning to buy it for self modding, just don't waste time.
6302	1	a	Think Tribes with dinosaurs. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, but it has the potential to become one of those games that get popular for being bad, a sort of cult following. Other than that, the game was poorly executed, IMO, but a nice idea
4016	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME! MUCH BETTER THAN DINO HORDE BEATDOWN! MUST BUY !   So people say that there can be zombies, Killer robots and Nuclear Bombs in Future Tech Warfare but... DINOSAURS!! HA!? Its Future Tech VS The Dinos . Humans Were weak against Dinos in stone age Now We stand on equal terms! Grab yer Gun And Friends And Kick some Dinos! I was playing yesterday And I punched A T REX when I was out of Ammo AND WOAH I KILLED IT! I PUNCHED A T REX AND IT DIED! THIS GAME IS EPIC! 3 AWESOME CARRIER ROLES AND LOADS OF DINOS AND IMBA GRAPHICS! I LOVE IT! YOU SHOULD TOO!
6005	1	a	This game got renamed a couple of times:  ORION: Protoype  ORION: Open Source  Orion: Dino Beatdown Orion: Dino Horde Orion: Prelude &lt;-- currently  But you know what they keep updating the game which is good to see from a developer. It doesnt feel like a complete game but then again what game does? It's almost like one of those games it's bad but it's so good. For one dollar its lots of fun. One these games that you have to try for a bit and play it once a week with friends. Its one of those coop games that you can just sit back relax and have fun. It's not a game where you can play hours and hours and scream at people for being bad. Not a competivie game. The game has aspects of Killing Floor and L4D with waves of dinosaurs. If you like those type games you will like this. People are friendly and its even better with friends.  Gave 4 copies to my friends so we can have a break from CSGO from now and then. And did I mention its only $1... like sheeeet.  Graphics: Its from the Unreal Engine 3. So it could be better.  Game Modes : Survial - Defend against wave of dinosaurs Conquest - Muliple Bases to Defend Vital - 5v5 PvP protect your base while destory the enemy base Capture the Flag - Capture the Flag Ramage - PvP Dinos Vs Carriers  Team Elimination - 5v5 PvP Team Duel - 5v5 Swords and Bows Free for All - Deathmatch King of the Hill - Machine Guns and Flamethrowers Gun Game Slaughter - Every 25 kills you are offered new weapon  1v1 Duel  FFA Duel Instagib
6176	1	a	This game catches alot of flak, I'm not honestly sure why it has such a low metascore, because personally I find the game to be a really solid co-op survival game. There's nothing outstanding about the game, but the jetpacks, vehicles, guns and grenades all work fine.   Load up the game with a few friends and this is a pretty good choice for come mindless shooting fun.
2754	1	a	I can't get enough of this game. I don't know what it was before but the Meta score is WAAAAAAAYYYYY off now. This is a great game. I got this game on sale and I love it so much I am buying in game Items just to support the developers!
4865	1	a	Yeah This game is great the graphics could be alittle better but im not complaining . if natural selection 2 and halo had a baby, this would be it (even though u cant play as dinos) overall awesome game
3709	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least.  Personal Rating: 2.5/5
2816	1	a	Hey, forget Evolve, buy this instead. It has assymetrical multiplayer, excellent co-op, different classes with leveling and perks, multiple different weapons, turrets, vehicles, and ridiculous fights.  It's really a lot of fun, and it's cheap! It's something you can play with anyone. Oh yeah and Workshop support? Yep.
1784	1	a	A bug just killed several hours of gameplay for me and possibly the game itself so...  This is sort of a love letter to role playing games. It follows many tropes and sticks to a familiar atmosphere of RPGs. If I was still a kid I would find the game way more entertaining because ultimately it does get tedious at its core.   The story is actually interesting and the narrative from individuals is lengthy and will tie into the overall story. Sometimes non-playable characters will even have new dialog unlocked by actions that involve other NPCs. Unfortunately even with a well known author penning each character's thoughts, their words become droll when they are essentially the same thoughts reworded for a different face.   The combat isn't as varied as I'd like but it is also an action RPG. Having a single button for each weapon and using timing to pull off combos sounds like a good idea for an ARPG. But because the different weapons don't chain into each other and the combos themselves are largely generic gameplay turns into pressing one button repeatedly to attack and then dodging or blocking when needed. The enemies movements are telegraphed and while this is generally a good thing in video games, the weak A.I. and terrible combat scaling makes every fight with less than 10 enemies routine. Most enemies fall into the same 'type'. The three most common types following the same lines as the player; rogue, mage, or fighter. Because most enemies share similar move sets and strategy the fights feel the same no matter where you are in the game. I was actually amazed when I had an enemy flee for the first time. Fortunately it was because they were under a bleeding status effect. Unfortunately even the weakest of mobs will attack you aggressively despite being killed in a few hits. Most boss fights play out like ordinary combat except that the game will throw more goons into the mix and the boss might actually be on a level playing field with you statistically.   The 'Reckoning' feature ties nicely into the lore but is so overpowered that I only saved it for bosses. Of course the meter fills fast enough that I could have used it frequently, I just never needed to.  If this game had less content, it might actually be better. But my overall experience from the game was really feeling obsessive about having more loot. This is a loot driven game and I frequently found myself staring at item stats in order to sort out the gems from the junk. Luckily you can instantly junk most items and mass sell junk items. Without that option this game would be unpalatable. Unfortunately the bug that killed the game for me was having several items stuck in my inventory. Worse than that, I've been carrying around 5 of Brother Til's books for most of the game and all they've done is sat there.   I'd like to end this by talking about crafting but I didn't really craft anything beyond basic gems. When I had the basic levels of all the crafting skills unlocked the weapons or armor I could make were nothing compared to what I could buy or find on a corpse. Fortunately all of those crafting items don't take up space.
5066	0	a	the game seems like its an amazing concept. but thats it. after 5 minutes in game i fell through the world 4 times, failed to buy guns, was thrown into a server with no explanation on the controls and was eaten by a dino twice. after which i figured out how to use my mic by going into options and was explained to by another newb how to buy guns. the next time i respawned i couldnt move or use in game chat. i havnt seen a game this buggy since i played CS 1.6 with a ping of 800 on dial up. the developers are just trying to boom support for their kickstarter which i hope they fail because they dont desserve to be in business with a game this buggy. i fear to even consider what it was 'before' they 'fixed it'   0 stars
2684	1	a	justawesome i just love blowing trexsbrains out in a airship and alson some multiplayer ffa action
5925	0	a	this game is built for labour
3228	1	a	Really good for the price. Actually really fun.
5739	1	a	this game is a very good game many fun i have had with other people meeting the community it's fun yeah buy it.
3483	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.
5843	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
460	1	a	Have just started and love it like a mix between the witcher and skyrim but far far better BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!
2935	1	a	The best co-op survival fps game ever! You like Killing floor? Halo? Evolve? You should try this one then! You pay only a dollar for a great unique gameplay that will combined with beautiful graphics and some personal system that include level, stats, achievements, etc. It's a profit to buy this w/ your friends ;) 9/10
2210	0	a	I will start with the improvements.   1. More NPC bands and treasure on the map making it easier to level up and makes the terrain map a closer feel to D2.   2. Boats  Now the fails between Older versions of D3 and this pile of poo.  1. The character info screen. Tab #2 to see my XP? It's the stat I look at most often. Wait... WTF! Tabs!?!?!?! The right click character info from the older D3 editions were closer to D2 (and better).  2. The 3 tier levelling process of your support units. Again these guys made changes where older D3 editions got it right. I don't want to dump that much combat experience into a disposable unit before he upgrades. 'Look! I only need to play 643 more hours before my squire levels to paladin'... Go die. This also makes it harder to have multiple well supported leaders, so Lambert has the paladin while your other leaders rock squires and knights.  Side note: Your characters that die in combat also gain experience... This felt strangely like cheating.  3. The smaller battle map. Either copy Heros of Might and Magic, or stick with static formation turn based combat like D2 and old classics like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. The smaller map makes it near pointless to move around and puts your ranged units and magic users in harms way like never before.  'Oh, Look! You got creative in an uninspired game'. Your creative efforts have gained you a hybrid, akin to the crap you take that comes out like you've been eating cheese for a month, but leaves your butt dirty like Taco Bell diarrhea.  4. The ranged/magic user unit's attack range has been limited (which was never a thing in any previous installment). Ranged units were weaker, but could hit anything on screen, so you never had to move them into melee combat, or off bonus tiles (in D3). This further weakens an already weak support unit. I assume this was meant to draw ranged units off the bonus tiles by having your melee units 'Run Away!'. Pro Tip: concentrate attack on bonus ranged/magic unit. They will not have that bonus after 1 =&gt; 2 rounds of combat. Limiting range of ranged units = EPIC FAIL!!!!
5375	0	a	trash. theif. don't play
468	1	a	The combat is plenty of fun...,but lacks any compelling dialogue or story (this skyrim excels in). And again, combat is lots of fun. Try it if you love your rpgs.
6228	1	a	Great fun. The concept of shooting dinosaurs is kinda ridiculous but the game is really fun. I like the different classes and the wide range of weapons and skills. The vehciles like the mech are awesome too :)
5638	0	a	I can't run it in offline mode steam!!!!
1322	1	a	One of my favorite action-rpgs of recent years. Lots of side quests, brutal combat, easy customization.
2353	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
365	0	a	Fun and dynamic combat-system with cringeworthy writing and uninviting corridoor maps tacked on in an attempt to create an RPG. The combat alone was engaging enough to play past the point where I started to hate the writing and claustrophobia was creeping in, but in the end I gave up hope that things would change and skill and gear progression made the fights too easy. A real let-down, this game, but I give it points for effort in the combat department. [4/10]
3619	1	a	this game is really fun, worth playing. totally worth it 
1995	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing you should get it if its on sale and like rpgs
2037	1	a	This game is, simply put, incredible. There are a few flaws, yes, but everything else is so brilliantly done that you can quickly forget those.  Pros: Good graphics. Great character balancing. One of the rare games that if you want to make a mix between the various skill trees it lets you do it, and gives you unique bonuses as well. Good battle system. Haven't played much of fighter or mage, but the rogue's combat abilities are very good, and the combo system is easy to use. Great story. Hard to give any example without spoiling anything. Factions. There are a lot of factions, each with its own main plot and side quests. Crime system. The crime system is very similar to what Fable had. Did a crime? No money to pay bounty, don't want to go to jail either? Get out of town and let things settle down. You can also turn off safety mode, to kill any civilian in cities (also similar to fable) Map size. In my current (and most advanced) game, I have less than 1/4 of the map explored, with over 10 hours of gameplay. And most of all... Quests. So many quests. Some very trivial, being as simple as going to see someone and talking to him, some much more elaborate and hard, such as clearing an area of all Ettins.   Cons: In the case of the rogue, the sneak attack is not as relevant as you'd expect, due to the combat abilities you have. If you have the occasion (or want to challenge yourself), do try to kill a few enemies in stealth, but otherwise it isn't worth it. Travel on long distances if you don't have a fast travel can be long, as there is no other mean of transportation than running. Inventory system is similar (if not identical) to Dragon Age: Origin. 70 invetory space, each item takes one space, stackables take one space per stack. As I am someone that just loots everything, this can be quite a bother (especially at lower levels), and the price for backpack expansions are steep when starting.
238	1	a	Played this game on PS3 with 60h game time, now on PC with DLCs, hell yea the DLCs are so awesome and the game is just one of the best RPG i have ever played, the Design of the Characters, the Open World Feeling and so much fun in this game, its totaly worth to buy this game :)
5304	1	a	Very Good Game,Amazing Multiplayer. 8/10
5536	1	a	Its a fun and cheap game, bought it for my friends
679	1	a	Its like skyrim without skyrim 7/10 was not op enough
4425	1	a	  Worth a dolla if u like killing hundreds of dinos + want trading cards and achievements! Fun to play with ur buddies
5881	0	a	In light of the recent scandal.  The first rule of playing the victim is trying to make people sympathetic, being a â¥â¥â¥â¥ doesn't help.
2207	0	a	If you enjoyed Disciples 2 i would stay away from this one...
4899	1	a	So I tried the free week with this game, its worth a dollar, but I wouldn't pay much more because the dev's are double dipping. Their selling you a game for $14.99, and than charging you for content in game using their in game shop.  Gameplay is really fun, it plays like a really big mod from a game like halflife 2.....its main downfall is lack of players really, thier co-op gameplay is pretty interesting, it feels like a mix of tribes and halflife 2  If you haven't tried this one and are bored, the co-op is worth a try.
3080	1	a	Although the animations are eh, and the movement is kinda laggy/jittery-ish, it's still a pretty fun game to play with friends. I had fun playing it :D
2397	1	a	BEST GAYM EVER JHHRURHURADKAD :melon:
6201	1	a	pretty fun coop game, great value. could be better graphics (reminds me of Tribes) but the coop gameplay is fun. would not recommend playing offline solo.
1571	1	a	Having just finished the main story of this game i can honestly say that without a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Some may say that i clearly havent played that many but i guarentee that if you buy this you will not regret it.  The story for this game is unlike any that i have experienced, it is rich, full of life and constant twists and turns. The amount of side quests in this game is astounding! And the graphics although taking a more cartoony style look beautiful.  All in all if youre a fan of RPGs then buy this game. If youre a fan of great story lines buy this game. If you are a fan of games BUY THIS GAME!
1876	1	a	I am a little disappointed in this, not because the game was bad but because there won't be more. With just a few tweaks like removing the amount of running and more varied quests, this game could've rivaled The Elder Scrolls series. For what I paid during the steam sale it was well worth the purchase price. I haven't started the DLC quests yet but I just finished the main story and although it was a pretty generic story I still enjoyed it. The world that was created was really deep so I felt the story could've played more on some of the more intricate subjects. If you like controller enabled games this one is for you, the controller settings and the keyboard and mouse were both good (although on controller you have less spell hotkeys).  8/10, pick it up during a summer sale!
138	1	a	I spoke to a tree about mortal politics
4967	1	a	This game rox
5440	0	a	So if you kinda have a old computer do not get this. If you have a realy old computer definetly dont get this. I dont know if you have a brand new computer maby get this  but its probely not worth the mony
6177	1	a	Its has dinosaurs and Nice VEHICLES what else can you ask for a game!!
5677	0	a	Bought it for 39 cents. Tried out refund policy. Got 39 cents back. No fireworks i didnt like it much :/ But what to expect from such cheap game + when i saw microtransactions it lost all of its chances.
891	0	a	Get outta here.
1996	1	a	best game I ever played with better story, content and it was co-created by RA Salvatore, who did the story, what isn't to like. the continent you are on is at least 5 times the size of skyrim and has more interesting gameplay  30.7356t8391977646158746382832651236541934591436814 out of 1.12345678900987654321  but that is an estimate : )  defininetly worth every penny, and then some 
6086	1	a	This is not a good game, by any stretch of the imagination.  There's presentation and UI issues, the art assets are super bland, awful voice work etc.  But holy cow it has space marines shooting dinosaurs.  Get it when its on sale, buy copies for your friends. Load up a server, fly around on jetpacks shooting raptors and stegos with guns and mechs and tanks and VTOL aircraft.   Just have a good old time.
5489	1	a	Awesome as â¥â¥â¥â¥, says this Massive Duck
929	1	a	Amazing game, I didn't enjoy some RPG so much for a long time. The animations are beatiful, cartoonish graphics will not get obsolete by time and there is so many utility details, that will make your gameplay much more enjoyable.   In this game, you can truly see that responsible people (developers) made it with focus on player base, unlike Fable 3 - which was destroyed by utterly poor design decisions and which is in overal 'very similar' to this game. But those 'minor' decision makes this game so awesome in a large scale and also so much more 'different' compared to recently mentioned 'Fable 3' game.   If you liked Fable: Lost Chapters', you will like this one also. Good pick for good money, get it!
1302	1	a	Fantastic game although it's heaps short. It's not open world like Skyrim and other RPG's but it certainly is addicting and it provides a great overall gameplay experience. It's only flaw is that is is SUPER easy so I suggest you play on hard if you actually want a challenge. Best RPG I've played so far, 10/10
1628	1	a	[I'll add more to this review once I play a bit more] If you have played Fable(1,2,3) then this is the game for you. The freedom to do anything in this game is just unbelivable. The character creation scheme could of been better (IMO), but overall still lots of stuff to customise your hero/heroine. Tons of side quests (maybe like 300 or so) to go run around in the open world.
706	1	a	Fantastic game. Sad that it will never get a sequel. The game studio was really talented, it just got ruined by poor marketing from EA Games.
3325	1	a	This game is awesome! That is the truth. There is a bit of jank to it though, but the developers appear to be actively updating it and ironing it out. What is already here is awesome. Like how Fall Out New Vegas was awesome, jank and all. The game is a blast to play. All games types have a real sense of progression to them and a rewarding upgrade/weapon/vehicle system to keep it changing as you go. The augmentations system alone gives you the ability to customize your game on every life or level if you want. This game is great. Get eaten buy a T Rex or the other one at least once. You gotta do it. 10 outta 10.
4339	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
5626	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
3952	1	a	I love broken pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3624	1	a	Mmmmm i wouldnt say it's bad.. but i wouldnt call it that great either... servers need more workin on... other than that if u like hordes and hordes of crazed dinos chasin u then be my guest and get this game
514	1	a	great game
3105	1	a	its good 
194	1	a	Probably the #1 under-rated RPG in a very long time.
179	1	a	Overall, the game is pretty good. The main problem is that it's too easy.   With Lorestones and unlockable Destinies, there are no shortages of permanent bonuses. If by the end of the game you have fewer than 30 bonus mods not related to your equipment, you must be doing a speed run.  Each area apparently has a level range, and the levels of enemies get locked to your level within that range the first time you visit the area. There are no areas where the minimum level is 40+, meaning after you get to a certain point, leveling further becomes impossible. Luckily, 40 is more than enough to become totally invincible, especially with the Dead Kel DLC.   With some clever blacksmithing, you can end up one-shotting many foes, and bosses will take no more than 4 hits.   Also, the map you have is magic. For most quests, they ask you to go somewhere and find something or kill something, and the map knows exactly where it is, even if you haven't been there before. The Lost Treasure Of Meropis is a quest to find a bunch of relics sunken in various bodies of water. Surprise, surprise, it's not a 'lost' treasure for long because your map knows exactly where all the relics are. This happens in 95% of quests. NPC's will be totally amazed that you found the lost journal of a long-dead scholar or the bandit-in-hiding.  This aside, The world is pretty large and decently well-rounded. Some of the quests are pretty interesting on their own, but most will seem silly. With a little work, your character will soon be the undefeated champion gladiator, the archsage of the largest group of mages, the king of a bunch of immortals, etc. Sadly, no NPC will know you are more than one of these at a time.  The fighting system is pretty good overall but again very biased in your favor. With the exception of certain bosses, no regular enemy has more than 2 or 3 attacks, many of which are staggered so you have time to react. The variety of enemies is lacking considering the size of the world so you can quickly learn how to deal with them all and then demolish everything standing in your way.  The storyline is alright once you properly understand how literal the characters are when they talk about fate. The Fae are pretty much stuck in an eternal loop of rebirth and redoing the same thing as last time, and knowing that they are doing it. The other races have fate issues too and your character seems to be the only exception. All things stem from this.  From what I've seen of Skyrim, this game seems very similar to it, except this version seems to be more rushed in it's development and a little buggy.
6124	1	a	Cmon man what are you even looking at the reviews ? You can shoot waves of dino's !!! This game is simply a good game and it's .99 just buy this XD
5788	0	a	I got this game when it was called Orion: Dino Horde. It was garbage then, and it is garbage now. Do yourself a service and don't get it.
1098	1	a	This game had a mixed a God of War meets Fable, and I simply loved it!!! It's a must buy and would highly refer this to any friends. Hunting for the secret armors alone was a blast and encountering each new enemy type and learning their patterns to counter was a blast. Graphics were colorful along with enviroments rich and plush. Weapon customization alone was amazing, having specialties from Chakara Blades to throw to hammers to smash each one having its own ability. I think this game didn't get enough credit it was worth!!
1418	1	a	This game is very good. If you played the demo and were turned off by the controls I have good news. The game itself so far is pretty awesome. The controls work very nicely on a mouse and keyboard (and I also believe gamepads, but I like mouse/keyboard). The graphics are nice, the combat is very nice, the loot is cool, story is nice, side quests, and exploration is cool as well. Two thumbs up. :)
2651	1	a	Got this â¥â¥â¥â¥ when it was free and went hard as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Forgot to buy it when it was 99 cents and got â¥â¥â¥â¥ for it but I have it now and I gotta say, it's complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't get me wrong, it's fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥ but the spinosaurus is a mean â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. He'll eat you for breakfast and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you out right after. He eats those little â¥â¥â¥â¥ing raptors like a fat kid eats cheetos he found under his man-boob flabs. His health shoots up faster than a meth addict in a truck stop bathroom. The stego is an OG and is a pretty cool guy. The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trike likes to hang out with the stego and act like he knows what's up but he's really just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ nigguh. The damn crocidile thing is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ other than be in the way if you're playing as a dino. Now you may think I'm just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, but your opinion doesn't really matter you loser. All-in-all I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. Really good price for a really good game.
2279	1	a	i mean... i dunno it's alright, it's kind of god awful in a hilarious broken buggy kind of way. But it's a dollar for a few hours of super cheap fun. You have to pay more for a can of coke than this game, and though coke is tasty and refreshing, this game costs less money and therefore is better than coke.
3985	1	a	Best Developers ever! Game can't fail, only developers can! 11/10, best game for only 0,5 - 1$
1461	1	a	I love this game, If you like the game Fable The Lost Chapters You would love this game. It gives the same feel as Fable Lost Chapter did back in the day.
578	1	a	fun game get lost in it sink hours into it
4889	1	a	10/10 would have rocks thrown at me by T-Rexs again
5392	0	a	only played it for about 20min before i deleted it. bad level desgin bad game play. only good thing was the graphics. it was 0.99 but even if it was free i'd ask for a refund
1953	1	a	If you are a fan of RPG/Action/Adventure type games, this one is an absolute must-have!  I might be overly biased, but this is the first game in years that I haven't been able to put down. Every aspect of this game, from the lore to visuals to voice acting is so carefully crafted, that you cannot help but lose yourself in it.  It is quite an experience...
4679	0	a	Before I begin, I would like to point out that I can run Far Cry 3 on high graphics.   This game could be great. It already would be great, if not for one killer - fps. On low everything, this game lags like hell, and my gun appears to be hovering in my hands, which often go through it. Also, there are no tutorials. I know you can probably find them online somewhere, but it would be nice if there was an optional one you could participate in if you needed to. I really tried to enjoy this game, but the fps, which was probably about 7, ruined my experience.   When they fix the fps problems and major lag, then, and only then, will this be a reccomendation.  It will be an awesome game when that happens. But for now, it is terrible.
709	1	a	5/5
5599	1	a	Hainanese Chicken Rice Never Tasted This Good Before?! Good Price, Kappa Gamers.
1897	1	a	Lots of fun to run around in and explore. Just wish there was some level of co-op.
2637	1	a	This game is more of a 'so bad it's good' kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons.   Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.  In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.  All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.
1648	1	a	Like a mix of Fable, Skyrim, Darksiders, and World of Warcraft.
985	1	a	Utterly and completely AMAZING! Totally worth the money!
2052	1	a	Good game although at some point the (many) side quests become uninteresting.
5860	0	a	Just no... DonÂ´t waste your 1$ ! 
441	1	a	Extremely fun, so mad they weren't able to fix some things like leveling and even make another. If i was a millionare i would honestly try to get this game back on whole new levels.
3478	1	a	Addicting - Not sure if it is because of the different achievements - the fact that you get to shoot Dinos , the fact that you get to drive vehicles over dinosaurs.. or what ... but it is definately addicting.
2832	1	a	so fun and addicting you upgrade and kill dinos! i judged it at first cause i thought it sucked but played and i loved it
1215	1	a	I say things like fallout, skyrim, borderlands, or other really good RPGs are my favorite but the truth is as a realization I've just had. Kingdoms of Amalur (KoA) is by far my favorite game.  The company that produced this game had little expirence when they were founded, but persued there dream and made there amazing dream game!... But guess what. They went backrupt and had there company taken by the state of rhode island. So if you're looking for a game that will continue with a sequal. I suggest you leave now.  This game features a third person, button mashing, combo breaker, combat system. The map is extreamly large, has hundreds of thousand of little hidden treasure spots. It has more uniquely designed weapons and names then any other game has. It incorperates a nearly flawless blacksmithing system which is my personal favorite. Amazing worth while DLC, and one of the few story lines ive never been able to predict (Note: I predicted most of mass effects series story) They multitudes of characters you create is amazing. You can make a mage, warrior, rogue or all three for all the game cares! Theres a lot of quests. Amazing effects. Good graphics, and mostly smooth gameplay. If the company werent bankrupt id suggest they fix some of the issues when it comes to not being able to walk onto the ground when you're only a inch up on a staircase... and maybe incorperate a system which actually allows mods into the game considering It starts to get boring on your 9th playthrough. (I know this from expirence being on my 13th)  Anyways Id say this game is by far the best of its kind and I hope it makes you as happy as it has made me. Ill make a short pros and cons list to sum it all up!  Cons: Despite having a Havok engine, this game pretty much says â¥â¥â¥â¥ you when you attempt to jump so much as a inch. (unless its a designated area to leap to the ground) The company is bankrupt. So if you fall head over heels for this game like me you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed asking for a sequal. Moddable = False.  Pros: Good gameplay (Combat, running/walking, Fast Travel, Dialouge, Character Creation, Etc). Good Variaty (About 9 Weapons, 70+ Skills, High Level Cap, Lots of lore specific enemies, useful and useless lore items). Good DLC: Id rate Deadkel: 9/10 and Teeth of Narros 7/10. (Decent Stories, Repeating Combat) Very Clean (Almost No Bugs). Great Story (Lots of side lore and quests, Like game of thrones you cant expect most things) Detailed NPCs (Between designs and there story background, Id say 90% of NPC have some kind of backstory and quest)    BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  
520	1	a	amazing ten out of ten if your looking for an uncommen rpg to play.
2310	1	a	 ORION: Prelude  is worth a look. It sells for 0,79â¬. Iâd say the price is right. Iâd also say the price point is probably another move by the developer to try and earn back some brownie points. Itâs a fun little time waster and I can see it being a good game to play with friends over a few drinks. Glitching through a building you have just climbed on to might be funny then.
4841	0	a	Buggy, boring, and the same thing every level. Fun at first, but gets boring fast. Not worth the $1.  3/10
1721	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is simply a joy to play! The combat is smooth, fast, and fun. The storytelling is great and easy to understand. The amount of quests is nearly endless. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone, new or old gamer. The only downside of the game is the difficulty. Even on the hardest difficulty setting, the game still doesn't have much of a challenge.
4519	1	a	Steam Free-2-Play âORION: Dino Hordeâ event / 75% off sale
2730	1	a	Bad. Play it and see how bad it is. Bad.
6137	1	a	awwrrrsome LAN Party Game!    Check it out!
4271	0	a	I tried this game on a free week. It always attracted me because of the nice screenshots and the coop mode, but because of the previous failure from this developer, I always retained myself from purchasing it. I'm also an indie lover, and I can bear with bugs and underdevelopment if the game is actually good and fun, and this one looked like one such case from the conflicting comments of the players.  The reality is this game is not actually fun, but funny. I laughed so much when I played it, because if you can do anything wrong when making a game, you'll find it here. Even the graphics, that looked like the only thing that was made good, looks so weird because of the bad animations (or lack of in some case).  The gameplay is a lagfest, even with a low ping, and amazingly it also affects animations, that will lag aswell, making it look like an old cartoon, when animations were made with just 3 drawings repeated forever.  Nothing is fun here. The shooting, the driving, the walking around for miles to catch up with teammates, the lag, the animations, the gameplay.  Seriously, this game has potential, but looks like a v0.2 of an ongoing free project made by an amateur team. And, for now, even at 91% off for 0.99 euro is not worth the time spent purchasing, downloading, configuring and playing it.  Go buy a bundle with those money. The worst it could happen is you'll get five bad games instead of just one.
4647	1	a	so much fun for 1$! It is very awesome get it worth its worth the money
3128	1	a	I bought this game for 39 pence simply to extend my library and to have something to entertain me for about 20 minutes. What acctually happened was I spent 80 minutes having one of the most fun experiences in multiplayer gaming. The people I played with were extremley fun and helpful, no trolls or spams or anything like that. I only played the game with strangers but I imagine there is also more fun to be had with freinds. I'm about to find out actually, I just bought this game for three of my friends and we are going to paly it to death.  If I was to give this game a score out of 10 so far it would be an 8. I was happily surprised by this game.
4079	1	a	I don't own the game but I can write a rewiev. So I think it's a cool game and I give it a good rewiev.
2070	1	a	The greatest game i've ever played!! And honestly very addicted game too      10/10 i would like to collect more purple or yellow items
1390	1	a	Outstanding game. Reminds me of how charming the original fable was. Combat and magic system is top notch. Enviroments are nice but the cartoony style actually ended up grating on me a bit. I am more of a Witcher style RPG fan but this game was definitely worth the money. So weird that Curt Schilling's 38 studios made this, it's really good. Who knows what they might have made as a follow up. I hope someday someone buys the license and makes a proper sequel. Could be great.
4233	1	a	Played one game of survival...................... WHY IS THIS GAME ONLY 49 CENTS TAKE MY MONEY TAKE ALL MY MONEY! I have only gotten a chance to play the survival mode and what I saw was well worth the 49 cents and then some, I loved watching the T-Rex tear my teammates to shreds..... 10/10 would let them get eaten again
4604	1	a	They have a Turok reference in Achievements  15/10
1634	1	a	lots of fun
2734	1	a	I 1v1'd a T-Rex with a laser-cannon rifle
5540	1	a	right now as it stands the game is really good. It is a knock off of halo, however it is done really well.   Pros: Its just like halo, there are a ton of things to do. Endless replayabiliity, I have 124 hours into it and looking forward to another 124 easily. The dlc for this game is auto updated for you and always free. also for the price its unbeatable.  Cons: It used to be buggy but not anymore. you do sometimes get stuck in cliffs if youre jumping around on them, however that is fixed by just using the teleporter.  I 100% recommend this game to anyone, not just halo fans. Its a fun way to spend 100+ hours and not get bored with it.
2065	1	a	Immersive story and innovative combat features.
3194	0	a	this game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥
3730	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
3955	1	a	10/10 I love this game with a burning pashion, if you have 1$ i reccomend this game.
1016	1	a	I dropped a meteor on a bunch of dogs. enough said
724	1	a	It's just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ with terrible graphical fidelity, annoying character movement, poorly written plot, embarrassing voice acting, and repetitive and bland combat! 10/10
3621	1	a	This game doesnt even work :) turn off!
6011	1	a	this game is great for the price.
145	1	a	This is a sprawling, epic action RPG. There are three classes to choose from, might (fighter), finesse (rogue) and sorcery (wizard). It is extremely easy to create a pure character or a hybrid. Respec'ing your character is easy and you will find yourself doing this several times, if not for anything but to be able to purchase skills from an earlier trainer. I started with a pure melee character and took him to level 36. I played around with a hybrid melee/sorcerer/rogue, but didn't have fun. In the end I settled with a powerful rogue/melee hybrid that could barrage enemies with arrows from afar and mop up with blades afterward.  Combat is a mixed bag. It is essentially a click fest like many action RPGs. Even still it is rewarding. Loot is the end game and trying to find the right equipment will keep you going. Unfortunately, as with most ARPGs by the time you get a complete set of armor you have better non-set stuff. However, sometimes the bonuses gained with a full set overrides the slight decrease in protection.  Side quests can be annoying. Many are of the FedEx variety. It can be extremely frustrating to move from place to place delivering goods, or killing X number of beasts to collect your reward. There is a fast travel system that allows you to move from location to location as long as you have been there on foot at least once. This does cut down on travel time, but these FedEx quests are tedious. Since this is likely the only time I will play, I finished the majority of side quests. I did get bugged out of two and couldn't complete them. And a couple others I didn't do early and never went back to finish them. The quest system is easy to navigate and helpful markers show up pointing the way to your next objective.  In the end, I was finally glad to get through the game. The last levels are mobs after mobs standing in your way of the final battle. I did enjoy this game and can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good action RPG. There isn't a lot of depth in character development, but what is here is good.
4687	1	a	Its awesome and worth the money! I have not bought it but I will try to as soon as I get the money. I have this far only played it when it has been free.
1231	1	a	It has Demo, just download it and play. I do not Regret buying it
4914	1	a	catchy game!!!
3152	1	a	ORION: Prelude is great horde game. It is really unique style. I absolutly recomend it!
597	1	a	Back when this came out I played the demo and bought it for 360. Played the holy hell out of it. Just picked it up on sale and am repeating. The game is fantastic. Seriously. Such a shame that it will exist as a one off and no follow ups will take place. The world is interesting, rich, and gorgeous. On a meta level the game reminds me of playing an mmo solo but with combat that takes certian elements from the arkham games while adding in a nice dash of strategy to how you go about things. On lower difficulty your build wont matter a whole lot but increase the difficulty and you can find yourself in a bit of a pickle so pay attention to what loot you are getting and how it factors into your way of playing. If I had my play times from the 360 version I would reckon I have spent 200+ hours on the base game and its expansions - which you should also buy because they are every bit as good as the base game. My only real issue is that there is not more DLC. I need more of this game. Strage situation seeing as EA published it and they would milk the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off a tic tac toe clone if they could. Strange times.
4346	1	a	With this new update i am shocked with what i am playing. doesnt even feel like dino horde, it feels like a brand new game and i fell in love with it all over again. i liked it b4 and now i like it even more. great game to play with friend :D
447	1	a	Very Decent RPG  Silky Combat, Plenty of room for Customization and faffing about and a dizzying amount of things to do 110% worth its price tag
2943	0	a	This game is still crap.
4025	1	a	Its like HALO but with dinos.
1909	1	a	This game is an amazing RPG that not only gives you skill and spell choices, it gives you various weapon types. The amount of selection that you have is honestly a little overwhelming but still fantastic. It has tons of sidequests and an awesome main story! I highly recommend for anyone that is willing to kill some epic monsters and get awesome loot! Rate: 10/10
2826	0	a	First match I get the flag and a T-Rex tries to eat me. I glitch through the bottom of the map and am stuck down there for the rest of the match along with the egg. Very buggy.
1767	1	a	KOA is a good RPG at the start youâre drawn in by the fun combat system and good writing but by the end youâre just a little bit bored and somewhat confused about it all. The problems the game faces is that itâs difficulty curve is too shallow which coupled with a fixed level world means that exploring becomes a moot point as you out level the content very quickly. If youâre looking for a RPG to run with for a couple of weeks this is for you there is plenty to see and do then get this game but wait for a sale.
3632	1	a	this game is underated but buy it on a sale
4285	1	a	This is a good game. Maybe even great. It sure isn't the best game in the world, but it's certainly worth playing.   I don't care about what this game was called before or any negatie reviews. I sure as hell don't care about Activision going after the other ORION game. This is not that game.  Picked this game up on a sale for 50 cents. Haven't tried the PvP modes, but right now I've sunk about 30 hours into the PvE wave mode. Sure the bots are absolutely terrible, the graphics aren't at Crytek levels, and it gets fairly repetitive, but I've enjoyed all 30 hours. The survival mode is fairly simple: defend a generator for three waves, move to capture an outpost somewhere on the map, repeat twice, then finish with a final tenth wave. The waves of small enemies, ground and airborne, are accompanied by a few very large, very strong dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurs and Stegosaurs. The game can be very challenging or very easy depending on the settings. A personal favorite of mine is to turn the dino health down and spawn rate up to dramatically increase the size of the wave.   Recomending a game is all about the value-proposition. Do you get a sufficient amount of enjoyment for what you pay? I payed 50 cents for currently 30 hours of game. That's a 60 hour per value ratio. 60 hours per dollar is equivalent to 3600 hours in your standard $60 AAA game. Very few people spend 360 hours on a game, much less 3600. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Even if I don't play another hour of this game, the value of my 50 cents is apparent.
2111	1	a	Quite good thing to play. A ton of bugs, but still nice.  Advantages
4440	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
1619	1	a	One of the greatest RPGs I've ever played. The world is beautiful, the lore is amazing, and the storys are interesting. Everything i see and do makes me want to see more of the world, and extremely sad that there won't be anymore of these. First game where i ever tried anything different than magic rogue, and i couldn't have chosen a better game to do so. The fighting is fun, the magic makes you feel powerful, and the stealth is very believable. Honestly, not even Skyrim could match the magic, as despite having more, i never felt truly powerful unless i was using a shout. This game lets every blow, strike, blast, and arrow loosed increase the feeling of power you have. And i wouldn't have it any other way. Not only would i say you should buy this game, i would also say buy it for all your friends and family. Make everyone play this.  To put it another way, i bought this game on disc twice before, and lost both of those disks before buying it on Steam, and even if i somehow lost it on Steam, i would still buy it again. This game deserves to be in everyone's library.

4330	1	a	Rather than review the game, I'd like to point out a few things about it.  1. What's new and groundbreaking? Nothing. What's fun? Everything. What's a ripoff? MAYBE some of the aesthetic items from the in-game store, but they don't change the game at all.  2. Remember the days of Blockbuster? Pay five dollars and you can try a game for one week. If you don't like it, you're out five dollars and you have to give it back anyway. Well for 20% of that ($1) you can try this game, and believe me when I say it's worth trying. If you don't want to spend that dollar, just sell some of the trading cards you picked up from other games.  3. If you get only four hours of fun out of this game, it's a victory. That's $.25 per hour of fun. To get that same value from a AAA title you need to have 240 hours of fun. Be honest, did you play CoD: Ghosts for 240 hours and enjoy it the whole time?
2719	1	a	First game, I just jumped in. Found a rifle, 'Ooh, that's cool. I'mma shoot me a raptor!'. I ran around until I saw a raptor. As I was patiently scoping on him, a t-rex came up behind me and chomped my â¥â¥â¥. My girlish scream of terror woke up the whole house and I was sold in an instant.  Get this game, shoot dinosaurs, squeal like a little girl and hopefully don't get eaten.  Pure and simple extinct-animal-murdering fun!
2087	1	a	A very highly underrated game. Made by some of the greatest minds to the Fantasy Genre, including Ken Rolston of Bethesda, and R.A.Salvatore, writer of the Demon Wars saga, this game is full of color, lore and a ton of places to explore and weapons and armor to find. This is what World of Warcraft would look like if it wasn't a low poly MMO. The combat reminds me of the first Fable game, so it's really easy to learn; also there's a bunch of weapon types to choose from. I have played through this game twice on the Xbox, and now I am playing it for PC. I recommend it.
1031	1	a	I had waited to see how this game would turn out when it was in development. I was disappointed when I heard 38 Studios went under and that this might never be released but for one EA did something right and allowed it's release. I have been having a blast with it so far, it's similar to Skyrim in customization of play but the actual fights are more involved and alot more enjoyable.

5073	1	a	0.72 euro , preaty cheap for a game like this play cs:go one day , get this game , shoot some dinos , have some fun for free !
886	0	a	The game is more an action game than a rpg. And as such i can not recommend it. The fantasy is also quite thin in terms of story and lore, the scenery however is lovely.
3848	1	a	If theres anyway to describe this game, it certainly is no Dinosaur on a technical level. With Hi-Tech Dino-Devonian physics,Cretaceolicious level design, an Jurrasictastic story, and Jaw dropping Weapon Array. There's certainly no going wrong with Orion: Dino Horde/Prelude especially for the outrageous asking price. 8/10
538	1	a	You will find interesting when you play it more than 5 hours
685	0	a	Boring game. Little weapon variety, what weapons there are all have the same attacks, just press one attack button. Same monsters throughout the entire game, they just give them different names. Main quest line is very boring and repetitive. Go into this castle and fight horde after horde of people to kill this boss, all while just pressing one button to attack *yawn*. Feels like an MMO but it is single player so the whole world feels very empty and lonely and not fun to explore. If you go the rogue class good luck getting any gear. 14 hours of gameplay and i still had the starting gear they gave me in the tutorial because everything else was for casters or warriors. Dont waste your money, even if its on sale
4376	1	a	It's enjoyable, and better than most FPS I've seen on the PC. They allow a large amount of room when it comes to how you want to play and develop your character depending on the group you are with. Of course if you keep playing the same people you will eventually develop a routine and some amazing synergy with your fellow hunters.

1196	1	a	This has to be one of my favorite fantasy rpgs. I highly recommend this game to anyone else that loves rpgs.
1877	1	a	A great RPG game that reminds me alot of World of warcraft!   Would really recommend this game to all RPG-lovers out there!
657	1	a	This game just feels so good! This game has it all!  MANY different combat styles (great magic, melee, sneaky, ranged, massive 2H's and more!), crafting, good (not great IMO) story, amazing word, great graphics, great variety in zones, weapons and monsters, good optimization and just a lot of depth to it! Feels like the only thing missing for me is a co-op option for this game :D  Especially with the very frequent sales on this game this is one of the easiest recommend I can make!
4226	1	a	Better cost to replay value than BF4
364	1	a	really good game had hours of fun.
4661	0	a	No thanks.
3416	1	a	This game is excellent, ignore that low meta score because it is so much fun to play, single-player or mulitplayer but is best with others, the graphics are good and the mechanics great. I have found no bugs so it is very smooth to play and easy to learn. It can get very heart-thumping at times and is very good fun for groups of friends
5811	0	a	Buyers Beware!  This game isn't well optimized, it runs very slow even on low graphics. Everything is wrong, the servers are laggy, poor gameplay, it will consume every byte of ram and vram you have. Honestly the worst game I ever bought before.  My Specs: AMD A10 7850k 2GB vram (R7 Graphics) 16GB Ram 2133Mhz Windows 7 Ultimate
814	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is at odds with itself. On the one hand, it strives to be an epic fantasy along the lines of Skyrim or Oblivion (or even WoW). On the other, it is an arcade action game. The arcade part is fun. The rest... not so much. The backstory and the lore are dull, as are most of the voice actors. Quests are generally interesting... many are simple fetch quests or kill monster X at location Y. But many are multi-part with intriguing backstory.  The story has something to do with your character be exempt from fate because you were resurrected from the dead. And other characters want to help or exploit you. Or something like that. But, as a whole, it just doesn't come together. There's nothing compelling about the story. The mini-games pale in comparison to their Bethesda counterparts. I clicked through every dialog tree as quickly as possible. There are stones scattered in the world which, when touched, divulge some of the lore via a voice-over. I couldn't pay attention to a single one of them.   Now, on the combat side, it resembles more of a Darksiders flair. You roll around to avoid enemy attacks and wait for the right moment to close and shred your opponent. Some monsters just absorb hits until they die. Others will take a few before striking back. The only downside is that it becomes repetitive. Each dungeon has the same types of monsters, reasonbly spread across the map. But after my 5th encounter with kobolds, for instance, I was ready to move on.  Kingdoms of Amalur sports an RPG element. Your character levels up and points can be allocated into different skill trees. Some of them unlock cool moves that can be used in combat. Others unlock world exploration skills like alchemy (dull), lockpicking (dull), finding hidden stashes (dull), and the like. And, you can re-roll your character at any time -- a feature that I haven't used yet, but appreciate that it is there.  The game is definitely on the easy side, especially if you avail yourself of the powerful weapons available at the start of the game. Set the game on hard and pick less damaging weapons (like daggers) to make the game more exciting.   Nevertheless, with six hours into the game, I'm probably done with it. It hasn't grabbed me. And, as a gamer with limited time for gaming, I have to be engaged from the first moment. The story needs to be compelling. The characters (especially my character) need to be intriguing; their dialog something I listen to with rapt interest. And if not that, then the action needs to be exciting. Perhaps if it mixed the combat with some Prince of Persia like platforming elements, and downplayed the story/RPG stuff?  It feels too much like a couple of different incomplete games all squished together into a mostly ineffective whole. It's not enough to keep my interest.
3584	1	a	This game reinvented the genre of railroad building tycoons for me! It is such a fast paced, off the wall rail shooter that really shines when it comes to famliy building exercises. The game is centered around an unnamed protagonist who is giving birth during a dinosaur attack. Now if that sounds crazy this will really knock your caboose right off your sockle doos, you are black!!!1111!!11!1!!1   Only if you decide to heal people like a little buttpooplickingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. This game is a great baby care taking simulator because it has everything that a little rhino would need in order to get a hexakill and get 123125 AP. This game is also a great addition to anyone's collection of games because it redefines the entire genre of tower defense!!! Without only 0 towers to place you have to be sure to place them in very strategical places in order to stop those pesky brazillians from breaking into the dunkin donuts across the street from you. All in all this is a fantastic game that all pregnant mothers should pick up instantly!      Also includes one free C-Section.
4639	0	a	What about people who play when it's not F2P ?? no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing refund for this ?? i feel disapointment so much :&lt;
347	1	a	Great game so far, but its pop ins are almost as bad as la noire's.
4377	0	a	Basic wave survival and was not worth the money (even your spare change). Try it if you want to get some trading cards or to pad out your Steam library.
1002	1	a	This is a solid RPG thats is a great addition to any game collection. If you enjoyed playing the original Fable you should enjoy this game. Very similar feel but on a bigger scale, with better combat mechanics and diversity of special combo moves.

4003	0	a	still just as bad as it ever was...
1967	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time.
4582	1	a	its an amazing game for its price the grapics are good i would recomend anyone getting it
1246	1	a	great game in the true rpg genre of games
6369	1	a	Great game and very fun to play with friends and for 99cents cant beat it!
2731	1	a	This game is tons of fun. 99 cents right now!!!
6373	1	a	You look at this game, and you think...Ehhhh, is it worth it? It looks kinda (dumb, simple, noobish, glitchy, whatever), so you seriously don't consider getting it. Get it. Its probably worth at least 5 dollars, and future updates can only make it better xD  Gun system very similar to CSGO, with weapons that are based on the same type (heavy deagle like pistol, AUG like gun), but that doesn't make it a knockoff. Its very unique, with a very fun, adventureous feel. The community is nothing but friendly, and learning to play is easy. Its a fun way to meet some new online friends, or play with some old ones. If it is its worth you're worried about, don't.   Now, it is not a top notch game. The mouse is super sensitive, so you have to adjust it every now and then. Sometimes settings dont stay saved, so you have to reset them. Servers are kinda glitchy, so sometimes it takes a minute to join. It is a .99 cent game, so bugs are there. If you want a top of the line, everything must be aboslutely perfect and run smoothly kinda game, this probably isn't up your alley. It takes a little patience, but only a little.   Overall? Get it, unless you're really, reaaaally picky. You'll love it. Kill some dinos for me!
961	1	a	This game is so good that there were times I just couldn't stop playing. You will love this game. It has a huge and mostly open world that should appeal to fans of The Elder Scrolls games like me. The combat is one of the best that I've seen in any rpg. The lore is also pretty cool.

485	1	a	-I got suggestions from 9gag this game being one of the most underrated RPG. -I am not dissapointed in this game at all. It was a beautiful world and amazing RPG elements. I love crafting weapons and robes. -It has an amazing storyline and great side quests, not easy nor too tough. Just the right amount to make it interesting. -It has great faction stories, such vast expansion of cultures and traditions explained . -I love the way they talk, so medival.
1380	1	a	A single player version of World of Warcraft.   The good points -Combat it plays so smoothly and nice that I could use the exact same attacks for hours and not get bored by them -Total freedom to choose any combination of skills -Exploring it may be cartoony but it still looks nice and there is a lot of it. -Nice interplay about fate and freedom of choice -Voice acting -Very very long game  The bad points -NPC's are forgettable as in the two main npc's are so forgettable I don't remember them already. -Foreshadowing and RPG tropes run very strongly making well everything very predictable. -Obvious port from console meaning very tiresome inventory/map shenanigans. -The company went bankrupt just before an important patch could be made leaving obvious imperfections. -Subtitles are very unsynced -When talking with someone it can be unnerving to look directly at NPC's. -Not so difficult I played my first try on the hardest setting and only one DLC boss gave me some trouble only because I was underleveled the rest wasn't that challeging.  All in all if you like the typical RPG and enjoy the combat system then this is the game for you because the combat system is wonderful. If on the other hand you want an interactive world, intriguing storyline or an a typical RPG then this is not for you.  That said this game take a long time to finish so I'd advise buying it in a sale and play it in a vacation.
4938	0	a	Interesting concept, trying to be a 'survive the wave' type game, I guess like a cross between Halo, Left 4 Dead, with dinosaurs. You can level up your characters to give them better skills, and drive around in various vehicles and buy new weapons to help kill the dinosaurs.   Very dated graphically, but even worse is it's not particularly interesting/barely existant gameplay, AI on the dinosaurs is a bit rubbish, they just run straight at you. Nowhere near as entertaining as the teaser trailer seems to imply. The level ups aren't particularly interesting, and the game maps are poorly designed.   Sure it's only a dollar, but there are a number of Free to Play FPS titles that are more entertaining and a better use of your time. I can only guess that all the positive reviews are trolling.
2337	1	a	It's fun and it costs less than a dollar. Sell some cards and buy this game. Trust me, it's worth it. Just make sure you have some friends to play with too!
4234	1	a	Oh look. A bunch of people jumping on a witch hunt and ruining someone's livleyhood based on activisions unprovable claims on a non-competing franchise.   Get real people -- errors have been corrected; hence why the game is back up for sale. The worst are the people changing overhelmingly positive reviews based on here-say like truly ignorant white knights.  If you want to go blast something go hate on the re-re-re-released version of the WarZ -- Shattered Skies. Those people deserve all the hate the world has to offer and more.
5900	0	a	Game is still â¥â¥â¥â¥.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As all ways wanna see what games I am playing now then follow and view my stream @  twitch.tv/spitroasted 
4917	0	a	i purchased this on my windows pc that meets the recommendated software and stuff but then when i go in the audio is all f'ed up and i get 1.5 frames per second and you said you fixed it if its not fixed in 1 week (a week because i dont think you did bug fixes in a while and i want a refund if its not working) ill get a refund
2420	1	a	Few times in one's life do they get the opportunity to do the things that you can do in this game. I have been blessed with the oppurtunity to shoot dinosaurs in the crotch while driving mech suits and tanks.   Doesn't sound relaxing enough?   Perhaps you enjoy pushing your friends and dinosaur corpses through the blood and feces of a now endangered species with state of the art ragdoll physics?  And how can we forget about the CryEngine level graphics and in-depth storyline? I was hooked from the beginning of the 10 level massacre to the end. I became legitimately worried about the sanity and morality of the characters and even the dinosaurs. The game creates a player-glitchy NPC bond that can only be created on the incredibly diverse levels that the developers have created. Don't even get me started on the animations! They were 'Transformers' quality and left me in awe every time I looked at them in 3rd person mode.   Basically, this game gives you an oppurtunity to achieve your goals and conquer your greatest fears in one incredible experience.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26/10 would recommend to public ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Best game on Steam. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014	1	a	This is one of my favorite action RPG games of the last 20 years. If you're a fan of real-time combat systems and storylines that take longer than a weekend, then this is definitely worth a try.
2232	1	a	Finnaly Disciples 3 almoust without bugs and erors, nice story, pretty long and chalenging campagin. It is really good game. If you like Disciple universe, or turn-based strategy games, YOU MUST, really, MUST BUY IT!
4120	1	a	AMAZING JUST AMAZING
2798	1	a	Great game! Bought it for myself, and after a few hours of playing, bought the 4-pack for my friends, Good job!
2708	0	a	It is rare I'm able to say this, but this is even overpriced at $1..
1065	1	a	10/10, tremendous replay value. It's like a Skyrim and God of War had a love child.
2465	1	a	YOU SHOOT DINO'S  AND DRIVE MECHS AND DRAGON FLYS (TO GET MAD AIR)  WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ MORE DO YOU WANT?
5085	1	a	Charged into a pack of dinos with no regret, Didnt die 8/8
5150	1	a	Pretty fun game if you like facing off against waves of enemies.
3719	1	a	update for v3.0 This is my review of Orion Prelude I will not be comparing it to its past versions Orion Beatdown or Orion Dino horde, nor go into the devs back story. You want to know about THIS GAME not of its past. Orion Prelude is a first/third person shooter where its main game modes are to kill dinos to survive or to try and kill an opposite team.     There are a couple pvp modes but there aren't many people(you may find one or two servers) playing. The only pvp mode that gets love is Vital. This is a interesting Idea and is fun, but can have problems. Vital you have two teams of five each of you have a generator which you must protect from the dinos which only thing they do in life is kill you and your generator. As you kill you get credits you usually use them to upgrade yourself and get weapons but in Vital you can mess with your enemy's dino spawn. you can increase damage that dino deal, how many dinos spawn, and give them big dinos as a present and I feel its balance there. problems are with the players. It's doesn't have a balance system so instead it can be 4 old with 1 new vs 4 new and 1 old player its fun but you have to be careful . also this game mode will take you 1-3 hours(it may drag on) to beat and is really the greatest with a full team.    There are also three survival modes one named survival, conquest, and Slaughter. survival last around 40-50 mins in the most of the difficulties and your goal is to survival 10 rounds of dinos, how? by protecting your generator also you will have to go to outposts and capture them every 4ish rounds. You can buy weapons and upgrades in between rounds before the killing begins again.    Conquest is a copy and paste of survival but on a HUGE map, has 30 rounds, is 2-3 hours, and you can also buy jeeps, tanks, heles, and so on. It's fun but only use dedicated servers for if the host leaves then the game ends.    Slaughter is endless slaughter( I know what a surprise!) there are no rounds for you just keep getting hit by dinos you will be given guns and ammo over time and the longest I have survive is 20ish minutes and it's a good mode. in all, I play them at different times but each one is different and all are fun so I would suggest you try them all.   now that will give you a idea of the game itself I'm sure you have some other questions. (if I miss any please do not be afraid to ask for I will add it to the list, thank you.)  1. how does it run: it has always run well for me(60fps or higher) on ether of my pcs but I have heard that it runs better now than ever for some people who have had problems before.  2. sounds: Since 3.0 all weapon sounds have been redone/edited this has really made the games feel deadly. I have found one or two that I don't like but its an overall improvement.  3. graphics: Improved since 3.0, all maps look and feel better then they were and the new maps (2 which have been added in 3.0) are really well done.  4. how does it control?: good question, on mouse and keyboard like other good fps and controller  support is only for the 360pad, from what I hear its good there to.  5 modules: great don't have any problems with that. Although it's fun when the T-rex model flies in the air after killing it!  6. guns: you will see some guns that look semi normal but many are very cool and fun to just look at.   all in all its a great game. Its not a AAA title but you can sink some time in this. I would suggest this to poeple who loves first person and third person shooters. I feel you would have as much fun with yourself as you will online. also there is steam workshop to make maps so If you like making maps then you might want to get this to. (Note: workshop is stuck in beta mode until a bug can be fixed)  7. score: 9/10. v3.0 really has made this game shine its not prefect but its a great game.  p.s. If you have a question please ask.
5531	0	a	I paid 0.79 and i feel cheated.... After i bought this my parents are questioning my ability to make decisions. Just wait for steam sales maybe its will be worth it when its cheaper. 
6023	1	a	9/10 Is not that fps friendly but is plenty of fun
3049	1	a	Light and fun gameplay.
1538	1	a	This game is seriously underated. I found it scolling for a new game and it was on sale. Jackpot. It is hands down one of my favorite games in this genre. The combat system is smooth and fast. The graphics and animation have a glowing beauty to them that leaves you staring at simple ponds in awe. The character creation is satisfiying and in depth enough to make a fairly individual charater. I bought this game last time it was on sale and would have gladly paid full price for what I got. The game as mentioned previously is huge and leaves you as skyrim does wanting to play a second or third game through with a different class/race of character. I wish there was a sequel or expansion but it seems that shipped sailed long ago. This game is definetly worth your time and more as its carefree enough to not soak up every ounce of your mind but still get the whole immersed world feel.  Sure there are a few flaws like the armor system could use some fine tuning. Some of the story lines could link up a bit better. And yes there are a few gliches hidden throughout, but nothing detrimental to the game. Since the developers are no longer it won't be getting fixed, which is sad because this game is worth every second. I have no idea why I only heard of it this past year because put simply...... its awesome. Buy it. Now.
1116	1	a	This is actually a really fun game. The crafted gear becomes the best you can get. All classes are fun and the story is good too. Sound fx and music are top notch.
1894	1	a	I've played this game on PS3, and all I have to say is that is an all-around great RPG. The story line is very immersive, the characters are unique and have a lot of story behind them, and the ability to choose whatever play style you want is the best. EA really hit the nail on the head with this one.
6388	0	a	For me it crashed when tried to start a match Lowered graphics still crashed, I have a Geforx 9800 + Games like the Witcher 2 &amp; Batman Arkham Asylum work for me - Witcher 2 on low Batman on max  So maybe it just dosen't work on older cards even if they are capable
2576	0	a	Grafica e naspa.... Graphic is to low and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥....
3089	0	a	This game is awful. Now I know what you're gonna say, 'How is it bad if you played it for less than an hour?' That's true, but it is extremely laggy, god-awful with a controller, and graphics are terrible.
1420	1	a	One of the best RPGs I have played in a long time.
912	0	a	First off this is not a bad game, even still i wouldnt recommend going through it because it is just painfully average. If you expect some epic rpg then no this is not quite it, if you want some easy hack and slash game then yeah this might be it. What bugged me the most, speaking of bugs this game has very little of it, is the quests are just boring as hell and even though there is a lot of background story to discover but it just seems to matter so god damn little. Fighting is pretty cool though i would have liked to see a more diverse skill system or some sort of diversity that is not in the game. Also i finished the game and didnt even get my top sorcery card which means i probably didnt do enough side quests, but heck they are boring as hell. LOTS of walking during quests and in between makes it a bit stupid at times as well. Yeah so my final verdict is don't go with this game if you expect the next skyrim or some epic rpg.
2335	1	a	Plays game for 5 minutes.  Gets trapped in rock for ten minutes. Finally finds the teleport button. Hurrah! Run around dinosaurs with cryo knife taking advantage of their slow turning. Cryo blade a T-Rex and a Triceratops to death. Gets killed by a small and insignificant dinosaur. 10/10 would play again.

1008	1	a	This game is just superb. The styles of combat are so completely varied and intuitive that it almost holds it up on it's own. That, mixed with the gorgeous scenery, talented voice actors, and the sheer amount of weapons, armor, potions, and quests are what make it golden. The crafting is also quite in depth, you salvage weapons/armor for hilt, blades and various other things to make your own gear, and experimenting with different ingredients to make just the potion you needed is just great.   But honestly, this review would not be complete without Reckoning Mode; a slowmo, kill all, Bayonetta style super finish that just makes crushing your enemies a dream.   Though I'll say this, it's not   perfect.   The game itself can be somewhat easy at times, but fear not!   Youngneil's Amalur Mod fixes all that, and can be fully customized.  I'd rate it a 7/10 without the mod, but with it, I'd give it a   much   deserved 8/10
5645	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
5623	0	a	My friend got the four pack of this, we played for a few minutes, quit, never played again
2389	1	a	What the hell Bren, this is actually fun.
101	1	a	This is truly a gem in the rpg genre. Its got everything a rpg should have like: - A open world with, like skyrim guilds to join en other sidequest as you explore - A fun and simple crafting system - Some funny humor and dialog. - Awesome combat, let's you choose what you will become, and you can become alot. Like a mix between a mage and a rogue.  - Some clever bossfights - Lots and lots of loot and dungeons Even the two dlc packs are awesome. But this does have some lame-â¥â¥â¥ fetch this, kill this, retrieve that missions. But most of them are sidequest and can be easly ignored. It takes alot of time to finsh this game and the plentyfull sidequest/guild missions keeps you occupied for some time. So looking for a good action rpg, then picks this game up.
5552	0	a	I have a crappy computer but this is very very slow.
2758	1	a	Pretty fun game, kind of a mix between halo and left 4 dead. Can act slightly glitchy at times but no major things.  BUT THE DAMN BIRD DINOS, like jesus, give them a nerf please. Almost impossible to hit and can take you out so quickly.  8/10 so far.
2606	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
5842	0	a	These graphics are so garbage that it isn't even worth 1 mere cent. Let alone one dollar. 2012 game my â¥â¥â¥.
2160	1	a	wait....this isn't Skyrim?!!
3256	1	a	It's buggy - but for $0.99? Why not? The survival gamemode is definitely worth at least that. I have fun with it.
2496	1	a	This is a really good game, not 'good because it's cheap', but this game stands on it's own merits. Lots of fun, good feeling weaponry, the graphics are simple but clear and attractive. Strongly recommend.
4980	1	a	10/10 got butt â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by a T-rex
3182	1	a	It's not a great game, It's not the game with the best animations, or the best gameplay, It's one of those games which is cheap and sells alot because of the great times you have with your friends blasting dinos.
4901	1	a	cheap and fun
286	1	a	Amazing game to play if you're a fan of any role play games! The graphics are really well done. Most of the game looks really colourful and bright, or dull and dark when it needs to be. The gameplay is loads of fun and offers a ton of variety in terms of what your character can do to fight. Finally, load times seem to be very low, and overall it's an amazing RPG to play!
6070	1	a	11/10 the voice acting is god-like and the game is cheap as â¥â¥â¥â¥ recommended
3675	1	a	Probably one of the worst games I own. This is the most fun I have had in a LONG time.
5218	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.
112	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It feels like it was designed for people who like RPG's, but want more involved action type combat. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy action RPG's and exploring new worlds. It's a shame that the studio went down the way they did, but this game I felt was definitely worth my time.  Pros: Combat Loot Interesting Sidequests and Stories Leveling System Art Controller support (if you like that, I played with both, it was better with PC just because of more binds I could use) Deep fleshed out world. I really liked the Lore in this game. Lots of Quests ( I did every quest except for the 'Collect XYZ' quests, and that took me about 60 hours. Choice (It's not as deep as some games, but you can make choices that have different outcomes in the world) Bosses (Had some interesting boss fights, including the last one, although not too difficult on normal setting) Voice Acting (I liked the voices of the characters, although your character has no voice, I prefer it this way)  Cons: Character Creation/Customization (not a big deal for me personally but bare bones here) Bugs (There are some serious bugs that ruined quest lines for me. They occur rarely, but it didn't take too much away from the experience for me) Main Quest Story is OK (I enjoyed it, even the end boss is pretty fun, but the epilogue after feels short and unpolished) Can be grindy (Lots of the quests are the same, but the stories for the side quests were often interesting and kept me wanting to get to the next town/area to find new quests and solve problems) Combat (Although the combat is fun, it's easy to become over powered if you figure out ways to spam certain attacks. It's not a HUGE flaw, but the balance could be better) Voices (Although the acting is good, you hear the same voices over and over again.)  All in all I would recommend if you're looking for an RPG to play while waiting for something else. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
828	0	a	worked on my old potato pc, upgraded and got win ten, now it will randomly crash everyonce in a while (15minish) making it unplayable. the only thing worse then a bad game is getting locked out of one you loved   EDIT: found that if you close tabtab.exe under details in the task manger is runs fine
5114	1	a	GET THIS GAME...just do it.....its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice
4227	1	a	Personally I don't like this game, just don't like it and I still want to recommend it anyway. L4D 2 is way better and I got it for free.  3/10
5715	0	a	It is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ F2P P2W game, except you pay money upfront. The gameplay is okay, but the lowest graphics settings can still be laggy on weaker machines. 2/10
3844	0	a	The graphics are pretty good, and there are some cool weather effects. I also like the voice acting. Other than that, it's not very good. All you do is activate a generator and defend it against dinosaurs. Why are the dinosaurs attacking the generator anyway? This game is basically a lesser Borderlands/Halo with a Jurassic setting. I did have some fun playing it with my friend, but I can't see myself going back to it.
3123	1	a	subpar in just about every way, and poorly optimized. BUT has some interesting ideas and innovative mechanics which you rarely see in an fps. id love to see this one picked up by a major studio but only if it would stay faithful to the original concept and gameplay quirks. like everyone else has said, its way more fun than it ought to be, and its only 99c!
2183	1	a	Buy it. It's awesome....More after respectable playtime hours.
4783	1	a	playing with friends, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun game :D
2364	0	a	Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the 'Play Solo' option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.  It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.
5707	0	a	This belongs in an arcade
1539	1	a	I've actually changed my mind about this game. I initially didn't recommend it, because I was playing it 'as intended'.  My view of the gameplay is pretty much unchanged. It starts out fun, and gets old fast, and is never challenging. This is because the game was initially an MMO that was just revamped for single player, so the devs could get some quick cash. Looking at it from that viewpoint, this is a massive game with hundreds of hours of gameplay.  However, I have found that the game is much more fun, and maintains a reasonable level of challenge, so long as you skip the side quests. Side quests pretty much ruin this game. They are all the most inane, and generic MMO stereotypes, and there are literally hundreds of them. Even worse, if you actually do them all, you end up severely overpowered, simply because of the massive amount of killing involved, and thus you outlevel the content.  Focusing on the main story, and the factions, while skipping any side quests you don't find interesting, cuts this game down to a nice 40-ish hour experience. You're in each area just long enough to enjoy it, and do some exploring.  If you play this game in a completionist fashion, you will hate it by the 20-40 hr mark, unless you actually get your jollies from doing the same action for the same result endlessly like a factory assembly line.  That said, I recommend it keeping the above in mind. I wouldn't pay $50 for this game, maybe not even $20, but if you can get it on sale for less, jump on it. Go through it like a buzzsaw, and try to play it like Ninja Gaiden, rather than Skyrim, and you'll have a good time.
1789	1	a	Beautiful graphics and amazing story make for a epic game and adventure! The gameplay is wonderful as well with a great combat and well done classes Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that all RPG fans need!
2407	1	a	Shooting raptors while flying through the air in a jetpack. Sniping pterodactyls on top of mountians. Driving tanks head-on into battle against a giant alligator. And best of all, flying a VTOL through the air, laying down covering fire for a teammate trying to make it to the base. 10/10 best buck I ever and ever will spend.
2958	1	a	You made it 0,99â¬ instead of a greedy 20â¬? Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. The first non-greedy game company in existance.
867	0	a	This game did not work for me. Constant freezing and stuttering, was basically unplayable. I know that this is a decent game but cannot recommend...I am reviewing this simply to warn those may consider purchasing it in the future. By the way, my system runs high end games perfectly, such as Doom, The Witcher 3, The Divison, etc...so my rig is not the problem.
2825	1	a	Getting grabbed by Pterodactyls never gets any easier.
3388	1	a	you know that moment when you pee after a long day of work and it feels so good and you're overwhelmed, that's just like this game except you're peeing out dinosaurs
3257	1	a	1 dollars is nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!this game worth more
1965	1	a	Good game. Fun combat, fairly interesting story. There's a lot of random quests that I would expect from an MMO more than a single player RPG, like 'go fetch this' and 'go kill that', which don't actually have anything to do with the story.  Also, the game is WAY too easy, by the end of the game I was running around with 4-5 curses and wearing armor I used near the beginning of the game and still slaughtering most things in two hits - and that's on hard mode. I'd suggest playing just the storyline quests and the faction quests, the rest are kind of pointless and level you up too fast.  It was still worth the money to me because it kept me entertained for a weekend when I didn't have internet connection, lol.
5777	0	a	this game gives me a cancer :3 dF
5664	1	a	Lol this is a joke, the game in its current state is worth NOTHING, i have faith though
3323	1	a	gameplay - pretty solid, and a lot of fun with friends, and multiplayer. graphics - this game is not meant directly to graphic enthusiasts, but still looks pretty solid  lots of different modes to enjoy with many players.  cons. - many glitches and weird buggy gameplay which get frustrating. overall this game is pretty fun and i would give it a legit rating of 7.5/10
4018	1	a	Dinos try to bite your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off
6412	1	a	An amazingly open combat game, reccomended to those into amazing dinosaurs like the Raptor, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops. I had a great time playing it, even though I died a lot. Also, is it just me, or do the soldier guys look like they're in Dead Space 3 armor?
5859	0	a	bought the game, booted it up, joined a server and tried to move but it occasionally went to slow motion, and there was UNRELENTING RUBBER BANDING. it was so bad i could hardly move, i didnt want to move and i sertainly didnt want to play the game
459	1	a	Great game, definitely underated.   Story telling is brilliant (Salvator and his writting team does not disappoint), the environments gorgeous (McFarlane can do no wrong), and game design inspiring (much like Elderscrolls, but with tighter combat mechanics).  I would like to have supported this game when it counted.
824	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning poor game. fix bugs.
2920	1	a	The game is actually pretty good! the graphics are OK, and the sound design isn't crap. unlike what others say, this game is pretty fun compared to the bug-fest others make it out to be. Dino Horde borrows elements from other games, which makes it very familiar and relatable. Ignore the Metacritic review, this game is worth the purchase, especially if on sale
3059	1	a	Very good game. Metacritic scores are misleading.
3176	0	a	The worst game I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Not even worth the $1 its on sale for.
540	1	a	I can definitely say this game is worth playing. Dont get confused by my steam hour count, I played Reckoning on Origin before I got it on steam. Graphics are really good, combat system is easy to learn and world is very big, full of quests and enemies. You are in for a lot of fun if you decide to give it a chance.
5918	0	a	10 out of 10 i give this game a minus 50, wont play again,  if crap was a art piece this game would be it
5961	1	a	Been a fun game to play from the start, should try it too it is only 0,99 cents..
6371	1	a	THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME
4493	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
1326	1	a	This game has so much too offer,hours of exploring,and hours of combat. I recommend this highly.
383	1	a	Actually pretty fun! Sometimes the story is basic and not deep, but the fighting and combat system is pretty epic!
6157	1	a	By far one of the best co-op shooting games ive played if not THE best. its just so riculously fun and the gameplay is fantastic. Also achievements. all kinds of achivements. u play as futuristic soldiers with jetpacks and guns slaying waves of dinosaurs. i shuldnt need to say anything more, 9/10
5965	1	a	Bought it for 0,49â¬, no regrets.  Have you ever felt the desire to fight unlimited waves of dinosaurs? Well, here you go!  Pretty basic horde gameplay that wears off pretty quickly but I mean, what are we to expect a lot from a game that was less than 1â¬?`  Great to play when you are extremely bored, downloading something or if you don't have access to the internet for a bit (kinda like a last resort)  11/10
3795	1	a	Really enjoy this game, they've hit on a great formula; especially the co-op conquest maps. It's one of those games with a very simple concept done flawlessly. Graphics are great too, I have a fairly old graphics card and this runs nice and smooth at full res.  Vehicles are great, the ballistic tank weapon is great. It's fun. I really like how when you go up levels you have a decent starting weapon too.
800	1	a	Never could stop playing this game on Xbox. Maybe I should be playing it on PC instead lol great game
418	1	a	LOVE LOVE LOVE this game, great story, easy controls, and straightforward questing. the only drawback i have found is the inability to see quests other than the one tracked quest in the world map.
3746	1	a	Bought it at 99 cents and it worth every penny and more! Haven't played it a lot yet but from what I did play it was already worth the 99 cents.
2973	1	a	This is the worst game in my library. I love it.
4991	0	a	played this and immediately hated myself for even buying it. 10/10 whould buy again.
550	1	a	Thereâs a game you probably didnât play. It came out 2 years ago, itâs a genuine epic, a vast, elaborate RPG with a sprawling story and vast numbers of sidequests. It features superbly in-depth combat, has huge variety in character design and levelling, and lets you instantly wander from the main plot and explore its enormous world to your own entertainment. Itâs Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. By John Walker
429	1	a	I originally played and beat this game on the Xboix 360  The big draw for me was there is open world. Lots of areas and hidden secrets to explore. I like to inspect every corner to find all the really awesome loot hidden somewhere.  And no choice of playstyle is a bad one. Very Balanced combat triangle.  10/10
1293	1	a	8.8/10
1531	1	a	One of my all time favorite RPG's ever. It actuallty is my favorite game. And for the game and all DLC's for 11 dollars..you can't go wrong....BUY IT
1787	1	a	There is a VERY good game here. It has all the hallmarks of a class action rpg, but I just CAN'T get into it no matter how many hours I put in or how much I want to. Its missing something but I can't put my finger on it or it has something thats off putting like this fantasy game obsession with including elves, fantasy games have done elves to death and I'm getting sick of seeing them in EVERY fantasy game, film, or book. That said if you can get into it and put up with yet more elves stealing the spotlight, this game will rule.
1467	1	a	Get lost in the interesting world of Amalur. Have the freedom to roam around, fight on your own term, craft your own weapons and armor, unlock skills, magical spells and bend fate to you will. Your will be pulled into the story and the world. A game worth having.
4673	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
2588	1	a	This game is so awesome now, shooting dinosaurs for only 99 cents! I bought 4 copies of this game for 1.50 euros to give to my friends and play together. This game is very fun and challenging for a couple of hours. ORION: Prelude is totally worth your money: 8/10
2888	1	a	Get past the general generic feel of every aspect of the game and it is actually quite fun, plus theres always killing a T-Rex with a lightsaber.
5555	1	a	I just imagine it as unreal tornament 2004 with dinos 11/10
4338	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
50	1	a	A pretty good game. Especially for the price.
1712	1	a	After 2 hours - one of the better RPG's, addictive and wildly customizable, i love it
5176	1	a	Amazing. Halo and TF2 mashed up with dinosaures and bathed in the madness of borderlands. Cheap houres of riduculousness .
1522	1	a	There is ALOT of game here and definitely worth the price when it's on sale. I am enjoying it. Tip: Play it on HARD - it's really more like 'normal' for any other game.
5104	0	a	Even though it has a gamemode where you can play as a dino but its not that fun deinosuchus hardly works for me i cant kill anyone I hate that my fav dino raptor only has one attack never choose raptor if your playing with pro players I dont even try to play as compy ptera the only dinos that are good spino,trex,triceratops,stegasaurus i didnt even remeber the rest of the dinos if there are more even for the price its at i still dont like it
5966	0	a	This game needs alot of work, feels clunky and unfinished. Would not recommend this to anyone.
3833	1	a	5/10
1279	1	a	Actually a really good RPG with classic elements and multi-colored fantasy. An in my opinion very good and consistent art style, a bit of exaggerated gore and a really nice skill system with balance issues. Too easy for most people, even casuals but with enough motivation to keep playing and wrecking enemy bones.  In KOA:R you create your own character who dies at the beginning of the game and gets revived, only to now that he is now free of any limits set by destiny and that he is the only one to bring victory over the big enemy over-boss. All classic fantasy clichÃ© so far. The story is neither the weakness nor the strength o this game, it just fulfills its purpose.  What stands out is the really well designed world with its races, different areas and effectful beauty. KOA has its own way to it and thats good. From an artistic point of view everything is worth seeing and the lore-stones that are spread throughout the world are also worth searching for because they add a great deal of well voice-acted immersion to the world.   Combat reminds me ratgher to a fighting game. Daggers, chakrams, bows, swords, the faeblades, hammers. Melee and ranged combat, magic, everyone gets served. There are 3 skill trees you can progress in, there is no class binding. Depending on what you choose you can activate certain perks that improve your powerso r give you additional abilities.  So far so good, but why did this game sell so badly?   There are some things that keep the game from being the epic must-have it could have been:  Questing: On one hand you can quest as much as you want, there is always something to do, skillbooks to find, treasures to hunt, bosses to kill. The different guilds all have their own quest-lines. On the other hand however you will not be able to do even half of the quests without being brutally overleveled, meaning the rewards you get will suck. Luckily there are some perks you can get by completing a quest-line. The DLCs are also worth getting, new epic landscapes, weapons and loot await, however they suffer the same problem. Quest rewards are also mostly random and most quest objectives are just the standard roleplay chores Kill X or bring me Y.   The second really bad thing about this game is the difficulty: It is just way too easy even on the hardest options. Sure, you feel epic. But it just gets boring after a while. Additionally there could be more enemies. If you played the Witcher 3 you might know it, there are maybe 30 different enemies but most are just remodels or retextures and can be taken out the same way as all of their kind.  Some skills are just overpowered or not strong enough. A mage for example will be able to pawn enemies with an epic elemental combo (and I mean epic, ability effects in this game are first class and superb) while warriors will have something similarily epic looking but way weaker.   Summing all this up I still think KOA is worth playing and worth your money, it's a shame that it has not reached the perfection it could have reached but that still does not make it a bad game.  8.5/10 I can impale my enemies with pure faith essence, never gets old.  
3938	0	a	couldn't join matchmaking and single player was not fun or challenging. would not recomend buying
2984	1	a	First off the meta score is a little low for this game it is way more fun than you might think it does need lots more work.
3977	1	a	What can you buy for 99 cents? You can buy random iPhone games. You can buy a very cheap packet of chips from Maccas. You can buy a frozen Coke from Maccas. You can give to a busker on the street.  Or you can buy Orion: Prelude and nuke dinosaurs with rocket launchers... in empty servers that crash a lot (at least they did when I played).  Angry Birds/10 would buy chips from Maccas again - IGN
4778	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!!!!  Even stronger than Jurassic World ;)
1342	1	a	Played it before on my old pc, now again on my new one. KOA inn my opinion has one of the best combat in rpg games second only to Dark Souls series. The game while fairly easy is very fun to play and you will likely have less frustrating time compared to other rpg as it's a really smooth and well polished game (even during it's original release). The weapons and armor set is fun to collect too, the quest while consist a lot of fetching but if you do the faction quest it will be quite interesting. The enemies have quite some variation too, but at the end game part the enemies become quite repetitive. Speaking of end game part that is where this game fell short of, as you can feel thaat the devs rush the ending part and it becomes boring. But either way it's still a really great game and i hope someday it will get a sequel. Oh and one more thing the character models and voice over kinda sucks too as it has almost all the same models in each races.  My rating : 8/10
5893	0	a	lol these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ stole just about everything when it comes to assets dont ever waste your money on this game
114	1	a	A Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ¢  Personal Rating - ( 12/10 ) Must buy Classic!!!   Great storyline, lots of quests, very very big and beautiful world to explore, great graphics !  I will still continue my Journey until i achieve everything :) So another 80+ hours on 'HARD'. (Just for one achievment lol)   CONS? (have any? well unfortunetly yes)  Lack of Multiplayer  - Game made for Multiplayer / CO-OP...but you won't find this in game menu....( [/i]SHAME ON YOU DEVS[/i]  Music/Soundtrack...  - Tragically, the music/soundtrack was far less polished. Maybe they ran out of funds? The sound just isnât relevant to the rest of this great game, and doesnât compare to the rest of the entertainment production.   Tons of side-quests...  - The side-quests....Yessss..Ohhhh YESSSS.....You will find tons of them in  Amalur....Good?  depends on how you want to go through the game, in this case, performing all the side-quests (  tons of them out there  ) will make you 0verpower3d Mut4nt and the game will be just too easy and boring, even on âhardâ (  Basically... you will enter the opponents as the Bee Gees in leggings  ). Other way (  I think is better one  ). Other way is sticking to the main tasks and the three 'main' storylines, (House of Ballads / Scholia Arcana / Travelers) to have some challenge from our enemies, and to enjoy the game as long as possible! You will feel pleasure slowly developing your character, and the satisfaction of gaining experience after a difficult battle... (  what else do you need  )   I hope that all Action RPGs will be like this one in future :)
2383	0	a	very much not a fun game, not worth the dollar it cost
4999	1	a	Extremely poorly made game. Devs obviously have no idea what they are doing. â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor visuals. Utterly disgusting gun sounds.  The game even has an in game cash shop where you can buy hats and looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!
3581	1	a	This game is EXTREMELY underrated. It has improved so much since all the crappy reviews it got 2 years ago. This is probally one of the funest games I have ever played! This game is pretty much Halo and Jurrasic Park put into one fun Multiplayer funtime game. You get to kill Dinosaurs, blow up Dinosaurs, stab Dinosaurs and get Turrents to kill Dinosaurs.  Did I mention you get to kill Dinosaurs?  Get this game while it is $1.00.  You will not regret it.
2678	1	a	This game much better than the metacritic rating it has recieved, I have only played this on multiplayer co-op but there is some fun to be had running around with your mates killing dinosaurs.

4183	1	a	There is a $wagzilla, nuff said.  11/10
2628	0	a	I dont know one person who auctually likes this game, most my friends play it and they say its only ok
3284	1	a	When I bought the game like 1 year ago it was really just a piece of buggy junk. I got it for 50 cents in discount so I was't really angry. Yesterday I was looking at my steam library and I found ORION: Prelude. I was kinda confused (the game was originaly named ORION: Dino Horde) so I downloaded it again and Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥... They tweaked the game A LOT. It's still the same, same old weapons and vehicles, but it's polished. It really looks like the devs made a lot of improvement to the game. Some previously useless perks are now vital and guns are more responsive. Also, they added flying damage indicators, so you don't have to guess if you hit that one annoying pterodactyle or not. And the best thing is, IT'S FREAKING 79 CENTS!!! It will give you at least few hours of enjoyment and even if not, it's just 79 cents. 8/10
3042	1	a	this is a pretty good game, i give it 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family and would play 24/7 to save the little black people from Kony 2012
5854	0	a	It sucks.  if this review gets downvoted 500 times i'll vac ban myself from this trash
3857	1	a	Great game. Killed a TRex with a â¥â¥â¥â¥in lightsaber. Then got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by a Robot Santa that drops bombs disguised as Christmas presents. 7/10
4109	1	a	This is the only game ive ever played that let me run at a horde of dinosaurs with knife while wearing a dinosaur mask. 10/10
2272	1	a	Definetly a must-buy for any disciples fan!
3810	0	a	Feels like a PS2 game, very clunky and basic.  Devellopers are thiefs and fire their employees with no pay and steal 3D models and assets from other games.  Do not buy even for 1$ and do not buy their future â¥â¥â¥â¥ products
3732	1	a	This game makes me think I'm retRded 11/10 but it's still kinda fun
2629	1	a	Drove car into an alligator and blew up. 10/10
2713	1	a	Orion: dino horde is great for those cold winter days when you need to light a wood stove with your computer. 10/10
5693	0	a	Graphics poor. Really bad game. Barely any good gameservers aswell...    Don't kill dinos please for the sake of me   
3552	1	a	I've paid a lot more for games not nearly this good. Halo plus dinos.
2172	1	a	Surprisingly good Action RPG. Combat requires you to time your dodging and blocking and learn the moves of your opponents. Story is pretty good and graphics are beautiful even though its from 2012.
856	1	a	Reinstalled 4 times !
1345	1	a	It has a really good story line, very well made characters, super fun combat style and crafting options. Only thing that I belive truly piiss people off is the jump option, but I think they did an AWESOME job with the game anyway.  It's sad that this game didn't get as popular as it should. I think it's underrated, I love fantasy RPGs and I can say I had loads of fun playing this game. I wont lie, it has a lot of thing that most RPG fans would hate but worth it in the end. It's fun and I say, get it and play, now more then ever because EA games has announced they will release a KOAR 2. So this one first.
1073	1	a	What they've done here is make an action-MMO without the MMO. Oh, and they hired Grant Kirkhope compose the game's brilliant score.  HOWEVER, after buying this game (on sale) I realized that I was duped! EA had their soulless paws on this! Had I known, I would never have given them money. YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS ROUND, EA, BUT I WILL DOUBLE CHECK THE PUBLISHER NEXT TIME! (here's hoping that the sequel--assuming there is one--won't suffer from EA's curse of ruining great series.)  In all seriousness, I love this game, and it will likely replace my copy of skyrim in terms of replay value.
16	0	a	Marvelously fun game. Major set back: Even on the lowest graphics setting, the infernal game chops like there's no tomorrow. I've played 2 hours, then took a break. Now when I try to load her up, the game chops for 5+ minutes till I get bored and quit. And wehn I say chops, I mean the music cuts in and out and you can't interact at all.  The developers have an awesome idea for a game, it's great fun - but unplayable by virtue of their execution.
2480	1	a	It may be a really cheesy game, but metascore is way too low. It has no outstanding features, but playing co-op (especially with friends) is a real blast!!!
4736	0	a	I did not like the game
6012	1	a	This game. It is just simply amazing.   I came into it with the most low hopes I've ever had. It was cheap as hell and everyone was making fun of the people who voted for it to be on the community sale. I decided to see what all the uproar was about and made the 5 dime plunge. Plugged in my 360 controller (supported) and to my delight, the game handled brilliantly. The controls are nice and tight. With sprinting, crouching, sliding, jumping, jetpacking... the works. It feels like many a AAA shooter I've played in the past.  Nothing is really explained. You have to dive in head first and just experience it. It plays like a mix of Dungeon Defenders + Sanctum + Turok = WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY COMPLAIN ABOUT.  Seriously though, buy the 4 pack and give the copies to some like minded buddies for a weekend (or much, much more) of zany bliss.
5635	1	a	Hi-tech guns, light sabers, jetpacks, invisibility cloak, and Dinosaurs. Killing Dinosaurs have never been this fun. Especially when youre with your friends or with a stranger.
5100	0	a	not a very good shooter. Good if you have no money and a subpar computer .
1762	1	a	What can i say about Amalur, it is a RPG but one different from everything you have seen before without forgeting the true nature of RPG games. Recommended to all those looking for something new. 
5650	1	a	Buy now whilst it's cheap!
535	1	a	Since it's on sale today for 4,99â¬ there is no reason to pass on this. Amazing RPG with good combat, story and graphical it's very nice.   The DLC you want to buy with this are: -Legend of Dead Kel -Teeth of Naros
1833	1	a	Game is amazing. Get it. PIck magic. Have fun.
2605	1	a	Best game I ever played.
4760	1	a	Killing dinosaurs was never this easy!
4498	0	a	Not worth even 99 cents !!!  Don't buy IT !!!   Too booring!!!
1948	1	a	Ive barely scratched the surface (12hrs in and barely scratched the surface) but this game is incredible!  You like Skyrim (Elder Scrolls games)? You like Fable? You like Trines visual style?  YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME  Tons of quests, a â¥â¥â¥â¥-off-MASSIVE world, so much to see and the lore is deep.  Grab a helmet and prepare to crossclass
1317	1	a	I heard that this was at first going to be an MMO, but turned into a single-player game, which is good as far as I'm concerned, because I held off on playing this for a while. It's a pretty standard open world action RPG that stands out for its combat and personalized feel, but it drops the ball in a few places that certainly hampered my enjoyment.  To get the basic stuff out of the way; The visuals work. Subpar texture quality is masked with a cartoony art style and lots of visual effects. The music is memorable, but repetitive, as is the nature for these games. The voice acting is excellent, although sometimes it can be difficult to tell underneath sometimes cringey writing.  The combat is the best part of this game. The best parts of RPG character building meet the scale and feeling of spectacle fighters. Fast, fluid control keeps the battles from feeling too clunky, and the player is given a wide variety of choices with which to handle fair challenges. There is no artificial difficulty here...  Unless we're talking about the camera, one of the game's biggest flaws. The only way to properly target enemies requires moving the camera onto them, and since most enemies come in groups, this means that a large portion of the action will usually be happening off-screen. If I decide to keep the camera focused more on them and less on the enemy I want to hit, my attacks automatically gravitate towards these other opponents. Sometimes, the camera follows an enemy that I knock off a ledge and glitches out for a few seconds. I can't begin to explain how many fights took a bad turn because of crappy camera angles. It ruins what is otherwise a perfect combat system. What this game needed is a targeting button, or attacks that prioritize movement direction over camera control.  Another issue the game has is atmosphere, in the same way Skyrim did. At first, this may not seem like such a big deal, what with the various skills and crafting and unique customizations, along with that huge map. However, scale and robust character tailoring are only half of what makes depth in an RPG such as this. The other half is an immersive game world that both makes sense and is fun to spend time in, and that's where the game loses its footing.  For example, it's nice that the player can rent beds in the various taverns throughout the world. It fits in with the rather generic RPG fare, which is fine, but how often did I end up actually using this feature?  Once. I used it once in the entire â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, plus the expansions, plus a second playthrough. The only reason I used it was because I had to kill time until night so that I could do a specific quest. Otherwise, if I needed a bed, I could just go to one of my houses, which also provided several other helpful services. Even then, most of my visits were simply about inventory management, as the game is extremely generous in keeping the player alive and well anywhere.  The fact is, 99% of the time, the taverns have no reason to exist, which is funny, because I can think of several ways, off the top of my head, how they could have been put in the game while still being useful. How about giving the player a temporary bonus for staying in a rented bed? Or charging gold for fast travel, to perhaps make the world seem a little bigger? Or having more quests that demand completion at a certain time of day? Granted, none of these are perfect solutions, but they have been tried successfully in other games.  There are plenty of other things that make this game feel a bit hollow, like the faction 'system' that is clearly just an excuse to have long lines of sidequests, instead of factions that actually interact with each other and treat the player as more of a group member than an inevitable hero (coughElderScrolls2cough). There are also the characters who are supposedly so important but never need to be spoken to more than once or twice, which could have simply been expanded upon with a few extra sidequests. I could go into more detail about these, but this review is already getting too long.  My verdict: It's still an okay game, despite its glaring flaws. It feels average, even mediocre at some points due to the lack of depth that I already touched upon, but is otherwise a most enjoyable waste of time that went all-out in terms of player customization.
6063	1	a	How did i manage to review this game? I don't own it.
2722	1	a	If you play games with a group this is a hands down awesome game for the price.  on another note I was able to trade this game for ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS   Dinos for Rockets   10/10 would trade again  It's like syrim with dinos and guns 10/10 ~ IGN
1725	1	a	Really fun game.. it has a Fable like combat system but was a more fun game then Fable 3. Graphics are good, not the best and a little 'cartoony' at times, but they serve the purpose. The fun in this game really rests on it's combat system and story. There is a lot of lore, story is deep and well done. It's really not a very hard game, I have played a Mage and a Melee Warrior and while the Mage is powerful, the Warrior is downright unkillable. If you need a fun game to sink a lot of hours into, this is a good choice. I dig it.
1262	1	a	PROS:  Very close to true open-world with rewards for exploring TONS of quests and sidequests including multiple faction lines Visually pleasing Fable-like graphics Combo chain attacks Crafting system for equipment and potions Usual thief/mage/warrior options as well as some minor encouragement to try duel-specing Interesting NPCs with really fantastic voice acting Really fun story  CONS:  Not very well balanced Buggy: some repeating crashes, quest marker glitches, etc. Download the widescreen fixer if you want to save yourself from getting dizzy Overabundance of quests+respawning mobs+in-game mechanic to increase xp+not great scaling system = you can easily overlevel yourself Stuff that feels unfinished: quest items that get perma-stuck in inventory, can't craft accessories, etc. Equipment crafting system at higher levels requires a lot of luck (read: quicksave/reloading) but even at highest levels can't beat found/bought equipment in all cases   OVERALL:  If you want a game that will absorb you for a good number of hours as you run around talking to a million people, navigate massive towns, do crazy numbers of sidequests, and get immersed in a fantasy world that's a little less Tolkien and a little more Fae, you'll enjoy this game.  However, those who care more about mechanics will have complaints. It's very easy to get overleveled, which can make all those many quests feel a bit like dull repetition. I discovered that I'd missed a whole faction quest at low level because I didn't realize I was allowed in an area, but because scaling maxes based on area, I spent the whole time OHKOing everything and then didn't even make enough money to offset my equipment repairs.  Speaking of equipment:  So, you can craft equipment out of pieces you buy or salvage by breaking down other equipment. Salvage works on a somewhat random system that can require dozens of reloads to get what you want. At high blacksmith skill, you can work an enchanted gem into an item so that, when you salvage it, you MIGHT get a crafting piece with the stats of the gem (or a little better).   However, you can find and buy equipment with gem 'sockets' which allow you to freely (at a small cost until you max gem-crafting skill) swap gems into and out of that equipment. And those pieces can also have inherent bonuses of their own. There's also a top-tier rank of gems that only fit into a slot that can only exist on a chestpiece, that can't be crafted into a homemade armor.  So, you could spend a ridiculous amount of time crafting items, reloading until you salvage what you need, and then crafting your masterpiece equipment, but it would only get you close - not all the way - to the best armor you could find just by getting a lucky loot from a kill. And the 'unique' and 'armor set' items can't be salvaged and don't have gem sockets, so while the gimmick of the set bonus might be nice in early game, by halfway through the game such items are just money that's taking up inventory space.  I have a LOT of little complaints, which by themselves don't seem like much but added together feel clunky: - The lockpicking minigame has only a few preset unlock positions, but the 'wiggle' time on a wrong position is so low that you still need to stock up on a million lockpicks to play a broken minigame - Repeatable sidequests ('Tasks') can't be turned off, so the quests markers will always show, the items will sit in your inventory, and they'll take up space in your quest log (and I've run into bugs that seem to trigger on having too many quests currently open) - You can't change the game resolution unless a character isn't loaded and you're at the main menu. This is never explained anywhere and drove me crazy. - The game is ridiculously dizzy with the spinning camera in close-up. If you get this game, check the game guide with information on downloading the free widescreen fix utility because otherwise you won't survive. - Walking back through entire dungeons because there's no shortcut back to the entrance, or, worse, when there's an exit into an outdoor space for the boss fight but for some reason you can't fast-travel from it.   THE BOTTOM LINE  I could go on for a while about the issues I have with this game. I think that if EA took the time to release a patch or two, this could be a really great game. However, when I hit post, I'm going to go back to playing (and finishing) this game, so overall, I recommend.
4407	1	a	I'm almost ashamed to say that this game is stupidly awesome. It's HALO crossed with Jurassic Park. Co-op play is really fun.  Dozens of weapons, ability upgrades, maps. Lots of game modes including PvE, PvP, PvPvE. You can even play as a dinosaur and eat your friends. Custom (Prehistoric) difficulty is where it's at. There are vehicles, explosions, jetpacks and much, much more.  The persistent leveling system unlocks permanent bonuses; if you ever get the itch to feel like a complete badass, this game is for you.  The best $1 you will ever spend. Just do it.
2573	1	a	fun and amazing I love it. one of the best Dino games I've played
5578	0	a	It's pretty bad, unfinished and full of microtransactions (not pay to win, only cosmetic). Overall....it's free and I still didn't my money's worth.
1566	1	a	very good and quite beautiful game. Graphics is very solid and the wold is very charming but there is something missing
3103	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, don't need many words, one of the best games i've ever played, i've been going back to origins since games do bore me alot nowadays and when i tried this game (without any prior knowledge of it's existence) it was such a wonderful experience i can't wait to play it again every time i come home, just try it, don't bother with the reviews, TRY IT!
3173	1	a	Got it on sale for .49 cents. Played for 2 hours and it was a blast. So far that about 25 cents to the hour. 10/10 would give two quarters again to get this game. Don't even think about it, just get it.
6325	1	a	really good gameplay the dinausors bug and fly in the sky from time to time but apart from that i really recomend it and its almost free
3997	0	a	Its like Jurassic Park, Halo, and Call of Duty had an abortion. Nothing else to say about it.
5840	0	a	These devs are bad for the community. Stealing assets and lying to customers.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC_-6U_93rU

3137	1	a	54 cents Hour Download Instant Regret. 11/10 Not Halo
6303	1	a	I keep getting picked up by flying dinosaurs and then dropped 1 mile down. 10/10 would be swept up by a Rhamphorynchus again.
1268	1	a	very fun game that is full of loot and is similar to dragon age.worth the price!
3994	0	a	Hard on any pc even with graphics on the lowest setting... Take care when playing.
692	1	a	***** Highly recommended. Spent a riduculous amount of time in this game (think Fallout)
4119	1	a	Love this game!
2416	1	a	My mum bought this for me and told me this is COD:GO the dinomen mod but there was not enough black men without eyes. - Halnoter Jafin
965	1	a	Apart from reckoning mode and some combat aspects, this is just like a generic singleplayer MMORPG. It's sorta fun though and it looks (and runs) nice. Worth the money I guess.
5628	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no
3334	1	a	metascore means nothing for this game. 36 my â¥â¥â¥. 8/10
1862	1	a	Solid rpg with a heap of content, good combat system would certainly advise rpg fans to give it a go!
4675	1	a	I think that despite the criticism that orion prelude has been given I think it is a very solid game... for only ONE dollar. Its so cheap that it doesnt have to be good but they still made it decent. It is a vey fun arcade shooter and I would say it is the most casual out of the three dinosaur shooters that I own. Its a great game to buy a friend who has naver used steam perhaps and is multiplayer so you can play together. It is very satisfying to kill large hoards of dinosaurs. Personally I would have liked to see a few more guns as well as bigger differces between the character classes that you can choose. It is also too easy to camp because of the jetpack although there is a brid that will sometimes pull you off your camp spot after a while. Lastly there are not so many servers for the vast number of gamemodes that the devs have created.  Pros: -fun arcade shooter -cheap -decent graphics -good game balance -many dinosaurs -many gamemodes -good powerups -multiplayer (you can make your own lobby)  Cons: -repetetive after a certain amount of rounds -some glitches -maps are sometimes too easy to defend -few guns -classes dont do much -after upgrading guns and armour ect the game can become unbalanced -Should be different types of bosses in harder levels, not just more of them   
1242	1	a	I kinda surprised by this game it has good level designs, scenery and vibriant colors that screams classic fantasy game. The number of quests in this game(for a single player game) is huge, the main storyline is also pretty good as well. The combat system in this game was also something I really liked, sometimes it's just hack and slach and sometimes you have to be strategic.  The only problems that i had with this game was the poor variations on character design on NPC's, they differ but not much. the seccound thing is that you don't realy seems to be able to connect to any other NPC's then those in the main story line, which i find a little bit dull. Why that is can maybe lay in the fact that even if there is a massive account of quests there is only like 3-4 quests per city and almost only one per quest giver, which results in that thier gratitude seems less appreciated.  But overall I liked it :)
5301	0	a	This game is really not that well developed. The graphics are very good but the game is not optimized well at all. I only get about 50-60 fps on max settings with a gtx 760. I can run more demanding games past 100 fps. Also not to mention th animations for the dino's are very cheap looking and in all I really wouldn't reccomend this game. The servers are not hosted by the game developers which means someone will be hosting the game through their internet so if they lag the whole game does and almost every game I joined everybodys ping was through the roof.
5132	1	a	i played it... But, The Animations of the Dinosaurs and the People are sucky. cool and awesome graphics though! R-Really Awesome Grapics!
173	1	a	I think this game is amazing, I sunk 25 or so hours in before even touching the main story line. To me, it feels like everything Skyrim could have been. The graphics are quite good, the look and feel is great, the voice acting is decent, quests are varied in a number of ways and the combat is amazing. Althoguh it doesn't do anything insanely special, it does a lot of stuff really, really well, making it a very polished game.  The one thing that annoyed me quite a bit, as I frequently used reskilling as a way to keep the game and combat fresh and exciting, was that there were always a number of skill points that were wasted on things I didn't need or use but were required to unlock the next tier of skills.  Very good game all around though, I hope more games come out with well rounded quality like this.
576	0	a	I was really looking forward to this game, but in retrospect I probably shouldn't have bothered playing it. This game wastes your time with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sidequests at any given opportunity (and a boring main quest). However, the scenery is very nice in places and they did at least TRY to make interesting combat, but it becomes very repetitive after the first quarter.  It's definitely not the worst game I've played, and I can understand people enjoying it as a mindless time-killer, but I cannot recommend it.
5105	0	a	I do not recommend this game considering it was gifted to me by a friend to play early, now they want more money again. Something wrong there. Not worth it as far as im concerned.
375	1	a	Truly a work of art. If you enjoy fantasy and stories that explore The Forgotten Realms, then you might want to try out this game. R.A. Salvatore, author of The Legend of Drizzt series, puts his influence into the world of Amalur and helps create a beautiful world to explore and fierce creatures to slay. A streamlined combat system makes it easy to get into the game and enjoy any class or play style, while offering those looking for a challenge a little fun too with combos and flourishes to master.
4937	1	a	Epic graphics, Epic weapons, Epic cars, Epic helicopters! Even better with friends!
3689	0	a	The only thing that is cool about this game is that you get to shoot dinos otherwise it is like quake went stonage minus the fun.
472	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that is well known for its customization, while this is its most strong point, I would like to take the time to point out some of the other incredible things about this game.  While the story is kind of lacking in tying into the Lore of the world of Amalur, it does a fantastic job of being a gripping story. You will grow to love each and every character that you meet in the storyline, but there are some you will grow to hate as well. The Voice-Acting is superb, but the level designs are very hit or miss, some landscapes are beautifully crafted and are visually stunning, but there are some that are very much so lacking in beauty and are very poorly designed, that you'll have to empty out your vomit bag after you clear the area. HOWEVER, this are minor setbacks compared to what this game can offer for only 19.99$, I personally rate it as an 8/10, with it also being one of my favorite games of all times.
4465	0	a	Hilariously bad coding, icons quite possibly stolen from Apple's iOS, and unintentional surrealism (read: bizarre ragdolling) combine to produce a quite mediocre dino-killer surprisingly reminiscent of Halo (with dinosaurs), but nowhere near as good.
6366	1	a	Shooting dinos with big guns - almost the best way to let off some steam. Second to having sexual intercourse.
2438	1	a	no one told me it had dinosaurs, completely misleading.
2578	1	a	What Jurassic Park could have been if it had a good director like Michael Bay.
3372	1	a	Very fun game at a cheap price and is worth a dollar. It's pretty much Halo with dinosaurs instead of aliens. 7.5/10
4116	1	a	if it was crap first, they fixed it now. Reminds me of a mix between Section 8: Prejudice and Killing Floor. stupid not to get it at one eurodollarz
1491	1	a	It's everything you can expect from an RPG.
3358	1	a	Fun game if lacking a little polish in some areas, the Metacritic score is years out of date from many patches, updates, and free DLC added onto the game. It's greatly improved since the initial reviews and is pretty fun. A very big update is coming later in 2014 that will improve the game even more. If you picked this up during the $1.00 sale, congrats on a great deal!  Graphics: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 User Interface: 6/10 Replayability: 8/10 Innovation: 7/10  Overall: 7.7/10 Summary: Good game, great idea for a game. With some tweaks to the engine and a few more bug fixes Dino Horde will easily be an 8/10 game. 
5559	1	a	CoD Ghosts:  - Kids on multiplayer - Spamming on Voice Chat  - Very High Price - Unrealistic Gameplay while game takes place in this universe - Crappy graphics  This game: + Great multiplayer experience  + No voice chat for spamming + 0.79 cents + Fantasy FPS with an alternate universe + Still better graphics than CoD. 
3946	0	a	Peter the Pterodactyl killed my friend
3612	1	a	This is one of the greatest steals on steam. For the money you would spend on a 2-liter you can have hours of dino-shooting-madness with 3 friends.
5880	0	a	I used to like this game, but with so much things going on with the company and CEO pretending to be victims of Activision's actions, while Activision have the truth, now I can not feel anything about this game but hate, this is disgusting. The game was fun, but now I can't just give my time to this disgusting Company.  Do not buy it, don't give your money to this **messed** up company.
5488	0	a	I tried it for 20 minutes and I want my 20 minutes back.  I wanted to give it a chance to see if it felt like a good shooter. It doesn't feel like a good anything. Even if it was a real piece of human excrement, it wouldn't feel like a good piece of human excrement. The weapons have ridiculous recoil, but sound more like stapleguns. I could forgive the late 90's graphics if the game had a good feel to it, but they couldn't even come close to the combat feel of something like Goldeneye.  On sale for 74 cents, eh? Free would be too expensive.
5621	1	a	STAY AWAY FROM ME DINO!!!! &gt;:V ILL KILL YOU!!!! 10/10 would run from the dinos again!!!!
3877	1	a	If this game was a dinosaur it would be a 'pretty-good-for-a-dollarsaurus.'
2024	1	a	This game rock. If anyone wants to be my friend just add me to your list. ^_^
481	1	a	Awesome RPG game. Fantastic combat. Compelling story. Delicious visuals. Pick this one up while it's on sale!
4665	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
1052	1	a	Not the best rpg, but still a fun time, get it while steam sale is on. Combat is great. only bad thing is im having a sound issue.
5667	0	a	This game is completely reprehensible filth. Even the low price tag cannot justify this 'game'. I bought two copies, one for me and my friend. We played for a while and had many technical difficulties. Let it be noted that we do not have poor computers or low specs. He was experiencing lag for a lack of a compatability pack that wasn't installed with the core download. It gave no notice that it would cause issues and no method of installing it after.   The gameplay was abhorent. I've played Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, and it was significantly more complete than this. I literally could not find an aspect of gameplay that was complete or satisfying. The dinosaurs AI is dumber than a stump, and their animations are just repeatedly walking into you while your screen has a violent red seizure. The graphical fidelity is not present. These visuals aren't bad necessarrily, there just isn't any style or charm. They're similar to the Call Of Duty graphics. Bland. There was no impact from the gunfire and shooting guns seemed to be problematic. A core element of the game was not even functional. The vehicles are awful. It's similar to driving a ghost from Halo without any physics. The sounds were generic, similar to stock sounds you can find online or on YouTube. The music wasn't even something I acknowledged was present. It's bland. The game modes are just sitting there and fighting bland generic raptors. There is no exploration, there is nothing interesting. You stand there, shoot raptors and then die. The servers are dead empty for a reason.   DO NOT BUY  This is the WORST game I have ever paid for on Steam. Thank god for refunds.
3149	1	a	This game somehow makes many old concepts work together and feel new and innovative. It's a whimsical kind of awesome; you can fly around with a motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing lightsaber fighting a T-Rex.
1370	1	a	Excellent story, fantastic scenery, and as large as Oblivion. The game is third person and totally scripted but has a large open world with plenty of side quests. The only problem is the final battle; which in the PC version becomes impossible to beat because it switches to a long view with large crystals blocking the view. This seems to be a major coding error and there is no work arround for now. As long as you don't mind not winning the Final battle the game is an excellent value.
3893	1	a	This game is very good, you have dinosaurs and â¥â¥â¥â¥, very dramatic. I like, good weapons, strong and powerful. It is game for real men and fake women
4107	1	a	This game is amazing and suitable for kids to play
4363	0	a	Runs poorly for the size of the maps and the graphics.
4600	1	a	it is rilly fun
5111	1	a	this game is great!!!!!!
2378	1	a	Quite a bizarre experience, actually. On the one hand, this game is very buggy and unbalanced, its sound design is just weird... BUT on the other hand, you are killing (and roadkilling) a handful of FAHKIN' dinosaurs and flying around using jetpack. It's kind of like a mix of EDF, Halo and maybe a little bit of Tribes. It could be better but it is good for what it is. ...why do I even enjoy this
6014	1	a	It's a good game for how cheap it is and if you have a bunch of friends playing it can be a laugh. However it would be nice if the devs implemented some gun sounds xD
5964	0	a	...
6110	1	a	A stegosaurus was coming right for me, but I was okay because I cloaked at the last second. 150000/10
1547	1	a	I bought this game on sale for 11 dollars, DLC included, and I must say this is a game I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did. I can't point out any major flaws. The graphics are cartoony, but the game really makes it look better than that. The combat reminds me of my old childhood days playing Fable and other old school RPG games, and this game is just that- a modern old school RPG. I haven't beaten the game yet, however even as far as I am into it the story is very interesting, and you always want to find out what happens next, and it always brings you back in. With many side quests, and countless smaller features such as the leveling system, this game is deserving of a 9/10 in my book. I can compare it mostly to the Fable series, with it's cartoon/fantasy graphics, it's UI, and combat. I'd reccommend this to anybody who is nostalgic of the RPG games of the yester years. Would scrape and lick.
5894	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the unnistall button.
88	1	a	5/10  Runespell: Overture is a single-player turn-based RPG that uses poker rules and the game takes between 8-10 hours to complete. Combat involves setting up poker combinations (flushes, full houses etc.) with different combinations dealing different amounts of damage. You can use your own cards or even steal individual visible cards from your opponents. Dealing and receiving damage builds 'rage points' (essentially mana) that can be consumed to use spells (damage spells, defense spells, etc). I would recommend this game for someone who wants a throwaway game to occupy a bit of time.  Pros: - Easy-to-grasp gameplay concept - Novelty poker rules are interesting in the RPG genre  Cons: - Forgettable 'plot' - weak story - Can be frustrating at times due to the RNG nature of cards
3034	1	a	Not A Bad Game
987	1	a	Game looks nice, but it is made for playstation, so little bit worst controling. But it is acceptable. Game looks perfect, nice combat, and looks there will be lots of fun. I just gut bad luck, coz I already played TES: Skyrim, so I DONT RECOMMEND it if you already play that, coz nothing cannot be compared with that and others RPGÂ´s wont be playable :) If you dont play skyrim I DO RECOMMEND for you! :)
4616	1	a	I think this game is pretty fun, but I cant say that I like the devs. Most of the reviews that are negative have to do with the devs, just disreguard that stuff. This game is $1 This game is 100% worth $1 I wouldn't say that its worth $20 by a long shot
5314	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game
1316	1	a	Actually a very solid RPG. Not the best, but still very much worth your time.
2277	1	a	The game is $1. You pay $1 dollar to play Halo, Killing Floor, and Quake at the same time. You also get a lightsaber. What's not to love?
2259	0	a	This game really upset me. First of all I would, say that this game worse that Disciples II. Icons of units dont understandable. Secondy, where is mountain clans? Thirdly, too easy to conquer capitals. Finally, this battle web is so awful. 4/10
4615	0	a	bought this game as a joke after betting with my friend whether this game is worth a $ . played this game only for cards and later deleted this game . 10/10 would rate meh8/h8
72	1	a	This game is addictive as hell. (For a card game)
4888	1	a	Its an amazing game, cheap and so worth the money. I'd definite suggest it, but i will warn you that the graphics could use some work, as well as the frame rate, if they could fix that, this game would be out of this world!
2726	1	a	We were mowing down a bunch of little annoying dinosaurs with machine guns then a giant T-rex came out of nowhere with an ear-shattering ROAAAR and ate my friend in one bite.  9/10 would watch my friend die horribly right in front of me again
3411	1	a	Dinosaurs + Guns...what can go wrong?
59	1	a	Runespell: Overture - Solid 7/10 TL:DR; Looks like a port from Mobile, but plays well enough to let you enjoy it. Good graphics, bad sound, decent gameplay idea.   Graphics: 8/10 Game appears behaving like a typical mobile title, with big icons, colourful sprites, single click interface. This is rather small title, so not much can be expected - but it does not disapoint anywhere.   Sound: 5/10 Absolutelly atrocious music, unfit for a title, where you need to pause for a while and think about your choices.  Sound effects are average to say at best, nothing that will make a lasting impact or increase immersion. Could be worse.  Storyline: 7/10 There is a story line, suprisingly, quite decent one. There seem to be no nonsense in story arcs, characters do all fit the setting. Unfortunatelly dialogues are absolutelly atrocious. You have a medieval world full of legends with dialogues using words from modern teenagers dictionary. Unpolished dialogue lines are possibly the greatest issue I had while playing that game (after I turned off the music).  Gameplay: 7/10 There are issues with a screen display and game settings not being saved correctly.  This is quite visible, because the game is best played in 30m to 1h bursts rater than as single continuous experience.  And the experience is sometimes uneven.  This game features poker-like mechanism of matching cards in 5 sets of poker type hands to perform 'attacks' that damage health of your opponens. This is as fun as it sounds, but wait, there is more! You can steal cards from your opponent hand, you have runecards (effectively magic, limited use), companion cards (unlimited use), passive cards that increase your stats.  This extra layer of cards is put separate from your regular playing cards that you match during a duel.   This is as cool as it sounds, however the single duel can take a long time and its outcome is quite often random - as the card you get are randomized - which means that in 30m of gameplay you will have 3 to 5 duels (five being lucky) and some story line.  Past that it is really repetitive and that is why playing this game in short sessions is recommended.  Solid 7/10, recommend buy if a fan of a genre, wait for sale if not.
2243	0	a	I really tried to get into this game, but it just never was a disciples 2 game. The combat doesn't match, the art style is nice, but doesn't match. Not having the dwarves ruins the game too. I want to burn this game.
3437	1	a	It's like PlanetSide 2, with dinosaurs!
688	1	a	i am enjoying playing this but the small amount of classes and races seems to bore me quickly.
2047	1	a	This game had a lot of hype and usually that leads to a letdown. But with this game i didn't get that at all I enjoyed every minute playing this game.  It's sad the developer is dead and no new content will be available. The DLC came very cheap in a bundle sale. and added many more enjoyable hours to the game.  If you like singleplayer RPGs this is a must play in my book.  Camera control is sometimes strange with the zooming in and out. but thats one of the only cons i've really seen from it.  This game is worth every penny even without a sale.
2078	1	a	This is literally one of the best RPG's you can buy, it often goes on sale for 5 bucks.  Please note this game is LONG, don't expect to beat this in a weekend. I've beaten it through 3 times on the PS3, and working on PC now.  
1830	1	a	I really enjoy this game, it's got a fun story line, and reminds me of the first Fable game mixed with world of warcraft.. but in a completely single player style. You have to play on the hardest mode if you want any sort of a challenge though. I hooked my x-box remote up to my pc, and it plays pretty fun. :)
952	1	a	The game was a lot of fun to play - good adventure and quests. It would have been nice if the developers had included adjustable difficulty levels - it was a little too easy towards the end of the game. A sequel would be really cool.
1072	1	a	The game is better than I expected! It's very similar to Fable where the same character can change their combat role based on their armor and weapons. And the functionality of controlling your character is similar too. One thing I really like is that the battle system predicts which targets you want to strike, and as you turn the environment blurs to give you the illusion of motion.   So far I'm enjoying it a lot, and the featured price is a great deal!!!
2652	0	a	Regret: The game  what seems like an awesome concept becomes boring after 10 minutes. Avoid like the plague.
4854	1	a	Awesome game! I was able to get it for â¬0.99 and I have to admit that the game is really worth it!  I love playing this with a bunch of friends, good times! :)
4671	0	a	  A masterpiece that revolutionises the gaming industry. Truly a spectacle to behold. The best game in my library without a doubt. Worth every cent.
3222	1	a	I gave this game a yes only because Valve does not give us the option of a 'meh' or 'Decent' option. Let me go through this with you shall i? The game is loads of fun, if you are a fan of Killing Floor you will ADORE this game. If you love the art style of Halo and the feel of Halo you will ADORE this game. If you lik fast paced FPS games like Quake or Doom you will ADORE this game. It is all of these elements rolled into one with an added bonus of awesome DINOSAURS! However, perfection i not with out its hidden flaws.   These flaws have been reported as crashing upon starting the game or even just browsing for servers (wich thankfully i have yet to experiance though apparently it can be fixed by verifying game cache), the gun and other sound effects not loading up or working and finally (the one i am suffering through) Lag. Now there ae two types of lag to this game, regular internet lag (as i have seen most the people on here or the less populated servers you can access for play are foregin in nature IE im American and joining a primarily German server) but then theres graphical lag. This being the lag where you must lower the settings to the lowest or have major slow down. This issue is usually fixed by reducing the screen size but unfortunatly the resolution only gors to 1270x720 and no lower. The only way to truly fix this is if the resolution could go lower making it less of an issue to render and work the PC more. I have resorted to playing in windowed mode on 1270x720 but even then with alll the graphic settings set to low i lag HORRIBLY.   Outside of that tiny lag issue and bugs that can be patched the game is fun and offers hours of enjoyment and is a fun party game for survival mode. Highly recommended of a pick up but i would more or less wait till the bugs are ironed out (i believe the game isn't a full release yet not totally sure)   PICK IT UP AS I AM SURE THE .99c PRICE WILL CHANGE VERY SOON!
4987	1	a	10/10 would play for never 
4449	0	a	They changed the name of this game several times. The name changing is so out of hand that the review on the game's page is from the wrong game. It's constantly being discounted to 99 cents for a reason. Not very fun, and multiplayer is a real challenge to get working. Plus no one plays it. Still doesnt feel like a polished game for some reason.
2375	1	a	10/10. Would shoot baby dinosaur in the face in front of dinosaur family again.
5083	1	a	one of the only games where im better than everyone else one of the only games that cost 99 cents and i ask why a game where you can get chewed up though a wall  34/16
2366	1	a	The year was 1967. We'd just been deployed in the delta to keep the Cong and NVA from approaching some of the major trails. I was trudging through one of the tree covered marshes, soaked to the core, wondering what the hell I'd gotten myself into. We were two minutes away from setting up an M249 on a rigged turret when out of nowhere what looked like a pterodactyl flew down and exploded, killing four people in my unit. From there on out, it was hell, neon lights everywhere, and then the god damned t-rex had to come in and stomp our â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Either way, this is a 10/10 simulation of Vietnam War II's opening, with Far Cry Blood Dragon acting as a good reenactment of the end of VWII. May the t-rexes of the world rot where they stand.
2725	1	a	Worth every penny!
5054	1	a	I am able to pursue my dreams as a dinosaur hunter. I also punched a T-rex in the face. My life goals are complete.
4138	0	a	Dang it. why did I let myself get fooled by the trailer. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. And it looks so GOOD in the trailer, lightsabers, mechs, dinosaurs. sounds like a recipe for fun.  Unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt fun. guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt fun. No tutorial what so ever isnt fun. microtransactions arent fun. And gameplay elements that are terrible.   I gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a human is run right at them. No way to out manouver, and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds.. Even as a human the game felt grindy and unpolished. You can unload TONS of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a bad looking blood splatter. Now, I don't usually care if graphics are bad. But I want my bulltes to line up with my fire, I want to not be the wrong colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning, I want what feels like a complete game for my money.  At this tage, I have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver.   EDIT: Ok they have recently made an update that seems to follow a particular theme, that theme, is that the devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport, adn are constantly improving the game, basically all the issues I covered here have been fixed. so the game is ok now.
2560	1	a	The first time I was killed I was dropped 200 feet to my death by a pterodactyl.  Fun game to play for an a short time period. I can't sit and play it at length like I can a lot of games, but if you're looking to waste an hour or so it's a great game for it.
5647	0	a	Today's Review: Orion: Prelude (Formally Orion: Dino Horde)  Let me tell you a story about a bunch of 'developers' that thought that would be a great idea to launch an indie game, poorly optimized (i'll say not even tried), multiplayer game with dinosaurs and guns (FPS) and how they fail at the point they had to drop permanently the price from 9.99 to 0.99 due the fact that no one will ever buy this crap or accept it for free, because they game sucks in every posible way, and i've played the slaughtering grounds, ride to hell retribution, RAMBO and other crappy games and this one it's the worst one, but hell, they reach steam without even passing trought greenlight so, there.  I'm not even gonna put a score to this crap, stay away from it!
4815	0	a	Pretty damn horrible even after 60+ updates The audio oh god , Sounds like it was made by a retard Grahpics were ok it did render horribly gameplay was ok it could get fun but it was mostly boring  voice actors gave me ebola 3/10
551	1	a	This is one masively underrated RPG in my opinion. A massive world full of people, factions, quests to do, places to explore and experiences to be had, it never received the due praise that it should have received.  Possessing a truly original and authentic story and set in a vibrant world, I keep coming back to this game for more. A non-linear leveling system that actually lets the player customize the game around their own playstyle, and a Fate system that allows for either further customization and giving the player a sence of accomplishment. I wish more RPGs could be as well thought out and beautiful as this one.  For a single playthrough to experience a near full clear will take well over 100 hours, and that does not even touch the DLC. At $40, this is an RPG YOU HAVE TO TRY. The demo includes not only the starter 'tutorial area', but after that you can take to the first zone for 45 minutes and do ANYTHING you want - quests, crafting, gathering, killing NPCs, whatever your heart desires.  I cannot say enough great things about this game. I wish everyone could get as lost in a single game as I did (and still do) with Kingdoms of Amalur.
3389	1	a	Thank god they changed it from a expensive grabage to a cheap masterpiece.
4274	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
5212	1	a	awesome game love it
1693	1	a	A deep RPG, which will keep the hardened role playing fan busy for a while...!
4168	0	a	I purchased this game when it was $1. I mean for a $1 game, this game is decent and actually you can say it's a good price for what you get, BUT at $15, the game is just not worth it. The gameplay is basically what it looks like, slaughtering dinosaurs wave after wave until you just win the game. The gameplay is super repetitive and gets very dull easily, I guess it's a little more fun when you play with friends but still, the gameplay is the same each time. Reading the positive reviews about ORION, I'd have to say this game must have been a lot worse without all the updates it has had. I enjoy the game and all, but I would not recommend it if there are no discounts. There is supposably a big update coming this month, but I will change my review then if my opinion has been altered.  The Pros: - Co-op, play with friends!  - Vehicles: Jeeps, Hovercrafts, Tanks, Robots, and more (Fun!) - Dinosaurs: T-Rexs, Stegosaurus, and some other fairly big ones - Just a LITTLE character customization included  The Cons: - The gist of the game, very dull - Repetitive gameplay - Limited class choices - Small array of guns to select from - Limited amount of players in servers - Limited enemy types, considering it's a dinosaur game, there are a very limited type of species. (All there is is regular raptors, pterodactyls, and the larger version of them, then the big dinos that are similar to bosses) - Limited map selection (Maps have sub selections which allow you to switch the game from day to night and vice versa, but... it's still the same map) - Limited game modes  - There is no real motive to the game, it's just for fun (If you don't include achievements)    
2382	0	a	The compeny behind this game is a real flock of scum bags so don't bother supporting them.
4921	1	a	i cant play it seid i had to donlode what i had 
6218	1	a	bought for 99 cents, had fun with friends for a view hours. not enough content for more then 4 hours.
6215	0	a	For some reason this game gets put on sale multiple times. If you're looking for a hilariously bad game to play with your friends, this is for you.
5802	0	a	bad graphics old game expected it to run fast on my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ laptop and it doesnt 1/10 dont reccomend cant even run on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ laptops
1930	1	a	yes awesome game but sometimes boring
1618	1	a	Plenty of content makes Kingdoms an alluring option for a frugal gamer, but none of the content rises above competent. This is a wholly too long adventure with a bland world, no memorable characters and no quests worth mentioning. Still, for dollars paid and time spent in the world this game does stand out. I just wish it were more fun.
2619	0	a	Thieves plain and simple.
1049	1	a	This is an interesting game. But doesn't have very much replayability. The game becomes repetitive and boring after a while. But the graphics are good, and the mechanics are solid.
4516	0	a	Dont waste your money on this game its really slow for average computers as well as a bad game keep looking for a better dinosaur shooter like primal hunter!
4912	0	a	LAG.......GY......A......S......HE.......CK.....
1580	1	a	Well... I'm sure it's a great game, I was sooo looking forward to playing this game for a long time till i discovered you can't bind the WASD keys to something else. So please allow me to flip the bird to the devs for a crappy port â­â©â®(-_-)â­â©â®
5651	0	a	Ok, i know i haven't even played this game for 30 minutes, even 10 minutes. But here me out anyone looking at this review; the SECOND i got on, i thought this game was GREAT, but it turns out that the loading/menu screens were sexy looking.. When i got into a game and tried to connect; BAM, i lost connection. I tried 12 unsucessful times to get into a game and FINALLY got into one on my 13th try. The second i get into it, what does it say? 'Lost connection to host/failed to maintain connection' so i go back and i try again :P  When i DO finally manage to get into a game, the graphics were poor, the controls were CLEARLY meant for an Xbox 360 controller, NOT a console, and i could barely move around or anything due to that fact. And when i saw the Dinos i nearly â¥â¥â¥â¥ a brick -_-  They were awkward looking things, albeit their obvious attempted graphical enhancements.. so no, i won't recommend this game even though it was 1$  This game HAD good potential back when it came out awhile ago, now, however; it doesn't which is sad to say.  but HEY! who am i to tell people what to do/not to do? Go on and buy the game, try it out for yourself! But this is just my recommendation to NOT play the game. :) enjoy -_-
2284	1	a	You can fight a T-Rex in a mech. That's all you should need to know, unless you live a small, sad existence.  (like the sort of person who makes daily comments on the same Steam review)
4303	1	a	it's like blood n bacon but with dinosaurs!
4080	1	a	so a while back this game was on sale for 0.99 I loved Dinosaurs they were so cool, almost as cool at he game eets muchies 5/5 star game I mean if you wanted to be as cool as the FieryPepper, Definetely By this game! Now into the very detailed and serious review of Orion Dino Horde Like I said this game was 0.99$ when I purchased it Great Price and I LOVED DINOSAURS OMG PERFECT GAME.... thats what I thought, When I found out the point of the game was to fight off hordes OF â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOSAURS I WAS VERY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ OFF, I mean NO WONDER THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ING IS ALWAYS ON SALE IT SHOULD BE LOWERED TO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING 0.00$ â¥â¥â¥â¥, NO NOT EVEN -100$ THEY SHOULD PAY US TO PLAY THIS CRAP MY GAWD...
136	1	a	If you can get past the odd feeling you're playing solo in a cartoony looking MMO, there are tons of fun ahead with this one ! I strongly recommend, especially when on sales !..
3412	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with the starter pistol.  devs pls nerf starting pistol
1384	1	a	This is game is great, you can buy it if you like rpgs. 20â¬ for this is nothing ^_^.
3215	1	a	Halo Clone [check]   Halo Clone with Dinosaurs [check]  that's all folks, not the best game out there, but for 99cents, its well worth it. Highly Recommend to play it with your friends since the servers, well sucks  6/10
5765	0	a	UPDATE ON MY YEARLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME REVIEW   Shock in the gaming community as the developers of ORION once again caught Stealing assets from other games
4935	1	a	Pay .99USD and then 2 weeks latter its free
3897	0	a	Dont buy this. Even for just a doller it is not close to anything near ready to play. Just a warning to people new to steam, if a game is on sale for a ton of and it is not a store wide sale it is not doing good. The driving is made on a 16 sided shape. wich means that you cant just turn right you make wide turns that feel like the game is laging. But no its is just a crap game. The store looked like a thing a young kid made on ms paint, The textures are blurred and ugly. The gun play dosn't work because the engine cant keep up and just feels slow. DONT BUY
3800	1	a	PLease, get this game, its alot of fun you can even do pvp and they are planning a new title to be announced this month or coming one.
4224	1	a	Dinosaur genocide simulator with T-Rexes that do flips.
1051	1	a	Nice game, good mechanics, interesting system with the fate bar.  Good story so far, quite good graphics. Fae Blades (Warglaives!!!).
5571	1	a	Great Game But The 1 Thing Thats wrong is that the dino are way to fast but its a fun game highly recomned
5400	1	a	fockin' bought this game for fockin' 15$ and now it's f2p  fockin' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i tell ya  FOCK Me fockin' british  
1731	1	a	Never finished it. Plan to. What I did play of it was great. Great visual style and a huge (almost linear) world. 9/10
2348	1	a	OH my gosh! Instead of buying that Mountain dew for $1.89 buy this instead, trust me its worth it! (Plus you shouldnt even be drinking Mountain dew...Its bad for you!) Ok to start off this review i'm gonna list some pros and cons for it below.  +PROS+ + Very affordable price + Beatiful visuals (Graphics) + Well made interfaces (Ex: Main menu, shop, in game HUD, all of its great really!) +Voice acting seems pretty good in my opinion + Different classes (their is 3 classes) +Has vehicles (Suck on that cod fans!) + Variety of guns (and are upgradable)  + Awesome devs (They admit the game was bad when it was first released and made it so much better) + Great multiplayer + Lots of maps and game modes + Even better deal when on sale (Dont even know how much lower the price could possibly go but it's great for you penny pinchers xD) +Has a uique art style mixed with dinos (Think Halo style mixed with Jurassic Park!) +Easy to make servers! and work well!  -CONS- - Has glitches (like most every other game also has. Very few are game breaking) - Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well) -Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!) -Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)  =Summary= Overall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after blowing out a dino's brains! Also fun to take your teams vehicle and drive off (without them) and listen to the glorious sound of 'TEAMMATE DOWN!' xD. If you are still hesitating what are you waiting for? You have nothing to lose, try it out!
1815	1	a	I adore Kingdoms of Amalur, let me start by saying that. The game is entertaining, the combat is engaging, and the world looks pretty decent. There are a few glaring issues with the game, though; it's not without it's share of problems. So to help speed this along, I'll just rattle off the good and the bad.  The best thing that Kingdoms had to offer is it's world. It's massive, with optional caves and quests at every corner. There is a ton of stuff to do in the game. I have what, over a days worth of playtime, and I haven't even touched the main quest yet. The world is also nice looking, and while not as nice as say Skyrim is, the world feels more fantastic and mysterious. I have a genuine giddyness when traveling to new areas, as each new area is vastly different. It makes me feel like I did when I played games like Banjo-Kazooie, as each area is different and exciting. The combat is engaging and can be difficult, especially during boss fights. The best way to describe it is and Oblivion style world and crafting mixed with Dragon Age syle conversation and Dark Souls-esque combat.  Now for the shortcomings. The most notable and prevalent is that the game's difficulty drops off drastically as you play. Your character becomes the most OP â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t thing in Amalur, and that makes the game become a lot less fun. Because of all of the optional side quests and fights, your character levels extremely fast. before I left the first area I decided to do every side quest, but by the time I left I was already around level 10. The next areas don't scale well enough for the amount of exp you have if you do everything. Not to mention a lot of quests just seem annoying or dumb when they all basically boil down to 'go and kill certain things for me and i'll give you gold'. Speaking of gold, the economy in this game is super strange. you can get a ton of money just killing things in the world. Now to offset the amount of gold you get, the game makes repairing your weapons cost more and more, but the price of repair kits never changes. It's easily exploitable, and you can hoard gold the entire game. I literally don't spend gold on anything but curse removal and repair kits. Finally the combat is engaging only at first, after you've done every combo and tried all of the weapons, you soon tire of the combat system and each character can get the same combat maneuvers which means one character is enough to try almost everything.  That said, I really do like this game, I just think they messed up a few things along the way in development. The game is fun and exploring the world is charming (though I would like to hear more music) but the lack of difficulty scaling and over saturation of side quests makes this game easy and repetitive. But I absolutely reccommend it to you guys because there is a certain charm to Amalur and the game is an epic RPG that manages to be a relaxing experience throughout.
2970	1	a	Fun little game for very cheap at Â£1, worth buying while on sale!
3927	0	a	It's horrible! The game play is bad, the graphics suck and overall it is horrible quality. Why did I even bother spending money on this garbage.
4879	1	a	Steam tells me I already own this game. I do not. What gives?
3909	0	a	Buy? No.  And that suggestion is after all the praise quotes from the current trailer about the game being improved and deserving a second chance.  Dino Horde is a sequel/successor to Orion: Dino Beatdown with was universally terrible. It is a first person horde shooter much like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, a between round weapon and augment store, and vehicle mechanics from a poor man's Halo. I felt a little disgusted after shooting my first weapon, which had a tinny sound effect and no recoil. Oddly enough, the recoil does come up sometimes. The guns just have this weak and unfinished feel. Dino waves are sent to you at lightning speed and most half-decent teams can wipe them out pretty quickly as they are sent in a couple packs that's easy to spray and pray at. When you're new, you might miss the opportunity to kill enemies or at least get a hit on them so you can get some assist credit. What makes the waves system even more terrible is the pacing. While you do have a variety of enemies, with some being faster than others, fighting them still often ends up being mass killing the Raptor-types, then finishing off the stragglers of larger, bullet sponge dino's and 'godd**ned bats' trope pterodactyls. Killing Floor has a better variety and pacing of enemies, as the speed of different mobs are more noticible and require proper prioritizing and handling by your group depending on the map you're playing.  Ammo is all handled by an ammo pack at the weapon store, so better hope you killed/assisted enough dinos and be able to make it back to the stores far away in the base after the game told you to go to the other side of the map for an outpost. I can accept the texture, model and animation quality for a cheap indie title. I think the texture quality is pretty good in comparison to Killing floor, and the animation is perhaps finicky in some cases, but the dinosaurs generally look life-like. Sound assets are pretty terrible as guns sound weak, majority of the voice acting sounds ham-fisted and terrible, save for maybe the announcer and the female scout, and the same one or two tracks repeat through the entirety of the game - menus, gameplay and all. Vehicles are extra handy in later waves, but can be a pain to drive, and lead to you demise if you get stuck and a Triceratops rams the ride, making it explode. The land hovercraft kept wobbling on the ground and I had annoyances managing the tank. Regardless, the game ended up feeling shallow very quickly - the fun factor wasn't there and I didn't see any reason to stay and level up.  I think the vast majority of the player base are probably younger types who got this on sale/as a gift and may not have much else to play. I'd hate to have played this before all the 'improvements'. There are plenty of better alternatives like Warframe, Payday series, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effecct 3, even Call of Duty Co-ops and Transformers Cybertron co-ops.  That being said, this game seem to have carved it's own niche, as there were a decent amount of active servers to join (like 20 or more), though that could be due to the recent .99 sale. That's probably telling alot about the quality and value of the game if it is going for 93% off when it's not a big Steam seasonal sale. I think kids and teens with more time and less money are willing to deal with this game (in fact, I probably would have been ok with it in my childhood), but adults like myself and most people on my friends list only have limited time and shouldn't waste it on this when there are better alternatives.  Don't buy it.The premise of Dino Horde FPS sounds cool, but you can get a similar and more entertaining as well as solid experience from Killing Floor. Once I got my opinion of the game, I only stayed longer to get my card drops....which I probably shouldn't have because they're pretty worthless.
6002	1	a	1-Make sure you buy weapons xD   2-Let others hit the flying birds. lel  3-fun to play.
3521	1	a	Very easy to pick up and put down. Fun with friends.
660	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Not quite skyrim, not quite WoW; somewhere in between, and I love it!
6166	1	a	Absolutely AMAZING!!!! So worth your money!! JUST GET IT IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI FPS/DINO GAMES!!!!!!! This is a great addition to your first-person shooter collection!
252	1	a	Pretty good, but lacks its own identity (feels like Everquest + Fable, and a dozen other rpgs at once), and suffers from a lot of what makes modern RPGs (even many FPS) suck; being artificially extended with pointless busywork.   90% Sidequests for Deliver this to-, Kill 8 of-,.. 'Hey you're supposed to be a warrior on an important mission to save the world, but can you go fetch my &lt;mundane object&gt;?'  It's certainly not this game's fault. They ALL do that these days because it's an incredibly easy way to flesh out a game. Leveling via uninpired fetch quests isn't so bad in an MMORPG, but its dull as hell in single player games. I'm not anti-sidequest by any means, its just that they're a whole lot more common and less creative than they used to be.  I'd still recommend it for the $5 I paid, though its ~82 metascore feels a bit high. I'd have it closer to 70.
4712	0	a	The frame rate is so low, it is unbelievable, I had an incredibly low resolution setting on, and on an I5 Processor Windows 7 Ultimate hardware and it was unplayable, my friend has a fully working operating Windows 10 Computer, his was still laggy, DO NOT BUY, laggy to hell.
2554	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
2940	1	a	i love this game so much!
6376	1	a	Most enjoyable game I've ever played! Killing dinos have never felt this epic :D
796	1	a	I like this game quite alot and played through the whole game along with one and a half of the DLCs. The big thing about this game is it's upgrade system as your 'class' is determined as you upgrade different things along the three skill trees, might, skill, and will. You can choose one tree to specalize in, two to favor, or go with all three.  I did enjoy the combat but after a while it got pretty old. I eventually found my favorite combination of weapons, (greatsword and charams), and pretty much spent the rest of the game and DLCs doing the same moves over and over again. The game does have a system to let you respend all your skill points and try a different style but I never found a combination of weapons and skills that I liked more than the one I had already found.  Also the enemies got really old too, flinging the same filler enemies at you again and again. If I get ambushed by imps ONE MORE TIME I am going to die!  But now that I got my rage out of the way I do like and recommend this game. I could say the game is worth it's price but who am I kidding? Everything goes on sale eventually and this is somthing I would grab when it does.
5186	1	a	Dinosaurs to sxc for me
3241	1	a	Great Game, Countless Hours of fun, only game i could fight a giant crocodile with a mech :)
5014	1	a	This game is so MLG PRO. People that dislike this game are all n00bs, because the game has de best Graffix ever. Its all about trickscoping the Dinosaurs with Snipar rifles.
2983	1	a	This is the gameplay Call of Duty: Zombies wished it had. Very fluent, groomed and polished little game. Fun playing solo, and an even better time playing online with friends. Rewarding class/tier and weapon upgrades to demolish dozens of Dinos in a satisfying manner. Definately worth the price. 85/100
1486	1	a	I've had a lot of fun with this game. Definitely didn't get as much attention as it deserved. It went in the direction I always felt Fable II should have gone, and for me is a great spiritual successor to Fable. The story was surprisingly good as well, which seems harder to come by these days. That being said, the game's combat is simple as hell and doesn't take long before it starts to feel really bland and repetitive.   7/10
3815	0	a	free to play and didn't get anything for supporting the game, bought it for the original 15$ price tag, it was a complete waste of money
3770	1	a	Good Shooter game! Nice graphic!
5655	0	a	I killed a few mindless dinos while some Australian man yelled at me. Also, the gunshot sounds didn't sync with the animation. Would not play again.
4200	1	a	i say 50 50 and this is a RE releash to put it  This is just a name change and more updated game (just saying) it was called   But back to the point it is a fun good old game  i say it a good game you may love it i find it fun and enjoyable i mentioned the top so you would know but i find it more fun then Cod Ghosts to put it it has a lvling systems and 3 classes
2275	0	a	This 'remastered' edition makes many changes however they seem to mess just as many things up as they fix making it hard to recomend this over the origional, even though both have their problems. I could go into exactly what was good and bad about it but at this point I'd need to replay the game to gather my thoughts again. Comment if you want me to do this... 
4353	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced. The dinosaurs were photorealistic, but I guess you would expect that from a top quality studio like ummm... whoever makes this bloody game. 10/10 very good. btw i love the jurassic park movies if anyone has a spare copy of jurassic park 1 id be happy and id probably blow you. Lots of love Adolf Linkin.
1417	1	a	Slipped under my radar, great game with refreshing combat and visuals. I recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the fantasy RPG genre.
4580	0	a	I just don't like the game, my personal opinion.
6312	1	a	I more or less bought this game basically because the name has 'Dino Horde' in it. I expected it to be completely ridiculous. It is completely ridiculous, but it can be addicting. I mean, what really makes this game worth it is that there is a mode where you can play as the dinosaurs and kill other playable people. I like that. It is hard to get used to at first and they overwhelm you quickly (regular horde mode), but if you play with a group, it is enjoyable.
2048	1	a	Amazing game, does not work on windows 10. Overall runs very well but has random crashes. Seems you can play for ten to fifteen minutes before the game force closes back to the desktop. Untill this is fixed I cannot reccomend on windows 10. Otherwise, Windows 7 or older, buy it, amazing game and art direction.  UPDATE-- Windows 10 users or like me, surface 3 users (non pro but pro would run it as well) open task manager, gp to details, and kill the tabtip.exe. Runs like a charm.
82	1	a	Runespell: Overture was fun. It reminds me a lot of PuzzleQuest, except matching blocks was replaced with competitive solitaire. Build those those trips, quads, and boats to attack the enemy. There's also spells and other typical RPG trappings. Good stuff. It's the first chapter of a larger story. It wasn't that long and the game abruptly ends.
786	1	a	Recommended if you love exploring a vast world, a CRAP TON of loot, new lore, and action RPGS. Not if you love an overly long, incredibly repetitive experience. I give it a 6/10.
20	0	a	Poker meets Solitare - suprisingly shallow puzzle adventure, but if your into poker, you probably can't beat it for the price..
4097	1	a	This game is a fun little title where you fight horde after horde of zombi-, I mean dinosaurs. Even though the game is pretty glitchy I still think that this game is a fun FPS to play with friends. One thing I disliked however is that there is an ingame store that requires real money to make any purchases, which is a shame. Seeing as how the game is on sale now, I would suggest buying it.
2269	1	a	7/10 Not At all like Disciples 2. Way more in=depth. While it has some of the basic functions of other Disciples. it has major differences. Still fun to play and it will challage you. The ai will try to flank you use 'Feign' force to draw you away from it main goal. You will be on your toes the whole time.
645	1	a	This is one of those games that i picked up from blockbuster back in the day on a hunch. turns out my gut was right this is one fun game that has alot to it. I didnt have downloaded content at that time and in a week barely scratched the surface. this game is worth a look at if you are into rpgs and well games that have alot of content to them with the abiltiy to build your character your way since as far as i seen it doesnt matter how you build it
2091	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a third person RPG in a vast fantasy world. Brought to you by R.A.Salvatore (DnD novels' author), Todd McFarlane (Spawn creator), Ken Rolston (Oblivion designer). With such credits nothing could go wrong. Well, almost...  Amalur is a good game, it's almost like third person Skyrim. You wake up as a kinda resurrected John Doe, aka The Fateless, and apart from uniting factions, killing monsters and looting ruins you're gonna avert the end of everything. Because fantasy. The story is staple, but it's not bad, and you'll have lots of sidequests to deal with, and some of these can be quite interesting too. Main character can progress as Sorcerer, Fighter, Rogue, or a mix. There is not much difference really, but some weapons work better with a matching class. All in all game is quite fun and took me almost 70hrs, that's for main quest plus almost all of the sidequests and some achievement hunting.  I liked: * lots of stuff to do and lots of places to visit * your character can use any weapon regardless of the class * some interesting npc characters  I disliked: * normal is very easy * most of the armor pieces are random drops, so it's hard if you aim for a specific set * gfx look a bit dated  Get this: * if you like third person rpg games  Don't get this: * if you don't like arcade'y combat in your rpgs * if you want complex character progression
787	1	a	10/10 would game
2806	1	a	at first i didn't know what to expect from this game. i just had a little money left so i thought sure why not buy it. it was tricky at first because i didnt know how to play and i don't really play these kinds of games anyway so i wasn't to sure to think wether it was good or bad. a group of players helped me with learning how to play and from that moment on i started really liking this game. the dinosaur gameplay i wasn't to crazy about but i loved the weapons. jet packs, mech suits, tanks and things that unleash hell XD. to top it off there are also dinosaurs ofcourse! :D  so yes i do recommend this game it's pretty good for the price...
382	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time! Similar to Skyrim but not much can beat Skyrim. Its a Must Play for RPG fans.
4382	1	a	Wow. Just wow. before i was saying this game is bad because it was having a lot of bugs and glitches. Now with the new update its the best game EU and the cheapest game and awesome i really do recommend this game.  Gameplay 8/10 A.I 9/10 Graphics 7.5/10 Soundtrack 8/10 Multiplayer 5/10 (Because it does not show a lot of players and servers)
4054	1	a	'But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents!' Not only that this game only cost me 99 cents, It's better then some games that I bought at full price.  What I like about this game: -The devs are active in the games development -It's a fresh idea (You don't see alot of Dino killing games, amirite?) -Great Value, and all DLC and Updates are Free! (Who doesn't like free?) -There is a cash shop in where you can buy most items for a doller -The cash shop only sells cosmedics -Tons of Replayability -Mechs, APC tanks, and VTOLs -There's a Lightsaber  What I don't like: -If you join a game late, you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed -If you have bad internet, you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed -Sadly, not alot of people play this game :c  ââââââââââ
146	1	a	I bought the game even though I've never even heard about it. It was on sale, I like RPGs so I thought I'd give it a shot.   The first thing I've noticed or rather heard were the familiar voices from other RPGs. It was great to hear Canderous Ordo from SW: Knights of the Old Republic who gave voice to Agarth. Also you can hear Cullen's voice from DA: Origins. I've figured out more names when I was playing it but I've forgotten most of them now, it was a nice surprise though.  I like the open world, and man it's huge! I've played ~100h and I still haven't discovered every location. Also, each location has different environment which is good because it doesn't get boring (well maybe except caves which are all similar).  The story isn't the best point in the game, the beginning is enough to get you intrigued about it but when I found out the truth I was a bit disappointed. However, a good thing was that I enjoyed every moment that led me to finishing the story. The gameplay is very good, I found it easier to play using controller, but sometimes I found it frustrating that you can only map 4 skills. However, if you have a good feel of your character and combat it shouldn't be a big problem. Another thing that I absolutely loved about it is the possibility of mixing the skills from all trees which allows to make some interesting hybrids. It's a feature that isn't very common in RPGs.   I've found some things that were frustrating for me, for example sometimes when you have a boss fight the camera behaves weirdly, and you don't see the enemy. You just have to move your character to an open space but it's annoying if it happens often. Another things is that, you have to go everywhere on foot. Yes, there is fast travel, but the areas are pretty big and sometimes I wish they've added some mounts. Sometimes it seemed to me I've spent more time walking than fighting...And, one other thing - MORE ALYN SHIR!!! I mean seriously, she was the most interesting character out of all of them and you only interact with her a few times...such a shame. Don't get me wrong, Agarth was quite cool too but...ALYN SHIR!! What can I say, I just love her voice.   When it's on sale again, don't think twice about it, just buy it!  Edit (June 2015): I've just started to play this game again and man, the camera really sucks. You'll die more times because of it than because of your skill, it can get really annoying.
1842	1	a	an awesome game if its mmo it would be legendary
5606	0	a	don't  just don't    Tip: IF YOU SEE A GAME WITH 'MIXED' THE CHANCES OF THAT GAME BEING â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS LIKE 87,25%
3061	1	a	I wish my T-Rex would evolve and get himself an automatic weapon but I guess throwing rocks will have to do. Fun game for a buck and young kiddies like it too. No complaints but hopefully with the next update the raptors will finally get jetpacks...eating guys in space suits sure beats licking tacks.
658	0	a	This isn't a bad game, its just not worth your time.  The best way to describe it is like an awsome MMO from the mid 2000's with nobody on the servers.  The main story is good, but there are SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t fetch quests that just eat up time and you have to do some of them to be an appropriate level to beat the game. There almost all terrible.  The ONLY way I could reccomend this game is if you are an unemployed gamer (no judgment) and want a large amount of time for you buck and don't mind sacrificing gameplay.  If you have a good internet connection I reccomend any good MMO over this game. It will scratch the same itch but better.
749	1	a	This game is fairly Fable-like. Decidedly more sexy, with much lusher graphics, a much wider world, and absolutely ZERO 'Fixed' story.
805	1	a	While slightly lacking with a weak story, still a solid RPG. Kinda like a singleplayer WoW, where lackluster NPCs send you on grind and fetch quests, with a few action packed fights to break up the benality.
4954	1	a	Great game!!  Addicting and simple. 10/10
2313	1	a	36/100 in Metacritic  #1 in my heart
2007	1	a	Extremely good game, with good story and quite colourful. I felt emotionally touched and is definitly worth checking out!
617	1	a	very fluid fighting and interesting rpg elements.
2228	1	a	It's tough, it's got a learning curve as sharp as a knife, and there's almost zero guidance. But my god is the game ever beautiful and full of depth
5507	1	a	Yeah, this game is weirdly fun. But it is quite broken at times.
5660	0	a	makes you buy 5 dollars in funds to get a dollar game wtf?
3623	1	a	'Just Do It' - Shia Labeouf
44	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Puzzle Quest but the computer cheats significantly less. Pretty fun little time killer, a cool take on RPG battles, but luck is a pretty heavy component so be prepared to lose because there are no card to chain sometimes. If you can get it for cheap then why not, it's more engaging than Solitaire for christ sakes.
817	0	a	MMO style single player rpg, too easy even on hard difficulty.
2580	1	a	this is the game of the year, if you dont have this you might as well just give up. buy the 4 pack just for yourself and have pride in having 4 copies of this game. dont trade any of them away. truly a masterpiece of our time 7 flamingos/5 flamingos.
4533	0	a	I paid 16 cents and I feel like I payed too much
1745	1	a	Awesome game! Great combat system and huge world to explore. Everything that Fable could have been, but never was. Well worth every cent
722	1	a	For those who cannot quite afford to get Witcher 3 just yet and are looking for something similar in style, this is a very good substitute. It is older and not as well written, but you can customize you own character and has very fun combat
548	1	a	Great game, lots of fun!
5450	0	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAID FOR THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ NOW ITS FREE TO PLAY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS STEAM WHAT ARE YOU DOING
1629	1	a	I haven't played for to long but i actully im injoying it
6050	0	a	More bugs than Goat Simulator
1850	1	a	Great game, 60 hours of fun playtime.
5902	0	a	Game does not support 64 bit version of windows 7. Go back to the stone age with this garbage
2627	1	a	its got dino hordes i guess 10/10 delivers what it promises  just make sure to hold C to roll out of trex chomps  ( This game used to be called Dino Horde )
3864	1	a	The sheer amount of content in ORION: Prelude is impressive. Not just all the equipment and weapons that you'd expect but also lightsabres, portable turrets, jetpacks, bows and arrows, not to mention the vehicles, from jeeps to tanks, planes and walkers, like the developers decided to make the game as purely fun as possible, and they succeeded in a big way.
4321	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
5355	0	a	The developer keeps re-releasing the same game under different names, and they steal assets from other games and then try to paint themselves as the victims. Plus, the developer goes around on Internet forums threatening to sue people for talking about those two facts. Complete scum.
704	0	a	After everal hundred hours of play, the movements of the character stalls, hesitates and locks up. I have removed this game and reloaded it without any improvement. I have reloaded flash player and shockave, no help. The other steam games I use still work properly, therefor the problelm seems to be intigral to this probram. HELP??
1525	1	a	Great RPG
2690	1	a	A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends
4219	1	a	In a lot of ways, this isn't a very good game. However, it's incredibly fun, and there's a lot of attention to detail.
1573	1	a	Hello community,  This game is, to me, a strong fusion of World of Warcraft (with quests similar to SWO), and a build system like skyrim. However, the hack and slash combat system eschew the traditional grindy bordom of this style of game.     Pros:   good mechanics,  very customizable,  overall fun game.  Upgrading wepons almost always feels rewarding with the large number of unique epic idems to use.  (note* the weapons pack for the game is very well handled, you get a bunch of really cool looking starters that dont wreck the reward feeling when you get your first natural epic idems)   Cons:    Terrain is a bit awkward with things like small ledges.  Interaction in dialoge feels non-impacting to the result of the dialoge.  Something of a 'casual game' (not really a pro or con) 
6293	1	a	Like Jeff Goldblum this game had me avoiding the toilet for many days after playing. Simple concept lots of fun.
4575	1	a	A lot of people rip on this game, but it really is a fun game. For me, I don't have a lot of free time, and this is an easy game to pick up and play in short bursts. Only have 15 min? Enough time to fire up and play Rampage for a bit. Have a few hours? Conquest mode will take that.  With that said, some of the complaints are true. Early on bugs were pretty frustrating, but offset by a lot of free add-on content. None of that is really much of an issue anymore - the worst bugs are worked out, but there are still some (minor) issues.  The online community isn't large, but what is there is pretty welcoming for a casual gamer like myself. Typically the online games are set to the easier modes (which are a little too easy). It is a little annoying that it's hard to find people willing to play on harder modes...  Overall, the game is fun, and for the price that it is, It's worth an add to your Steam library.
2889	1	a	You pay 1â¬ to play Halo and Killing floor at the same time!
5520	0	a	Ridiculously bad. I mean, I downloaded this thinking that it might at least be funny, but it's really very terrible. Not even in a so-bad-it's-good way, if you've ever played any other FPS at all, it'll take you one wave in survival to decide that this was a terrible decision.
5923	1	a	The game gives me a random achievement every 10 minutes.       11/10
5538	1	a	Fun with friends, it's hilarious, stupid, amazing, fun, bullcrap, and definitely worth the price.
2021	1	a	truly fascinating rpg\slasher. over 100 hours of total gameplay. and also the Chicken Overlords
1869	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME!!! SKYRIM + FABLE + MASS EFFECT = NERDGASM
237	1	a	 Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning  has all the trappings of a traditional action RPG along with a few unique claims to fame. One of those claims is the development agenda and post-production of this game, a very interesting story in itself, but that has little bearing on the game as is, which offers some good Fantasy fun.   It helps to understand KoA:R in the context of  Big Huge Games ,  38 Studios , Project Copernicus and the game owners bankruptcy and default on a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island. If the experience feels like an mmorpg in single player mode, that's because the game was more or less a template for the planned but never completed Copernicus. Despite having strong opinions about this whole business, I won't say more since it's been covered well in the news, and at this point it's old news.   The story was crafted in large part by one of my favorite Fantasy novelists, R.A. Salvatore, and the quality shows. Plentiful lore and background is there to find if you bother listening to dialogue, reading books and paying attention to quests. In particular I enjoyed the Fae (Elves) Houses. Their social traditions, internal politics and perceptions of the mortal races reflect the Fae's immortality/reincarnation in interesting ways.   Gameplay is rock solid. It is slightly reminiscent of Fable. Options for stealth, hack n'slash, melee, ranged, martial or magic devastation all stem from a clever class/skill mechanic seated in the game's lore about fate. Essentially there are three archetypes: Warrior, Rogue, Mage - and three types that are hybrids of those. The combat is engaging however you choose, with various combos and skills to mix it up. The monsters are diverse and will keep you on your toes, although it is possible to skill and gear up to a point where the player is virtually unkillable, rendering tactics irrelevant and thus diminishing the satisfaction of well executed fights. That only happens in late game though; plus, you can always increase the difficulty! I played the entire game on the standard difficulty setting.   Design overall isn't all that innovative save for a few aspects. It feels a little bit generic and safe as fantasy RPG's go. One issue I had was that pacing seemed a little off. I explored side areas and finished every faction questline in addition to many side quests, but still wasn't quite able to unlock the highest tier of the Fate system (classes) until the very end of the campaign. Also, towards the halfway point and onwards, some side quests felt like derivative, cliche filler content for the level grind. It felt like an mmo. This wasn't a huge problem, just an annoyance. Backpack expansions should be slightly more frequent and the inventory should have more categories for crafting materials in the trade interface.   The technical issues are few. One rare but recurring problem is that the camera - during and immediately following combat - likes to get fancy and zoom out or chase the player at certain distances. The camera gets stuck sometimes, or shows a bad angle that hinders combat. Quest and lore items shouldn't count towards the inventory item limit. For some odd reason, you can't switch from the journal to the map without first closing the journal. Like so many RPG's, this one has recycled voice actors even for primary characters. While the world is huge and varied, certain areas feel strangely boxed in when they shouldn't.    The music and the voice acting are brilliant here. I was especially pleased with how high quality and well fleshed out the dialogue was. The visuals are beautifully realized and have some fun fantasy art concepts behind them. On the other hand, given the budget of this game it doesn't reflect the money spent in my opinion.    I did not play the two content DLC's,  Legend of Dead Kel  and  Teeth of Naros . I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning to any fantasy aficionado. If you check this out, you'll probably be glad you did. I cannot necessarily recommend it to players with no patience or time for branching out from the main quest to see side content, or for players who are utterly uninterested in seeing more of the same from the fantasy genre.  TIP: Use Reckoning as often as your fate bar fills up, since it rewards bonus experience for kills. TIP: The gear obtained via crafting (Blacksmithing plus Sagecrafting) tends to be the most powerful. Crafting is greatly facilitated by diligent gathering of materials in the world and the salvaging of looted armor &amp; weapons. TIP: Finish all of the faction quest lines at least, since those are among the more interesting content.
285	1	a	A wery well-crafted script,certainly the best title role ( for me ). Has everything great detail, luxury buildings,caves,magnificent  perfect environments.The creators also want to enjoy all the beauty. âª From here I thanks to BIG-HUGE Studios,38 Studios and EA games âª ************************************************************************
3920	0	a	This game is very laggy and it isn't very nice if you dont know how to play the game. The dinosaurs are to hard to kill and it is very hard to aim the gun! DON'T BUY THIS GAME
5602	1	a	5/5
3680	1	a	in this game u can shoot with guns so if u like shooting game u like this game but also not every one like shoot animals(dinosaur) so if u hate animal shoot u dont like this game :)
1610	1	a	Honestly.....100% the best RPG I have ever played. It is amazing and fun straight from the get go. I absolutely love it. I bought it just cause it was on sale for a great deal. Turned out to be the best money I have ever spent! This is a must get for any gamer!
2887	1	a	If you love Dinos and hunting this game is for you
928	1	a	Have had this game on Playstation for years. Learning all the controls on a PC isn't too confusing. I Like how the spells are hotkeyed to the 1-0 keys and displayed on the hud.   The amount of sidequests in this game is fantastic, you can spend loads of time leveling up through grinding if you want or just complete quests to achieve the same. There are lots of items to collect (if your into grabbing every item you see:) There are also lots of items to steal, but it can be quite a while until you get to a place to sell them or level up enough in mercantile to sell to store.  This game has a lot of replay value for me as a quick 'have an hour, do some quests/kick some butt' fix. Fun enough I even got my husband hooked on it!  Also, the Legend of Dead Kell is worth picking up. You get an extremely cool castle with all sorts of perks. Plus, the whole pirate theme and design is very cool looking.  
4041	1	a	DINO-RIFFIC 11/10 HOLY CRAPPP
1548	1	a	Amazing Game, rented for xbox and did not believe it was worth full price. Once i saw this game 70% off on steam i decided to buy it, and it was a steal, this is one of the pest pc rpg's i have played, the story is greatly interactive and you can make it your own. Do you play the Heroic character, or one who is not so great with their morals. Do you play a Warrior, Mage or Assasin type class, or mix them up to create hybrid classes. Overall this game has been phenomenal for PC and i would reccomend this game to anyone who loves a great fantast RPG -Nnairasor
2512	1	a	It's kind of a glitchy game, worth a dollar. Graphics are 'ok' but still good enough to have fun.
2018	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I decided to get it as an alternative to Skyrim when that game started getting buggy. The end result :  Pros (better than skyrim): 1. an actual dynamic and engaging storyline written by Forgotten Realms writer R.A. Salvatore, 2. all conversations are fully voiced by incredible voice actors who actually sound like they're creating a film rather than a video game, 3. the graphics were created by Todd McFarlane creator of spawn, 4. the combat system is incredible allowing chain attacks involving 2 weapons and it is fast and fluid. 5. I've never had it crash: EVER 6. more dynamic and creative crafting system 7. non-mod-capable  Cons (skyrim did it better): 1. massive free-roam environment. 2. more dungeons, 3. more quests, 4. more factions (dark brotherhood!!), 5. more magic, 6. mod-capable  Final Judgement: EVEN   All in all, I feel that the pros overshadow the cons and that skyrim and KOA: Reckoning are both great games and I would recommend both of them personally, depending upon what aspects of gaming are more important to you. If I had to make a choice though, I would choose KOA which was finished upon its release over skyrim which was (once again) rushed into production and it shows.
1692	1	a	Worth getting for under 7$, or if you have a teenager as this will keep them occupied for a VERY long time. Now onto the detailed review:   It's important to know what this game is and of its origins so that we can judge it correctly. When I started playing it I thought 'gee this world seems huge!', as it turns out it's no coincidence - the game was originally developed as an MMO.  Second this isn't an in-depth RPG with a lot of strategy involved in every decision. It's a button mashing Action RPG.  As such, the game does alright. The button mashing class-mixing you can do is very fun... up to a point.  *Customisation - in skills and abilities is probably one of its strong points. Combined with the Tarot style 'fate' system, things are easy to plan out. 'I'll start with sorcery, but get those might talents to beef myself up along the way.' or 'The greatsword sounds promising, let's grab a few crazy passives from the finesse tree to ensure devastation'.  Every battle feels challenging, especially on difficulties medium &amp; hard settings. The art style is cartoony, but not necessarily bad. There are many epic fighting situations due to clever camera shots and animations.   And now for the bad:  - No jumping! What is it with some of these developers? Is it too much work to make sure that there are no exploitable areas due to jump bugs? SADLY this game could have really used jumping to minimise the travel times. In fact the more I think about it the more I can say this is the biggest issue (which amplifies all the others) with Kingdoms of Amalur.  - The game is too big, I can't believe I'm saying this but... yes it's too big! It relies on constant monster smashing for fun and when you're not doing that you're running quest errands. Or going to the next encampment/city.  - For some ungodly reason there is one big design flaw as far as skills are concerned in this ARPG... the skills which you've placed on the hotbar get 'equipped' i.e. you press 4 to equip the spell and then right click to cast it. Isn't that unproductive? Again this is a button mashing game and even in an mmo doesn't make sense.  - The quests/dialgoue and voice acting is pretty bad. Full of cliches, nothing new, but not a biggie considering what the game is.  - All of the combos are executed the same way with different weapons producing different results, not a problem. However given the fact that you'll be killing A LOT of trash-mobs (MMO remember?) you'll quickly find yourself bored. Sadly there are some fantastic fights in this game which many people may not wait around for!   I recommended it if you have children because such flaws for us snooty gamers didn't exist when we were younger and in combination with just how massive the game is (literally an MMO turned single player) you won't get much more for your money.
4203	1	a	I have wasted $0.68, now that the devs made this game free-to-play. For me, this game is good, i just play with bots, because i live in Asia, and there are like 5 servers on this game. 400 if not 500 ping on every server, do you expect me to play with that ping?  But overall, good game. DEVS made this game free for those who want to try.
1320	1	a	Very fun, but is sadly underrated
4697	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥, but when they decided to make it look better, they just made the game more â¥â¥â¥â¥, so now its â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered in â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10 its â¥â¥â¥â¥ `ign
2796	1	a	This game is really awsome its totally worth it!
1469	1	a	Awesome game! sad to hear about the launch fail. WIsh i would have been more aware of the game i would definitely had bought into it. Great Game
1405	1	a	Initially this game seemed like a forgettable generic action RPG, but as I invested more time into it I discovered that my initial impression was very, very wrong. I think the most accurate description is a combination of Elder Scrolls and God of War. I know that sounds crazy but sink a couple of hours into it and you'll understand. 38 Studios only existed long enough to create one game, but they most certainly made it count.
592	1	a	People don't think that this game be like it is, but it do
2717	1	a	You know, this game kind of sucks. BUT. I have had a ton of fun on it- I cannot lie. Haven't played anything but survival, so that's what I'm technically reviewing. Check it out. It's only $0.74 right now.
6257	0	a	Although it was a decent effort, this game's mechanic are not the best. The game feels rather clunky and has a large time gap in between survival rounds. In addition, there is a lack of game mode variety available in this game. Due to this, my attention deviated from this game in less than an hour. In conclusion, I would not reccomend buying this game even though I got it for $1.49.
4319	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
2481	1	a	This game is Awesome. You can drive cars and fly Helicoptors.
5152	1	a	Its a dollar, buy the freaking game. Its pretty damn good. Honestly, I think its worth 10-15, but im cheap. If you're cheap aswell, but it for a dollar.
3469	1	a	Do you want fun? This is funny. You can laugh with or at it. The game lack a story? Narrate a creative one while you play at a random server or with your friends. At first glance the game may look stupid, but even though a second look reveals the same opinion, this is still worth playing. I wish there to be more friendly and helpful players, so the community can grow lively and strong.  Edit: Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I do really enjoy playing it. Is this game bad? Yes, it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing is. I laugh at the poorly opmized game with clunky gameplay. But I do wish it was good and well made, with more time dedicated to it. But the developer left it to rot and went on another project that is an even worst clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥. I wanted this game to be something I could give to my friends and enjoy with them. But it is buggy and most of the fun comes from laughing at the game and not with it.  I still recomend it though. Even more now that it is free to play. Hope one day it will be open source and the players will be able to directly contribute to good development of this great concept and visionary idea for a game.
3398	1	a	You get to play as a spartan, using lightsabers, to fight dinosaurs.  Need I say more?
5229	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
388	1	a	Absolutely worth buying especial for its price, If your an RPG fan that likes unique and skilled base combat systems, and storylines that are not too huge with content (athough there is plenty of fun, amusing, and interesting storyline content in the game) The game has a huge open world with plenty of areas to explore and find, if you chose to do so. But still its a game you can put down and forget about and then come back and immerse yourself once again.
857	1	a	TERA LIKE RPG WITH MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT
3786	1	a	great fun for your spare time
1357	1	a	This game is simply excellent. From about five minutes into the demo, I knew I was going to buy this game. Everything about it has drawn me in and kept me playing so far, from the combat to the scenery to the very rewarding loot and all the different quests to choose from, everything has been even better than I expected. Something about being able to equip any weapon and armor combination when you want is extremely satisfying after so many other games restricting your options based on your class. I HIGHLY recommend this game!
1990	1	a	It's quite like the legendary Skyrim, but unique in its own ways.
963	1	a	Good campaign, I would put it up there with the original Fable and DA: Origins. Plenty of sidequests and lore to get caught up in, and a surprising ending. Worth a play for any fan of RPG's; just wait until its on sale.
4797	1	a	A game where you run around a huge, picturesque map killing dinosaurs what else do you need
4140	1	a	Love this game lots of fun!
2519	1	a	hands down the best game you can get for $0.99. tons of game modes and cool guns! perfect for the jurassic world hype!
4923	1	a	it's a game that's all :D
5652	0	a	I do like that this game is in the regard that it is updated often and it displays that the developers care for the game and want to promote the game as they update it. Though, I was still disappointed with the game even with the being updated so often. The game play is like many shooters but with sub par controls and broken game play. With the teamwork being the most important in the game but even with skilled human players, they dinosaurs have the advantage most of the time. Maybe in the future this game will be satisfying.
3573	1	a	for 99 cents yeah.
2154	1	a	I bought this well over a year ago, and no matter how long I go without playing it; every time I come back to it, I fall in love all over again. Though, I'd still wait to buy it during a discount event, tbqh.
3450	1	a	Played it for 10 minutes and got AIDS. Thanks Orion: Prelude! :)
2883	1	a	Me and my friends had a blast its halo vs dino amazing
751	1	a	I haven't finished the game in all the years I've had it but I still go back to play it. It's not that the game is bad, its actually a fun game to play, there are just other games that come out that catch my attention. Give this one a go.
5598	1	a	it was ok but i hope it can get some more updates an stuff
4810	0	a	like dinosaurs but with jetpacks and guns kinda  not very good
2488	1	a	this is one of those games that makes you want to take a bath with a toaster 10/10
732	0	a	At first the game seemed to be fun. It was fun trying out different builds, character looks, weapons and magic. The quests were fun as well, in the beginning that is. But the fun pretty much stopped when I realised that the quest are all the same 'we have a problem, please do that and that' - so tedious and unimaginitive and boring. I mean the quest in Skyrim are so much better and IMMERSIVE. So combat system becomes a drag and a total bore after you get to Ysa (that how it was for me) and the difficulty is disheartening. I played on hard, yet it was a stroll. Boring. Don't mean to spoil the ending, but it was so ******* stupid and dull. The whole game feels so scripted you can't feel yourself immersed in the world of Amalur.  3/10
1791	1	a	I write this early review (only 8 hours in game so far) for the summer sale: buy this game while it's on sale, you won't regret your 10 euros (or 20 with DLCs). I'm gonna buy the DLCs right away.  The game has its flaws though, the biggest one being the UI which looks like a 2004 hardcore RPG. This is quite of a pain to go through the inventory (and you'll have to use it quite often). There are also some issues with the camera that sometimes goes in your way during combat. And the graphics may look outdated but I don't think it's most important point for an RPG (some players have a different opinion on that). I have this feeling looking at the final result that this game could have used a little bit more polish (budget?) and that would have been one of the greatest RPGs on PC.  But if you can forgive those - minor IMO - flaws, you will enjoy a deep ARPG with a refreshing, dynamic and interesting combat system. There are a lot of ways to build you skill tree, and the moves you can unlock are really visually cool. The crafting system offers a lot of possibilities, but it seems to me at this point that materials are hard to come. There are of course lots of quests and side quests, a lot of lore and hidden objects to find, and litteraly tons of loot.  The voice acting is very good though a little bit overdone sometimes, the only thing I regret is that your character is mute (some voice presets would have been welcome).
4532	0	a	Terrible... Just terrible. The least they could do is make the in-game purchases menu look a bit better right?
4597	0	a	...
1253	1	a	Have you ever played an MMO and thought to yourself 'Wow I hate these other players in my MMO. WIsh I could play my MMO without another player bugging me'?   If this describes a thought you've had while playing mmo, Kingdoms of Amalur was made for you. Kingdoms can be summed up the best as a single player theme park MMO. You wonder from hub to hub, collecting quests, becoming overpowered and collecting gear.  The story is pretty generic, you are risen from the dead as the 'Chosen one' go save the world because I said so.  The story kinda just rebounds you from place to place, serving to keep you somewhat on rails like a parent who tries to keep their kid in line but then gives up and returns to ignroing them and drowning their sorrow in a bottle of cheap wine.  You won't get to drown yourself in cheap liquor but you will get to drown yourself in cheap side quests! While some of them can keep your intrest, most equate to fetch this, or go collect 20 bear arses. The lore waivers from being strong to repeating eveyrhting we automatically know. Spoiler alert: Elves are somewhat Immortal â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Combat is a thing, half way between really fun and annoying which equates to this weird outcome of 'I like this in short bursts'. You won't get it in short bursts, you'll get a lot of combat. You can't stop the combat. Your choice of combat is magic combat, sneaky knife combat with some bow, or Imma SMASH IT combat. If you want you can make all combat happen at once by becoming a jack of all trades or you can focus down on your role of combat. So you can be a Archemage or god king fisty mcpunch guy.   The graphics are pretty, the world is bright and colorful, and ruins and swamps are dark and spooky. One of my fav. parts of the game is the Crafting system. It's pretty standard but each weapon you craft is truly yours. You select the parts, and then get to name it. It adds a personal touch to the game and can draw you in.   So should you buy Kingdoms of Amalur?  If on sale, Yes, You can easily get 20 hours of fun out of it before you get burnt out.  If for full price, No unless you really want a single player mmo. 
5136	0	a	Altough its cheap its not bad, but its not too good, lets go to plus and minus  +Its cheap +Dinosaur +Good graphic +Good control  -It doesnt have any player online -Its single mode suck -Bad AI  Maybe you should buy the new Orion game, its on Kickstarter
3949	1	a	Want Call Of Duty with a prehistoric twist? Want Jurassic Park with Team Fortress 2? Then get this game: seriously, get it now! It's awesome, has a tonne of awesome weapons and unlocks, there are 10 playable dinosaurs, and the last major update is AWESOME!!! A definite 1000000/10.
3500	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
2105	1	a	1) Essential purchase  2) Recommended purchase
2979	1	a	It may be fun if we play with friends for a few hoursâ¦ but it may be not. There are many games fighting in the FPS genre, and it's very hard to find something worth highlighting in this one.
1198	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I've got it on Xbox 360, Origins, and Steam. Author R.A. Salvatore's brilliant mind for fantasy (Forgotten Realms Drizz't books) coupled with Todd McFarlane's (Creator of Spawn) designs make a breathtaking experience. A great rpg for anyone who likes story and gameplay alike. Play it ASAP.
2278	1	a	Still better than CoD Ghosts
2051	1	a	One of the best, most overlooked RPG classics.  Like a Skyrim and WoW mix, and really fun to play- and chock with great lore.
3905	0	a	I got this game for a dollar and i'm not sure it was worth it. The premise seems fun, but the lack of people playing it makes it pointless to play.
1254	1	a	Its a fairly fun game with a lot to do. I still haven't finished the main questline yet. Not as immersive as Skyrim, but has a really rich world-a lot of history can be discovered. Combat is fun, and its freaking awesome to be able to reckon someones fate, gives you a lot of really cool death scenes for bosses and minibosses.  8/10, will continue to WRECKon.
2992	1	a	Super fun, fast action dino killer.
2831	1	a	Best dino shooter I have played. Pick it up if its cheap.
68	1	a	Odd mix of poker...points for card combos cause damage... and fantasy card game..spells to defend or attack.. but it works. Addictive despite it's faults ( mainly not being able to cancel selections in the trade screen and having to buy the cards to replace used ones ). Good card game
5625	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
1034	1	a	Imagine Skyrim stuck in third person and simplified.
1474	1	a	This game is awesoe the combat system is great the story line is great the game overall is great beside the glitches and some other random stuff i give it a 9/10 because it reminds me of skyrim a little
1529	1	a	One of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing. It has great replay value, and it seems you'll never run out of quests. Hightly recommended.
3872	1	a	Shockingly Good. Must Buy 2014-2015.
6128	1	a	It's a very good game. Fast paced action similiar to old school shooters, really fun to play.
2681	0	a	suck.
465	1	a	Another Great game/series cut short at the first chapter. Single player fully customizable characters to go whatever class/path you wish to create. Randomized map loot, all kinds of loot and qualities.   Only thing besides the story being cut short from its cancelled sequels is there is no ability to Jump.
631	1	a	loved it on the xbox was able to buy at a good price with all the dlc on steam.
4953	0	a	Worst game ever, but is still alright 
445	1	a	KoA: Reckoning is one of the most underrated, wonderful RPGs ever. DO yourself a favor, right now, if you haven't played this game yet and you like games like Dragon Age Origins, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher and Fable, buy this game and see that it does something that most modern RPGs don't attempt...   Some of my issues with other modern RPGs as of late are the 'build your own class'. I'm not a huge fan, because it ends up feeling bland to me. where as when you play a game like World of Warcraft, you pick a race that is so colorful and interesting, then you pick a class that adds another layer of flavor.  What KoAR has done is incredible, it allows you to craft your own class without shedding that flavor by using a system called 'Destinies'. It's a sort of Tarot card system, that allows you to hand pick between 3 major class types, mixing as you like and then you pick a card or Destiny that encompases your choices and adds bonuses to your choice to incentivise your picking a card that aligns with the ability choices you have made.   It's the perfect remedy to bulding a class without throwing the baby out with the bathwater, or the classes out with the player's handbook...   The story goes a long way to explain the gameplay which many RPGs fail to do. It has a way to explain character death and resurrection which i find very interesting and until recently many games have not attempted to explain, like Pillars of Eternity.   The games armor and weapon models are some of the most fantastic I have EVER seen!!! Not to mention the character models/designs, designed by none other than Todd McFarlane, have like many other featrues in this game, gone the extra mile by creating extreme detail to the characters anatomy, animations and movements.   The combat is VERY fun and fast paced. As you build your character up, you gain more and more moves and combos that all intertwine on the fly beautifully!!! You feel a real sense of power when you dispatch your enemies because ultimately it was you who chose this path of raw power.   There are a few things some players take issue with in this game, but for me the quality of the game outshines any small issues I might have otherwise. I know some gamers have issues with the cameras FOV and height, and I agree it could be better, but it is no where near the problem that could reduce my fun and also combat, if you are adept at games like Fable, Skyrim, you should set the games difficulty to hard at the beginning of the game because if I remember correctly, you can't change the diffiiculty after you start a new game, which is the only other odd design decision.  Otherwise, PLAY KINGDOMS OF AMALUR RECKONING!!!  Such a shame this company didn't sell the amount of games needed to keep this franchise going, with an MMO that was on the way, its an utter shame that this incredible fantasy world was created from top to bottom and no developer has come forward to save this IP!!!
5482	1	a	UPDATE: SO the devs have been constantly updating the game , After years of release , There are virtually no BUGS , and content is added on a regular basis!   The game is very enjoyable fast paced and good for having a great time with friends or your girl friend .   DO NOT listen to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥uckers from call of duty negging this game , they are mindless idiots with less than 0.1 hours in this game and just 1 line reviews , it shows their worth and class and that they are clearly negging the game because their daddy company activision was involved with an issue with orion devs  Regarding that issue , Anyone who has half a brain would know working with online contractors often results in palgarism , its not the teams fault , upon notification they pulled out the content that was offensive to activision , Hell activision bullied them before even notifying them  So all in all what did i learn ? THIS IS A GREAT GAME , but most gamers are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that like sucking â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of big corporations that charge them 60$ each year instead of honest developers that provide free updates years after realease .   This is the reality , buy and judge for your self. ---------------- old review   SPAWNED WITH MY GF  DINO EATS MY GF   10/10 WOULD PLAY GET RID OF MY GF SIMULATOR AGAIN
3097	1	a	This game suprised me, I hate FPS games but being able to play as dinosaurs really drew me in.   Dislikes, The tutorial or starting play to me is garbage. Besides that its more fun with friends. way better then the lets play videos when it first came out.
1488	1	a	ABsolutely fantastic game from start to finish. The combat is smooth, clean, and the combos you can make are visually-pleasing. All the armor you equip looks badass, and the weapons are player-preferred. Although there are only 7 different weapons (sword, two-hand, hammer, chakram, staff, wand, sylvan blades), the combos that can be made with them (along with mixing the weapon combos together, such as switching from a sword to chakram mid-combo) is extremely satisfying. The three skill trees are wide, with several tiers of skills. The game, in it's simplest form, is an outstanding hack-n-slash game with endless forms of combat. Want to launch enemies into the air with spikes just by punching your fist into the ground? Want to pull enemies towards you with telekinesis? How about tearing your enemies to shreds with chakrams and sylvan blades? It's all in this game. You have to get it. I haven't even mentioned the other awesome things that are in this game, but I extremely recommend that you get this game right now. If it's on sale, it's a must-have.
3880	0	a	The good part of this game is that i only waisted 50 cents 10/10 would buy again
2915	1	a	The Best Cheap Game Ever! i wonder why its cheap because the graphic looks fantastic!  10/10
4106	1	a	Really fun in co-op
3673	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.

2858	1	a	its cheap , cool and fun
5560	1	a	beta for battlefield 4's upcoming dinosaur dlc
4306	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
694	1	a	Great game, Criminaly overlooked
5124	1	a	This idea should be picked up by a more capable developer, updated with better graphics and gameplay tweaks and could become like L4D with dinos
883	0	a	this game is seriously TOO EASY WTH... combat is like your character in permanent GOD MODE. This makes customization of characters useless since hell anything will work against such weak enemies and bosses zzz
5262	1	a	i bought this game in 2012 when it first came out and ive loved it ever since. its a great game to play with freinds
2260	1	a	Finally Discpiples game that as good as it should be.
1907	1	a	Great single player rpg
3694	1	a	Mad, Frantic, Buggy, AWESOME. This game has got it all. Punch a raptor in the face. Done. Get eaten by T-Rex. Done. Get carried away by a Pteradon. Done. A crazy game who's charm far outweighs it's buggy nature. Great fun to play survival. PVP is not the best but you be the judge. Check it out.
4134	1	a	This is the best game i have ever played on steam, it is perfect, there is nothing i would change about it. 10/10 i MADE all my close friends buy this game
566	1	a	love it. its like if fable and skyrim had a child this would be it. XD
2151	1	a	This is a very fun and entertaining game to play. Just whis they had better skill trees
6295	0	a	It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off.   The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage.  The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective.  On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do.  Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.
1150	1	a	I always love great styled RPGs like this and even tho atm ive never finished the game its one of those where there is so much to do that it feels endless. that can get tiring but it also gives more then enough opportunity to maximize your experience.
1464	1	a	This game is filled to the brim with incredible adventures, quirky and humorous dialogue, fantastic visual combat &amp; spell casting. The downloadable content does not disappoint either. The tale of Dead Kel and the Teeth of Naros set you upon more questing fun in which you learn more about the wonderful lore of Amalur. If you want an rpg game that won't dissappoint you and that will give you at least a week's worth of game time, Get this Game!
1311	1	a	its addicting for the first 50 hours... then it gets boring and repetitive.  If it's ever on sale for less than 10 bucks... GET IT. This game has more items than skyrim (i feel).
4708	0	a	Server's dead. Bored now
2423	1	a	If you're going to buy a game in which you wield lightsabers, shoot your friends and blow the tar out of some massive dinosaurs while flying hundreds of feet up in the air, I would probably recommend this game above other games that fall into those categories. Most likely.
4033	0	a	t-rex stuck in a small tree... kinda say it all. it sucks
86	0	a	I have tried repeatedly to get into this game and I just can't. I find it dreadfully boring and I usually like games that do the puzzle quest thing. I'd skip this unless you really like the idea of playing a poker/solitaire mashup a puzzle quest-esque progression. Trust me, it's not as interesting as it sounds.
4694	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible, even worse than Dino Horde
1577	1	a	Fairly solid entry into a world of Western MMO's. Fluid combat and an alright story, I'd give it a B.
2866	1	a	Well worth the money, quite a bit of ridiculous fun. wave based dinosaur survival game with limited shopping between waves. can also buy power-ups and turrets not just guns.
4318	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
372	1	a	Nice open world with lots of side quests. Better combat system than most of games of its genre *cough*skyrim. Lore created by R. A. Salvatore, artwork by Todd McFarlane. Definitely worth the money and time spend.
4626	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
126	1	a	It's a real shame that this game is not well known. I had a blast playing it And exploring. Typical action RPG with some sweet visuals and op main character.
1406	1	a	Can't belelieve this isn't way more popular. Solid graphics, good story, great gameplay and customization. Defintitely reccomned this game.
3146	1	a	Not a bad Dinosaur Horde Survival game, but for $1, its a steal of a game! Definitely get it, since its one buck.
1367	1	a	Super game to enjoy for hours
3839	1	a	Great game
1839	1	a	Action packed but the combat is very simple, just alot of mass clicking. very good story and cool weapons/armors.   7/10
899	0	a	Just couldn't get into it. Felt like it borrowed shamelessly from a few games like Fable &amp; Elder Scrolls for example. I wanted a new experience and got a cocktail of old ones. Not for me.
1251	1	a	excellent, i enjoy playing this type of game
6370	0	a	Game costs a dollar for a reason. Crashed as soon as I joined a server.
4277	0	a	I bought this games and its F2P now? Do i get a free in game bonus?
2901	1	a	You are in a SUV killing off dinos when a trex spawns and hits ur car....the car flyes off into the sunset (off teh map) and u win the round by unknown reasons. 10/10
906	0	a	If you're using windows 10 don't expect to be able to play for more than a few minutes, there's some awful bug that will crash the game, and the developer never â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bothered trying to fix it.
4475	1	a	.
4956	1	a	Spend a little bit of time this holiday season playing this... festive spirit 
5432	0	a	i dont know how this has any good reviews save the change
1595	1	a	Amazing combat system and overall huge and fun game.
4050	1	a	I have SO much fun on this game. So many play styles, and it NEVER gets boring. Just more dinosaurs please!
774	0	a	A sort of hybrid of Fable and Skyrim, Amalur suffers because of its unoriginality. In the end, why play it? If you are looking for a skyrim-alike game, play that instead. Miss Fables? Play the original, for it is still the best.   Competently made and largely free of graphical or gameplay glitches, Amalur suffers from the greatest sin a video game can commit: it is boring.
4088	1	a	100/100
2371	1	a	Funny game, not as bad as people say it is.. when you get into a game, because there are some connection issues. But it's a fun co op game and if you can get it at a discount, I got it at 93% off, 0,99 â¬ you should get it. 
5954	1	a	great game for a cheap price.  a lot of map glitches and exploits.
5064	1	a	fun game and now its one doller i couldent resist :3 thx for changing the price.
2567	1	a	I just picked a 4pack up for 3$.   Pros vs Cons:  Pros: Dinosaurs Jetpacks Mechs Tanks Dinosaurs  Cons: I can't find a laser..but there is a F'CKING LASERSWORD..  Really, for 1$, there are no cons. It works, I had fun. And I KILLED DINOSAURS USING A JETPACK.  Buy it.
1495	1	a	While not perfect, this actually turned out to be a pretty fun RPG. The main story is a slow burn, be patient. Overall I'd say this is an underrated, overlooked gem from a doomed studio.
3314	1	a	Good game for such a cheap price.
2687	1	a	This game has changed A LOT since release. What was once a shoddy, broken game is now one of the most jam-packed, jaw-dropping experiences I've ever encountered in a game. Not only does it have literally every game mode I could ever want it's only $15.  Do you like Dinosaurs? GET IT. Do you like PLAYING as Dinosaurs? It has 4 (soon to be 10). Do you like tons of guns? Game has 50+. Do you like cooperative gaming with friends? 4 coop modes. Do you like competitive multiplayer? It has like 10 modes!  200+ achievements, 30+ maps, I don't know how, even in it's worst state, this game was so knocked. Seriously check it out at the next f2p event or sale.
1434	1	a	Great game. Huge map and the combat is not limiting at all. The combat becomes more expansive as time goes on, so a first impression during the tutorial part may be a bad one.
4829	0	a	Orion: Dino Beatdown is an entirely broken FPS.
5079	1	a	Laggy and crashed during my first game but seems fun.
5508	0	a	10/10 Do not buy this pile of cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥, stinking sand eating, frogsniffing, tryhard, anal breeding prolapse.  
6297	1	a	It's a little confusing at first i spawned and was immediately getting chased by a t-rex and about4 raptors and was eaten immediately but this game is still awesome nd makes for some epic moments.
2756	1	a	Dude... You get to murder dinosaurs with futuristic weapons and jetpacks and tanks... The vehicles all resemble Halo, so do the guns and maps for the most part. BUT WHO CARES YOU GET TO MURDER DINOSAURS!!!!!!!!!!!
2907	1	a	This game is worth more then just a dollar! If you own a steam account you should own this game. It has multiplayer rpg levels and rewards with over two hundrend fifty achievements. Many different game modes and even play as dinosaurs. Multiplayer games are fun and easy to host or play solo with bots.
5161	0	a	This is madness
5381	0	a	i have played some crap games befor but this takes the cake, i wouldent even bother downloading it for free. i dont know were to begin it sucks that bad, maps are huge for a single dude walking the weird way you got to get money to actualy have more than a pistol, its like the point of the game is to bore you with tantalizing upgrades you could possobly get, that are not very good any way then the game ends or you all die and you got to start all over again. i would rather play warhammer spacemarine that crashes 50% of the time then play this game.
537	1	a	Underrated RPG  I bought this game without any anticipations and for what it is I had a lot of fun, of course it's not the next skyrim or dragon age origins, but there are worse Rpgs to play than this. Although I have to mention it's still in a somewhat unfinished state, which is rather unfornunate :( because this game deserved more!  Lets get to the up and downsides of the game.  Up: - A big, open world with plenty to explore and varriang landscapes (lush forests, dry deserts, damp swamps, etc.) - Really intuitive active combat it has some elements of darksiders and devil may cry (you can change between main and secondary weapons on the fly, use magic and can string together long combos *although therefore I recommend playing with a controller) - Quiet unique main story and setting (you are being killed and revived and therefore being able to change fate itself and later you also get information about your past before you were killed) - Crafting system (you can salvage any weapon/armor, except legendary and sets and get parts to craft your own weapon/armor and name it) - Dialogue system (sometimes you are able to persuade people, if your skill is high enough and therefore avoid some encounters)   Down: - Tasks, secondary quest are pretty boring (many fetch and kill-x-of those quests) - Crafting system somewhat unbalanced (mid-to-late game if you craft your own equipment you will be pretty overpowered and will kill most enemys with one hit)  - All in all a little bit to easy espacially some boss battles which therefore were pretty anticlimatic xD (minigames to pick locks is pretty easy even with few points in lockpicking *although the dispelling mini game can go eat it man, even with maximum level I still have problems but maybe it's because I suck at those things xD) - Graphics are average there are some good designed places, but other than that not really outstanding (and little variety in the faces, you will meet a lot of siblings but who knows maybe the genetic pool in Amalur is not really varied, that would explain the almost lack of facial animations espacially the main character which looks as emotional as a wet stone ;D ) - Some bugs and exploits (due to the developer going out of business :( ) - Best played with a controller  All in all it's a decent game, it's a real shame the developers went out of business before they could patch out all the bugs but you still get get enough entertainment if you go into it without expecting the next RPG-Hit.
3868	1	a	8/10
411	1	a	A surprisingly well made game. The graphics is not spectacular (though the combat animations and spell effects are good) and the game does not bring anything really new to the genre, the combat is excellent and the possibilities to progress your characters are many - want to be a rogue with chakrams and combat magic? No problem. Want to be a warrior in heavy armor, wielding huge warhammer and summoning skeletons to help you in fight? Go for it. There is plenty of side quests, usually involving finding something/killing somebody/stealing something. There is not much variety, but the quests lead you through the areas and into loads of combat, so you do not really care as long as you can slaughter some boggarts and brownies (yes, you heard me).  The world is quite huge and open, if you want, you can just explore and roam and kill stuff, though do not expect Skyrim here.  The game also offers a straightforward crafting system including weapons, armor, potions and socketable gems.  8/10  Worth your money, worth your time.
1690	1	a	EA level console port (translation: Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥in' bad ok?), I hope you got your gamepad! ... Gameplay wise? Eh.
329	1	a	Lots of quests, huge map, nice character development possibilities - very nice overall.  Too bad it's so underrated.
1307	1	a	Awsome game!! Its like a way bigger FABLE with more hours of gameplay.
3110	1	a	Seriously this game is pretty badass. Think Killing Floor but with Dinosaurs. I always wondered what life would be like if I could beat down some velocoraptors with a laser sword and now I now.
6278	1	a	Wow, I bought the game while it was free to play then when I go to play it it says it expired or something like that. So I go to this and I bought it for a friend I wasted 2 dollars but my friend can play the game I dont get it!
948	1	a	It has a good history (very important for a RPG) the controls are nice. Not the best RPG I've played, but decent for good gaming hours.
2600	1	a	I'm not too sure why this game has such a low meta score. I only played this for 17 minutes and that was during the free weekend, to make a let's play, and during that time, I had a lot of fun. Sure, the shooting isn't the best but the concept and the graphics are awesome!  I only played this on easy so I don't know if the dinosaurs would be harder on the harder levels or if you just have less ammo etc... but shooting dinosaurs is quite good fun!  This is one of them times where you shouldn't actually listen to metacritic and just go ahead and buy the game.  I have to admit though, this game is not worth Â£11.99, maybe just Â£5 but I would recomend it to anyone for just 99p!   This is a really good game overall and I liked it a lot!   You can see a full let's play of it here:  www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming  (the let's play will be going up later today)
6235	1	a	A simple FPS with dinosaurs, what more could you want?
3958	0	a	This game is so confusingly bad, I honestly cannot tell if it's intended to be shovelware or simply a product of poor production.
4894	1	a	Awesome game! Soldiers with hi-tech weapons and equipment against Dinos is just soooo cool hahah!! Really fun game, there are a few bugs here and there but It wont be a waste of money if you like First Person Shooter games AND KILLING T-REXes!! Plus the GMs are really active, so if there's any bug and they find out, they'll fix it as soon as possible!!
2220	1	a	It is NOT a worthy successor to Disciples 2, like Heroes 5 is not a worthy successor to Heroes 3, it's not even a TBS, but it's no longer a complete fail like the original Disciples 3 is (who said Heroes 4?).  Patrick Lambert's talent gave life to the world of Disciples 2, a sane grade of realism in a gothic fantasy world where humans look like humans, orcs are orcs and dragons feel like they're alive. Reincarnation is still gothic, but artist's anime abuse shines through all holes, most of the atmosphere is gone and calling one of the protagonists Lambert seems like a bad joke or outright trolling. Treat this game not like a sequel or a remake, but like a fan-made jRPG spin-off in the same universe and you'll enjoy your journey, just don't expect anything special, it doesn't bring up nostalgia.  It's now quite balanced, I've managed to beat the first 3 campaigns on maximum difficulty without much strain and quite enjoyed it. No more spell and resurrect-spamming, no more '4 trolls per enemy party' to keep game challenging and in-combat creature summoning now works 'right' (for those who remember how Zombie talisman was useful in Disciples 2).  Story has some twists and turns, 'darkness in not the evil, greed and indifference are' etc. You're already used to saving damsels in distress, right? What can go wrong?
457	1	a	Good, not great. God of war -esque combat system is the only real thing that sets it apart. Reminded me a lot of Dragon Age and Skyrim, which isnt bad.
728	1	a	Cool story bro. DLC and â¥â¥â¥â¥..
2130	1	a	If people were to ask me to pick between skyrim and amalur, I would recommend Amalur more. This is due to gamepad friendlier game and a clearer character progression. Downside of this game is the limited character builds and unmmodability
442	1	a	Good looking combat, great writing/story (R.A. Salvatore) and a different kind of fantasy RPG experience. It isn't as immersive as the Elderscrolls games and can get pretty boring as the side quests design is pretty weak. Combat is awesome looking but does quickly become very repetitive. That said, for anyone looking for an easy-to-play RPG, KoA does a pretty good job at entertaining. If you're a fantasy RPG gamer, do yourself a favor and try this game.
3043	1	a	Those who critisize this game do not really get deep into the gameplay. I personally like this game very much. You can experience a different type of FPS game by killing dinos with friends (and the multiplayer game is quite smooth). And you know what, this game costs only 1 dollar (and is even cheaper when you buy a 4-pack). Please don't compare this game with other which costs you more than 20 dollar!
4986	1	a	Things I got to do on Dino Horde: 1) Mech fight with a Stegosaurus 2) Knife fight with a Triceratops 3) Ride a TRex while shooting smaller dinosaurs from it's back  Why is this game rated so damned low?  Be interesting to see what happens if/when modders get ahold of it?
1523	1	a	This game has a lot quests and great graphics, I would recommend this game for anybody who enjoys RPGs like me ;)
512	1	a	If you like the idea of smushing Fable and Zelda together in a world so massive that you'll never finish all the side-quests, if you like GREAT action RPGs instead of FO4 or ES5: Skyrim's shallow, weaksauce bullsh*t, play this game instead. It is much, much better than either of those games will ever be with all their mods installed. Graphics? Sound? Gameplay? Plot? Writing? World size? All AWESOME.  There are some caveats: 1. Don't take every quest you run across unless you really want to do it. There are simply too many. 2. This game REQUIRES a controller. Works well with my generic XB360 controller. 3. There is no mod scene nor further patches beyond what's out there. The company tanked. 4. You will have to make an account for and log into EA's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t service. Steam handles it more or less transparently after the first time.
4530	0	a	This is one of those awkwardly medicore games. Even their options menu is clunky (with typos). With resolutions that are a bit off (especially if you show windowed). Hell, you can't even turn off things like head bob, so even your human bobs his head like he has a two foot neck (great for headaches). The combat has the awkward down with the dinos twitching around as they run half sideways as their attack.   Funny enough it even has a store to buy 'Spiral Coins' from, which is impressive for a non-F2P game. Though they seem to be putting a lot of updates in, so they probably are working for it.  I picked up a 4 pack on sale, just because even a bad game can be amusing on co-op. So I really wanted to like it, but it looks like I'll just keep those for gag gifts.
6254	0	a	this game is crap to play by yourself...maybe it would be fun with other people...
1493	1	a	I like it a lot, haven't quite finished it yet but it is still good. I wouldn't compare it to Skyrim or any RPG that released around when it did, because they aren't like it eachother too much. It's art style is kind of like Fable, but other than that they don't really have much in common. Combat is really fun, RPG elements are pretty good, and exploring the vast colorful map is really cool.
3590	1	a	It's aiight.
3154	1	a	This is the type of game you mess around in with your friends.
5768	0	a	The game is as empty as my pockets
4658	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
3167	1	a	This game is aweosome for a 1 dollar game, great game for if you feel like playing something new but dont feel like spending alot of money
2846	1	a	Very enjoyable game, if you are playing it with a budie on co-op mode :D
554	1	a	I'm having fun with this game, its only draw back is that it will use the same dungeon more then once for quests.
3634	0	a	Wonky Animations and Low Res Menus that will make your eyes bleed.  ****/10
1855	1	a	Kind of has that fable feel to it
396	1	a	everything you expect of an RPG and more. fun for the whole family!
6332	1	a	This is a game that I recomend greatly due to its great gameplay. it may have some glitches here and there but its nice to get a game that anyone can get for just a dollar.
1351	1	a	Kingdoms of Amelur is one of the best if not the best RPG game ever made. It has everything you could ever ask for and more.
3292	1	a	This is so bad it's good trust me buy it it's amazing
3271	1	a	It's good.       ....For .99 cents.
2460	1	a	an unpolished gem, get more servers and you guys good to go. im having fun playing with my friends, but with a helluva ping. 8/10
2545	1	a	Super fun with friends. Rough around the edges but still really fun. For less than $3 100% recommend. Just buy the 4 pack and give it to your friends.
5495	1	a	Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-SymonÃ© guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.
2959	1	a	THE DINOSWER CAME UP TO ME THEN I PEW PEW IT WITH BO THAT COST A MILLION COINS THE I DIE   GOOD GAME OVERAL
2530	1	a	If you're looking for a triple AAA platnum seller, then go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a shooter that runs decently where you kill dinosaurs just for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles, then you've come to the right store page! First of all, the game has a really cheap price tag attached to it, but that doesn't mean it's not a good game. Again, it's no game of the year award winner, but you really get a lot out of this for the price you pay, especially if you're buying it for only $1. If nothing else, it makes for a great game to play on rainy days when you lose your internet connection. Just fire up the game, turn on bots, and have more fun than you might expect. I played this once a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but recently I played it again and was surprised to see that the devs have been updating the game, which is really saying a lot when you think about how little most devs care once they get your money. So come on! Buy the game, install it, and have yourself some fun. It's $0.99 and I can pretty much guaranty that you'll get your money's worth out of it.
4764	1	a	This is a mainly multiplayer game but you can play versus bots if you really need to,though it is really not recommended to do so since that really takes away from the whole 'stay with your team to survive' feels. There's alot of diffrent gamemodes to choose from but mainly there's 2, atleast what I found, which is survival and Deathmatch. The game dosen't take that long to learn and the controlls are relativly easy to learn.It's a relativly fun game to play with some freinds on a LAN party.  It will most probably turn pretty boring after some hours of gameplay.    **** PROS AND CONS****  + Easy to learn +   Only cost 0.99â¬   Free-to-play + Lots of modes   - Edit: Early supporters that bought the game gets nothing in-game for their support - Not alot compelling about the game after yyou play certain matches on the main modes      *** Overall rating***  ***6/10***     
2123	1	a	Amazing gameplay, it gave me a lot of fun. I only wish the storyline would have been better developed. Still, this game s must if you like action RPGs.
3884	0	a	this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥, and i think i may have received cancer from playing this game. Please do NOT ever develope another game to save the human race as we know it.
5107	0	a	Horrible game with horrible graphics... Also there are a lot of bugs for example sometimes its not showing that the gun firing effect while I m firing... Also graphic optimization is horrible as well and there is not goal on playing any map. This game do not deserve to play. Do not buy it and do not make some useless pc programmers rich...
3234	1	a	Recently purchased the 4-pack bundle for my friends and myself - I tried it out this weekend with a friend, it was tons of fun. Absolutely recommend it for play for fun casual gaming and spontaneous LAN-parties.  The full price seems a bit high, but if you can pick it up on sale it's really worth it - especially if you have a few friends to play with! Also, you fight dinos with big guns from a jetpack - what else do you need?!
5205	0	a	I paid $20.00 USD, for this. Now it's $1.00 USD, I feel ripped off honestly. I bought the 4 pack. So this is not putting me in a happy mood. i'm glad I can buy it for friends now, but change your price back to twenty. Or are you just that cheap, like the Thai Hooker down the street! - Crimson Bolt.
4300	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
2852	1	a	This game is well worth the money spent ($1), and even if it was 5 bucks i'd STILL buy it! Half descent graphics, and good game-play make this game a 7.5/10 in my opinion. I've paid alot more ($10-20) for games that weren't even HALF as good as this one! Enjoy it, and pass on the good word :)   Respectfully, Cronic
2908	1	a	Was expecting to eat many people (cough cough Chris Pratt). Got bored and started killing friendly dinos (for sport... of course) and maybe ate some velociraptors and stomped on some compys in the process.   roar/10 would kill everything that moves again.    p.s. : I did better in the movie, except for the whole dying part.
2010	0	a	Unimaginative and often constricting gameplay got in the way of my interest in the world and the story. After a little over 20 hours of completionist-style play I felt like progress was a chore and just stopped playing. Plus the still-present minor technical issues didn't help either.  Full review here:  http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/09/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning.html 
3410	1	a	BEST CO-OP SHOOTING GAME This game is Halo 4 and Star Wars combined.  Nice graphics, very fun to play with friends. However a bit buggy.

4584	1	a	awsome 
2835	1	a	Good game, TERRIBLY OPTIMIZED  the game is FUN don't get me wrong but... running around at 2 fps with the lowest settings on MY computer means something is VERY wrong.
5430	1	a	Omg,i purchased the 4 pack ,truely a gud fricking game.the price tag is low,very fun and allot of gameplay to be had plus i got 3 other copies that i can give to my friends ,or trade with it for another game,the best bargain i have ever seen!
6209	1	a	:)
3443	1	a	Ay it's a good one.
533	1	a	This is a great game, and I've had a lot of fun with it.   HOWEVER, something to be aware of is that the game studio that developed this game is no longer around. This means that there are not going to be any official patches for the game in regards to any bugs that you may experience, and there are some game-breaking bugs that make it impossible to complete the main storyline. For example, The Hunters Hunted mission.
135	1	a	77h of pure gameplay, honestly more than I expected from a console-esque RPG. Game is a bit long for it`s own good, cause side quest are dull and repetetive in the second half, looks like the devs have run out of ideas. Rich lore, mediocre story, bearable fight system. And don`t play it on normal difficulty settings, it`s way too easy. Certainly, miles away from the best RPG experience I had in my life, but approximately same distance away from the worst. Golden middle ;)
3259	1	a	I want My money back
3402	1	a	This game is good when playing in such as Lan party or something. A thumbs up game that every FPS player should have.
2561	1	a	better than ARK
3791	1	a	Greatest game ever you kill dinos and then you die the end. fantastic 10/10 nothing compares buy now
4787	1	a	I love this game sooooooo much I quit playing CS:GO for this game.
5663	0	a	This game has some serious performance problems, to a laughable extent. Dinosaurs will float across the place and your gun can't really even move when you shoot it. Might be fun if you like buying games that are funny because they are bad.
2237	1	a	This game is amazing i have been a fan of the series since the beginning when i git a free demo of the game when i was 6 and now play all the games everyday and i am proud to own this game. Dose it have its problems yah but what games dosent and in my opion its worth evry dollar you spend though i am confused on how you do the map editor
2839	1	a	Its a fun game but man could the frames be better
1773	1	a	Much better than Witcher 2 and other similar titles. The graphics are a little ''Childish'' but the gameplay is so addictive I have spend hours upon hours playing this title. I feel bad for the company who did a good job and went bankrupt while others sell us crappy titles and because of the hype everyone buys them and they get rich!
2630	1	a	I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.
607	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ¢, when I first read about this game before it's release it claimed it would be a Elder Scrolls killer but as some people many know that it really wasn't that case. The game has good and bad qualities about it. Lets start with the story, the story isn't a strong point for this game and is pretty generic for an RPG and after you play through it once, playing through it again is something you just seem to want to avoid, though the concept for the story itself was pretty good.  The Combat. The Combat is this game is in my opinion better then Skyrims, in Skyrim I just felt like I was just whaling on people like some untrained warrior, but in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ¢ it felt a lot more smooth and just flowed a lot better and some enemies I needed to learns some of there moves and time my dodges right to either take no damage or at least not suffer a large blow. It is true that after a few hours the combat can become a bit or even entirely boring as you will have a solid tactic to spam with crowds, bosses or big creatures.  'Fateshift' is basically a super, nothing can really stand up to you when your in this form and the final kill animation is great and the fact that there are many make it so it doesn't become boring that quickly, though I found that in my later level Fateshift was something I always had and clould eaily build up but I never used it as I found no enemy challenging.  The World. Kingdom of Amalurs world is extremly nice with a good colour palette, though the game is a bit aged right now it's still a great world to explore and just look at. The characters were very well Voice acted and it was nice to have everyone in the game have a voice instead of just text, well I say everyone what I mean is everyone but the character you play as, he/she is a silent protagonist and it really seemed to kill some of the games immutation as people who you talk to seem to express something to whats going on and to what you just said while you just seem to stand there with a blank expression of nothingness on your face not give a sh*t.  The Classes. Now I enjoyed the class system in this game, I found it to be better then Skyrims as you can't get to the point were you can level up every tree (I'm talking without Mods) you have to choose to either focus on one tree and become a Warlord, Nightblade or Archmage which means you master all the weapon and gain the top tier abilities. You could go into two trees and become either a Blademaster, Shadowcaster or Champion with these sorts of builds you don't reach the top of either trees which means you don't gain the top tier abilities. You could go into all three trees at once and become a Jack of all traits person or as it's named Universalist, which means you're gonna be getting mostly the basics of all the trees. The classes themselves some with different effects and stats themselfs, to boost damamge or Mana regan per second also the Shadowcaster class had a poison blink ability that replace dodge. The class system in this game makes choosing a class to strive to a did more hard as you know how far you will go in the trees.  Side Quests. Side quests could be both good and bad, in some you just be fetching something and in other you would be exploring caves and dungeons, so overall I find the side quests to be like every other RPG a combination of good and bad, with some being fun and interesting and other being dull and pointless all together.  Crafting. I only went into Blacksmithing and made some of my best gear it was simple to do and rewarding still, but for the other crafting options in the game well I'm not gonna say anything about them, not because there bad but because as I said I didn't go into them, I soley did Blacksmithing.  The DLC. You have 2 DLC's not including the Weapons pack, these DLC's are Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel, both DLC's never seem to improve the story but are good for higher level players to get good gear and fight enemies the same level and sometimes even higher. Teeth of Naros. Honestly I didn't enjoy this one to much, the combat was sameish and the story was just something I didn't pay much attation to as it didn't interest me. I'd give this DLC a 5/10 as the story isn't so great that it kept my attention but the fights were good as you faced a new selection of enemies and got both good armor and gear from it, but when I finished the story line I was gone from that DLC area. The Legend of Dead Kel. I enjoyed this DLC more the Naros, the story was somewhat interesting and the combat was good aswell and with the addition with the Keep that you get which honestly was great at first, after a while you start to feel a bit detatched from it as the pets you get and raise just give you a stat increase and then are in a corner of the Keep, you don't get to take them outside the keep nor can you have them walking with you in the Keep. You also get a Scavenger who will find people in ship wrecks who will become something in your keep and get you closer to the end of the Keeps quest line, but after you find everyone you'll send him out sleep for 24 hours and get items and then repeat and if he says he lost the bag you'll be dealing with a group of bandits you can easily cut through to get Items to sell, gets boring after 2-3 trips there. There are other people who do different things but you'll find that the only person you'll use in the end after you've done everything in the keep is the Scavenger guy because he gets you items to sell and make more money that you don't need because you've got the best gear but because why not. I'd give this DLC a 6/10 the story is somewhat good and the combat is still good but the Keep seems to both be it's strongest and weakest point as when you first get it you;ve got lots of things to do but it runs out in the blink of an eye and the Keep is just something that you have.  Overall I enjoyed the game, it had it's flaws and wasn't close to being an Elder scrolls killer 8/10 Rating from me
4864	1	a	This game is very fun, although I doubt it before I played it. Absolutely worth buying. This is actualy great. I rate it 9/10, but it has sound problems and takes too much PC performance.
3198	1	a	Great game so worth 1 dollar
3290	1	a	Meh..Nothing special.A few servers,and not much people are playing it.The game is fun doe.
6034	1	a	if you have any comment to add / correct me, please post it   I played on 'normal' to start, and it was a bad idea. i died fast, even if i had money, but i had no idea what to do with them. i STRONGLY suggest you play the first ~ 4-8 levels on newb. that way you have a decent chance to learn and still get a feel of the game.  most of the waves are 'survive'. with 60 seconds pause in wich to check the store to see what you could buy. unfortunately, the 'store' is 2 stores, sometimes so far apart, you HAVE to choose wich one to visit, because you will have NO chance of visiting both. after those 60 seconds, the store literally teleports you out and closes the doors  there are dinos that don't belong to waves, so don't be surprised to see one, and don't waste your time.  once you buy a weapon, you discard the weapon you previously had. except if you buy the augment that allows you to have 2 of that weapon, in wich case you discard the oldest of the 2 weapons that you have  each game you start with a pistol (unless you get something better from lvl up), and you have to buy everything  i strongly suggest you buy the following (your choice in wich order): weapon store: -better pistol. the only gun with unlimitted ammo, so even if it's low rate of fire, don't underestimate it. with higher levels you will get a better starting pistol -main weapon. i saw only 2 tipes: auto and sniper. get one, has much higher rate of fire than a pistol -secondary weapon: shotguns. i am not a fan of up close and personal, so i have no suggestion here, if this is a usefull item -double damage, higher ROF, faster reload, double capacity clip. each costs 5k -adrenaline weapon. see bugs -the longbow adrenaline weapon has many types of tips that can be changed with the reload button: armor piercing (infinite ammo), explosive (sticks to the enemy if is direct hit) explodes after ~ 2 seconds, smoke (the enemy can't see through it), and EMP (weird enough, works backwards: REPAIRS machines and generator and stuns enemies). all arrows that are not AP have 2 max capacity but replenish ~ 1 each 5-10 seconds -turret. the bloody thing lasts 60 seconds, but it shoots most of the little dinos right away. has cooldown until you can set up the next of 120 seconds. so.... don't set one up at the end of a wave, because the pause is 60 seconds. costs 20k. see bugs note: you can have just one of the following: machinegun / flamethrower / rocket turret, cryo knife, repair gun (works on vehicles and generator), instant revival gun -extra life and ammo. used automaticly. cost 500 each. basicly you can't restock the ammo otherwise, so the ammo one might be a choice you have to make most waves  augmentation store: -volverine: HP regen. 'nuff said -double armor. i don't know if that is 'armor' (as the game states) or 'shield' (because it regenerates if you leave it a while) -25% more accuracy -more energy. VERY usefull for use of the special each class has -ability to have 2 pistols / secondary weapon / primary weapon / adrenaline weapon. i think each one costs 5k. see bugs -50% more ca$$$h drop. 'nuff said  there are other choices, it's up to you if you want to bother to get more  bugs (or as microsoft would call them, 'features'): -when you buy a weapon (by mistake, for example) the previous weapon is LOST. you have to pay AGAIN for it.  -when you buy an adrenaline weapon, you lose the primary weapon. i found that it does not happen if you already bought the augmentations to have 2 primary and 2 adrenaline. edit: it still happends, even if i buy all augments. no idea why. the weapons are not lost, just dropped INSIDE the weapon shop = useless edit 2: apparently i buy augmentation for a second primary weapon and a second adrenaline weapon and i can use just 1 primary and 3 adrenaline.  -when you set up the turret, for those 60 seconds the adrenaline weapons and the sniper rifle is no longer available with the scroll of the mouse. maybe it is available with the keyboard, did not have time to check. -don't touch the generator with a vehicle. instant loss of the vehicle :( -grenades and teleporter NOT available with the scroll of the mouse -some augmentations can be bought twice. or at least payed for twice. so look carefully what is bought and what is not. -visor does not freeze augmentation does NOT work. worst 7500 i ever spent  the 'hover' augmentation is... very limitted in use. buy it if you are bored to death and have money to throw away  when a player is 'dead' (1 HP) a team player can revive him or he can revive himself if he kills an enemy (so the smaller ones are very usefull because they die fast). unfortunately in that condition the player can move very slowly and use only the pistol (or heal gun, if the class is medic)
5371	0	a	99 Cents huh? why not.... thats what i thought. ok this game might be good but my problem is that the game just doesnt work, i can have this on the lowest GFX and get 20 fps i can have this on the highset GFX and get 20 fps...do you know why? i dont. i can run games like bioshock and blackops 2 just fine bioshock at 60 on max gfx and blackops 2 at 40-50 fps med GFX. so why cant i run this game? i just want to know because this (to me) doesnt look better than blackops 2 or bioshock. and for that reason a solid NO will be in order. (its the steam summer sale go get a good game like system shock 2... i wish i had)
3747	1	a	someone said it better then cod ghost LOL for me this game cost 1$ i think it too low because quality of this game is good then cod ghost sorry for my eng and i hope you guy understand me :) 
2403	1	a	If there ever was a game that combined Aliens, Dinosaurs, Space Marines and robots etc. It's this... People may say it's a bad game. That's because it ain't your avarage shooter. I love this game, and the first time I saw it, I said 'I want'. It may not have a storyline so far, and It may just be matches fighting people or Dinosaurs but it's so much fun and great all the same. Dino Horde is reguarlly updated and is about to 'evolve' into it's final stage, Prelude. And I can't wait, so far it's one of my favourite shooters. The company may be small but it has made a great game. There are tons of Dinosaurs you can play as and fight. Tons of customizations, weapons and weapons and vehicles. One thing annoys me though, you can only play team eliminations and free for all's a lot when it goes on sale for $1. When it's not on sale, all you see is survivals and conquests and very rarely a Duel or Gungame.  It's still worth your money and attention. I would recommend getting Orion Dino Horde! (Also like how I heard T-mass on their trailers)
1817	1	a	I have only put about 15 hours into the game so I will probably update this later on, but I feel I have seen enough to have a pretty decent idea of the game as a whole.  In theory this is the best rpg in the world, huge crafting systems, freedom with playstyles, world full of characters and quests, and the potential to stick well over 100 hours into it. In practice this game is extremely generic. That isn't saying its a bad game, or that its not worth the money just it isn't anything you haven't seen before. It takes the good parts of all the action rpgs you have played and puts them all together in one package, except it doesn't innovate on any of those elements.   The combat is pretty weak overall, its very repetitive and one dimensional, playing as a sorcerer you pretty much just use 2 attacks and then throw in 1 or 2 spells (out of a small handful). Dodging / blocking in the game is slow and inconsistent to the point where it is better to remain on the offensive and try to stagger / stun your opponent out of their attack than it is to actually block or dodge it. The camera angle and unit targeting is also equally inconsistent, trying to target the right unit seems like 50% luck which can really hurt when you are trying to incapacitate a strong foe in a battle.  I also have a huge problem with the controls. The keyboard and mouse controls suck, especially in menus, so I play with a gamepad. But there aren't enough keybinds on the gamepad to use all of my abilities. Even worse, there is no way to use one of my abilities without binding it.   These are the actual steps you might have to take in a fight to use an ability that is unbound. Pause game &gt; navigate multiple menus to find the skill &gt; bind it to a key &gt; unpause and use the skill &gt; pause game again &gt; navigate menus to skills again &gt; replace it with your more frequently used ability &gt; unpause and continue playing.  If that sounds ridiculous that is because it is, I have actually set my gamepad down on my lap, used the mouse and keyboard for 1 ability, then picked up my gamepad to continue a fight. I feel like that was actually necessary to complete the fight too, to the point where I don't think I could have done it without that ability, but I had no easier way of using it at the right time.  A lot of my problems with the controls come with the games difficulty, playing on hard the game doesn't present much of a challenge until you get to the bosses. The reason the bosses are difficult though is because they use attacks that are extremely difficult to avoid and will almost 1 shot you if they hit you. The game can be extremely frustrating when you die because you weren't able to target the right enemy quick enough and then he hits you with an ability that stuns you just long enough for the boss to 1 shot you. Or getting 1 shot by the boss because you were staggered by an enemy that spawned 2 feet behind you, but because of the camera you had no idea they were there.  I don't feel like I am far enough into the game to comment on the story too much, as I have spent most of my time doing side quests. I am hoping this will be a redeeming quality for it though. Currently I am finding it hard to care about the story, though that may be because I have spent so much time doing other things between completing main quests.  As it stands if someone asked me to recommend a game to them, this wouldn't be on my list. Though if they asked me to recommend an RPG that they can sink a ton of time into, I would consider telling them about this game.
2932	1	a	I stabbed a dinosaur to death with a combat knife.... 10/10
613	1	a	Recommended, as long as you run Widescreen Fixer to give yourself a more zoomed-out camera / wider field of view. The default is waaaay to close for my comfort. If you're looking for an RPG where choices matter, look elsewhere - I completed nearly all the available quests, and I can count on one hand the number of them where you actually had to make any decisions about how to complete them, and maybe... one? where there was any sort of fail state if you picked the wrong dialogue options. If you just want something where you can kill dudes while traversing the overworld and dungeons, perhaps while listing to podcasts or otherwise multitasking, this is it.
3829	1	a	The game cost $1 during the Steam Summer Sale and was the best $1 I spent. My brother and I had no clue what the game was about or how it worked. We jumped into a survival game and instantly enjoyed it. I expect that there will be many more hours spent on this game in the future.
1715	1	a	Good RPG.. Very Injoyable.
640	1	a	The minds behind Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning are certainly cultured in the world of fantasy RPGs. Ken Rolston brings his pedigree (and some Bethesda alumni with it) having worked on both The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and its successor, Oblivion; while accomplished fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore breathes life into the world of Amalur, creating a 10,000 year history for the developers at Big Huge Games to pull from. When you factor in the fantastic art design from Todd McFarlane and the enthralling backing from retired baseball star Curt Schilling (yes, really), itâs easy to proclaim you have a veritable dream team of talent for the genre, and the exciting precedence for a new IP to really blossom.  Reckoning starts off on the right path, even if its beginnings are fairly derivative. Upon creating your character using a fairly limited creation system, you wake up amongst a pile of festering, rotting corpses. You were previously dead yourself but have since awoken: a successful lab experiment and the latest in a long line of video game protagonists suffering from a contrived bout of amnesia. Before long you discover youâre quite the unique prospect in the land of Amalur: one without a pre-determined destiny. This is a world governed by fate, its residents able to visit fortune tellers to see how theyâll end up; left to live their lives on a decided path. Only the Tuatha â an evil race of elves â are able to be resurrected once they pass, so the fact youâre the first non-immortal to do so has shifted the balance of the kingdom and left you without the burden of a preordained life â a blank slate ready to be crafted.  Not only is this a superb premise for the narrative that unfolds but, as you can imagine, it also factors into the gameplay and character building. There are three archetypal RPG classes to choose from: Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue) and Sorcery (mage). Each presents itself with different skill trees but youâre not asked to pick one, singular class. Instead, youâll dump points into different active and passive abilities on each tree, allowing you to mix and match classes. This allows a fantastic amount of freedom and variation as youâre able to craft a skill set of your choosing, perhaps mixing together Finesse and Sorcery to create a stealthy magic-user, or combining all three sets together to reap the rewards of a well-rounded jack-of-all-trades.  Depending on what path you choose youâre granted with multiple destinies that provide you additional stat bonuses. So if you choose Might you may find increased damage multipliers or supplementary health, while someone combining both Might and Sorcery may receive a bonus to elemental damage and improved mana regeneration. Itâs a meritorious system that encourages experimentation, the lore endorsing re-specialisation if you want to try another path.  Of course, that will come down to how you want to play Reckoning. Each class brings with it its own set of weapons, from longswords and giant hammers, through to daggers, longbows and staffs. Their over-the-top designs provide a sense of personality, while more unconventional weaponry like the chakrams and faeblades offer a welcome change of pace from the more regular fantasy tropes.  Whichever set you choose youâll find a simple one-button setup. There are no elaborate combinations for increasingly complicated attacks (whether youâre using a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad), instead youâll time and change the pace of button presses to execute different combos. Itâs easy to pick up and play and thereâs a nice fluidity to the way it handles, allowing you to go from using a staff, to slicing guys up with a pair of daggers before switching to a variation of magical, elemental attacks. It hits hard and is very satisfying; Reckoningâs bevy of diverse enemy types requiring a smattering of dodges, blocks and counters to stay out of trouble. Crowd control is often the name of the game, facing off against big and small foes; magic-users and straight up brawlers. It keeps you on your toes, the gameâs loot-driven nature repeatedly throws up new weapons to starve off any sense of tedium.  Itâs the side quests that invoke the greatest sense of apathy â and even implicate the combat in some major ways. Along your travels youâll encounter an overwhelming amount of quest givers; your map quickly filling up with blinking lights like itâs Christmas at Rockefeller Centre. This cluster of side quests and tasks offer little but middling content despite their increasingly high numbers. Collect x amount of items or kill y amount of enemies; itâs unimaginative and provides a stark reminder of Reckoningâs MMO beginnings (and its future), drudging up mundane and repetitive quests to pad out the content. None of it is compulsory, of course, but when a game is stacked with 200 or so quests, it would be nice if some of them were the least bit enjoyable.  If you do decide to partake in any number of these quests then thereâs also a real threat your character will over-level, negating any sort of difficulty the combat once had. Youâll often find yourself fighting enemies with grey names, indicating they are no match for your combat prowess; itâs a wonder they donât flee in horror at the sight of you. This seems like a major oversight, particularly for a game as action-oriented as Reckoning is. The combat may be fantastic but itâs still relatively simple. If you play too many side quests the formula becomes rote, and that simplicity just canât carry a hundred hour game. Reckoning may be a loot driven game, but no reward is worth the banality the side quests offer.  Fortunately, the main quest line and faction quests are eminently better. Your character may be an emotionless entity, but the rest of the writing and voice acting elevates the narrativeâs quality. There are branching storylines, interesting and set-piece driven combat scenarios, enjoyable boss fights and plenty of exotic locales.  For the world of Amalur is a large place with distinct areas for you to explore. It doesnât encourage exploration as much as something like Skyrim, instead opting to funnel you down corridors between much larger areas; but itâs a vast game world with plenty to see, the art style shining through despite its poor draw distance and some low-res textures. The desert area provokes an oddly befitting Wild West vibe with its orange hues and rocky mountains, while the wide open plains of Erathell are transcendent with their use of space and colour. Reckoning might not have the graphical fidelity of some of its counterparts, but its bright colour palette, excellent art design and smooth level of performance is certainly an aspect to be lauded. The orchestral score helps too: itâs often riveting, inciting a sense of enchantment and wonder, beckoning on your adventure. Itâs really phenomenal throughout.  The same cannot be said for all of Reckoningâs many parts, however, but thereâs an enjoyable game here with some interesting ideas â providing you stick closely to the main quest line and faction quests. The drabness and profusion of the side activities is too big a dampener to ignore, especially once it significantly impacts the gratification of its combat. If you treat Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a shorter, story-driven experience, youâll have a much better time of it than the completionist who chases every single side quest.    Recommended 
4258	1	a	play this game if you bored with survive from zombies

2847	1	a	Great game. 100% worth the $.99 it costs. 500% worth it when its on sale for $.50, or 1000% worth it to get the four pack for $.75. I bought 5 of the four packs to share the game with my friends. 10/10 would buy 5 more.
4194	1	a	Still debating if my $1.50 was really worth it or not. hilaribad

2006	1	a	Fun to play, such huge playtime and gets never boring.
461	1	a	So I've played enough of this game to completely fall in love with it. The art style reminds me of an older style kind of xbox original game, which isn't a bad thing really. There are plenty of in depth quests to do and a lot of replayability without being bored out of your mind. Now my favorite thing so far, actually, is the weapons. This game posseses a unique array of fantastic weapons such as Chakrams and Faeblades, and there isn't one that comes out on top for performance, so you can use what you like without drawback, all weapons are just different styles of combat. The second most favorite thing about combat for me is the fateshift. When you build up enough in your fate meter to use a fateshift, you go into Reckoning mode and just own everything, ending it all with a finishing move that looks super badass. Definitely recommend 9-10/10 honest review.
456	1	a	Awesome story, artstyle and gameplay. Very unique skilling and character building options! One of my all-time favorites, sadly it's extremely easy which can make it dull at times.
5075	1	a	Have fun with your friends or the bugs or both.
5521	1	a	Don't listen to all these call of duty fan boy haters about the relaunching of this game and the art theft or whatever. These guys have been making a great, super cheap game for a long time now. Yeah there have been some ill advised copying of armor or gun art from other games, but â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens. The game is 99 cents, no one is getting rich over it.   That being said, this game is worth every penny. If you don't have a lot of fun blowing up dinos with your friends in this game, there is something wrong with you.
5265	1	a	This game is a dino massacure. IT IS A GOOD BUY FOR A DOLLAR THERE IS SOME MICROTRANSACTIONS BUT ITS NOTHING YOU CANT AVOID.
2698	0	a	this game is a waste of time dont even bother to be honest there are better free to plays
3900	0	a	worst game in history
2030	0	a	This game had so much potential but there's something a bit off about it. I still can't point it out yet but it's a good RPG to waste 10 or 20 hours with but still I wouldn't recommend it.  Pros - Skill system is just pure AWESOME!  - Great crafting system - Combat is quite enjoyable  Cons - Voice acting. Try it and you'll see. Not bad and not good either. Maybe and just maybe this is the one that is really off in this game. - Story isn't really that interesting - Not immersive at all (I can literally kill a whole town and the next town wouldn't mind at all and tell you that's just one reason) - The monsters you'll be encountering are the same one except for the names from the start until the end of the game - Graphics (More of a personal taste)  I really just bought the game to show support on how this game could have been a ton better than it is now. I know the studio is gone and everything but We'll never know.
4031	1	a	Unlike most steam reviewers, my review is about this game. Which I really like and have found it to be very refreshing and fun regardless of the problems. This developer obviously cares about us as players and I've witnessed the game evolve in all the ways it needed to from suggestions of players and fans.  Great Memories from playing with friends. Everyone hoping on a vehicle and the driver drives everyone off a cliff and we all die even though we were all wearing jetpacks. Classic!  The gameplay is straight forward. Kill dino's in waves, get money, buy upgrades, go out on a remote mission, come back &amp; kill dinos in waves. If your generator goes down Repair!  There is nothing quite like fighting a slew of mini dino's to look up and see T-Rex chomping down on your head, or getting that last pistol bullet into a dino right before you die for a self rez. Or getting that last Dino down while all your friends have fallen and are watching you complete the wave.  This game is awesome, great fun, great memories, and refreshing to see a developer that cares and a game that grows.
5496	0	a	As someone once said 'If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything'. 10/10 IGN 'Didn't like the dinos'
665	1	a	5
4173	1	a	I would complain about the sometimes ugly effects I would complain about how much of the game seems to be copying aspects from Halo and borderlands I would complain about the upgrade icons in the store being super low-res  But who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ complains about a game that costs 80 pence when NOT on sale.
3980	1	a	Edit: After giving the game another chance, it seems to be running fine now, weirdly enough, and is performing much better at a stable 24 fps. Gameable with friends when looking for a light shooter with something different. Easy to pick up and play. Still I'd like the guns to be a bit more fleshed out, with one pistol being mentionable as possibly being enough to play with as it can effortlessly take down everything and comes with infinite ammo, no recoil and it's fully automatic.
5844	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
167	1	a	Big, long, open-world RPG. Grabbed this when it was on sale for $5. Totally worth the sixty or or hours I got out of it (and I didn't bother doing everything). Great art direction, too.
3658	1	a	You can kill T-Rex'es with a Lightsaber. You can also get eaten by them. 9,8/10
6221	1	a	Go this when it was on sale for $0.99 and I like it. Not aa game I'll spend a long time playing but it's fun for a quick fix.
3572	1	a	Ten times better than Call of Duty. 11/10
397	1	a	KINGDOMS OF AMALUR HERE IT COMES THE RECKONING  Kingdoms of Amalur was a surprisingly good fantasy game. It has a fluid and fun combat system. It has a generic but decent storyline. But best of all, it has good side quests. Some of them are even more interesting then the main storyline at times.  What I liked most about Kingdoms of Amalur, personally... was how you could build your character in whatever way you wanted. You were not tied down to any restricted class. But you could cross-class between three different trees. Don't like what you ended up doing? No problem. You can re-spec your character at any time during the game. Gold is no object, as there seems to be an over abundance of it in the game. I finished the game with over 6 million pieces of dosh. If that gives you any idea how much money you can make in this.  The story goes like this. Your character gets killed doing something he or she shouldn't have been. You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?  Weapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.  The game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.  The DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia &amp; Dead Kenan &amp; Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!  So am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.  Finale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)
2810	1	a	It's a game featuring cyber-soldiers with jet-packs, shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, cloaking devices, and a bunch of other weapons and gear against waves upon waves of dinosaurs. And it costs one dollar. There's no reason not to buy it and spend at least an hour or two messing around in this game. Also, rocket launchers and jet-packs are OP.
471	1	a	i recommend this game and i also forgot how to spell recommend for like 2 minutes even though it's on the page
3114	1	a	Slaying dino never felt so good.  The graphics is not so good but not so bad (1$ game, what you expect ?!). It is fun, it co-op, ROTFL mode on with this game. And 4-pack ? this game should consider 15-Pack. This game was way more fun if you played it with your close friend in the same room.
104	1	a	 Nothing revolutionary, but the perfect scratch for your Action-Fantasy itch
5311	1	a	It's a game with Dinosaurs in it. Why are you still reading this? WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT IT YET? LET ME SAY AGAIN, IT. HAS. DINOSAURS. IN. IT.
1737	1	a	I just love this game! Lots of action, but you control the pace. Great RPG game
4680	1	a	0/10 They're changing it.
2242	0	a	tedious
4247	1	a	This game is good for simulating human VS Dinosaur. The rampage mode allows you to be a dino and is fun. I highly reccomend the game
1154	1	a	Loads of quests and good story line. Recommended
4866	1	a	Just got it, can't wait to play
3757	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
5720	0	a	if you enjoy dinos this game is for you
5187	0	a	All i can say is the game is too repetitive...
5250	0	a	I want to like this game, so bad. but inbetween a terrible player base and constantly losing connection ive yet to play a full game from start to finish. the 7 hours i played is not alot relatively speaking, but â¥â¥â¥â¥, youd think youd at least play 1 game all the way through. Other players leave you to die, steal your vehicle leaving you stranded and take your equipment after you die. Not to mention the constant series of kicks ive gotton after simply going down once after i join 4 or 5 waves in.  If by chance these things dont frustrate you and you manage to hurdle past these issues, the connectivity is so wonky youll disconnect in the midst of a fire fight.  This game has a great premise and wonderful execution, iand i desperatley want to like it, but god damn is it hard. maybe my experience is unique to me alone but thats my review
3107	1	a	It made me â¥â¥â¥â¥ upon myself
2336	0	a	What can I say ? After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material. What a waste of time AND money.
1545	1	a	This is a great game, Reminds me almost exactly of Fable 3 (but better). It has quirky characters, a fun story, and lots of side quests. And the looting is maybe one of my favorite parts so far. The combat is amazing and intricate, every battle feels intense and theres plenty of room for different stratigies. A must buy for RPG fans. KoA is making a name for itself, that is for sure! Try it, it won't dissapoint :D
2596	1	a	Quite possibly the best wave-based dinosaur FPS's ever.
2784	1	a	This game is some of the best fun I've had playing a multiplayer on the PC in a VERY long time. Thumbs up from me!
707	1	a	right now this is my favorite game
3764	0	a	Abortion of a game.
3861	1	a	I've spent countless hours playing this game.
4386	1	a	OMG what awesome fun this is just get it
1441	1	a	If you ever wanted a 3rd person Skyrim with actual fun melee-combat and not powered by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GameBryo, then look no further! While I do agree with the common criticism that the story is very generic, and that the side-quests gets VERY MMO-like (especially near the end), I did overall find this title pretty damn good. Combat flows nicely, the stats and crafting is just complex enough for this type of game, and you can easily regulate how easy/hard the game is by doing or not doing sidequests. Highly recomended!  It's so sad that the studio got disbanded though, I would really love to see a proper sequel to this made by the same team.
4611	0	a	It was really cool until i played it
2315	1	a	10/10 best game ever  buy 4-pack and play with your m8
2421	1	a	THIS GAME IS ONLY .99 AND ITS VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS I PURCHASED 5 COPIES OF THIS AND SENT TO FRIENDS THIS IS A COMBINATION OF HALO + BORDERLANDS 2 + Planetside 2 I ENJOYED IT A LOT 10.5/10
981	1	a	I have played this game with no steam and with steam it was fun better then Skyrim but this is just my opinion.  The only thing I hate is that there are no Japanese swords (Katana)
4968	0	a	Played A while Back When It had a free weekend deal thing ( Before this F2P version) It was Okay Then. Now it is bad. I think people who paid for the first game should get a refund. (not including me)
6407	1	a	Quite good needs upgrades for all weapons not just all the weapons upgrade at the same time
2244	1	a	Well, do you want to have your TBS collection complete!? This is a MUST buy, it compiles the previous versions within one (Disciples 3 Renaissance + Disciples 3 Resurrection). They also added new content and fixed lots of bugs. This game has a good story, a dark theme that's even reflected in the UI of it...like the previous versions of it. The game is a little difficult for beginners, but a good challenge for those that know how to play TBS games.  And by the way it has nothing related to Heroes of Might and Magic. IT'S NOT A CLONE OF IT!!! Damn, look at a dictionary before, they can be compared but they have their own style.  I could explain features or combat, or even give spoilers, but there are enough videos and screenshots around....but why looking at them!?   JUST BUY THIS GEM AND GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET!!!
585	1	a	If WoW, God of War, Skyrim, Dragon Age and Fable had an orgy, this is the product. 10/10 A force to be RECKON with.
2955	1	a	How to play this game: Pull out a gun, load it and shoot your head off. I played this game and i got molested by a T-Rex 11/10
1007	1	a	What is wrong with this game? Well, so far, it's that it suffers from the crippling disease that Fable 2 suffered from...the company over-hyped the whole game idea and concept.  Also, Skyrim. 'Cause, let's face it, Bethesda has years of experience and an established engine they have been fine-tuning and improving for the better part of a decade. This studio didn't have the years, experience, or group work that Bethesda holds onto, but, as a Freshman release (this was their one and ONLY game), it definitely holds up a pretty high bar for first release. Nothing about the game is revolutionary...it is a pretty generic game overall. Open world concept (Elder Scrolls, GTA, Sacred), but semi-lineared (like sacred), high octane combat (God Of War, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta), a solid skill tree (Champions of Norrath, Dragon Age, Guild Wars 2), and a fairly vibrant world. Yes, it borrows elements from all of these, but it definitely does fall shy of any them in terms of the elements. The game is solid. Just, solid. It's smooth, has fairly impressive voice-acting, and nothing but the generic fetch and kill quests seem lacking.  That's is it's major pro, is that it is a solid action RPG. Champions of Norrath meets God of War in a semi-open world, and does it very well. The combat is fluid, the world exploring is fun. It isn't quite sandbox....your map isn't a giant square that lets you go wherever among the four walls that is the map. It's semi-enclosed, but still fairly large and definitely explorable. I've never been able to get engrossed in the Elder Scrolls or Fallout series for that reason alone...the map is TOO open...my OCD combined with my want to explore just get me frustrated in a few minutes of wondering what the hell to do. Kingdoms keeps the areas more enclosed and organized, while still leaving room for plenty of wandering and visiting.  I recommend the game for any RPG or Hack and Slash lover. It's foundation is solid. Very solid. It's a shame the game didn't kick off as well as it needed to for the company to grow and expand on the engine...it has major potential.
6400	1	a	The mechanics of this game are so broken, it's beautiful.
3382	1	a	OMG THIS GAME IS INSANE! I recommed this game to everyone! I like to kill dino's ;D But those small creatures are hard to spot -_-
1753	1	a	Though it is a bit repetitive, this is quite a fun role-playing game. Choose any combination of character skills (from might, finesse, and sorcery branches) and highly-customizable items to travel through the massive world of Amalur. As previously mentioned, the sidequests do become very repetitive - but the main storyline is fun to complete. Similar to Skyrim, but with a more fluid combat system.
2503	1	a	It plays like Halo! It's got Dinosaurs but it's a breakfast cereal! 
293	1	a	I would highly recommend this game! Great fantasy RPG, huge world, lots of dungeons to explore, more quests than you could count, and fantastic combat. Love it! &lt;3
1462	1	a	One of the 'Awsomest' RPG's ive played recently!  Unlike most RPG's lately that are somewhat lacking in terms of combat, im thinking Skyrim, but make it up with plot and character progression. Kingdoms of Amalur has an awsome combat system that reminds me of Darksiders or Vindictus (without the smash attacks.) The plot itself was pretty cool but the random sidequests picked up in towns or out and about were somewhat lackluster and usually involved a lot of running to get to your objective. However, Kingdoms of Amalur also has what is called 'faction quests.' As the title suggests these quests are a chain that are issued by a particular group, think thieves guild or mages college and I definately enjoyed doing these.  All in all i'd give Kingdoms of Amalur a 7-8/10, take that how you will.
2874	1	a	I played this game when it was free for a day and I was very negative and only looked at the bad parts of the game.  But when my friend and I wanted to play some co-op we decided to give this a second try. And It's actually really fun! Maybe the idea and sounds are kind of cheesy but the game is packed with hours of fun.  I recomend this game for the people who want's a good cheap co-op game. 10/10 would dinosaur again.
4838	0	a	Don't be fooled by the trailers. This game is surrounded in controversy, mainly due to it's main developer David Prassel. Among a long list of nefarious acts, Prassel has been accused of stealing elements from other games, laying off employees without paying them for work, and manipulating message boards to deflect negative criticism towards the game. In addition Prassel tried to rebrand the game formerly known as 'Dino Beatdown' into 'Dino Horde' to increase Metacritic scores; claiming it to be a sequel when it's more of a content update. Even if one were to ignore the game's depraved upbringing, the game with it's comically short T-Rex arms fails to grasp the lofty claims and over-hype created presumably by Prassel.  Ignoring the game's heavy influence from Halo, the gameplay revolves around a stereotypical group of 'space marines' defending bases against swarms of prehistoric predators, which in of itself sounds okay on paper. However, within the first hour of playing, any seasoned gamer with a critical bone in their body will start to see the game's inherent flaws emerge. The game which marketed itself around commiting mass dino-cide features a surprisingly laughable AI that would make a Stegosaurus roll in it's sedimentary grave. The dinos tend to path in a completely linear fashion towards the player which makes 'Dino Horde' feel more like 'Dino Queue' which really brings the atmosphere in the game to extinction. Taking high ground will often result in dinosaurs running around in erradic beelines as you frantically spray at them with shoddy hit registration until they die. Don't worry about the hit registration though, because all of the basic ground dinosaurs can be run down inside of invincible ground vehicles such as the Wartho- I mean 'Gladiator' combat buggy, making firearms completely pointless outside of killing large dinosaurs. No seriously, I ground dinos into lizard burger for an hour and was awarded top score for being the most unskilled player on my team before I logged off in bitter apathy.  I tried giving this game a fair chance, I really did. I tried looking past Prassel coddling his 'baby' like an overprotective parent, his apparently questionable business practice and his deplorable attempt at dodging Metacritic rating, Underneath it all though was only the husk of a game, a grand idea with poor execution, and unfortunately it will not keep the interest of experienced gamers. Don't get me wrong, this game can be a fun waste of time with friends, but you should be laughing WITH the game, not AT it. Until someone can nail the 'dino defense' game on the head, my dream will remain fossilized in amber until it's DNA can be extracted and brought back to life, which sadly will most likely not be anytime soon.
3161	1	a	I've never been much of a fan of Shooters, but this game keeps bringing me back for more. Have you ever played a game where you can shoot dinos with a powerful array of weapons, or been able to kill a T-Rex by punching it in the face? Well, despite Sally more likely to end up eating you whole, this game has that, and so much more. It may lack the story that Guardians of Orion has, but nothing's as good at relieving tension than running through Prehistoric mode solo, as you can set enemy damage, health, large and small dinosaur ratios, starting credits, and credit drop rate to become a dinosaur killing machine, easily going on a 6 hour spree without even realizing how much time has passed. For just a dollar you can get so much fun out of this gem of a game, so I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a chance.
12	1	a	Addictive poker role playing with real tactical depth making sure every battle keeps you on your toes, all at a bargain price.Delivers an interesting and fun variation of a traditional card game and turns it into a competitive puzzle with myriad nuances to its strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn't do enough to keep the variation fresh throughout.If you're looking for a card game and you're in love with the poker Runespell: Overture could be your game but keep in mind it has no multiplayer and the gameplay can be extremely repetitive.
3420	1	a	Air lifted a Deinosuchus with a spaceship. 5/5
4004	0	a	Absolute Crap, no wonder it was on sale
5639	0	a	Not even worth the download on a free week. They somehow cloned Halo with dinosaurs but yet still managed to make it suck somehow.  It's almost not even possible to do and yet somehow Spiral managed to screw up the marriage of Halo and Dinosaurs even worse than the way 800 North screwed up Nazi's and Dinosaurs.(Dino-D-Day)  So now begs the question......will Dinosaurs ever kick â¥â¥â¥ in video games ever again?
3513	1	a	Before the update of March 1st, this was a fairly average game with a few flaws. I found it fun to shoot dino hores with friends, and would find the whole experiene to be banterous. However with the update it has just revolutionsied the game and made it so much better. I would honestly recommend everyone with friends to buy it, (but if you dont then dont bother). 10/10, would recommend to a friend.
2439	1	a	Definitely better than what the metacritic suggests. And for $1 right now... totally worth it. Get it while it lasts! Has the structure for replayability, especially with friends.  Edit: The previous was my inital reaction. A more detailed review to come.
2692	0	a	This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?  The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is 'downed'. The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little 'increments' when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.  Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?  It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was 'Dino Beatdown' or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.  Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.
4037	1	a	Only $0.99 to kill dinosaurs? Amazing. 11/10
1560	1	a	Awesome game, really fun. To bad the company no longer exists
5610	0	a	The idea sounded cool, so I tried it. I really can't get into it. The voices were annoying and I feel like the graphics on some things (rocks, grass, trees) are on an overkill level and I had to manually turn the graphics settings down. The is a solo mode but it's not a story mode, it's just a play with bots mode which I found disappointing because being new to the game I had no idea what I was doing. The gameplay is choppy at best. Sound quality is horrible for a FPS. My surround sound is pointless for this game because it doesn't seem to use it. Also, I kept getting dropped from servers. I would love to see this game redone (again) with the Unreal engine.
2809	1	a	its pretty fun for the price, nothing special but very enjoyable with friends, just buggy enough to give you a laugh without being frustrating, easy to pick up and very scalable in difficulty, from being a cakewalk at lower difficulties to being nigh impossible at higher ones  same price as a cheeseburger, you cant go wrong
4253	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
2300	1	a	Always wanted to know what would happen if you rammed a jeep into T-Rex  11/10
1411	1	a	listen up this is a great game except for 1 thing the moving cam angles suck donkey nuts u either see too low or very high and it makes seeing your surroundings impossible
275	1	a	Great game really enjoy it. A mix of Fable and Oblivion.
2710	0	a	bring the pizza
5649	0	a	This may be the literal worst thing on steam. I think it's definitely a contender at the very least.
2667	1	a	Its just fun, I don't know how else to explain it. Little sweet $5 game.
5933	0	a	i played alot more in this game than i should have... had more fun than i should have why brick why
1574	1	a	One of the BEST RPG game !!!
5258	0	a	Overall clunky and unbalanced. There is a lot wrong with this game that I really don't feel like making a big review about it. It's just not worth spending any money on.
503	1	a	A very good alternative to Skyrim. I have had great fun so far, although the quests (as expected with a game of this size) do get a bit samey as the game goes on. Fun in small bursts and definately worth it if the game is on offer!
909	0	a	Feels like an MMO both story- and contentwise. Combat is as boring as Fable.
1751	1	a	Suprisingly good and really fun
83	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest but with poker instead of gems. Although there's not the same depth as the Puzzle Quest series it's still a lot of fun.
1872	1	a	More of a casual RPG that has pretty decent story and not a bad leveling system. This game was originally supposed to be an MMO but was modified part way through the development process into a single player game (and it shows from level design and region/zone layout and parsing, to combat, to the inventory system, and so on). Overall an ok RPG that leaves you with a somewhat positive experience (not as bland or trope heavy as Dragon Age but no where near any of the Elder Scroll games).
1749	1	a	Holy crap this is what Fable III SHOULD HAVE BEEN! This game rocks socks!
2435	1	a	I played this game for 25 hours striaght for Extra Life 2013, and despite the obvious exhastion of playing a video game for that long, it was a surprisingly fun experience! There was more than enough content to keep me occupied by myself for around 10 hours, and 10 more if you have friends to play with. Of course it isn't perfect, the looping music can get very repetitive, but it does a good job of getting you hyped up. As of this review, it is on sale for $0.99 and Free-to-Play, so at least give it an hour of your time, and be patient with it.
2595	1	a	ONION: Dino Hoes has no onions  10/10 broke it
4014	1	a	This game was a mixture of L4D2, halo and borderlands2. Very fun game 10/10.
1066	1	a	I have played more than 300 hours on Skyrim, and I find KOA way more fun !, infact I have not had this much fun since Gothic 2...   I really don't get why this game got such a bad rap ? Love the quests, Love the combat style, Love the crafting system, love the world... Great game, my only wish was that the game was moddable, mainly because there will be no sequel and having a community putting out some unofficial content to keep the game going would have been great.   I rate this game a good 8 out of 10 which is pretty high, well worth the price for countless hours of fun.
3640	1	a	I nominated it for the 'i'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.  I'll never see that 49 cents again :(
2674	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
1736	1	a	The review of Fable x Skyrim is spot on. The game is a little easy.. but it was relaxing. It is very linear, combat isn't bad.. too many quests at times. I skipped all the side quests after a while and just had to focus on the end game.   Yeah.. hack / slash / loot.. and repeat. Overall, a solid 7/10.
1557	1	a	Brilliant game, and worth any price, it has great mechanics and systems in place to enrich your RPG experience, vast lore and sidequests to explore. Truly a glorious addition to steam, though some disagree and think this game is a blight i see no reason to think so. It has a strong and entertaining story full of moments where you will assuredly gasp with awe.  I Nayphun recommend this game whole heartedly.
6395	1	a	i really like this game but i have tons of lag as of right now.once when i get a new/better pc/laptop it will be one of my fav/top 10 games i would play all the time
5683	0	a	this game isn't fun at all 3/10
878	0	a	I haven't played it much, but the emptiness of the dialogue, the lack of emotions or immersion in PNJ faces (or even though yours), made the game really feeling like a waste of time to continue.
1536	1	a	This game is what most RPG arent: Awesome, and have their own style instead of the repetitive questing and mindless button mashing most RPGs are. If only it had multiplayer...
6033	1	a	Buy it! You can even byu it for friends! It seems weird at the beginning, but you will start to like it!
3456	1	a	Hilariously fun! Only played a couple times but It's definitely worth more than a dollar
4417	0	a	Awful textures from 1998, hideous color schemes, poor draw distance, ugly menus, the worst sound design and weakest musical score you will ever hear in a game. Ever. This game is bad and a major waste of your money.
968	1	a	This game has more content than the entirity of Burning Crusade era World of Warcraft, but with a more engaging combat system. Think Zelda 64 meets World of Warcraft and you've pretty much got it.  The major problem with this game is the difficulty. Even on the hardest setting the game is mind numbingly easy.  If you're the type of person who doesn't care about challenge or regularly plays with cheat codes just to have fun this is a great game for you.
1945	1	a	I'm only 4 and the gameplay is incredibly satisfying. This game took the best parts of the diablo, WoW, and other RPG single players and added entirely new fighting mechanics and combos that are incredibly satisfying and make you feel like a beast. I've played a caster in every RPG I've ever played - this is the first one that makes me want to melee (and you can melee as a caster, and yes, it's actually viable and powerful!). Lots of single player fun, highly recommended.
1809	1	a	Great game, good graphics and gameplay. Could play over and over again.
3899	1	a	very very fun game 
2531	1	a	It's Halo. BUT WITH FRICKING DINOS. nuff said
1187	1	a	I'm pleasantly impressed with this game. It feels a lot like Fable to me, but much more finished, larger, with better control, depth and... okay nothing at all like Fable.   The reviews I see here compare it a lot to Skyrim. Mostly in that people hate Skyrim but love this. It's really apples and oranges. They're both very good games, but for very different reasons. This one is a lot more traditional at its core. There are main quests that advance you through the maps and local side quests for each area. I honestly haven't tested if maps beyond my current exploration are leveled higher, of it it's all matched to my level. I'll have to look at that later.   The combat system is pretty enjoyable and works smoothly. There is a huge benefit to blocking, and skills to make it even more useful as you progress. There are enough skills and the skill points are few enough to make you make tough choices how you want to build your character. I'm playing a straight fighter and enjoying the hell out of it. But from what I did on the starting missions, both mage and rogue seemed like they'd be fun as well. From the fate system, it looks like it's designed for you to be able to mix and match fairly effectively, so you could do a fighter/mage/thief and not completely suck.  Con: The only real con so far is that the main quest line holds absolutely no interest for me. Actually, I can't really tell if there is a story yet. None of the other quests seem at all tied to it. People mention a faraway war a lot and there are some quests relating to that, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with your character's story. You mention the Tuatha, and the only response people give is, 'That's weird, the war is far away from here.'
762	1	a	I really enjoy a deep storyline every once in a while, and this game provided just what I was looking for! I will say that a mount system would have been lovely to compensate for those long runs, but overall the game is amazing. I stumbled across it on the PS3, decided to give it a go, and was pleasantly surprised. Very nice &lt;3.
479	1	a	I wanted this game to be rly great after i saw all reviews, but for me it wasnt total blast in the end. You should buy it is still nice rpg, but I expected something more. The thing that kept me playing was definitely AWESOME Combat sytem. This is 9/10 combat, but camera wasnt that great sometimes but not a huge deal. I hate, that this game doesnt have FOV slider and i couldnt almost play it at original setting so i downloaded 3rd party FOV program (found it in community guides) which made my time with this game much more enjoyable. Also if you are fan of epic story and great storytelling you will be probably kinda dissapointing. Story isnÂ´t awful, but nothing spectacular and storytelling in this game isnÂ´t good enough to keep you invested in characters.  All things considered this game is worth trying if you are fan of action combat and want GOOD RPG (dont expect best RPG ever). PS : sorry for typos
4730	1	a	Best game for 1$ you can find on steam.
621	1	a	The game feels like an abandoned MMORPG. Lame fetch quests, hard difficulty is not hard, just time consuming. Monsters have too much HP yet they can barely hit you. The combat is fun and animated well although gets boring fast because of the stale pace of the game. This could've been a classic RPG if they tried a bit harder. The characters are plain, the plot is somewhat generic, the game has zero depth. Maybe co-op could've saved this game but it's only single-player. 5/10
4112	0	a	
113	1	a	Great RPG would recommend .   PROS: -descent story. -Great combat. -Good graphics. -Good character progression ( skill tree ) -Alot of activities and side quests . -Huge amount of armor sets and weapons. -Crafting   CONS: -Cant see character stats ( have to count crit chance manually ) -Game becomes easy after a certain point. -Limited stash space ( not enough space to stash all stuf you loot )
6075	0	a	If you have a few hours to waste and $1 to spare, its ok. If it wasn't so cheap I'd say its a waste of time, sell some cards and buy this is you absolutely have to, otherwise don't bother.
5764	0	a	This game is an awful piece of dinosaur poop, and doesn't deserve more than one sentence in a review about it.
4978	0	a	This game, although cheap, is not worth 79p.
4187	1	a	A very fun game, and only for 1$!!! 
670	1	a	Very Good Everyone Should Have Played This.
4544	0	a	I bought this game for a doller. I was suprised that not only did i get a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game but that I was not able to refund it!
4435	0	a	Thought this woudl be fun with some friends. Lasted for 2 hours, it's just too clunky and slow. Getting into the same server is a pain, and play is just not great.
4457	0	a	this game is stupid
5721	0	a	Dont support thieves. Unfortunately I did and I truelly regret it now...
2753	1	a	After being disappointed by a few other games claiming to offer a fun time kicking dinosaur butt, I was reluctant to buy this, even at the ridiculous sale price of 1.49. After a friend recommended it, I found to be a great shooter with a nice arcadey feel that not only features great human vs. dino combat, but also fulfilling human deathmatch modes. That being said, I strongly recommend this game to be played with friends. Help get this underrated FPS to where it deserves to be.
1377	1	a	Old but gold: One of the best RPGs I've ever played.  Totally worth it, even with some bugs and no support.
2231	0	a	With beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack, and the Disciples name in the title what could possibly go wrong? Well the most important part of the game, the combat, kills the game. It's clunky, difficult to control your troops, you cant pick which direction to attack the enemy from (flanking and such), and the camera acts weird. I've only played like 2 hours and already I'm losing interest. If only they would have designed the battle part of this game better...I'd be hooked.
1769	1	a	Amalur could've used a bit more polish before release. It has its ups but the downsides keep it from being awesome. If you're a fan of western action RPGs, chances are you'll get some enjoyment out of this, but for it to be considered great, takes a certain type of personal taste. Kingdom's of Amalur isn't a masterpiece, but it's not god-awful either, thankfully. Perhaps most of the issues could be fixed if a sequel is ever made, though that seems unlikely with the developer having gone bankrupt.  Mind you, I'm still going through the game so some of these points may change.  The good:  + Customizable combat. You can switch between a mage, rogue or warrior or a combination of any of them pretty easily, and there're multiple weapon types in the game, which feel varied enough to keep things interesting. Bonus points for making Chakrams NOT SUCK  + Executing entire packs of enemies through Fate is pretty fun to watch  + The atmosphere &amp; exploration. I've rather enjoyed running around, discovering hidden loot caches and secret rooms, and the world's varied enough for me to enjoy exploring it  + The music. I found it rather relaxing in downtime, and exciting enough to fuel the fights in combat, though more variety would've been welcome  + The lore. I find this concept of a 'Fateless' person that is able to stand against the pre-determined destiny rather fascinating  The Bad:  - The graphics are a bit dated, even considering that the game went for a bit cartoony appearance which tends to age well  - Using Fate in combat is a quicktime event. I hate quicktime events. But at least it's brief  - Some weapons are broken, chief offenders being the bow and chakrams. You can completely stunlock some, if not all, enemies with them  - The inventory system is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. Each new thing takes up a spot and comparing items is a pain. And it takes ages to vendor everything, and you will be doing this a lot because most of the loot is completely useless.  - Money drops left and right. I haven't managed to drop below 60 thousand gold pieces yet, and it just keeps building up. And I'm not sure what there is to spend it on aside from inventory upgrades, since I've found all my best items  Personal pet peeves:  * There is no jump button, and jumping around in RPGs is something I rather enjoy * Default controls use Shift for Block, not Sprint, unlike pretty much every half-decent game made since the late 90ies.
6099	1	a	I like this game. Especially when i play it with my friends. Maybe they can add weapon attachment customization system.
282	1	a	I had originally played this on the console {Xbox360} and I enjoyed playing it for hours at a time. I believe I spent a good two hundred hours on the side quests and factions alone.   I decided to purchase this game on Steam while it was on sale {Because I am cheap haha.} and it was an amazing purchase. It is as fun as a remember.   As for the keyboard controls, I had to rebind most of them to suit my hand placement. The Wakening mode finisher is difficult for me with a laggy computer to pull off, but it is still rewarding to see those animations.   I would rate this game a nine of ten.
1554	1	a	After playing this on xbox I decided to try it on pc, and i'm glad I did, the graphics are amazing. the game plays like dead rising but has the rpg elements of skyrim 10/10 must buy.
6057	1	a	Enjoyably Fun 11/10 would Exticnt again
5805	1	a	How can I review this game I don't even own it.
3379	1	a	Uhhh, this is a bad game - and I love it. It's trashy, cheesy and a hell of fun.  Play it with friends, though.
2648	0	a	This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.  This game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing name of their game whenever they release a 'big update'. This game was and still is a buggy pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ since launch and despite these 'big updates' the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.  So what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).  Presentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.  But ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.  So it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it.
5199	1	a	Greatest game ever produced, the greatness is so epic, I am not worthy enough player to purchase such a godly title.
1515	1	a	The first and only massive RPG from 38 Studios. This game will take you on a long ride that i personally enjoyed every minute of. With deep class cusutomization and quests that never end, this game is great for long breaks (summer, christmas, ect.) The game is an amazing cross between open world and action RPG elements that create one of the most fluid combat systems ever. I adore the graphical style, music, arrmor sets, abilities, ect. Worth whatever price it is set at. Played over 200 hours with my 360 copy and steam combined.
2686	1	a	I know what you're probably thinking. Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great. I personally enjoy this type of game and it's just action packed and will keep you on the edge of your chair.
3063	1	a	I haven't play'd this game since some of the most, most recent updates as an fyi. When my friends ask me about this game i tell them that this game is buggy and if you come into the game as a try hard wanting to beat it on the hardest difficulty this isn't the game for you. however if you come in with friends and just F around you will have one of the funest experiences of your life.  10/10 Best Simulator for Driving off cliffs in a Truck full of teammates
4733	0	a	Play it only with friends.
2870	1	a	Orion dino horde is extremely fun and you will never get bored, servers are also very easy to make!
772	0	a	Spent a long time playing this game and I just keep coming back to the same issue: I almost like it. Almost.  Combat is fun, graphics work well but the story is completly unengaging. Fun combat and no story does not an RPG make. Sooner or later the shine wears off the combat and you're left with no real reason to complete the game. Shame really.
5816	0	a	I want my money BACK!!!!! -.-
4598	0	a	Clunky and unattractive menu just generally something you'd make on scratch its just ehh 
3124	1	a	Good for a 99c price
5145	1	a	great game love it good gun good game play maps and cars so i can give it a 10/10
2350	1	a	I have not played this game for all it has to offer but I feel like I have already gotten my dollars worth so I do recommend this game, for a dollar it is amazing!  I was looking for a dinosaur game to play with my young son and found Orion: Prelude on sale for a dollar so with great reviews I thought why not?   Only playing one of the several game modes that this game offers (survival) here is my experience. Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress. You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves. One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it. I thought that was pretty cool.  The game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues. The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.  My last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up. I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.
1022	1	a	This game makes me hard. 10/10 would bang
3550	0	a	Here's all the 'strategy' in this game, fill a dino with bullets, buy a bigger gun, fill a dino with bigger bullets rinse and repeat.
108	1	a	This is a review that's going to make me very sad. A sad tiger is not a sight people should have to witness, but nonetheless, hear the tale of the tigers' lament. Hear the tale of the RPG that once was, and will never be. The tale of Amalur.  Kingdoms of Amalur was pitched as a wide, sprawling, epic world. Written by R. A. Salvatore and artwork by Todd McFarlane, this was a world where big names came together to produce an impressive, colourful vista. One where grand battles were fought, where the history of races was told in rich tapestries and stories of lore. Where gnomes were no longer the comedy option (World of Warcraft, yes, you, stop hiding in the back there, this is you I speak to at this point!). A world where the strings of fate invisibly guided everything and everyone around them, and those who could read the weave could fortell glimpses of the future.  The story revolves around the antagonist, one who has managed to unpick the very threads of fate, and the protaganist, you, similarly freed from fate, and your journey from the rags on your back (and the start which sees you unceremoniously dumped in a pile or corpses), to eventual confrontation with the evil that threatens to consume the world. The story has been told many times in many other games, but it is presented with a style and sheen that carries itself well here, the core plot quests keep a coherency and pace that maintain your interest through the rather lengthy world. Not to mention the absolute *ton* of side quests and factions you can involve yourself in, and their own stories and backgrounds, all of which are intricately details and have their own little plot twists. This is a game that prides itself on depth.  ... Right up until you step into it and realise that this was probably intended as an MMO. It... takes a bit of a mental adjustment to begin with, because the world, and everything in and around it, feels at first -like- an MMO made singleplayer, there's the vendors, the towns, the crafting system, in fact, so little of it feels single player tailored you'd be forgiven for asking 'Where are all the other players?'. Once you begin the combat however, that slowly fades into the background, combat in the game is intuitive, flashy, and visceral, with a wide variety of weapons, and a constant encouragement to alternate between magic and weapon attacks, this is a game that rewards variety and creative use of your toolset.  Get over that initial mental bump however, and you'll quickly settle into a large, expansive game, with a wide and diverse world, which okay, will oft remind you that it does feel like an MMO minus the other players, but then equally it will take you places and on journeys that a lot of Roleplaying games have almost forgotten how to manage these days. It's a wonderful thing.  This unfortunately is why I am a sad tiger. The company that made this game is now bankrupt, and the assets have been sold off and everything connected to it, scattered to the four winds. There will not be a sequel, or an MMO, or any further patches or adjustments. The final product is what you get here, with a few idiosyncracies and all. It is a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless. If you wish to get lost in a world for a few days and embark on a properly epic journey, visiting Amalur is definitely a place to consider.
3407	1	a	This game really isn't that bad anyway, so the fact that it is Â£0.79 ($0.99) is phenominal, there's litterally no reason for you and friends not to get this game, being as cheap as it is. Shooting dinosaurs is nice, the easter egg events are great and it really tests you and your friends when you first play.  After not long the game becomes rather easy and you gain more knowledge; make sure to turn the difficulty up.  And not to mention you can 720 blaze a T-Rex with a sniper rifle :D
2766	1	a	crazy fast paced gameplay combined with violent over the top dinos make this a very fun game it just may take a bit to get the setting rights on an older comp like I own
161	1	a	OLD REVIEW WAS A THUMBS DOWN In one word  'Convoluted'   NEW REVIEW BELOW  Ok i recomend this game based mainly on the incredible length and number of quests, decent storylines and dlc. But before you grab it and get bombarded with so many skills and abilites there are some things you should know.  First your skills, more then half are worthless and should be ignored till you have an excess to drop your endgame poitns into. IGNORE Lockpicking, mercantile, and stealth. The Most important skill from the start is the FIND HIDDEN skill, get that to 5.  Dispell is the next skill, get that to 6 or higher, dispelling is the hardest thing about opening magicaly locked chests. Persuasion is a mixed bag, it won't change any major storylines, but it can lead to a few extra rewards. It's not game breaking, CRAFTING COMES LAST Crafting won't make a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of difference till the very end end end of the game, the gear you find will be better until the very end, Sage Crafting and Blacksmityh go hand in hand. SageCrafting can get to 6 or 8 Alhemy can realy be ingored, up to the user but it really can be. you'll be so rich you can buy the potions you need easily, and plenty drop.   CLASSES, Ask yourself, do you want to blaze through the game or slowly go through the game? Mages are FAST DEMOLITIOSHERS, WARRIORS are unkillable slow dps, you have to TRY to die as a warrior. Stealth seems nice but it's so slow you often ignore stealth kills and just go into combat, also the finesse/stea;th tree is majorly focused on bows.  You can mix and match any 2 or 3 trees for hybrid classes, but it keeps you from getting the top tier abilities in each.  Suggestion, don't make your first guy a warrior, don't try to craft till your lvl 25+ Get your Find Hidden to 5 ASAP  If you don't follow those basic suggestions this game is going to be tedious and so slow in the first 8 hours you'll hate it like I first did. i went to gamefaqs and read some guides to learn what was crap and what wasn't.  7.5/10 Better then most RPG's LOTS of play time, many ways to play, ability to fully espec into something else entirely is great, the DLC is super long. Adds 10-20 hours each on top of a 35-50 hour game. If you're a lore reader (which I am no) expec to drop 100+hours for a full completion
4188	1	a	Laughed at friend buying this game thought it looked â¥â¥â¥â¥. got given copy spent the next 2 hours epically fighting Trex's. A terex through a boulder at my face. 11/10 would take a boulder to the face again.
1841	1	a	I bought this game cheaply during the Summer sale and I must say I'm extremely happy with the purchase. So far the game has been very entertaining and I can imagine myself playing this for a long while.
1310	1	a	I really enjoy this game. Similar in play style to Warcraft, Rift and others, without having all the griefers, trolls and fails to deal with. Plenty of questing to keep you busy (if that's your thing) for many hours on end.
5658	0	a	I paid for the game and its now free. watta â¥â¥â¥â¥ move.
2740	1	a	 I dont know why people complain about this game, i think it is very enjoyable, fun to play with friends,and the bugs that people seem to complain about(example:cant connect servers/lobbys, vehicles like Vtols crash around, dinosaurs pop to outposts,walk trough walls and other that kind of lies. I havent met any of these so said 'real bugs' in the game. I can connect the game lobbys when i want, the game has crashed only 2 times for me, the dinosaurs are not phasing trough the walls, VTOLS and other vehicles work like they should. The complaining about the sounds aint true, atleast i dont have them, weapons sound just like they should( except the Revolver, but it might have intergrated silencer like WW2 STEN had). Buy this game for real, you can enjoy it, or hate it doesnt make my life different. 
4422	0	a	this game is absolutely terrible. i bought a 4 pack when it first came out. (at full price) they its had its name changed twice since then. terrible terrible game. dont believe my hours played either. the game didnt close and kept running in the background. save youself some money and shoot yourself in the leg for the same experience.
1457	1	a	All round solid RPG, allows you to combine range/rogue.warrior/tank/mage hybrid in a very nice blend, brilliant lore and in depth story makes this game a must play for any RPG fan
3062	1	a	at $0.99 I have already enjoyed this game tremendously for what I spent. Only have 2hrs in at the moment, but those were a couple of really fun hours for me and my buddies. This game has some terrible reviews, but I think it has come a long way since those reviews. Bottom line, this is a good game for its price, and a GREAT game for its current sale price.

2947	1	a	So...the enemy AI is crap, the music is repetitive, and the guns/shooting is uninspired. Why am I recommending this? Well, it often goes on sale for under a dollar and the sheer enjoyment of co-op dinosaur shooting makes up for it. Expect about 4 hours of entertainment from this before your ears start to bleed from the sounds, but hey, 4 hours with friends shooting T-Rex are ones well spent.
3843	1	a	Amazing Game nothing else to say  just amazing
567	1	a	I completed the version from origin, completed xbox version and now it's time for steam version.  No. They are all the same. I just had to buy all of them. For my own sanity. No matter what, this game is still the best. Story is perfect.  Worst thing about this game is that there won't be more Kindgoms of Almalur in the future.   ...but I have a little hope...
4423	0	a	waste of time and money.
496	1	a	It is a fun game with an intriguing story, lots of side-quests, that it does not end when you complete the main story(which is good). In addition, I encountered *no bugs* during play(which is *very* important in the era of bug-infested games) *and* it does *not* need a DRM to be installed to play(which was one of the factors to buy this game. I do not buy games needing a DRM after my HOMM VI fiasko). The optional EA registration during installation does not interfere with offline play and, although I could not see the 'skip'/'cancel' button during that, others have reassured me that it exists but I missed it.  Easy controls, nice class system, ability to roleplay your character the way you enjoy best and very flexible in giving you the chance to rebuild your character in case you feel you do not enjoy the choices you had made so far.  Not recomended to the hardcore RPG player but recomended to everyone else.

1225	1	a	best game ever, your power depends on your playstyle and whether or not you stay true to that, i did amazing with a sword, shield, heavy armor and crafting.  i died repetedly, while relying on magic, and i had no fun as a rouge.  however, that is because of how i play, not how the game is balanced, which is what really makes this shine to me
178	1	a	I don't understand why this game couldn't sell enough copies to stay afloat. It's beautiful, huge, high fantasy, with fun combat. Borrows from Fable, Diablo, Elder Scrolls. Lots of side missions and lore, good voice acting. It's a really solid rpg and I wish they were still working on the sequel.  Only complaint is that the pc port was obviously hurried and they'll never fix the bugs now (eg quests menu is totally unusable on larger monitors, no walk speed, redonkulous unchangeable menu key bindings).
2890	1	a	Got the game as a gift, started playing seriously a couple weeks ago.  Played as assault class, purchased perk to get other class adrenaline weapons.  Roll in the final round with 2 pistols, 2 LMG, double grenades, and a Gattling gun. Mow down three large dinosaurs with the pistols and the grenades. Pull out both LMG's, take down the Crocodile looking motherf*****. *Morph into Hank Hill* 'That T-Rex is always throwing rocks at me. I think I'll go over there and gvie it a piece of my mind.' *Pull out gattling gun* *Put five hundred rounds into the T-Rex's head* 'There we go, Bobby. He ain't gonna be throwing no more rocks. I taught him a lesson.' The whole place explodes as I Matrix walk out of the canyon.   -Directed by Michael Bay
1468	1	a	It's like next-gen Fable. Molyneux eat your heart out.
6196	1	a	a very fun dino game to play with friends :D
458	1	a	Its Like Skyrim but with an actual story, engaging combat , and genuine quests!  8/10 get it if you like action RPGs. be warned though, its semi-Open world game.
519	1	a	Sound: 8,5 Graphics: 9 Story: 9.5 Gameplay: 8.5 Commands: 8.5 Keep the gamer playing: 9.5 DLCs / Expansions: 7.5 Time to load / lag: 9 Bugs / Problems: 8.5  Final Score: 9
462	1	a	The most epic, colourful and beautiful fairytale I 've seen. Enourmous world, a lot of locations and places of stunning beauty to explore,great plot, style and attention to details and history, yet at the same time without any boring and repeating stories. Along with the main story, there are a lot of !!!!!!! (a whole lot of)!!!!! different quests for factions and just NPCs. With 2 DLCs ( each as big as the main storyline) you can play this game for a very very long time. And this time you'll spend with a great pleasure.
5533	1	a	i got it when it was .99 cents and it was worth it, but im not sure about it going f2p
5081	1	a	make a version of it for ps4 it will be awsome 
2871	1	a	I was told this game was really bad by friends. With a free weekend we started to play the revamped version and I must say it is a blast to play coop on CONQUEST. I will be supporting there new kickstarter on feb 27 for an open world game. Give this game a try and you will not regret it, this team has pulled a complete 180 with their game and you can see with their updates that the truly care.
3060	1	a	It's a decent game i guess. A little bit of bugs and other stuff but it's ok. :3
4915	1	a	Upset I bought this game and got nothing in return for them making it free.  Was a good game years ago.  EDIT:  I got helmets..
4072	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. Could it get better?
3498	1	a	This game has more content than some milky milkers,but hei its fraking Hilarious and lovely,much better then some big blockbusters!
3706	1	a	One dollar and you will be addicted. This game is just so fun and simple to play. Team based fast paced shooter where you kill a bunch of dinosaurs. 11/10 a must have for everyone library for a simple dollar.
4813	1	a	This game was bad, now it is good
5581	0	a	I am ashamed to own this game.
5970	1	a	I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO OTHERS. IT IS AWESOME.
5614	0	a	Even though it was only 99 cents i still asked for a refund
150	1	a	You get to punt a gnome through a glass window.
4175	1	a	need optimization
3727	0	a	6/10
1889	1	a	5.5/10 Not the best, but not the worst either.  Pros:  Really fancy graphic and animation. Fun and detailed combat animation. Cartoonish feeling might not appeal to everyone. Game could be fun for a couple of hours. Crafting. Beautiful music.  Cons: Unintuitive and boring story, feels like a mmorpg. Game engine/physics feels a bit outdated. Combat could feel repetitive. Hard to finish since the story is mediocre.  Summary:  Game gives a good first impression, feels like a Witcher/Fable mix. But it gets boring after a while. Worth $10 during sale just to kill time.
1570	1	a	Its a good game
975	1	a	An amazing bargain at Steam sale prices. Feels like a MMORPG without all the annoying players. Easy to pick up and play for a few minutes or all day. Best game ever financed by the state of Rhode Island.
949	1	a	I've played this game before it was launched, when there was only the demo back 2 years ago and I don't remember why it didn't convinced me. It was probably the price, or maybe that I didn't hang off Skyrim, but on a sale I say it's absolutely worth it. I've played like 10 hours or so and I've been gratefully surprised. I've read some reviews and comments bashing about the combat system but it isn't bad at all. It's just a bit different, you have to imagine you're playing some of the Batman titles, dispatching enemies with combos and your muscles (also cunning and sorcery in this case), but at the same time you can decide how to build your hero almost completely, from gear to combat skills. And you do so by choosing among the many many choices you'll be given to build up your hero. Yes, only 3 spec trees, but as you skill up those trees you'll be given fates that will make your character really unique. Maybe you want to be the full warrior kind? go ahead, perhaps you'd like to combine the might of the warrior with the power of magic and make a powerfull hibryd? sure thing!, each one of the posible combinations has a fate that will reasure your prototipe hero's source of power whichever the tree/s it comes from. Also it has a crafting system which can be improved if you want to be a renowned artisan. So, in my opinion, the game is a mix between the Batman titles (has the agility of combat), Dragon Age (talents, specs and lore) Skyrim (the feeling of freedom/sandbox) and Diablo (the loot), this mix is, at least for me, a really good combination to renew the genre.
2949	1	a	i.... i dont know what i just played... where is my bleach stash.....
6360	1	a	Got torn up by some velociraptors 10/10
2405	1	a	I've never posted a serious review below a minimum playtime of 40 hours, but consider the following:  the average wage in western europe is above â¬6/h this game costs about 20% less than an espresso  If I ever want to get my money back, I'll have to work 8 minutes overtime, or walk past the coffee place next morning. I could never down-rate a game that cheap.  Besides, just the mere existence of vehicles and sandbox maps give Orion a very good replay value. Sometimes it feels like back in 2007 on Halo 2.  
1612	1	a	Best RPG I have ever played. If I could describe it in one way, it would be that the creators took all the best elements from WoW, Fable, and TES and put them all in one game. amazing game.
120	1	a	This game is something new in RPG genre.  + Open world thats perfectly sized, not small, not huge; + Unique enemies and characters; + Crafting system; + Long story (With DLCs even longer); + Leveling System; + Possibility of reseting skills whenever You want; + Quest Filter (Main Quests/Faction Quests/Sub Quests);  This game is something like mixed World of Wacraft with Fable, everything is clear and explained, there is nothing You won't understand.  Game like KoA would be an perfect idea for MMORPG.
357	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
5726	1	a	Good dumb fun, let your brain take a breather as you run around shooting dinosaurs in the face. I don't know why it's so fun, it just is. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it. For the price you can't even play an arcade game for 10 minutes, and I got 7 hours out of this so far.
834	0	a	the story is boring
4286	1	a	Got given as a gift but would pay full price for game- really suprised me.
5668	0	a	Game contains stolen assets and is run by greedy devs, not worth giving them any money.
2012	1	a	It is mot very often that you find an Action RPG set in 3rd person that properly conveys the sense of combat and variety of moves, attacks and defenses of their isometric cousins. The game plays like a Tochlight or Diablo. It is also rare to find a game that fully utilizes your graphics potential. I have a crossfire setup and MSI afterburner shows me 96% GPU usage across both cards with both clock and memory frequency maxed. This game usually goes on sale during the summer and autumn sales. If you are a gamer and like Action RPGs do yourself a favour and pull the trigger.
1368	1	a	I love this game! Played it 5 times through on xbox 360, then another 3 times on pc. Can't get enough of this one. I am sad that the chances of a sequel are slim to none, but that just means more time for me to master this one. Anyone out there that enjoys action RPG games should give this one a go.
5502	0	a	this game is not worth it
4257	1	a	10/10 I saved a dudes life by quickscoping a Pterodactyl. Then I turned around at lightening speed and quickscoped a baby Velociraptor 300 feet away. This game is awesome!
2978	1	a	Definately ignore the MetaScore, this game is way better than however it got that rating! Great Co-Op or PVP fun, even play as the Dinos!
2565	0	a	I dont know if im doing something wrong but i have big fps lags with this game, when the rest of tha games i have works well
4734	1	a	Its a game about killing dinos with swords,lasers,bows,rockets,etc. and theres hats and its 1 dollar  It be stupid not to get this game No seriously buy it! You think i left? im still here. Waiting for you to buy it...... I can do this all day........
248	1	a	dungeon crawling rpg with a wide variety of weapons great at making you diversify your weapons/armors the enemy levels are hard to distinguish â¥â¥â¥â¥ wolves
941	1	a	Its fun but you don't go fast enough for how gigantic the maps are. 7.5/10
2282	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun.
71	1	a	It's that kind of game where you fight your ennemies by playing games against them in the style of puzzle quest, but , here you play poker. The idea is ok but the game itself can be boring at times and I stopped playing it when I reached a point where the game was curiously hard and apparently I had to do some grinding against weak ennemies in order to have the items needed to fight a boss or something. On the other hand , it's now really cheap .
3812	0	a	So... The rewiew... Bought this game for 1 euro so i dident know what to expect. Now i know. This is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ive ever played. I dont think you can make a game any more bad. I put the graphics up to full and it still looked like â¥â¥â¥â¥... When i got into my first game there were no other torturial than 'Use wasd to walk' And thats it... Nothing else was there and i just walked around without knowing what to do..  1/10 ....
4555	1	a	Got in a jeep and was eaten by T-rex. 11/10
1263	1	a	I plaed this game for like 15 minutes i run up the hill at the start and i look at the PC screen and wonder wtf i am doing then i turn it off and i havent played it since     10/10
1332	1	a	My verdict: Its not a skyrim, but it had its own charm that made it a good game. there were a few booboos but also skyrim have had thsoe. A huge world to explore, a nice combat system, not to mention the amazing crafting possibilities. Hours or rather, DAYS of fun. :3c
3268	1	a	This is a game that if a bigger budget was available, it would be amazing! As it stands, it is good. Fun Co-op or Single Player. Great weapons, good dinosaur combat and plenty of ways to customise your map variables (dinosaur health/damage, timers, vehicles, oddly funny extra dinosaur waves). I've been playing since Orion: Dino Horde and I enjoyed that game too. Sure it has bugs and some issues and not amazing visuals compared with $40 Million dollar games, yet it is surprising replayable and trying to get even more XP the next game by using Melee is great! Punch a T-Rex in the head! There are not that many 'Survival' levels which is what I mainly play but still good solid fun. And won't cost much at all! Recommended!
1400	1	a	HUUUUGE world to explore, hundreds of quest and content to keep you busy.
203	1	a	Really good, it like I'm playing skyrim, but with a better battle mechanics.
3638	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA
2202	1	a	The definitive version of Disciples 3, with many improvements, but also carries over some of the faults found in the original release. Difficulty still fluctuates all over the place during the campaigns and so missions can turn into grind fests.  Worth picking up on sale.
5785	1	a	Who cares about:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Epic game for 0,99c pls more and firetruck negative reviews just because of this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
6016	0	a	Can't say I really enjoyed my time with it.
1854	1	a	Very well made game. I think it was released too close to Skyrim, so no one noticed it. Feels like Fable, but much better.
2783	1	a	It has dinosaurs, and you shoot them..... 10/10
5616	1	a	Really fun game specially with friends. Not the most extreme epic graphics and textures but the game is still very much fun all around. A must have as part of a LAN party pack.
1867	1	a	Such a great game! Super Huge map
4210	1	a	The Metacritic is misleading , the game got completly remade after the bad critics wave they eaten up with courage and now the game is combination beetween halo and a survival game with dino ! Simply awsome , the coop aspect is essential to keep being alive. 7/10 With more updates it will become epic , oh yeah and there an open world gamemode.
5752	0	a	Don't support liars and thieves, don't buy this game no matter what the price.
1920	1	a	Solo World of Warcraft with less grinding and better graphics, highly recommended if you don't want pubbies ruining your solo MMO experience.
5558	1	a	Whilst its on offer YES GRAB IT for Â£1, totally worth it! For Â£10 or whatever its normal price... not so sure, but its definately fun blasting around with your mates shooting huge hordes of dinosaurs in the face.
3929	0	a	Killed some time on this game, so glitchy. I had fun though, guess it all comes down to who you play with.
5901	0	a	this game is absolute trash i bought it on sale for 49 cents and i feel it wasnt even worth that save your money guys dont buy this theres ftp games better than this
4459	1	a	Did you love Turok on the N64? Did you love Halo when it was cool?  If not, still doesn't matter because this game is pure fun.  This game brought back sweet memories when I used to play Turok 2 on the N64 and then when I played Halo CE for the first time on PC.  You haven't lived if you haven't punched a T-Rex till death with your bare hands.  1$ and tons of fun!
4192	0	a	Just no no stop looking at, yeah you dont even for a second think of buying this turn around and go buy something else this is not worth time, Download, Hard drive space, or anything. Trex mechs no noooooooooooooooooooooooo 
4017	1	a	Fun game! was well worth the $1.49 I would really love to see some south african servers though
1652	1	a	Wow! I Was quite surprised when I started playing this. I was expecting the same cookie cutter formula as every other game of this type. Even though my initial thoughts on the game were not that far off there is enough variety and lore packed into this game to make me forget the 'standard' format it follows. Worth my $12 so far as far as time played per dollar spent and I have just started.
4317	1	a	It's a good game .
1546	1	a	Two words: Stun Lock
390	1	a	know how a lot of RPGs get REALLY good 20-30 hours in? Kingdoms Of Amalur is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fantatsic right from the start.
158	1	a	its a good game. but while it ran wonderfuly when i was using windows 7, after i upgraded to windows 10, it keeps crashing after 5 to 15 minuts. from what i understand, this problem us uncommed for windows 10 users. but, if your in the same boat as me, i would recomend eather doing a clean re-install of windows 10, or holding off on picking up this game untill you do.   update: after disabling all my drawing tablets drivers, it now runs realy well. i have no god damn clue why wicom drivers were crashing the game, but there you have it..
1289	1	a	like it, good action base rpg.. not good story line, only one direction narrative. but it is unique, and it is also the last, dont expect a sequel. i like it enough to recommend, but sales, and reviews were not good judged otherwise.
1396	1	a	I have this game for Xbox 360 but decided to also buy it for PC along with all the DLCs since it was extremely cheap and a great game that I enjoyed. The gameplay felt so live and fun with all the cool combo moves you could perform with your weapons. The gameplay was very smooth and I enjoyed the fact that you were able to customize your own skill tree and pick your own destinies/faes according to your class or just for fun. Storyline, quests, animations/effects meshed so well together thus this game is definitely my most favorite RPG. Big Huge Games and 38 Studios did a wonderful job creating this well-developed and in-depth game. Surprisingly, EA took part in this and lately their games have been somewhat a big huge pile of failures and unsucessful games. However, KOA:R gave me a wonderful gameplay experience that I will always love, it's just so fun and awesome. I definitely and HIGHLY recommend you to get this game.
6276	1	a	This ga,e is alright. If it is still on sale for under 4 dollars than I would say it is worth it. Otherwise DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH A TEN FOOT POLE, IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
5022	1	a	Great game only if it didn't try to burn a whole through my proccesor.
4413	0	a	This is a Terrible UT mod. Ideas stolen from other good game out there. Changed, and made bad. Really awful animations and poor game play with extensive maps that are really boring to get around.   It sounds cool by premise, but honestly, this game sucks hard. Avoid it!
3775	1	a	I think this game gets too much hate. It's an ok game.
6041	1	a	game of the year every year
755	1	a	An amazing Open World RPG adventure! The graphics are so good and not only is it beautiful, it's fun to play. With Amazing Customization and ways to make your play style your own, I reccomend this game to anyone that loves the grinding, looting, all around fun atmosphere of RPGs. The demo is well worth playing before you buy, since if you play the demo you get extra items in the full game :D
5422	0	a	not really dinosaurs
288	1	a	One of the best all round great RPG's I've played in years. It looks stunning. It moves stunning.
6047	1	a	its not that great for a game. but it is what its being advertised. 5/5 stars
4948	1	a	10/10 This game is pretty good. Also its easy get money to upgrade your weapons and the dinosaur are really  strong yeah. more games the dino are easily died and also i apperciate this game coz it really good and the map  are big and when came on the round 20 or 30 the dinosaur are getting to many. but the best for me the halloween  map 1 coz its pretty hard to kill the all the pumpkin dino. and this game is good. who make this good but the graphic  are not so good but anyway this game good.   ó ðð°ð»ðð´
399	1	a	If you are a fan of the Fable franchise, then this is the game for you.
5746	0	a	played five mins, on the menu that is, worst than cod with its host migration. Got a single player game to go, but it crashed before it got to the loading screen.
2735	1	a	As a jurrasic park survivor, it's really touching to get the oppurtunity to get back at those pesky dinos for almost klling me and my family. For any one like me who had to go through that tragic events of jurrasic park it is a must have.
5569	1	a	Its awesome! But how do you buy stuff with your credits you earn?
5077	1	a	i mean it was $.99
885	0	a	I've tried several times to play this, but I couldn't get far into the game without giving up. It's a real chore to play and not worth your time.
5987	1	a	I rarely understand what is happening in this game.  But â¥â¥â¥â¥ it: Dinosaurs.
3356	1	a	Stabbed a pterodactyl  10/10
5563	0	a	You really get what you pay for with this game.  The idea of shooting dinosaurs with future guns is a cool idea, I mean, its just plain bad-â¥â¥â¥! But this game really falls short of expectations,   Graphically, its very nice. And on top of that, it not too hard on the computer. The framerate is smooth. Textures are quite appealing to the eye.   Combat is overly repeditve. About 10 minutes of play, i got bored fairly bored.   Its hard to get into the game's lore. Like seriously, with a few minutes of play, you have no idea as to whats going on. Here are some of my un-answered questions; Where are we? Earth? Some other planet with Dinosaurs? Who are we? Are we human? Are we an alien race? Why are there dinosaurs here? If we have futuristic weapons, and we are fighting dinosaurs, what time are we in? Like seriously, there is nooooooo story what so ever. You have no idea whats going on.  Athsteically, it REALLY needs some work. The its seems that the sounds in the game are SUPER repetitive. For the HUGE amount of weapons there are in the game, they all sound the same! The cars in it literally sound like the have 1 or 2 gears. after you start driving for a good minute, the vehical sounds cut and loop. Its HORRIBLE. There are No sounds for the game what so ever. I mean, there are no birds chirping, no wind blowing, no waves, no NOTHING. You can only here the sound of your own foot steps. That mixed with the GIANT maps that are completly EMPTY, the game feels more empty than fallout 3!   The animations for the dinosaurs, are just terrible. They move sooooooooooooooo fast, but the look like they arent moving at ALL.   The econemy of the game is horribly broken. You either always have TOO much money, or have no money at all. This works horrbilly witht the difficulty. On easy, the cash flow is so mondain. Killing one thing gives you â¥â¥â¥-loads of money, so it makes it even easier because you have great guns. Then on medium or even hard, you never have money at all because you get little money, too many enemys, and you can never afford guns.   So far, its not the best game ive played. Ive heard that it used to be much, MUCH WORSE. But seriously, this is BETTER?  I strongly reqimend NOT to buy this game
845	1	a	I heard that this game was a classic Underdog: a game that didn't succeed commercially, but was a true wonder.  I heard correctly.  I rather suspect that its failure to sell initially was due to being released in the shadow of the Dragon, you might say; released one year after Skyrim, and that's a big name to live up to. Big enough now; bigger then, when it was almost new. Most of the people who would've jumped at Amalur then were probably slaying giants and stealing mammoth souls, and Amalur's graphics aren't quite as impressive. They about match SWTOR's graphics and movement mechanics for that matter, though the combat is... different.  Ehh, I'm rambling. Anyway I'm only just starting to figure it out, but I feel like I did when I was just starting to play KOTOR... and I should've been in bed two hours ago. That says something.
4378	0	a	This game is literally cancer, whatever you do... don't even consider buying it! It first wants you to pay for it, and then pay for in game currency, just after you bought the game. Worst... P2W... game... ever!  Edit: they changed the name... again!
305	1	a	An excelent game. It has a level of character customizability that rivals and possibly surpasses the Elder Scrolls series. Your ability to thoroughly customize your character's powers and abilities adds a level of forthought to who you want your character to be while you fight. If you don't like the way your stats are progressing, then you can wipe the slate clean and start over. Through the course of the story line, you could have a warrior, a mage, a rogue, a combination of any two, or all three. Plus, your ability to sneak, forge, craft potions, find hdden items and other such skills are seperate from the combat skill trees. You could have a warrior with an insanely high sneaking and discovering items skills, or a thief that likes to forge weapons and armor. Basically, this game is definately worth playing, Nine out of ten, I'd say.
2444	0	a	too many glitches and stuff they need to fix them
5903	0	a	Very bad game in my opinion and it shoud be free to play becouse its garbage
4862	1	a	there are dinos and i guess one mode is kinda like halo. its really stupid... like really really stupid, but i paid a dollar for it. i've played like only 10 minutes of this game and i don't ever plan on playing it again but i guess it's like kinda okay. it seems like just owning the game is some sort of like elite club or whatever so it's kinda cool. the game itself sucks though. it's pretty boring and i didn't really have fun. if it's on sale for less than 2 dollars buy it though i guess.
5485	1	a	-buy game for $0.74 or something -why not seems cool -install game -try to play solo -i have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what how  -get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed -okay why not try to just find an open server -join game with 4 others -everyone has vehicles and obviously knows what they're doing -get kicked within 30 seconds -loading screen tip says  -'if you come across a new player, help them out' -ggwp  from what i've seen of it though, it looks cool with a nice concept. i'll try to play more of it so i don't get shamed again.  try again later/10
4350	1	a	its a good classic
2144	1	a	I bought this because the xbox 360 version completely stopped working. I wanted access to it. I preodered the original, and played it for hundreds of hours.  Not a bad buy at all.

4737	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥/10
3606	1	a	WOW, this reminds me of unreal tournament and at the moment just 79 its incredible value, fight against dinosaurs or other human players, fantastic 
4869	1	a	Hell, if I didn't have ping problems, it was 9/10
3659	1	a	Well worth it's price tag of $1. It has Dinos and guns! That's all you need. Dinos come at you in hordes/waves and you fight them off.
4804	1	a	This is some good â¥â¥â¥â¥ right here
3805	0	a	Atleast refund the money for the people who spent money on your game before making it free. Kind of lucky i didnt buy more than 1 copy for the game.   If you didnt buy the game, go play it. It definately isnt bad, but the fact that the devs dont care that we spent money for nothing makes me not play the game now.  EDIT:  Although it has gone back to paid, Alot of people recieved the game for free, which still isnt fair
2302	1	a	has big dinos  has small dinos has fly dinos has pew pew guns has pew pew vehicles  good game
2128	1	a	Pretty solid game i enjoyed it highly if you havent given it a shot try it out. weapons are a bit redudant after a while but over all a fun experience.
3311	1	a	worth your money 
5202	1	a	I may only have 0.2 hours on this game but let me tell you that with it being a mix of like Halo and a dinosaur game it is that good. rate 10/10 best $1.50 on the sale ive ever spent
3754	1	a	dont play this game
5642	0	a	The Land Before Time Game is not that great without the original voice actors
1121	1	a	The awesomness of this game is endless. Surely gonna spend hours with that.
5809	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
1003	1	a	One of the best stories I have ever seen in a RPG. The combat is challenging and epic. 10/10 Amazing!
5890	0	a	best uninstall simulator 10/10 would uninstall again
836	1	a	.
1064	1	a	[Ignore the time played on here, I have 100+ hours on XBox] I love this game so much and I think every rpg fan should play it, it breaks my heart there'll never be anything from this ip.
6103	1	a	this game was fun! i paid 50 cents for it and i love it!  its perfect for a simple shooter with your friends, theres several different game modes, differnt classes of waepons, bunch of maps. its perfect for getting into shooters its not to complicated and its not too bad looking either~  definatly worth a the dollar it costs~
5387	1	a	Ok, where to start from...1st Marto(Baba Qga) has told me to write this review.   This game has made to uninstall it at 2 hours gameplay. This game made me to be afraid of dinos. This game has made me to murder people with a spoon because i imagine them as dinos.  11/10  Strongly reccomend this game if u want to uninstall it at 2 hours gametime  Piece
360	1	a	Buy it. A shame the company went under, worth playing especially if found on sale
3216	1	a	Reasons why you should get this game 1-dinosaurs 2-multiplayer 3-10/10 fun 
4950	1	a	10/10 Orion Prelubbed
3784	1	a	1. Open map not open world 2. lots of cool weapons and upgrades 3. Great online play 4. Not alot of fun single player 5. Graphics pretty good.  This game is alot of fun online if your able to work as team. I find it most fun playing with just friends or family because team work is key its not like COD. This is NOT open world however. It is a small to medium sized map.  Guns+DInos= buy it
1913	1	a	Great game, i am happy that master Salvatore helped to make this game, you can do anything to everything and make your own story, you can be hero you can be the villain or just be yourself, it is in your hand
1450	1	a	I was hesitant in purchasing this game with EA having their hands on it, but I was surprised to have a pretty fun and exciting game in my hands. The major point that really drew me into this was the fact that R.A. Salvatore created the story at large. While the options in selecting your responses is limited to black and white with a dash of gray, the plot itself was amazing. I found myself constantly drawn into not only the main story, but the side quests littered around the entire game. Overall, it was a wonderful experience with replayability.
4845	1	a	i'd say 4 hours of fun was worth AT LEAST $0.99
6192	1	a	It's being improved on, but as of now it's absolute fun with friends!
1220	1	a	An excellent game, although the gameplay it's kind of hard to master it's quite enjoyable.
4882	1	a	This game reminds me of Turuk
4403	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
5074	1	a	The video game equivilant of the dinosaur toy you buy from the 99 cent store as a kid: you can tell it's cheaply made, but you love playing with it anyway. Also, it was only 99 cents.
5374	1	a	YUP! THIS IS A DINOSAURS GAME!
4535	1	a	Basically dino D-Day but in the future, and with more tanks. Gameplay is janky and hard to follow, and the majority of the weapons make no sense to use, even for fun. But it's good fun, again don't pay retail for it
3629	1	a	The last few times I played this with friends I was eaten by a T-Rex 4 different times. A+ would play again.
1085	1	a	From what I've seen of this game so far is if you like Fable, you'll like this.
1394	1	a	This game athoghe Single-player is amazing. The story was made by R.A Salvator the writer of many hit fantasy novels,i'd love to give details on the story but i'd probley give most of it away so i'll i say is, your the only one who can save amalur.
5338	1	a	best, good game, idled for cards
2873	1	a	OH yes it is the most fantastic game on the planet. Even the Stig has something to say abou â¥â¥â¥ and i quote, 'It's real good.'
3593	1	a	I've seen the steam key giveaway in the begining of the month... so I tried... Everytime I could not get one. Well the heck with that, I decided to buy the game some days ago (1 dollar is cheap) well... WELL... WELL.... MOST AWESOME GAME OF THE TIME. I mean FOR REAL! No micro transaction, no paying dlc, fun games, dinosaurs and kinda old school: all I searched for! A plus is the community ;) thanks for making this happen! I have faith in the future of video games again because people like you put passion and pleasure into your games and the players can enjoy it fully! :) Well be right back I have to eat some humans now
4525	0	a	REALLY I WAITED 3 MONTHS FOR IT TO GO ON SALE  FOR A 4 PACK then i bought it for $2.99 NOW ITS FREE AND I DONT GET â¥â¥â¥â¥ TO SHOW FOR IT AT LEAST GIVE ME A COOL WEAPON THAT UNIQUE OR EVEN A CUSTOM SKIN  HOW ABOUT A REFUND? oh no steam will not cover that you played to long other than that game is fun just gets to boring tedious and repetitive  but if u love 2 grind play this   EDIT 1: i bought this game Feb 22, 2014  and i still got 2 copies left which i can trade but since the game is free  WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT
425	1	a	Really good rpg game, nice graphs and a HUGE map, ive got only 5 hours into the game and its great!
608	1	a	Quite a good game. Nice movement sets for the characters. Rather too much sidequests.
2919	0	a	Cool concept, Poorly executed.
2506	1	a	I was hesitant to get this, because of its metascore, but it's actually worth it. This game is a great FPS that reminds me of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (anyone else?), but I can guarantee you that this game is original and only reminds me of it. In this game, you kill dinosaurs with guns, something I've always wanted to do as a child.  In spite of a few bugs here and there, this game is pretty good (very good if you got it for its sale price). With just a bit more development, this game has the potential to get its metascore where it schould be.  I rate ORION: Dino Horde a 7.75 out of 10.
37	1	a	good game for low price
3509	1	a	The game has a excellent premis, but is about as polished as decaying squirel poop. It is becomming a much better game with every update, and its eventually comming out of it's shell as 'One of the worst games polluting The Steam Library'.  Its pretty original, unlike exploitation games like Revelation 2012, and it has allot of 'good seeds' in it, waiting to 'bare fruits'.   All in all, with the price in mind, its definitly worth it. And for a few hours of cheap, guilty fun with the potential of becomming a good game with time, I'd recommend it.
6169	1	a	your probaly asking is this game good? well if it was a regular 5$ or more game no its horrible but for 1 dolalr you get quite a lot you get decent graphics nice weather effects and the guns look pretty cool it has some vehicles and of course dinos which are good but sometimes are a pain to hit so if you have 1 dollar and looking to waste it look no further
341	1	a	One of the best RGPs out there. It deserves a way more attention than it got. Even though it probebly won't get a sequal I'm still hoping for one. EA, please make that happen. :)
3127	1	a	Really good game. This game has been driven into failure because of it's previous title ORION: Dino Beatdown, but Dino Horde is different, and it is a whole new, exiting and amazing overall game. Completely worth my 15 bucks.
593	1	a	I love this game. It's just too bad not a lot of people know about it. It wasnt a popular release which is unfortunate. On the offside tho, this game has a great story line, smooth fighting mechanics, over 200 hours of side quests, and two DLCs which I have to try after beating the main story. The game has beautiful art work and amazing scenery. I highly suggest people play this game. If you like Skyrim and other freeworld RPG's then you will have hours of fun wth this game.
6151	1	a	Halo meets Dinosaurs, the warthogg and the scorpian tank are pretty good.
2230	0	a	At first I was looking forward to some good old Disciples after the years, thinking there will be some innovative touch here and there. What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess.   For one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me. On the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are 'tough'. And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.  To summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans. Good idea killed by totally non-functional battle-system.
945	1	a	This game is very fun. Lots of stuff to do and tons of game time. Good story line, similar to dragon age 1 I like that you can reset and become any other type of class anytime throughout the game. This game also has very good controls.
4015	1	a	It has dinosaurs, lasers, guns, and swords.
900	0	a	This game is pretty good. There is a lot to do, you feel like you are sort of making a difference, and the challenges grow with the character. Getting new gear is a treat as they are all visually more and more awesome. However, you need to save often! Not because you might die... lol... oh no... but because you might run into a game bug. So far I've found two and the second one actually disables fast travel entirely. The map in the game is big, but not too big, but the problem is just the annoyance of having to run everywhere. Then I found out when looking for a community to tell me how to get out of the bug, that the game studio apparently imploded. So, now I'm stuck, having to run around everywhere and the game is becoming more of an annoying grind than the fun questing adventure that I've been playing for hours. Big dissappointment and no chance of help. Get the game if you want, but read up on all the quest bugs first. You CAN get stuck. You CAN screw up the whole game. Gamer beware.
340	1	a	A gem that I find myself always coming back to. Not a perfect game, but just does so many things well you can't help but want to try every race and class.    Pros:     Decent graphics. Not breathtaking, but not a lot of buggy nonsense everywhere either.   Story is genuinely interesting, and each DLC story makes you yearn to discover more as well.   Combat. Holy cow, the combat is fun. There may only be a handful of weapon types, but the way your talents affect them and the combos you can string together is just plain fun. Mixing and matching magic spells with weapons adds some nice flavor as well.   There is a  LOT  to do in this game. Even if you only did the main story it takes a while to finish, but rising through the ranks in the various factions is some of the best parts of the game!   Your character's abilites are NEVER set in stone. You can reset everything to try new ability combos at any point in the game.    Cons:    This game can be very unforgiving. Probably my biggest gripe with this game, is that there is very limited auto-saving, yet many ambushes/surprise events that you can be quite unprepared for. I ragequit many a time after having hours of work sucked away by carelessly forgetting to save, then dying.   The voice acting may seem decent at first, but some of the accents and voices get VERY annoying and repetitive. Not the end of the world, but definitely noticeable.   At points this game can be grindy, when the level gap between zones is a little too big. One moment you'll feel like a badass, then move to the next zone and get wasted immediately(Then lose a ton of time as previously stated haha sob).   Overall, 8.5 / 10 I'll take slightly flawed, lesser known game with insane replay value over a big name blockbuster that leaves me yawning after 20 hours anyday.  PS- Bought this on Steam after logging 100+ hours into the PS3 version. Cheers everyone!
1642	1	a	All I can say is 'OMG amazaing.' 3000/5 stars or whatever. I just want to get back to playing.
3542	1	a	cool game for $1 but, if you have a cheap computer/work laptop i would not buy this game. if you have an old computer with low amount of vram game will be semi unplayable
873	0	a	boring. its trying too hard to setup its fantasy world when it should just focus on being a good game. lore should be a background thing while this game throws boring â¥â¥â¥ exposition at your face
254	1	a	Overall, a very enjoyable experience. If the combat system appeals to you, then this is a title you cannot pass up. Just keep in mind, due to the lower difficulty of this title even on the highest difficulty setting, you might want to consider learning how to combo, for a different kind of difficulty. Just giving a tip.
4536	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ Game.. never before i played such a broken and poorly devloped Game, stay away from it.. only Revelations 2012 is probably worser then this,yeah i know hard to believe, but thrust me lol
1947	1	a	Pretty good game. Seems like I am playing an MMORPG without the MMO part though. The story is good and the combat is satisfying. If anyone needs a game with a unique story and loveable characters to occupy their time, they need look no further.
5110	1	a	this is not a good game i have to say. but if you have a day off at work. maybe spend your spare time playing this.
1687	1	a	Game is worth. Very nice graphics, and a really huge map! Endless hours of fun. Strongly recommend the game.   I have only 5 hours on this game on record on Steam, but outside of steam, I have like close to 100+ hours.   BUT... I would NOT recommend buying the Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning - Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle. It gives really low level items. I opened it for the very first time with a level 40 character, and got items fit for level 22.   I wanted to post this on the addon page, but for some reason, this review box isn't present there. So putting it here.
4067	0	a	This game is fun to play. IF THE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WOULD WORK PROPERLY FOR ONCE
4703	0	a	this is the worst game ever I paid for it and the grafics are bad most of the game is noobs the worst thing there is no planes or tanks 
511	1	a	I've spend about 2 hours or more when playing this game daily...because of side quest
2657	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ Metacritic and their BS score they gave to the game, it has dinosaurs and thus is awesome as â¥â¥â¥â¥. The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).  Okay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.  Tl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.
5730	1	a	the game is cheap has awsome mechanics and is great to play with friends
4022	1	a	It's like a horrifying but wonderess car accident, it looks dreadful but you can't stop looking at it.  Set you expectations to 0 and you'll enjoy playing a fairly bugy and at times sorta nice looking dinosaur shooter(but mostly kinda ugly) with run of the mill shooting mechanics and an inconsistent art style that looks like multiple artists got into a fight over how the game will look and just decided to put multiple styles into it because they couldn't be bothered to decide.  So, if you have 0.79 $ laying around somewhere, need to kill a few hours of your time and have no idea what else to play or do, then pick up Orion: Prelude because it's actully a bit of fun for a while and as i said, it's dirt cheap, actully it is the cheapest game you can buy right now on steam.  Bottom line : It's cheap,it's cheesy,it's glitchy but still can be fairly fun at times specially with a nice group of people.
2527	1	a	A lot better than it looks. It's like Shadow of the Colossus, mixed with iCarly.
3188	1	a	This game is by far one of the best games on steam and can be played for hours on end. nothing says a great game like guns dinosaurs. The fact that you can play it with friends makes it so fun and replayable also with different maps and different gamemodes there is a new adventure ever time. there is so much to be said about this game but to some it up in two words they would be 'Pure Badass'.
1018	1	a	This is my first review of any game here on steam. I am new to computer gaming. Better late than never, I suppose.   Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was one of the first purchases I made. Having dropped WoW and recently completing a run trough of ESO; I wanted something more immersive. I was looking for something that was simple and fun, yet challenging in the sense of having a lot to do. I lucked up and found this game during the Steam Summer Sale.   I have only played about six hours so far. But already I am hooked. It is everything I was looking for. There are so many quests in this game that the main story line is easily overlooked. I love that you can set your own pace. Do what quests you like or want.   The combat and actions are relatively simple, but I like that about it. To me; games are meant to be fun. Don't get me wrong, I love to be challenged, and I have had moments where a preparing for a fight or a game has been more like homework than play-time, but this KoA: Reckoning is straightforward and fun. Simple as that.   One of the things I love about it is the art. I am a sucker for a game with not only good graphics, but the art behind the graphics. The style. I'm not good at explaining these things, but I'm sure once you start playing, you'll understand what i mean. It's really just a beautiful game all around. I love the world and the characters I have met so far.   In short; the Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is well worth a spot in your library. I paid a small price, but even if I had paid in full it would have still been worth it.
255	1	a	I usually don't play ports. Got this one from sale almost a year ago. Didn't really have time to get into it.  I'm on holliday now. I think I know where I'm going to spend it. In Kingdoms of Amalur.  ++ Big Word. Gender, race are customasable for hero Quests are intereting and chaladging. Side quests seem endless 40 levels to upgrade your hero. Thief, Warior, Mage -you pick whatever. Blacksmiting &amp; Alchemy in the game can make you think of PhD degree :) Change the fate and destiny is possible Lag free, Haven't expirince any for almost 30 hours of play Story is big and interesting  -- It's a port NPCs can be stupid from time to time   P.S. Gonna pick DLCs on the next sale.
4643	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
3150	1	a	Great Game for only $1
5283	1	a	METASCOREâ¡ is LYING !!!  Insanely fun coop survival / shooter game. Kill Dinos with bunch of guns and vehicles. ( Also lots of achievements for Achievement Hunters )
47	1	a	Mix Magic: The Gathering with Poker and Solitaire, and you'd come up with something along the lines of Runespell: Overture. Awesome game.
2752	1	a	got this on sale for a dollar and it's like going to burger king and finding out you're the 1 billionth customer and they shower you in triple whoppers made of REAL MEAT  8/10 wish i had friends for hamburgers and dinos ;_;
5515	1	a	You get alot of content for $1... And if u get it half price, like me, it's INSANELY cheap.
3327	0	a	I mean its kinda fun, but its just terribly made. Really badly done, choppy animations. The textures are muddy and bland, but some of the bigger dinos look good. You fight wave after wave the same way in the same area so it gets repetetive very fast. The weapons all handle like old school doom guns, along with the iffy hitboxes it just makes for a boring experience. After playing Primal Carnage(buy it), this game just doesnt have any appeal to me. I really couldnt recommend it, even for $1.
2995	1	a	Dino horde, the game you just love to hate, bad? maybe? its a game that you can play again and again and again, and yet still rage at it no matter how good/bad it is!   Is it worth it? not so much.
525	1	a	Grabbed the collection bundle for $10 on winter sale and I've got to say I'm surprisingly happy with it so far. It's kinda like Fable meets WoW meets Skyrim. Worth a spot in any RPG fans collection next time it goes on sale.
1886	1	a	Underrated RPG. I played the demo and did not really care for it at first; yet when it was on sale for dirt cheap I decided to buy it and give it another shot. I am glad I did. This game is full of content. It is like playing a mmo without the other people (because of the amount od quest and that is without counting the DLC).
4158	1	a	I took what appeared to be a Future Tractor with a jet engine strapped to the back of it and proceeded to run over a line of 10 velociraptors, at which point I ran headfirst into a T-Rex which decided it was time to throw me and Future Tractor 300 meters through the air. Future Tractor didn't survive, but I somehow made it and then took my laser sword to some more dinosaurs.  10/10
1012	1	a	Buy this game it is amazing, lots of fun! was looking at this for a long time and not sure if i would like it, very happy i made the purchase well worth it, great game.
3073	1	a	I'll be honest here I thought this game was gonna be a cheese buy like the game Bad Rats.  But honestly this game is a load of fun even by yourself.  I mean who doesn't love killing dinosaurs with guns?!  Also this game is super fun with friend's so bring them along as well!
2611	1	a	 ORION: Prelude   ORION: Dino Beatdown   ORION: Dino Horde  ORION: Dino DLC is a shining light in an otherwise dark and gloomy sea of poorly thought out RPGs, Shooters, and MMOs. This game is completely flawless in every way, a perfect example of a 10/10 rating, a number given too often to sub-par titles such as Mass Effect and Call Of Duty. ORION: Dino Beatdown is an instant classic, and surely stands up to the best as an action adventure indie casual racing game. For only  $8.99  $14.99 (Plus the price of any of the fabulous DLC you can purchase! I recommend the Gangnam Style dance pack myself!), you can't afford not to add this amazing title to your collection. Don't forget to donate to the Kickstarter for the upcoming ORION Project too! Support indie devs!
6105	0	a	Whats the objective? what are the controls? lets find out *mashes all the buttons one by one*
2410	1	a	Do NOT trust metascore ! This game is pure awesomeness ! Spread the word and join !
5851	0	a	This is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game i have ever played
1596	1	a	Very Good RPG game, I recommend this game anyday.
4305	1	a	This game is awesome and worth more then its price i recommend this game for evreyone who want an amazing cheap game. best 99 cents i ever spend, 10.5/10
1549	1	a	Would you look at this little hidden gem! I find it incredible that games like this aren't more talked about. It has a wonderful fairy-tale style that plays like a Fable/Elder Scrolls mashup. I spent about 10 minutes on it and was immediately hooked. I love the gameplay dynamic, the immersive storyline, the storybook appearance and just about everything else this incredible game. If you like TES:Oblivion (or Skyrim as well) or the Fable series, I highly recommend you give this one a try. Even if not, I'd still give it a shot. It's familiar, yet somehow unique.
5604	0	a	'Can't Run On A Potato' -D00M   I guess it can run on Potatoes, game got stuck when I joined the server and the camera was just stuck on 1 view and I couldn't move.   =========Rip=========  ---60 Cents---   *You'll Be Remembered.*
2815	1	a	Game is fun for a few minutes and on a sale cost much as a phone app so get it
893	0	a	This is an alright game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are kind of fun. The game offers over 100 hours of adventuring fun. The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.
3742	1	a	when i had this game for two day trail i was like AWESOME (when is this going to be another two day trail)
3984	1	a	This game is amazing! for the price and download time it is the best hoard game I have played!
2445	0	a	Pay real cash for in-game items for a game which you already paid for?...Really?...Might as well make it free to play then.
2386	1	a	This game reminds me of of the time I got that dinosaur skull from an auction.
3731	1	a	Awsome game
6337	0	a	This game... is broken and laughable.. want a laugh? sprint and look down at your legs flailing around... it's only a buck so... if you've got money to spend... go ahead
4197	1	a	Sexy fun all day every day. I loved being ravished by big dinos.
5600	1	a	Do not let the bad reviews and the terrible Metascore fool you. This game is awesome, no joke.  The bad reviews were carried over from their previous game, ORION: Dino Beatdown, which was buggy and unfinished.  My only gripe is that the animations are a bit awkward at times, but the gameplay is incredibly solid and loads of fun, especially with friends.  Besides, the base price is only â¬1, with the price dropping as low as â¬0,50 at times. Sell a few trading cards, and get this game!
2631	1	a	I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.
1055	1	a	I'll never understand why this game wasn't more popular. There are so many hours of fun gameplay here. The inventory/item system is much like Diablo in that you're always looking for those rare items, and you can even craft armor and improvements. When you add gameplay which I find engaging without being overcomplicated, and this title should hold anyone's interest for hours.  10/10
5137	1	a	Everyone needs to buy this game!!! It's amazing, and should be sold for much more then $1!!!
5244	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is always a damned dollar. just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it. It's really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but it's fun to play with friends. Or give the dollar to a homeless man. Whatever
4749	1	a	This game is amazing... Screw all the hater... Any game that you can use a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ piss colored lightsaber is obviously a pretty amazing game. This game is so good that you can run into a trex and he doesn't die. The creators of the game should now own call of black ops 5 san andreas fault edition. It makes me want to make love to a dinosaur... In my dreams I picture that dinosaurs are still alive and ready to be made love to. I have completely changed my way of life. I now worship dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs. Dey R mye fyverote tyng. Eye Love them with a passion.. Withoute Dynosurs i would have no luve in my life.. If i could make love to evey dino every I wood.
3711	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
5480	0	a	stephan hawking runs better than this game.
5386	0	a	this is literally the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ive ever played in my entire life. Its just plagued with so many issues and the developers must have had their heads up their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥ to implement some of the gayest things ive ever seen in this game. All in all i give this game a -20/10 and sentance the developers to go suck a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and learn how to make an enjoyable game
4774	0	a	jesus christ i know its cheap but you can buy a bag of â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the same price and you would be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of
3223	1	a	The reviews are right, this game is extremely entertaining! It's a new look to the feels I got from playing L4D2 with friends before.
4471	0	a	Meh, it's incomplete, glitchy, ugly, and repetitive- but it can be fun for a couple hours, i think it'd be worth a dollar if you have friends willing to play it with you- but otherwise , it'll be just another game to become untouched in your library after the first couple plays or so
5592	0	a	Fun for about 10 mins
677	1	a	This is Skyrim with better combat.
1006	1	a	Great Action RPG, filled with Fable-like combat, tons of content and great story line, doesnt offer that much replayability, but having the option to change classes in the same savegame seems to work like a charm in this game, it does have lots of quest and stuff, but if you are like me that enjoy doing everything in the first run then you wont have that much to do on your second run, if you have enough time to kill, this is a great game with great gameplay.
2789	1	a	a cheap good game....now thats is unique.
5477	0	a	Had to buy ths game and then they make it free to play what a rip off this game is loads of fun but the dev have a long history of changing this games name to avoid the fact that they steal assets from other games.... but is a fun game once you get past the scumbagry of the devs 10/10 would get ripped off again
1059	1	a	Fun hack &amp; slash game xD
5494	1	a	Really !?!?!? Free To Play 
1786	1	a	I have this on my Playstation Plus account, but never got around to playing it. Recently bought it and from the get go, I was impressed. It looks quite nice, handles quite well and gameplay is very solid.  I must say this, the voice acting so far has been very well done, a few iffy bits but they have done a superb job with that.  I've played more hours than listed as I play offline sometimes.  For $20, it's a great game. For $10 or less, it's a MUST.
2914	1	a	Cool and great.
5505	0	a	this game sucks
4358	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
2103	1	a	Great graphics, good dialogues and story. Quests can be repetitive in their task but the diversity of the map compensate it.
866	0	a	Worst 10.3 hours of my life, The game just got more lame the longer i played until i couldnt stant it anymore.
1371	1	a	For anyone considering picking this up on sale, I highly recommend it. It is a nice open world RPG in a stunning world. The game mechanics. Combat, and even AI are top notch. It is a shame the company had the issues it did. The best abandoned IP out there, in my opinion.
3692	1	a	Is geym of shot dinosuar. Meny fun time to have. Can have roketlaunch an go boom on dino hed. HAHA! 10/10
3913	0	a	While .99cents, I would not buy this game until it is functional at least. No audio normalization, no customization without actual money, survival mode is a gimmic and fighting dinosaurs with guns that feel weak and disconnected. Servers are hosted locally. Vehicles are a joke. Healing is a joke. Damage feels like nothing. Controls are sticky and numbing and there is no replayability except if you want to achievement â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I guarantee you that your money will be wasted on this game. I would relate this to a 500 year old ghetto house. You can buy the house for cheap but everything inside is crap and falling to pieces. This game was hastily cobbled together and updates are pathetic. This game needs a complete rework, with effort actually put into designing the gamem
455	1	a	 Honestly, this game is amazing.
2662	0	a	I only have 17 minutes played, but the 17 minutes were dull enough to make my eyes glaze over. The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the voice acting is awful, the combat is easy enough that a person with no eyes could beat the enemies, and the maps are overly large for no reason at all. I don't think there is even an end goal in this game.
5475	1	a	This is amazing....
2876	1	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME EVER
3894	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points.
3237	1	a	I didnt have much to lose, .74$ for a four pack for me and my friends(sale). I came out with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing game. it's a little clunky at first but god damn you'll enojoy this game.
1775	1	a	Third person action rpg with more focus on dodging and type advantage than actual roleplaying. Most choices in the game are fairly black and white, but with a wealth of alternate solutions in the faction quests - one quest has the player able to skip most of the fights if they have a high enough level in Dispel.  The DLC, while not bad, isn't worth getting unless the price is right - they introduce some entertaining characters and a few good items, but overall are short.  The game has a level cap of 40, which is very easy to hit before you get far in the main plot, so it can turn into a chore to advance the plot rather instead of exploring side quests.  Get it when on sale - there's a lot of content, but overall it is fairly linear - not that being linear is explicity bad.
678	1	a	In Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, you get not only a fun, dynamic action RPG, but you get a meticulously crafted world created by R.A. Salvatore. A blast the whole way through, although admitedly not challenging in the least.
4007	0	a	Very very good game! glitched around in a car for 20 minutes. 11/10 would play again.
2205	0	a	Do not buy this game if having access to the editor is important to you. It requires a cd key, which steam will not provide. Attempting to get a cd key from them results in them informing you that the game doesn't come with a cd key and then, if you keep going despite the clearly copy/pasted 'support', telling you that you have to deal with third party support.
803	1	a	Basically everything about that is good has already been said. Let me tell you one thing, the camera is great (in my opinion) it is very smooth and doesn't glitch and skip about.
3525	1	a	Very cool gameplay, rampage/dino vs humans is my personal favourite
3859	1	a	The only game where you can slap giant crocodiles to death. 100/10
5243	0	a	Played this game for not even 20 minutes, I got into a game at everything at medium and I get constant stutters, my team mates teleport everywhere and I had no f_uck1ng idea where any dinosaurs were cause I crashed a car into a f_uck1ng wall and died.  This game is honest â¥â¥â¥â¥, I would've played with friends, but they refunded it, before it became f2p
5068	1	a	Drove my friend off a cliff while driving and survived. He's dead.  Watched someone use their final breaths to crawl towards the broken generator and I cheered him on. He's dead.  Chased some poor guy as a spinosaurus, caught him, and grabbed him with my mouth. He's dead.  Played Vital (PvPvE) against some guy and he was mauled by dinosaurs. He's dead.  I'm all alone.
4218	1	a	very fun game  i would recomend it to my friends
2388	1	a	it's not bad.. but it's not great. They tried to mix Halo with a Dino hunt. Good graphics except when they aren't. Good controls that suddenly seem to stop working. (shaking head) I hold final opinon cause it's consistantly getting updates and changes. But get it cheep dudes.
2964	1	a	It's okay, considering that I can buy a Coke for more than I bought this game for.
2703	1	a	YES, What a friggin awesome game! The most fun multiplayer game i've played in a while! 10/10
3721	0	a	the only fun thing to say about this game is to say how bad it is.
1898	1	a	10/10 Love The Elder Scrolls franchise? Love the Fable franchise? You'll fall in love with this game! It's built with Fable-like graphics and overall feel of calming and atmospheric fantasy-based scenery with jokes included. This mixes with Skyrim's open-world and seemingly never-ending space and quests alike!   Fighting is Fable-like and uses two main hotkeys to interact with two special weapons. The greatest part of the weapons is the amount! You can use a scepter, or a sword, or even chakrans-and each set includes cool-looking moves as well. The background story is nice, and you can change your character as you go instead of commiting to just one type of hero. The dialogue is remnicent of Oblivion, but is skippable if you get bored easily. The add-ons are funny, and overall this game is not to be taken too seriously.   It's easy-going and relaxing, what more can I say?
5692	0	a	This game is more dead than my dad.
3526	1	a	Fun Game watch out for those t-rex's!
4677	0	a	its graphics are terrible and its gameplay sucks
3018	1	a	Amazing textures ... gotta get ur self indulge in it if u try this game
3301	1	a	Pretty sure this is the most fun I have had with a $1 game. Buy it.
3820	0	a	I played an entire game of this, A WHOLE 50 MINUTES. Word's cannot describe how bland and dull this game is if it was a sandwich it would be 1 slice of white bread, no butter, folded over a sliver of corned beef thats been opened and left in the fridge so it goes all dry and hard. Not enjoyable at all.
5786	0	a	They rerelease it under a new name when the rating drops. It's pretty crappy, but s*** it was 99 cents.
1703	1	a	Good game great action and tons of fun with the customization. Story line is done well to a point but all in all very fun...
4458	1	a	  Got 5 hours out of a $0.49 gift. Worth.  Actually pretty fun with friends, not sure about this whole copyright issue though.
3562	1	a	This game gave my friend an existential crisis and made my eyes bleed. All for the low fee of 0.99â¬  10/10
3244	1	a	one of the best dino fps ive ever played :D
4372	0	a	This game is ok it has a few bugs and it is just dead its fun to play with friends but if you want to play online, theres just no point.   I woud rate it 5/10
2547	1	a	Was not expecting this to be much of a game halo vs jurassic park was my first impression oh how wrong i was its a challenge its funny and iwould suggest everyone gives it a try. survival mode multi player awesome times grab a can grab your mates and get to killing everything that moves :)
944	1	a	The Attacks makes this game Fun but Running around attacking can be diffacult because camra views doesn't Auto move towards our backs right
1895	1	a	Good game too much running
4670	0	a	i played one match and thats good enough for me i had glitches every room i walked in i had teammates that just stood there when i was down and had no fun
3963	1	a	I Love To RolePlay With My Friends On Here. I Also Like Conquest. But I Wish They Could Add A Bit Better Stuff To The Dinosaurs...... Espeically The Pteradactyl And Raptor. WEIRD FACT: I Met All Of My Good Friends On This Game. :P
4029	1	a	I got this game for free on steampowers MAN ITS A GREAT GAME DONT BE FOOLED BY THE META SCORE
6264	0	a	If you ever wondered how virtual garbage may look like.. Just buy this game and your desire for knowledge will be satisfied.
62	1	a	If you remotely like poker and RPGs, pick this up. This game is addictive. Got this in the Toxic Bundle from Bundle Stars.
4483	0	a	This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. dont waste a dollar on this thing. This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that i almost choked to death on my own â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hand
686	1	a	a nearly solid action rpg games...
5368	0	a	This game is basically Call of Duty Ghosts: Extinction mode or Black Ops: Zombies mode - but no way near as good in terms of quality; and with Dinosaurs.  Only buy if cheap.
1939	1	a	Love this game. It was cheap (75% off), and keeps me intrigued. It is like a mixture of fable/skyrim. I find myself wanting to play multiple characters, as there are so many fun-looking options. The fight style is great, and I really enjoy the cutscenes. I highly recommend it to any RPG lover.
5525	0	a	What a coinkydink, this game is similar to what comes outta my pie-hole when my diarrhea starts acting up! This game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥, and with what has been going on with their stolen models, I'd recommend my bowel movement products over this.
5363	0	a	Don't bother. Much better titles have been done on the same premise.
3739	1	a	When it first came out, it was totally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Now, they actually polished it real well and it is pretty fun. Great team game.
2913	1	a	Every so often you get a game that feels so genuine. By that i mean that this game is low budget as hell, Glitchy and bad quality animations, generic graphics. But through playing the game, i felt that the people who made it really enjoyed making it and they made it mostly for themselves with no expectations of getting popular or even wanting to be popular. I just get that vibe from it and for me it just makes the game so much better.   I have only played the survival mode. and it's kinda like the serious sam games but with different classes and unlockables and dinosaurs. And i love it.
1106	1	a	Absolutley recommend playing this game especially if you have friends to play with.
123	1	a	KoA is a very unique kind of game with an interesting story for its development. We can partially blame our boy Lincoln Chafee (failed 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate. It was his first day) for us never seeing the MMO this franchise was set to be. Anybody can Google the story, or point out the parallels between other games.  PROS:  - This game has a really expansive story. You can't hit the game for leaving a lot to be desired in backstory as this game was solely a test game with the higher hopes of expanding the narative into a MMO.  - The Crafting system is pretty solid. I have never really done Alchemy, but Smithing and Gem Crafting is pretty slick. - The Combat is fun, engaging, and requires a small amount of skill. - I liked the talent and skill trees. Though, some might not. It reminds me of WoW back before this 3 choices every 15 levels business. - Fully Voiced (Hero Exlcuded). Ralof from Skyrim's voice actor does a lot of voices.   CONS: - If you actually pick up and do all the quests in areas, you will cap out on level just about 75% of the way through the game. Very bad level pacing. - Not enough gear sets in the game. It's basically material teired (Leather, Studded Leather, etc.), and then effects can be added through Smithing and Gems. - Glitches out the wazzou. In the House of Ballads quest line if you loot a second set of the special quest armor, one is removed at turn in; one is permanently bound to your character taking up inventory slots. Forever. My end game char has them now. - The combat IS fun, but horribly repetitive. In the case of my Finesse character its rolling and stabbing. End game I just killed everything with a bow because it required much less work. I don't really care for most of the combo moves. They typically end up setting you up to be attacked, and the damage output was hardly worth it. So I would have to count exactly how many clicks most of the time to avoid using a combo that is too slow. - With the proper time put into Smithing, your gear is insanely powerful. You hardly take damage even from Boss' mega attacks. Also smithing is obselete after you cap out 75% of the way through the main storyline... so, I hope you really dig your armor's look. - The game NEVER SEEMS TO END. I am a completionist. I like to do everything I can. But damn... its just drags on and on, and maybe this is made worse by no new gear, skills, or anything since you capped out a LONG time ago. I beat this game on sheer willpower alone, and it was a friggin' chore. They just keep giving you quests, and the end is never the end. I, seriously, had to quadruple check that the bad guy I was chasing the whole game was really, truly the end of the game.  Despite the Cons to Pros, I recommend this game. Its fun, engrossing, requires quick reflexes, combat is smooth as silk. The female models are stacked (if you're into that). Most of the game's problems could be fixed with a single patch (if the devs could have afforded to keep the lights on). The glithes I ran across were mostly inventory stealers or quest related. This game copied WoW and, maybe, The Witcher/Fable. BIG TIME! This game had Garissons in the Expansion pack long before WoW added them, just saying. It's just a badass game. It IS way too long and drawn out. Especially when you can't become anymore powerful shortly after the fight with the Balor. I loved this game so much I bought it for PC, when I had previously purchased it for XBox 360. Get the game, but don't expect perfection. For a one-and-done game developer, they made a much better game than some big name companies put out everyday.
2820	1	a	What you must know is that it's all about the vehicles. Get a ground vehicle, run dinos over or shoot them from and attached gun with someone else driving. Or get an aerial vehicle and shoot the hell out of annoying dumb flying dinos.
3577	1	a	It may be Glitchy as hell. Contain more bugs then any other games. Issues with just about everything but damn is this fun with a few friends!
4828	1	a	It's pretty good, but gatling gun is way too op. Just get it and you've already won.
2446	1	a	drive around run around fly around and kill those dinos. loads of fun and laughter and best played with friends!
1530	1	a	Not so bad, pretty fun &amp; a hell lot of things to do. Graphics aren't that bad, there's side quests and the storyline is pretty fun, a pretty big map, lots of things to explore, the combat system is good, you can craft potions and your own armor, &amp; then rename it which I think seems, awesome. Lots of different unique armor and weapons to find, killing innocents ;D, breaking out of jail, stealing, pickpocketing, lockpicking, dungeons to complete and a crapload more. Overall, I'd rate this game a..... 6/10 Not the best game in the world, but i'd reccomend you to give it a shot
1348	1	a	'Warrior build is bad,' they said.  'Pick a composite class,' they said.  Well, after finishing the game easily with a hammer I got at level 14, I can safely say that Warrior builds are not, in fact, bad (git gud??). Danke writing, (R. A. Salvatore) and acceptably danke combat, making for a pretty danke game overall.
6108	1	a	')
6182	1	a	Killing Floor with dinos...DINOOOOOOOS :D It hink its cool, worth a try. Nothing extra just to spend time if you are bored :D
5364	0	a	No so laggy, crashes a ton, and when a dino attacks from behind you can't even turn and shoot. Not worth it and please i want a refund!!!!
2433	1	a	METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE
4640	1	a	Its Free To Play And Very Nice Game I Recommend It.
682	1	a	DISCLAMER: I have about 100 hours logged into the console version, so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I hold the controversial opinion that maybe, just maybe, THERE ARE GAMES BETTER THAN SKYRIM. I also hold the opinion that this game is one of them.  It does so many things better than Skyrim, and many other RPG's in general:  Pros:  -Fluid Combat that is just right. Everything flows so well, and it's not hard to control.  -An engaging story. They had a proffesional fantasy writer, R.A. Salvatore, help them with the story , how could it not be legit?  -A large world that you can easily be lost in.  -The DLC has a good quality, providing a good 15-20 hours of gameplay per expansion, of which there are 2. They might as well be there own games.  -Expansive Side-Quest lines that will take up most of your time.  Cons:  -The character models are...something.  -Mediocre voice acting here and there, you'll be able to tell which accents are fake.  The game and all of its DLC is $9.99 right now. There is literally no reason not to get this game.  
1379	1	a	Awesome game. I played it on PS3 and Xbox, and now, rule the game again on PC. All is perfect
4528	1	a	Get It While Its Free 
2147	1	a	Diablo game with Assassin's Creed combat, AWESOME!
4585	1	a	thank god they lowered the price
4857	1	a	Amazing. Purely amazing. First i want to say, 93% off? That's freakin cheap. And i love it. I first played this yesterday for the 'limited time free game' thingie steam has. Instantly i checked the store page to see how much it costed. $0.99. Wow. Here is what i liked/didn't like about my experience.  PROS: Ya get to kill freakin dinosaurs with machine guns and rocket launchers! Great weapons (depsite being only about 25) Various gamemodes (There were only like 1 or 2 that i didn't like) Amazing concept, which was executed perfectly. Co-op PVP PVE Solo mode Slaughter mode (i freakin love it!) Play as a freakin dinosaur  CONS Single player is a bit too hard (so ya better have some friends) Could use more customization  Would i recommend this? Heck ya! i give this an 9/10 
3075	1	a	It's an okey FPS game. But it gets boring after a while.
4896	1	a	its not GREAT but i mean you can kill dinosaurs, and face it, how many other video games can you fight dinosaurs in? for .99 i would get it
5096	1	a	i hate this 
4890	0	a	its still pretty bad
2233	1	a	Finally, in Reincarnation they managed to save the series, because the earlier D3 games weren't even close to how awesome the D2 series was.   Progression is a bit slower than expected and the AI is sometimes unfair, other than that, great game!
8	1	a	Think Puzzle Quest, but instead of match 3 you play poker solitaire to fight your enemies.  It's fun if you're into this kind of thing. The story is cliched but well-written: I appreciate characters with a sense of cynicism. The art and sound are nice. Tutorials can be skipped when you replay the game.  Downsides: Mystic Box appears to fallen off the face of the earth. Technical settings do not save when you quit the game; I constantly have to hit Alt+Enter to resize my window and re-pick 'click and click' (dragging is a pain) when the game starts up  Overall, I enjoy this game. I use this game to kill time or relax: it's not as mindless as a match 3 and it's a fun twist on the premise. I don't expect it to do much more than that.
4437	0	a	horrible game does not work do not buy it is so horrible don't buy it don't pay for it
5219	1	a	Cheap and fun.
79	1	a	Poker meets puzzle quest. Very fun game, some fights feel overhwelming difficult though while others are a walkthrough.
283	1	a	This game made me feel like a kid again.  I've played a ton of games to the point where I felt like nothing was new, but this is defintely a unique game.  It's graphics look pretty good for it's time. It's got more of a fantasy look than anything and they certainly did a good job on that. While in combat everything looks really smooth and it's fun to look at... especially those finishers, oh man. Sometimes the combat is a little clunky though, mostly regarding the camera. It doesn't have a lock on feature so sometimes it's a little frustrating when you're trying to lock target onto someone else. With that aside, the combat is still great.  Usually with an RPG, you'll have to go down a specific specialization to be powerful. That mostly holds true in this game, though you can still spread your talents more thin and still not do underwhelming damage.   There's lots and lots and lots of quests. You might not even find all of them which makes this game great. Though it's no Elder Scrolls size, it's still a large game. Because you can make so many different characters and take different quest paths, it's definitely got great replay value. I'd certainly reccomend this game.  9/10
240	1	a	I really love this game. It's one of my favorites to play. When I first started playing it, my very first impressions were, 'ok this is nice, kind of like Skyrims poorer cousin', but the more I played the more I realized how unfair that initial thought was.  The combat is very fluid, with a great feeling of impact to the hits. All the moves and spells are beautifully animated. I've gone pure warrior on my first character and can't wait to try out the pure caster role as I think it will be different and interesting to play. Rogue types are normally my least fave to play, but the combat is so enjoyable I'm even looking forward to trying that out too.  Loads of side quests (I'm aiming to do all of them on my first character.)  The world is huge and very nicely done. There are invisible walls but the world is very open and I don't find they get in the way so they're not something to worry about and they've included jump off points at locations where you'd need/want them.  The dungeons are great fun too. Loads of loot drops and chests in dungeons and around the world. The weapons and armor are all really nicely meshed and textured as well.  The only negative thing I'd say about the world is that there's something not quite right with the ...ambience? When your outside it feels like you're inside, I haven't been able to put my finger on why that is though, maybe the sounds or something. It's not game breaking, just a little weird when you first start playing, it doesn't bother me at all now.  The herbing animations are beautiful, which I think shows a really nice attention to detail. The professions in general are all really good and all worth having. The only thing is when your salvaging armor and weapons it can be a bit awkward. It's fine if you only carry round stuff you have equipped and are going to salvage or sell everything else, but I 'collect' stuff, so I'm constantly having to flick back to my inventory and then back to the salvage screen to make sure I'm not salvaging anything I intended to keep. I feel if you could have salvaged directly from your junk inventory that would have been much better. But that's the only negative thing I have to say about this game at all, and overall and compared to everything else they got right, it's not at all important, just inconvenient......for me :P  I enjoy this game so much that I did a search to see what other games the company had made, and was really sad to see that they went bust shortly after this game was released. This game seems to have flown 'under the radar' which is ashame since it should have kept the company in business. I'm surprised KoA is not better known than it is. I bought KoA and all the dlcs when it was on sale here at steam, but it's definitely worth it's full asking price. 
405	1	a	Feels like skyrim should have done. Interesting and distinct environments, superb crafting system, a story you actually want to explore... the best RPG I've played since Human Revolution.
2640	0	a	It isn't amazing but it isn't awful either. The game is a decent amount of fun, but Trek Industries is a trashy and shady company. I'm usually all for supporting indie devs, but Trek takes things to a whole new level. They're manipulative and money hungry. They lie, fire employees without paying them for their work, and they steal assets from other games as well. I cannot recommend buying this or any other games they may be involved with.
5340	0	a	Was looking forward to this game, game crashed after I pressed button 'B' to buy weapons in a game. Man, I sure love this game.
1113	1	a	There's just something about being able to freely run amok and fight and explore without having the normal linear experience that follows with combat RPG games. Often I tell myself why they wasted the time crafting gear you have to blindly swap out for the next best things. (Or rip my hair out because of games that have 6 armor sets but enough quests to make you take a hiatus) If you feel that way about the typical Crawler experience, and games like dungeon siege, dungeon hunter, fable, God of war, and many other games on that front, this is worth your money.  The major selling point to this game for me is the perspective of gameplay. It's just you and monsters almost all of the time, someone who wants a quest, and a bunch of dead travellers everywhere. It's pretty much saying No one is strong enough to leave the city but the bandits or a few scarce soldiers around the game that want you recruited. It is extremely hard to explain without a video. So you should go watch a video review. And even with the reviewers saying, hey, it's easy, it's boring, I see the action And the exploration And it just became a sure buy in my opinion.  As for the difficulty. I started hard mode and felt right at home, I think you can change the difficulty at any time, but I didn't bother because the twists and turns are the same as Skyrim on adept. Though you'll probably die more here because they're more blatant on using combos to pressure you. You can do the same to enemies provided you have a weapon or spell that does enough raw damage.  Speaking of raw damage. There are disciplines. Might, finesse and sorcery I think... Or wisdom. Basically it's warrior assassin and mage. BUT these disciplines are based on ability point distribution. And the general number of the points spent in each one dictate the type of armor you can wear. Also, those points Also unlock a destiny card system that offers you all cards your points accumulate into. So if you had every discipline at 100 you can select one of any of the perk setups in the game. It is very rewarding to all play styles and I would have loved to see more of it. Some skills even come with evasion modifiers that help balance gameplay for you.  The quests in this game are very well done. Not in the skyrim sense of, there's a right way to do anything that isn't daedric, but in more of a, why would I help you steal something for what I think is No reason?, kind of way. If you're supporting a specific role in the game, it shows a lot of promise as you can easily find a few quests that have some odd bad alignment turns, though to the same event, it does lack motivation in how it doesn't explain why they want you to necessarily do these things, however I would think the game will feature the same dissatisfaction if you don't assume the role of being someone who has the power to change fate. And in that sense it may be entirely up to you to shape people and their, it was written so it is done, attitude. It's a very nice way to get you on your own two feet without direction.   I don't think I have done one story quest. I basically just help the people that appeal to me and move on. And it still manages to be enough for me as a game to recommend without knowing anything of the story. The game is just good looking. The combat is simple, yet fun, the skills and quests are very cut and dry, but remain relevant because they can be improved.   I personally think a lot of love went into the game. I don't see too many games that meet most of the expectations most people want and don't get out of games, essentially making them jump between several games to name a justifiable experience. With this game, you get combat, self implied story, open world, skills, magic, you can say it was supposed to be an mmo, and it does feel that way at times. You can even rag on the story, or repetitive quests that everyone seems to complain at. I guess they never played a real mmo. It's really not that bad, and I would have gotten the game during the summer had I known that. And I'm glad they made this game an offline game, so that even though they're gone, people can still experience it fully. Because it is really well made and quality driven. It's definitely not a purchase to regret. Unless you have a game just like it, and if you do, tell me so I can get that too.
5622	1	a	I remember when I bought for a $1 i now have crippling depression.
3250	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs   175/10
4572	1	a	If It only didnt lag as hell I could write a decent review.
5382	0	a	...Wow, that was pretty bad.  This is what took place In the ten minutes I could handle playing.  I was placed in the tropics with no back story. After a couple of minutes to prepare, a horde of Luddite Velociraptors started â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the generator 100 meters from camp (I think it's a camp). Once you kill them, another swarm of dinos appear with the same vendetta. That's it...if that sounds like a good time, give it a try. It's free for a week.
1680	1	a	i think is a game one can get into for long time ,so far i like it a lot .. go for it it will make our day /andy
4430	0	a	literally garbage
6222	0	a	I saw this game on sale for a buck and thought 'Why not?' I had fun with it, but that fun gets outshone by several problems with the game which I am surprised are still there for a game that was released over 2 years ago.  First off, the game. It's a game where you are set against hordes of dinosaurs, ranging from quick raptors that try to hunt in in groups, to triceratops that will charge at you, to T-Rexs which will just gobble you up. You have a variety of weapons to choose from: pistols, rifles, shotguns, explosives, and even a bow and sword. You can also hop in vehicles, such as trucks, tanks, and VTOLs. With three classes (a flying type, a medic type, and a cloaking type) you have ample options to wreck those dinos. Of course, there is the PvP modes as well, where you can play as the dinosaurs as well.  Before I start getting into the problems I had with it, let me say this: I did have fun. You can have a lot of fun with the game when it is working. My favorite loadout is jetpack, grenade launcher, and shotgun, with a little extra armor for good measure. I can tear through hordes of dinos while flying around like a fairy. It is also entertaining to have a jeep plow through the enemy while your buddy is shooting from the turret on the back. So yes, I had fun with the game.  However, I really can't recommend this game because of some glaring issues with it. 1. Connection issues. Connecting to server is iffy at best. Some times it will connect you to a game, and then instantly disconnect you. This happens quite a bit. Other times, you'll be midmatch, then be disconnected even though there was no indication of a bad connection. Sometimes lag will be horrendous. Players teleporting around your screen, and bullets seeming to vanish a foot in front of you. About 30% of my time had no issues. The other 70%, I was having trouble connecting, or getting dropped from a server. I've had several really good runs ruined by a random disconnect. It is extremely frustrating.  2. No tutorial. None whatsoever. It took me over an hour before I realized I had grenades(press g to throw). Also, you would think space would control the jetpack, but it's set to ctrl for some reason. You can melee, but again, you don't know that unless you hit it on accident, ask someone, or run accross it in the keybindings. It was even longer before I figured out how the augments system works(just an fyi, you can have an infinite number of augments equipped. You buy them by double-clicking. You can also buy an augment more than once for some reason. It doesn't boost you though, it just takes your credits). Altogether, there may be some fun stuff I am missing, but I don't know what those are because it isn't made obvious.  3. The graphics are all over the place. The dinosaurs look really good. The enviroments look all right. The player models just look horrible. Even when playing on high settings, they look blocky, or the texture messes up really badly. As for the weapons, some of them look really cool, such as the burst-fire rifle(I don't remember what it's called). Other weapons look extremely uninspired. The shotgun I like to use looks like a tube with some lights and wires. Also, a number of icons look extremely low resolution. They should really be polished up. The vehicles are all over the place in terms of style. Most have s silvery shine and lights, some are dark and grey, and the hoverbike looks like it is from a different game entirely with its turqoise paint.  4. Balance. The balance is odd at times. For example, a knife is pretty powerful, but the sword is pretty weak. That's a really weird decision, especially since it costs more credits to get the sword than the knife. Also, the grenade launcher is probably too powerful. I love to use it, and I am saying it is too much. I just wreck dinos with it, until I'm overflowing with credits I can't use. At times, my teammates are running low on funds because they can't really compete with a GL. Another weird decision is the turrets. I have only seen someone use one once because they only last 60 seconds, even though you most likely will not be able to afford one until wave 8/10. I don't know why you would pay 20,000 credits for one (the same price as some of the most powerful weapons in came), and people I have played with can't justify buying them either. Another issue I had was with the augments, one case in particular. There are two augments that affect jumping, one which increases your jump height(by a lot) and one which gives you double jump(which is unaffected by the previous augment). The jump height upgrade is flatout better than the double jump. There is a very noticable difference in heights you can reach between the two.  5. The shooting. For the most part, the guns feel pretty weak. They don't do a whole lot of damage, they don't sound powerful, and they can be extremely innacurate. Especially when you buy some of the more expensive guns, they don't do much damage to justify their cost. Sometimes, guns are innacurate for the weirdest of reasons. For example, the turret on the back of the car. If you look to the left or right with it and fire, the bullets will hit several feet to the left or right of where you aimed. I felt something was off when driving around with it, then tested it while stationary. Even while sitting still, if you aren't looking straight forward or backwards, it won't hit where you aim. I really don't understand why that is.   6. Bugs. Some of the bugs I have run into: -not spawning in a match. You are supposed to spawn when a new wave starts, but I've had several times where this had not worked. -in the player customizations screen, my character would not be centered on the screen. About half the time, my character model would be off to the side under the menus where I coulndn't seem him. -as mentioned before, you can buy augments more than once. I accidently bought an augment twice while playing, losing valuable credits. -in the keybindings, you can set vehicle steering to be either controlled by A and D, or by mouse. This doesn't work, it will always be controlled by mouse. I never got it to work. -sometimes, when reviving a teammate, the meter will disappear. You are still reviving them, you just can't see it, so don't stop holding E.  7. Just weird little quirks: -the tank has a second, smaller turret on top, similar to what is in the car, but it is still controlled by the driver. They could really make the tank a two-seater and give control of the secondary turret to him. -dinosaur spawning. We lost several vehicles because dinosaurs spawned on top of us while driving by. That really ruined the mood. -the flying dinosaurs(called Rhams according to the wikia) can turn on a dime. They'll fly at a player from above to try and hit him, but will stop and turn really quick, making them difficult to dodge, as well as being difficult to predict and shoot. -there is an indicator on your HUD showing you how many magazines you have left. However, the games doesn't use a magazine system. Ammo is just taken from your ammo pool and dumped into your gun.  So while it is fun at times, a lot of stuff can and does go wrong. If you can get it on sale, great, you'll find some entertainment with it. I got it for a dollar. But I cannot recommend paying 15 dollars on it, as well as spending real money for cosmetic items in the in-game shop.
5467	0	a	This is fantastic game ..if you are seven-eight years old
4095	0	a	Update 29/06/16: My original review was for Orion: Dino Beatdown, which then became Dino Horde and now Prelude. Despite the game going through several name changes to put itself back on the steam frontpage for more sales and to reset it's bad review scores it's still an unenjoyable mess of a game with a developer surrounded by controversy of stolen assets and crowdfunding fraud. Read here for more info and sources:  http://www.thejimquisition.com/trek-versus-activision-how-orion-went-from-victim-to-villain-in-one-night/  Just because it's cheap does not forgive the fact it's a bad game and run by asset thieves, the shady dealings of the developer are well known and should never be supported even if the sale price was $0.01. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPERS GAMES FOR ANY PRICE.
5217	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.
1542	1	a	This game is a straight up fable clone. I really enjoyed Fable, and it's been a while since I played it, so I'm really enjoying this game too.  The game mechanics and fighting work very well, which is important for this type of game. I've only had it glitch a handful of times, and none that it didn't recover from or destroy my gameplay.  There's a fair amount of storyline for players that want to dig deeper - you can interrogate every person about just about everything going on in the game. I skip about 60% of that, but I dig in every once in a while and it's nice that it's there when you want it.  There's an array of different weapons to fit your play style: sword, hammer, wand, staff, bow/arrow, daggers, and more. There's 3 main charater types, but best of all, you can mix and match their tech trees! What a great feature for an RPG - it really let's you play HOW you want to the max!
4325	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
5039	0	a	This game is the embodiment of an awkward child you don't want to sit next to at lunch.
4755	0	a	this game contains so much aids
5926	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
196	0	a	Lackluster. They borked their camera and prevent you from seeing a lot of the hard work they put into the visual design.   The story is freaking hoaky. Nothing interesting. The whole fate thing has been done to death by the Japanese, come on man.  The gameplay is a mixed bag, the quests suck. They're MMO quests in a single player RPG, not cool. The combat how ever is alright, though given how big the environments are they could have gone a lot more nuts with it, buy what ever. Combat gets an A.  I can't recommend this game for anything other than a quick sale buy. I really hope someone takes the ideas from it and makes something presentable.
1114	1	a	Great Game , Very addicting . The fight mechanics are excellent , to be able to switch weapons and hit with magic in such quick succession is fun to say the least. The inventory is a bit of a pain as it seems to fill up very quickly. Very few times the camera gives an unfortunate and annoying angle during a battle but like I said that has only happened a couple of times during the many battles. There are so many missions you could play this game for many hours and advance very little in the main quest, the only drawback i can see to this is that when you do go back to doing a main quest to advance your character will be much more powerful than needs to be for the missions. I would recommend this game without a doubt.
5248	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2025	1	a	So many options for character creation. Love it.
2492	1	a	It's like cs go, but with dinosaurs  11/10 - Would play this game again (with friends this game is a must own)
6357	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ the reviews, this game is awesome
5579	0	a	Worest Game Ever
5769	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ off
2945	0	a	I dont even know where to start, the game in short is a terrible mess. Ugly and confusing GUI and the game's graphics even on best resolution leave much to be desired. It amazed me because the screen shots look good, even fun, but like every movie trailer these pics were probably the best parts of what this uneventful game has to offer. Trust me whan I say this.... STAY AWAY you'll thank me later.  Update: The game has gotten better since writing my review, but it still is graphically inferior. If you see my review just skip this game and try the devs new game The orion project. This game has much more promise, its currently in early alpha stage but well worth the dollar.
1023	1	a	To say this game is anything short of astonishing would be an insult. Yes there are some bugs still in the game but in my entire time playing the game I've only ever run into one small bug which had no impact on my playing at all. This is a game that gives Skyrim a run for its money and while I deeply wish there were more content in store for future releases it doesn't appear that will be the case any time soon. None the less the story is told brilliantly and keeps you on the edge of your seat and when you are looking for a break there is a plethora of exploration and side quests and stories you can dive right into. The DLC for the game adds all new paths to explore and things to do allowing you to become lost in awe and amazement at the world before you. With all there is to do in this game you can easily get a couple hundred hours of enjoyment from it and still come back for more.  If Skyrim is your cup of tea then I highly recommend this game as you will not be disappointed by what you see.
5892	0	a	Game doesnt open, just says its running. Yes i ended the process in task manager, which had no effect. I reinstalled it, deleted appchache, restarted PC/Steam. Nothing is working and i found no information on how to fix this issue.
1711	1	a	like fable with out the bs
6042	1	a	the game is a fast fun shotting game where you run around and shoot dinosaurs its really fun if you got a group to play with ii was the best 1 dollar i ever spent on a game that was so good i have spent more money on games that are worse belive me i injoyed this one
2166	1	a	Fantastic story, great replayability, just wish there was a sequel.
5393	0	a	One of the ''WORST CO-OP GAMES IN THE WORLD''
799	1	a	If you like RPG's, why do you not have this game?
1204	1	a	This game has great art work and lots of adventure in it.if you like single player games and rpg's then this is the game for you.
2574	0	a	This game is terrible. First 2 minutes sure that was fun but after that its terrible. The reviews below are misleading the trailer is nothing like the game, this is just Halo with Dinosaurs. The game is full of microtransactions and full of glitches. Do not trust the trailers or reviews that are postitive the developers are lying and this is not even worth putting on your Hard Drive even if its free. DO NOT be pulled into the heap of trash which is Orion: Dino Horde
1228	1	a	THis game is great! Pity the developers went bust. It plays similar to Fable and has hints of Dragon Age in it as well. The story is engaging and there are tons of side quests which can seem daunting at first but I would advise playing it like you were savouring good wine. The visuals are spot on and with the exception of a few glitchy scenes (especially when talking to people), the background and setting is a delight to watch and observe. The voice acting is great too if you don't mind the occasional echo in the background. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves Fantasy and action RPGs.  10/10

3138	1	a	wow nc game price soo low many vehicles weapons to test and a tough game evry one should buy it i will give 9.5/10
2005	1	a	This is one of my favorite RPGs out there, very few managed to replicate its customization, story and progression feeling between each level. There are 3 paths butt  â¥â¥â¥â¥ing   each other to provide players fresh combination, atributes, and perks. Some set items available make the game more explorable. With proffesions, lorebooks and general enviroment placement, I'm surprised to find such polish on a single player game.\ Would definitely play this game once more....I am lying of course....since storywise, its very linear in its choices, but thatss not a bad thing. my only annoyance is all the walking i have to do in unnecesarily long hallways. Would pay for a hopping ballerina run animation DLC
1785	1	a	a game full of fun, flash and adventure. i had a great time playing this game, reckoning is one of the greatest rpg's that i've played in a long time. it's big open world helps for hours of playtime even after you've finished the main story line. sure it's no skyrim but think as if dragon age and the elder scrolls had a baby, this bad boy would have come out. thats not to say there arent some problems; almost all the characters look very similiar, there were some click in's and outs and the game suffers a few other glitches. but its nothing that takes away from the feeling of imersion, this game is great and the small bugs really dont bother all to much, sometimes not even at all. in total I'd give this game a 9/10. great game with an amazing story, i loved every minute of it.
1475	1	a	Love this game. I got into Dragons Age while I was in the desert and completed it pretty quickly. This game reminds me of that, but it is far more vast. Combat is fun, hack and slish style with some spells. deffinatley playable for several hours, if you catch it on sale, it's worth it.
2432	1	a	BUY IT BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!  Edit: Oh wait its free...
3959	0	a	About as fun as masturbating with sandpaper.
2942	1	a	Really good game, recomend i highyl! You can point **** you and have a sandwich/hamburger hat, what beats that? Nothing is better than this game considering you also can dance like a boss with matrix patterns on your armor. If you want a fun, dinasaour killing game, I highly recomend ORION: Prelude
4148	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
4184	1	a	damm this game is just superb for 79 cents itÂ´s worth it , if you buy it longside with friends and you play with them itÂ´s a really funny game
6162	1	a	I really like this one. Although the graphics aren't that great, I had lots of fun killing dinosaurs both alone and with my teammates. One of my favorite parts of the game is the wide variety of weapons you can use in-game between rounds. At first, it was a little frustrating trying to figure out some of the options the game gives us but after a while, you'll WANT to learn some of these extra features.  It's a great buy for just $1. It's definitely worth it!
760	1	a	very profound and entertaining game, need a good time investment in order to be appreciated fully.
229	1	a	I finished Kingdom's of Amalur and I gotta say, if you had to call it anything you'd have to call it ambitious. Get it if you like a good ol' save the world from sealed away evil storyline, interesting world and lore and games like Fable or World of Warcraft.  Avoid it if you get frustrated by limited camera control, simple movelists and a VERY limited amount of enemy designs (theres about 15 noticable enemy models and a lot of pallete swaps) and loads and loads of empty walking broken up by almost repetetive combat encounters. Theres a rewarding crafting system that sadly invalidates all the cool custom armor and weapons they've designed as the stuff you can end up making will far outclass the unique gear.  Play the demo to get a feel of the combat and camera and to unlock content for the main game (a fantastic touch) and be a little cautious of where you go because dungeons appear to scale to the level you first enter the at (same goes for entire DLC content)
3015	1	a	 Guys, buy it now . You won't regret it. Dino Horde , a.k.a. Futurist Killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicules, is a nice fun source. Step 1: Buy the 4-pack Step 2 : Give copies Step 3: Have fun !
2191	1	a	A wonderful RPG experience. Large selection of weapons with unique combos for each. There are no traditional restrictive class system. Instead you can be Warrior-Mage or Assassin-Warrior or Mage-Assassin and any other combination of these class depends on your preference. A lot of armor sets. You can even craft your own armors and weapons and name them.   But there are some downsides, The graphic looks like really old for a game release in 2012. There are a lot of side quest across the world but they are repetitive and less meaningful. The main campaign has a solid story though.   7/10. Recommend to RPG lovers.
89	1	a	It's a mix of solitaire, with a bit of poker and elements from RPGs that is really addictive!
1656	1	a	THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOUR D!CK HARD. (WELLL ATLEAST THE 1ST HOUR)
4652	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
4925	1	a	Doesnt work properly.
4842	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is so addicting. I absolutely love it. I immediately bought 2 extra copies to giveaway so my friends could enjoy it with me.
5556	1	a	What can be better than shooting a t-rex in the face with bullets? Shooting a SPACE T-REX in the face with bullets. When's the last time you picked up a friend in a jeep and spent the after noon cruising the land scape, running over velociraptors, runnning from a triceritops, and dodging pteridactyls? Come visit the jurassic park of the future where you make the endangered extinct! Caution no small children or Jeff Goldblum allowed.
1482	1	a	I've played a few hours of this game and it is a single player mmo basically, with crafting, loot, skill trees (and ability trees, you get to spend 3 points on combat-related abilities per level and 1 point on a non-combat tree per level, each), tons of quests, a combo/charge system for weaponry depending on how you spend your skill points. Keyboard/mouse controls work just fine, but personally I am liking using a wired xbox 360 controller much more, haven't had to change any button mapping it's nicely laid out for the controller. If this game lasts ~60 hours total (it's open world so I imagine it will) it will have easily been worth the price. Very fun game if like the mmo/skyrim/rpg/fable genre of games. Try the demo (but either/or turn off post-processing,or force 2x aa through your video card or you'll get black screen during cinematic/gameplay; fair warning for the demo any settings you change will not save). Full game has no blackscreen or settings-saving issues.
4052	1	a	In many ways the spiritual successor to half-life 2 and most fun I've had in a game since fallout 3.  11/10 'it was decent'
412	1	a	Game is fun
506	1	a	An unsung treasure that deserves a spot in every RPG fanâs collection.  Writer R.A. Salvatore created original IP for this game, giving it one of the most unique settings and characters of any RPG youâll play. While the game itself is nothing groundbreaking Kingdoms of Amalur does it all well; the controls are good, the story is compelling, the graphics are solid, and most importantly, the game is just fun to play. One of the best RPGs to come out in the last few years.
5449	1	a	Shoot big lizard it drop money good game 10/10
3296	1	a	This is a fun little team based shooter which involves you, the player, gunning down... well, dinosaurs. Hundreds of 'em, in droves. If you ever get tired of shooting at dinosaurs, then there's a whole host of different modes to choose from, including several styles of PvP. You can even turn the tables and play as a dinosaur yourself. The developers are very prompt about keeping this game up to date and adding new content, and have already released a huge update in the short time I've been playing it. Good work guys!  Pros: - Caters to a range of different playstyles. You can play in first and third person, solo or in a group. - Customisable characters provide a huge range of options. - A range of vehicles to choose from. Ever felt like blasting hordes of raptors with a tank? - Constantly updated with new maps, game modes and big fixes.  Cons: - Currently a little buggy, though mostly minor stuff like sounds not playing properly and dinosaurs getting stuck. - The music can be repetitive - While the game  can  be played alone, it's noticeably built with multiplayer in mind. Most game modes are considerably more fun with friends.  TL;DR: This game is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Why not give it a try?
1700	1	a	The best action RPG that PC ever had.
5498	1	a	IGNORE THE BAD REVIEW ON METACRITIC -- that was for a prerelease of the game. All the issues are fixed, and this is fun (and brutal) as heck. and for 99 cents???? whats not to love!
4357	1	a	Muahaha.. its free to play this game now!!   i got this 2 months ago, then refunded it 'cos the game wasnt played nicely on my pc. Multiple crashes in the game, laggy in some parts.  Should just lower the price to .10 cents so those trading cards will still get drop.
2241	0	a	Nothing changed, still unplayable piece of ****.
3404	1	a	Pretty much an epic game! =D
3678	1	a	Best Game for under Â£1 Great fun pure bants
5366	0	a	This game is so much fun for a couple of hours. When you play it with friends. Then it loses it's luster. It's got a nice premise, but it is also repetitive. As I'm writing this, I suppose they're adding more content. That should do the game a world of good. The graphics are nice, but the controls need some work. I have an Xbox 360 controller that didn't seem to work with this game. It was still alot of fun, but I can't imagine playing this alone.
6078	0	a	It's fun for a bit but missing some content.
5744	0	a	Bad game its a REALLY BAD GAME! they say theyve changed it but its the same old glitchy mess it was 3 years ago! evan without the glitches its a boring game!
4470	1	a	I paid Â£0.79, to ram a Triceratops with a car, he flung me across the map and i landed on about 5 velociraptors. 10/10
705	1	a	Very underrated. Gameplay is fantastic. Story may be a disappointment.
2418	1	a	its kind of good
3885	1	a	yes it very GOOD........ i was spend 5 hour per day for level up it very good than old
4202	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs. This fulfills my childhood Jurassic Park fantasies. 12/10
3394	1	a	Total of 30 min. 20 min searching/getting to a game.10 min of gameplay. Searching for a game was more fun. I somehow got this game for free.So im winning.
3539	1	a	Got it on sale, afked was like lucky to get a WHOLE set of foil cards. PROFIT MADE  10/10
4436	0	a	Blood Vomit. All over. Rotten Apple out of 10
5336	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ old dino shooter. cheap but gets boring quick
2821	1	a	played when it was free weekend i remeber it was fun im actuly planing on buying it this summer
3302	1	a	This game used to not be good at all. However the developers are amazing, listened to their fans, and turned this into one of the most fun games you can buy on steam right now. I've played this game for hours on end (on a different account if you're confused about my play time) and will continue to do so for a long time. Buy this game if for nothing else than to support developers who care about their player base
4969	0	a	Why would you buy this? It's awful..  No really it's awful..  GFX are in line with PS2.. This is like one of those bad movies that's so bad it's good, cept nothing is good. Save your $ and buy something else.
3975	1	a	Well, it's okay for a cheap game.
901	0	a	Gets boring quick.
5924	0	a	This game sucks because of the graphics, even thou it cost as much as a Mc Donald burger
2564	1	a	Killing Dino's have never been so much fun!!! Teamwork is great and all... but killing dino's with tanks and what not just takes the cake!
2911	1	a	25p each for 4 friends to shoot a T Rex in the face. What's not to like?
2188	1	a	Must have game for any RPG fan. 9/10 overall.   A hugely underappreciated title, even moreso than Enslaved.  Damn shame what happened to this IP. This is by far one of the most entertaining RPGs I've played, with loads of content, fun and deep crafting system, engaging combat, etc. etc. BHG did a really good job.  Pros: -Incredibly bug-free -Fun, smooth, combat -Flexible character development with easy respec -Great storytelling all over -Truely unique world -Great crafting system -I could go on and on  Cons: The only complaints I have are: -No new-game plus, so replay value is limited -The complex zone level-locking mechanic, in order to get the best loot and have the most end-game loot options, you'll want to level as much as possible in each zone before moving on to the next, and plan out the order you visit zones carefully, but that will make you overpowered for some areas; if you don't care about end-game loot you can just play through as you like.
4238	1	a	Picture a mix between starforge and killing floor, Ill be playing this for a long time
4282	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
1270	1	a	Great game, own it on PS3 and XBOX 360 and still go back to it when I have nothing else!!
6203	0	a	This game is pretty boring and has bad graphics, If it hadnt have been free to test, I wouldnt have played it... Im glad i didnt buy it.
6270	1	a	this game is halo and jurrassic park. there are perks to buy with credits just like in CoD zombies which can be used different ways to fit whatever play style you want. got a 36 on meta score but is way more fun than that rating...
5748	0	a	scummy, asset stealing, game rereleasing devs combined with a horrible game = not reccomended
324	1	a	This game has a ton of content. Lots of quest and other things to get into. I would be further along the main quest line but every time I'm running around its like 'Ooo another NPC with an exclamation point! Let me see what quest that is!' Then I get sidetracked for an hour or two. I'll probably never finish but it's still a fun easy going game to play. Sort of WoW meets Elder Scrolls. Has a good visuals, beautiful land scapes and good combat animations. Fate moves and the backstab kill cams are a pretty awesome touch. Story line is good, tons of lore, with better than average voice acting. I'd definitely recommend this game. Check for it during one of the big Steam Sales, which is when I picked it up.
3924	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
2552	1	a	nice game and it is cheap. Good for playing with friends for few hours.
5700	1	a	1 dollar of shooting dinosaurs with jetpacks. buy it, after u buy bad rats, because they are great game.
3881	1	a	- Walked out of base - Chased by huge horde of dinosaurs - Watched teammate get taken by a Pterodactyl - Ran for cover - Found tank - Jumped in tank - Destroyed angry Stegosaurus with tank - Massacred dinosaurs for a 'MONSTER KILL' - Triceratops bashed tank to death - T-Rex ate another teammate - Died to horde  10/10 - Would die to play again!
598	1	a	awesome game with great combat . slight camera issues and too many caves 7.5/10
2898	1	a	This game, when it came out it 2012, was, without a doubt, a total wreck. Glitchy graphics, animations screw ups, pathfinding issues, etc.  Now?  One of the best survival shooters I have played. It's tieing with Gears of War's horde mode and Halo's Firefight mode for best survival shooter I have played.  Seriously, Play. The. Game. It. Is. Awesome. YEEHAW!!!!!
4082	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ is cash as my balls
5763	0	a	This is a massively awful game. Don't even think about picking it up.
6236	0	a	Awful game. Just terrible...
4228	1	a	Sold my AK-47 and m4a1-s on Cs go then purchased this game for 0.99$ Totally worth it.
4603	1	a	LOVE IT
807	1	a	How many levels does this player go up to level 30 or  40....more??? 
3245	1	a	Amazingly well done game. Tons of game modes competitive and co-op with lots and lots of maps for hours of multiplayer fun. Still slightly buggy but I'm confident the developers will be working hard to fix everything. Buy this game!
5358	1	a	Liquidy purified AIDS condensed into a mess. Took me 20 minutes untill I was searching up how to permanently remove it from my steam library. SUCC/10 Willl never achieve THICCness.
3842	1	a	Lam as â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't bother buying.
4172	0	a	Though fun, the game falls horribly short as the dinosaur. They feel unpowered, squishy, and mostly target practice. Where this is good playing as a human in survival or even in versus; It leaves much to be desired as the supposedly powerful beasts. As the smaller dino's, you're so soft that you can rarely take more than one quick shot. The larger ones seem so clumsy and slow that it's nearly impossible to hit the humans. It could really do with some rebalancing of the team/species-based combat. The solo play is fun, and playing humans v. humans is also enjoyable, if not reminescent of another scifi shooter. If you wanted to play this game simply to be a titan, squishing puny humans and eating them up, this is not for you. If you wanted a good online shooter where you can switch targets between walking fossils and other sacks of meat; then you've come to the right place.
2102	1	a	So good action RPG fun a lot of classes play differntly you would not expct them to play.buy this a shame we will nevr get a sequal. this was a great game
6056	1	a	Dinosaurs, Halo, and Tribes
1297	1	a	amazing game. im probably going to play it as often as i play skyrim
2381	0	a	 https://encyclopedia   dramatica.se/The_Orion_Project 
121	1	a	First time i played KOA i say to myself : 'Shiiiit it looks like world of warcraft !!!' BUT - With High quality textures - Without the thousands retaaards running around - Art Design :  Todd McFarlane  [en.wikipedia.org]  (co-founder of image comics) - Lead Designer :  Ken Rolston  [en.wikipedia.org]  (game design on morrowind and oblivion) - Game universe and Lore :  R. A. Salvatore   [en.wikipedia.org]  (Forgotten Realms)  Thanks Azura this game got nothin common with the mmo for rude and slow minded kids. It's a very interesting and poetic rpg with dynamic epic fights and an amazingly appealing world.  Pros : + The crafting, skill &amp; respec systems + The main storyline and the sidequests (no feeling like working for fedex) + The Ancient stones spread over the world who tell you a 'faery' tale when you activate them + The Zelda Hommage + It's really beautiful, colorful, not realistic at all, a bit cartoon like, well made + A world handcrafted with love + It's a good port and just for that it's worth to see  Cons :  - Music is not very diversified. - Not a lot of choices to build the face of your character. - Some weapons way too much massive, a bit manga. - It's blurry and pale without a   Sweet FX   [sfx.thelazy.net]  - There are Gnomes, I hate Gnomes. (one of my ex girl friend left me for a gnome)  ==AND THE MORE IMPORTANT FLAW OF THE GAME== - Even in high difficulty the game is cake and it turns quickly really boring.    You must use YSA to fix that===&gt;   HERE  [www.dropbox.com]   Don't use the standalone.exe, make your own choice to fit the game to your wishes For example : I don't use the XP gain reduction cause it's buggy (the shortcuts are shiitty after that) I don't use the health regen and mana regen modifications neither cause it screws some spells I don't use the gold gain reduction cause i love to be rich as a pig BUT except these buggy things it's a MUST HAVE !!!   In conclusion i would say i've been totally charmed by this rpg different from the Elder Scrolls, or the Risen or even the Dragon Age... But like i said it's very appealing, it seems to be a long game and the more i play the more i fall in love.
2133	1	a	This game is one of the best RPGs I've ever played, it's right along side the dark souls series and skyrim in my opinion. Its a shame that this game didnt get recognized for the awesomeness that it is. I wish this game got more popular. I love stealth and assassinations, and this game handles both really well. For instance, the takedowns that you can preform with a dagger are unlike anything ive ever seen before and I was very impressed. There's a lot more I want to say about this game, but i'm lazy.
3282	1	a	This game is one of the most captivating and enjoyable co-op games I have ever played , and what's even better is that it only costs $0.99. I would say that if you have $0.99 to spare, this is the best way to spend it. 
4971	1	a	-10/10 beats cod and bf4 grafics togeter -its hard to learn the mechanics (like master yi )  -it cost a lot more than killing floor 2  -community filled woth 10 year old kids  -is no fun  -BUY IT
3233	1	a	So addictive, and for the price you can't beat it!
868	0	a	Camera movement are very sloppy but combat is good not worth buying the full price so...6.5/10
3424	1	a	sick game love the environments, game could change, when everyone dies on a specific wave, they just restart that wave and not a hol new game.
463	1	a	You smash wooden crates for gold, 5/5.
5442	0	a	Here is my constructive opinion :  Don't buy it.  Thanks.
5492	0	a	frame rate are too low..
1339	1	a	This game is a rare piece of RPG. For me the most amazing thing among the others is landscape and design of the creative environment. There are cities, villages, caves, underground castles, jungles, deserts... list goes on. Depending on where you go, you see unique things. Graphics may not be much realistic, but its cartoon-like graphics are still looking good. Ambient lights are also effectively used depending on the location. Game uses a wide varity of colors to bring places to life.   At the start, you are not forced to pick a class, instead, you can change your game style as you wish. There are 3 ability trees: Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue), Sorcery (Mage). Class system is a destiny cards based system where you pick a card depending on the total ability points you spend in a tree. If you want to play in a different way, just visit a fateweaver and reset your points. Any skill points learned through books or trainers are NOT LOST during this process. It is possible to max skill points with training books and trainers but ability points are limited (Max level is 40). One of the nice things about the class system is that you can create hybrid classes and if you want, you can create a combination of all three classes.  For gameplay, depending on your class, your gameplay will alter. You can use dodge or block as your defense. Although mages can block with talismans, they cannot use parry (Blocking right before enemy attack so you can counter attack). If you can reach high destiny levels, you can even get short range elemetal blinks. You can use any weapon without restriction but to be able to use weapons' special moves, you need to unlock them in ability trees. Only armors has requirements (Such as having 12 points in might tree for warrior armor). There are many creatures in Amalur with mostly their own unique fighting styles so you have to adjust your strategy for them at the beginning.  Among the things that could have been better, I can easily show the journal where you keep track of your quests. All the repeatable quest are located in 'Tasks' section which is very nice yet they still show themselves in the minimap. I wish there was an option to lock-unlock them in the minimap.   Now, let's come to the thing I hated about this game: Dialogs! SO MANY DIALOGS! You may be thinking 'It is a RPG game, of course there will be lots of dialogs' but it is not about that. For example: There is a city called Rathir. When you go and talk to a NPC with a special name (you can only start conversation with those ones), there is a dialog called Rathir that the person tells you something about the city. When you go talk another NPC, he has the same dialog with the same script. (Only it changes some words but idea is the same) Now think like that: there are more than 30 NPCs you can talk and I am just giving an example about the word 'Rathir'. Those NPCs share more than 1 dialog (If you are in a city or village, you will see NPCs sharing at least 4-5 dialogs.). It is not over yet. I just gave an example about one city and believe me, world map is enormous. So my advice is that get familiar with your 'space' button :D It will be your savior.
165	1	a	Excellent game overall. Here is a short overview:  + Excellent combat system: Game is very fluid, rewards proper timing and position. + Optimization: Runs very well on pretty much any computer. + Customization: As a proper RPG, this game allows you to customize the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of your toon(with the ability to respec for a fee).  - Graphics: Game looks a little cartoony but i'd imagine this was part of keeping the game as accessible as possible. - Overpowering: You quickly feel incredibly strong depending on how you specialize your character.  So overall, the game is definitely worth the investment if you're a fan of Action-RPG's.
6073	1	a	It's $1 and a very well done, fun game.
853	1	a	TERA LIKE RPG WITH MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT
5568	1	a	great game, recommend
3818	1	a	  well i played for the first time now after 1 year, and its a lot more buggy than before, it has a cheap price, but i find it frustrating and almost unplayable now.
582	1	a	Think Diable meets Skyrim meets Witcher meets Fable.   Pretty solid game overall, only complaint is their camera can be abit off-putting at times
1284	1	a	This game is like a cross between Oblivion, Fable and Two Worlds.
558	1	a	Thereâs a game you probably didnât play. It came out 2 years ago, itâs a genuine epic, a vast, elaborate RPG with a sprawling story and vast numbers of sidequests. It features superbly in-depth combat, has huge variety in character design and levelling, and lets you instantly wander from the main plot and explore its enormous world to your own entertainment. Itâs Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. By John Walker
4656	0	a	the developers are snakes
5242	1	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics but is funish
164	1	a	This game is my pride and joy ! I love it too much because there isn't anything like it when it comes to PC RPGs. You can play it with an XBOX controller for an immersive experience. The graphics are beautiful without being demanding so it should run flawlessly even on older PC's.   The story is intriguing but there is space for more.  Yes it's inspired from Fable or Witcher but hey those are awesome games and it's not just a crappy clone ; it somehow manages to be unique and fascinating. You can get lots of hours of fun by playing this game (probably hundreds of hours) so it deserves all the attention. Too bad the studios who created this little gem are now closed. They deserved more than that.  It kinda reminds me of MMORPG genre but that is not a bad thing. It's a shame that MMO's are populated by jerks and kids - that's why i prefer anytime a single player experience. Call me crazy but that is how i see things - i just want to game in peace.  The price is big on Steam but you get more than you pay - i got the game for free from a friend but i would have bought it without even thinking. it's A NO BRAINER!  Kingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions, four playable races, and three class trees with 22 abilities per tree.The four playable races are the Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans).The player starts off as a 'blank slate', but can afterwards choose a class among the three available in the game, which are called Might, Finesse, and Sorcery; they correspond to the fighter, rogue, and mage classes respectively. As the player fights and gains experience, additional levels are unlocked. With each level gained, the player gains three ability points which can be invested in the skill-tree system to unlock or augment the 22 abilities. By completing Faction quests and investing ability points, the player can also unlock various 'destinies', which add positive buffs to the player. Combat is based on the timing of button presses, similar to an action role-playing game, with occasional quick time event cutscenes. The combat includes a 'fate' system which allows players to accumulate 'fate points' and ultimately enter 'Reckoning Mode', a slow motion mode that allows the player to quickly dispatch enemies. The Reckoning Mode may end on player's command, with the depletion of the fate bar or by the act of 'Fateshifting' an enemy. Fateshifting involves performing a brutal finishing move on a single enemy. During the cosmetic Fateshifting phase, the player may rapidly tap a random button (chosen and displayed by the game) to increase the experience yield up to 100%. After the Fateshifting, all weakened enemies also die.  The player can travel on land, jump down from predesignated spots and swim in the water. The player has the ability to communicate with, rob or kill NPCs; each of these actions have their own consequences. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara emphasized that 'twitch skill is only going to get you so far. Strategy and proper RPG playing is going to get you farther.'[5] 38 Studios founder Curt Schilling said that the style of the game would be a marriage between God of War and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
604	1	a	Wow wow wow... this game is amazing!! Why haven't I heard of it before? Bought it on sale on a whim, and absolutely love everything so far. Must spend a whole day playing and emerse in this world. ^^
3024	1	a	Imagine playing a version of HALO 2 where you can obliterate raptors with the gun from RoboCop.  That's what it's like playing ORION: Dino Horde.  And I'm okay with this.
1223	1	a	I'm loving this game. It plays similar to Dragon Age, but in a prettier world that's rooted in Celtic mythology.
407	1	a	I like this game and I do enjoy it a lot but I recommend reading a guide on quests and item bindings before going in because this game has some really irritating bugs. Some items become stuck in your inventory forever, taking up space unneccesarily. There are some quests that give you items that you can't get rid off, too. Overall, really good game but developers went bankrupt so no new patches.
5389	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.
4660	0	a	Ugly. Awful. Bad gameplay. Waste of time. Sorry I gave this game a shot and it's just bad. Looks cool and fun at first however it's not.
5780	0	a	This game might be good if you didn't freeze everytime you turned ,but it seems good
2670	0	a	This has got to be just about the worst, overhyped games i've ever played. It's not hard, it's just stupid and boring. I would NEVER recommend this to anybody looking for a great game to play.... Go grab yourself a valve game, or a steam sale game instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
655	1	a	Great game, reminds me of Fable when i was playing it. Only problem i really had with the game was that you could not change your 3rd person view distance and after awhile it can make you rather dizzy, aside from that this is an excellent game far worth the money its sold for. Sad that we are never going to see the sequal to this game in the future.
3474	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
5045	1	a	I find this game extremely fun. Not sure why, but it is. Maybe it's because it looks like L4D2. I mean, the objective is to fight with the horde. Back to topic, i recommend it, you'll find a lot of hours of fun here. I like the vehicles a lot. I found only one little problem in steering some of them, but it's not something upsetting. The idea is so cool. I wait for new upgrades.
1490	1	a	This game is Fable... the way it was supposed to be made.
234	1	a	Well it's a good RPG game if you get tired of Skyrim combat in this game is bloody amazing
3139	1	a	Where is the Donate button?
1042	1	a	Good RPG, should of been Fable 3
6261	1	a	Really dumb fun akin to Killing Floor with a dinosaur flavor. Actually a very rewarding experience with friends.
2571	1	a	Mid or Mac because Mid is not Mac but when Mac is Mid it is
3956	1	a	Very fun and addicting game. Lots of game modes to keep it interesting.
2013	1	a	This game is long as hell. If you pick it up, play in bursts so you don't burn out on it.
2258	1	a	so when's Disciples 4?
2764	1	a	420/10 would buy
6307	1	a	11/10 would crash again.
4844	1	a	This game is like Turok on steroids. I really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes PvE games or dinosaur hunter type games.
2641	0	a	Feeling like i was scammed i bought the game when it costed money but now it is free devs can you return my money because this is now f2p  To anyone who bought this i feel your pain
2634	1	a	What isn't there to say about this gem of a game?  The developers took a common staple multiplayer game, L4D2, and challenged the concepts that make that game great. 'Why are their zombies? The story just doesn't make sense!' They exclaimed, and went to work fixing all they could.  The end result? An amazing amalgamation of Amazing graphics backed by an abnormally high framerate, incredible gamemodes and features that make it a complete blast to play, and amazingly polished combat. Don't even get me started on the incredible menu design and feedback.  If you're going to buy lunch, do yourself a favour and buy ORION: Dino Horde instead, and even better, buy some for your friends also.  A solid 11/5 from me, if only I could go higher.
4239	0	a	Dinosour games should be like dinosours...extinct.  3/10  -SÑá¾á¹§
683	1	a	The Game Is Godly!!!!! My only Grip was the hit box you would have with Some Enemies. It seem not matter how much you dodge they seem to hit you anyway. I lost myself in this game, I really wish this game was still running to day. Customization was decent the gameplay was fulfilling other Fantasy open world rpgs need to kill themselfs, a blood Sacrifice to ressurrect this game.
3809	0	a	It feels like I just dropped a 1â¬ coin on a rush sale. I open the game try out the solo and I notice how the dinossaurs movements looks like a plank with robotic legs. I still had some faith and tried joining a multiplayer game but all the servers I could find were either on the other end of the world with over 420 ping or were password protected. I mean, holly mother of dino jesus, even the T-Rex's struggle to move between wee litle dinossaurs.  Oh look, it also has hats, taunts and mutch more fun looking things, surely they are earned by skill. Nope just by money.    So remember kids, just because the trailer and pictures look fun it doesn't mean that is fun.
6089	1	a	might just be the best fun I ever had for 60p and workshop too .. also it plays great on a pad for chilling back on the couch . Never been a big fan of survival fps but this game alone is changing that :)
3064	1	a	Ran over 10 velociraptors with jetbike and, got stuck on a tree branch and killed 10 more with nuclear revolver. 10/10
315	1	a	Brilliant game, absolutely brilliant, the only reason this game isnt one of the most played games of the genre, is..... well..... skyrim.. skyrim's shadow is way too big for the genre.
2971	1	a	I played this solo. A Dinosaur bit my gentleman's specialty off and as I was bleeding out it ran away.  Of course, I died. These dinosaurs don't hang around like the mooks do on Borderlands, waiting to kill you. That suggests Dinosaurs are cleverer than the populace of Pandora.  8/10, would have my particulars bitten off again.
752	1	a	Dear god the camera angles are awful in some areas. Game is also incredibly easy. 8/10
4441	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
2865	1	a	i need a tutorial on how to stop playing this game because damn gurl, this game is gud
4254	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
3671	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
