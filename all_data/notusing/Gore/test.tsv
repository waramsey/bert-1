31	There is not much to this game just yet, and as such I cant reccomend it. There are 2 'classes'; one that is a bit tougher, and one that is a bit faster.   There are a bunch of different weapons, but as far as I can tell they all do the same damage and combos/specials, and a bunch of cosmetics (shirts shoes, pants, backpacks, etc.)      The core gameplay is running around whacking zombies with your melee weapon or shooting them with your range, your melee gets combos with finishers, combos being x--&gt; y x--&gt; x--&gt; y x--&gt; x--&gt; x--&gt; y and your pistol gets like a grenade charge thing.     As it stands now I cant reccomend this game, because as it turns out, this game is complete.
32	Backed this in early access so, so long ago. It just got pushed out as complete so they could keep the money, I guess. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rip-off.
33	  Got it free so no waste of money, but due to bugs surely a waste of time.
34	People gave 160 000 of their dollars for this on Kickstarter. What's the result? A blatantly unfinished game that was barely updated during Early Access and hasn't evolved enough since.
35	Its abandoned for over one year. Nothing moves and they just squeeze out the money from customers giving em an 20% done Alpha version. If you want to burn your money just hold a lighter under your money bill. it will do the same effect but faster and less frustrating

44	  this game is very fun I got it from a giveaway on alienware arena not really expecting not to like it but so far I am really enjoying myself. but i dont really think it is a complete game and should still be in early access because there is just not enough features and things to do I really think this game has potential but needs more work done on it and more to do in the game so unless more things get added to the game i cannot reccomend the game for the price there selling it for. but definetly worth free from that giveaway. The moment they fix the bugs, properly optimize it and add the content needed to be a full game I will easily give it a thumbs up but till then I would hold off on buying it because there is no guantee they will add what is needed into the game.

46	  Promising upon first impressions... I customize a little character with a ton of different weapons/clothing/accessories/hair, the menus navigate well enough, and then hop into the first level... MASSIVE stuttering during most mouse movement despite pushing &gt;100FPS, movement acceleration per key press that resets on direction changes so the movement is unresponsive and incredibly clunky, mouse aim feels completely off, weapon changes and abilities often don't work while making other inputs, etc. The melee combat has no weight to it, and the shooting at least with the revolvers I chose offer some of the least satisfying gunplay I've seen in years irrespective of the stuttering.  I made it through a bad tutorial with timers for each section so you have to wait even after you've completed the objective, and a few of the levels, but when I go back to the customization and find EVERYTHING I had access to on first launch is now locked behind large exp and currency requirements, and simply entering that menu reset my character to defaults even though it stuck fine prior during the first few levels.  Judging by how the movement operates, and the hitching (almost outright freezing at times) during mouse camera movement, I have a feeling this was designed for controller despite having seemingly functional key rebinding. I'd whip out a controller and try it, but honestly f*k that, there's no way I'd want to play a 3rd-person shooter without mouse aim, so there's no point.  I remember seeing this 4 years ago during their Kickstarter campaign, and then again last year when Jim Sterling covered the first builds. The only thing I can see that has changed since is the effect when the 'mayhem level' increases, that and there's no insane stuttering likely because he used a controller. The original pitch and concept art was absolutely superb... interesting classes and abilities, fantastic style, color choice, and atmosphere... this 'released' game (minus the amount of customization options and the visuals) is as if it's still in the programming stage before even pre-Alpha, before core gameplay has been established.  It's so disappointing it's painful... so imagine how the Kickstarter backers feel about the state of this, and the fact that I just got the game and it's DLC for free from their Alienware promotion, and not the $8.29 they just sold it for in the sale two weeks ago, or the $15 they charged  4 years ago  on Kickstarter.

50	  Honestly, this game is awful. I won't be playing this again anytime soon.
51	  Do NOT play this game atm. It's very bad.
52	  It's really meh. A brawler game for kids, with very little content. Like 4 animated models grand total, plus some generic assets, set on a tiny map.
53	  what's the different between boy and girl again?  - no difference between highest and lowest settings - often crashed/lag for unknown reasons
54	  Not worth the price tag at all, they basically tried to sell a $2-$5 CDN game for $10.99 CDN. If on sale for cheap and you want to play a left 4 dead style game with a store using in game currancy without micro transactions thats pretty easy to get, and is somewhat challanging with 3d cartoonish graphics go ahead. But not worth the full price.
55	  Recieved for free through Alienware.  In the game's current state I could only play the training level... Literally, there was no way to play any maps after that to see if tere was a plot or otherwise, as opposed to just running around a single yard bashing zombied while being told the goal is to bash zombies in certain ways.
56	This game is not finished. The controls are janky. The graphics are unpolished. The physics are jarring. The levels are repetitive baseball bats to the face of nearly harmless zombies.  The concept was cool, which is why I backed it on Kickstarter years ago. Unfortunately, this game is just thatâa cool idea with no execution.
57	Kickstarter backer. Watched the game get passed to a different team. Since then we've seen very few updates (even less meaningful).  It's somewhat sickening that this game no longer has an Early Access tag... it clearly fits the criteria.   There is one map. It's somewhat large, but one map is one map. Mobs are bare-bones. Barely have textures. They all look the same once you start playing.  The two classes only control differently under the hood. Skills and such. Movement and combat are completely the same regardless of what you choose.   There's a lot of cosmetics, but the vast majority are simply retextures of say ten or so different models.  There are different modes, but they all just seem like placeholder junk. Kill X amount of mobs. Kill the boss. Explore the school. They're all pretty boring, and mindless.   The game feels unfinished because it IS unfinished. The original developers talked about this fantastic experience that 'all kids dreamed of'. What we've got here is a dry, hallowed out version of that. There seems to be a resident developer roaming the forums, but updates are very few and far between. I have doubts that he/she is actually part of the dev team, and may just be assigned as such because of his ties to the game.   It's a shame that I can't really think of any other game for you to get if this kind of thing appeals to you, but I really can't recommend this unfinished beta product to anybody. Especially not at the pricetag listed.
58	  I thought this game would be good but it ended up being terrible. The characters you play as are suppose to be kids but in reality they look like 40 year old pedophiles. The weapons are weak as â¥â¥â¥â¥ against the zombies, a gun is suppose to do more damage not a plastic â¥â¥â¥â¥ing baseball bat. The customization in this game is terrible too. It is fun, but I do not recommend buying it. It is more like an alpha to be honest...

61	  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  UPDATES: The last update for this game was OVER a year ago! Developers since then did not post an update.  PLAYERBASE: The game during its release has never reached 2 average players. I sat in the lobby for 10 minutes attempting to find a game. Alienware is still hosting a giveaway which started 23 days ago and yet the game still has not seen over an average of 4 players.  http://steamcharts.com/app/215550#All    TL;DR - Game is dead, developers left it, and the game gets redundant after 2 minutes.

85	  DO NOT BUY!! it's THE worst game i've played that has come from steam and dear jezus...the controls are atrocious the framerate is terrible (on my system it didn't matter whether it was on the highest settings or lowest it had terrible frame rate dips and never went above 30 as i'm assuming it's locked to it) i got this game FOR FREE and i'm honestly wishing that no one EVER notices it's on my record...if you're dumb enough to spend ten bucks on this i feel bad for you
86	  This is one of the worst pieces of garbage i have ever played in my entire life. My steam account consists of more than 500 games, 300 of which i can say are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. This trumps all of them in one fell swoop. Me and a friend of mine played together since we got it for free on alienware arena. We were the only two playing at all this week. Would not reccomend. 
87	 Early Access Review
88	I'm editing my previous review out of newfound spite for this game.  My previous review stated that I would recommend this game with a fantasticly placed and thought out 'na'  Seeing the development of the game, I would like to reconsider my absolutely awful review and say that my review clearly stated the quality, time and care that the developers put into this mess of a game.   Basically, don't waste your time; the game is NOT done and NEVER will be. You will probably have better fun burning paper and stapling yourself in the face, and you won't have to pay for that.   I refuse to mention any of the gameplay because, there simply is none.
89	Perfect gift for all your Christian friends.
90	First off, I really wanted to like this game. The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing.  Unfortunately, the product that the trailers, the game descriptions and even other reviews prepared me for was not the product I got. I expected a demonic sandbox chock full of whimsically creative murder. Instead, I got a mediocre Hitman clone with exactly one (absurdly specific) solution for each murder.  The game teases you with all of these awesome powers straight out of The Omen: telekinesis, mind control, pyromancy. But you can really only use them when the game feels like it.  I would be fine with the restrictions on your mayhem if the game provided some semblance of direction. Instead, you're left to aimlessly wander the game's massive mansion, searching for the tiny, sometimes pixel-perfect item you need to proceed.  The best example of my frustration was a mission where you had to off your family's beloved butler.   (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS) (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS) (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)  The in-game prompt informs you that it's winter, and it would be a terrible shame if the ancient old goof slipped and fell.   Alright, fair enough -- I probably have to create some ice, huh, Lucius? Let me just grab one of the dozens of interactive cups dotting the mansion, and we'll be off.   Wait, what's that? I can't use any of the cups on the sink? Well, then... how am I supposed to get water, bro? Oh, you mean I need a water bottle, because that's 'less suspicious?' Okay, fine... Are you gonna maybe give me a hint about which of the mansion's 20+ rooms would be a good place to start? No? Great...  So, the kitchen then? Nope! The servants' quarters? As if! My bedroom, you say? Oh, you've gotta be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me, Lucius. It's in my bedroom? The very start of the level, which you purposely led me away from via the in-game objective marker? The furthest possible point from where you gave me my mission objective? Fine, Lucius. Fine. I'll go get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing water bottle.  Now I've probably got to just dump it on the ground by the doorway the butler's sure to walk through while attending to the Christmas lights, right? Oh, that's not right? Of course it isn't, Lucius. Of course it isn't. Instead, I've got to find the one incredibly tiny spot in the middle of the courtyard (the mansion's biggest room) where you want me to put it, don't I? Whatever, Lucius. I don't care enough anymore.  Oh, now the butler's taking his sweet time coming outside, huh? Not like he's supposed to be attending to the family during Christmas dinner or anything. Can I just wait for him to have a stroke, Lucius? No, that would be too easy. I'm guessing from your minimal exposition that I'm supposed to tamper with the Christmas lights to get his attention, huh? Fine, let's get to tampering.  Naturally, I assume you won't let me use my telekinesis to pull down the lights. That would be too easy. And also fun. Too much fun for your liking, Lucius. So, what then? Do I need to find some misplaced tool in the farthest wing, only to backtrack to the fuse-box in the next room and fry the circuit breaker? That seems like something you would do, Lucius.   Don't argue with me -- it absolutely does sound like you, Lucius. Okay, fine then -- what do I have to do, buddy?  Ahh.... I have to turn off the Christmas Lights via a barely visible light-switch? In fairness, that's also just so you Lucius. So completely you.   There. I turned off the light-switch and now the butler's coming out. Oh, good! He slipped and fell! But, wait... he's still alive! So, I've got to finish him off... Oh, now you let me use my telekinesis, Lucius? Finally, when it's too late to matter?  You truly are a generous god, Lucius... 
91	Once upon a time there was a little boy called Lucius. He loved his bicycle, his cute teddy bear notebook and bizarre murders, you know like beheading a guy with a grass cutter. Do you really wanna know what's next? Did he make his father proud? Did anyone survive being under one roof with him? How many photos does it take to get a perfect picture of a naked uncle? Just play and you will find out.
92	Burnt some guys face off, killed a bunch of other people, worshipped Satan, came home and played Lucius. Its pretty good
93	Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.  'Lucius' is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there. I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.   Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first 'Lucius' to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.  'Lucius' has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing 'good boy' status by doing mundane chores around the house. My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though.
94	'It's like Hitman with Lucifer' - IGN  I rate it 666/13 would hail Satan again.
95	Lucius is a game for those who enjoy (somewhat) brutally murdering members of their household in the form of a 6-year-old son of Satan. The graphics are fairly well done (in my opinion) and you have the option to customise the controls to suit you. As for the voice acting, there's not much to say. They did a good job and they worked well in the games setting. My only real issue (though it isn't much of one) would be the lack of an option to save. If you got caught, you had to start the level (next murder, they appear to save after each one) from the beginning which can be a hassle if your PC dies on you or you need to attend urgent business. Overall, I'd say it's a decent and well-done game by Shiver that I suggest buying if you like bloodshed as there can be some pretty surprising and nasty deaths along the line, all organised by one little boy. Lucius.
96	I really can't recommend this game much (maybe with exception of buying it for a very very low price). There is so much of unused potential it is sad. The basic idea is great but the execution is sadly lacking in almost every way.  You could think that in Lucius you will be placed in an open playground that lets you experiment with using environment for your intentions while there will be dynamic reaction of other people on your actions. But that is completely wrong. Instead of that you are forced to kill your victims in one and only exact fashion. No place for creativity or multiple ways to do that.  And the game is so unpolished. There is a load of bugs and glitches from the smaller (items in characters hands tend to move awkwardly during cutscenes) to really problematic (that can force you to repeat the whole mission). I can overlook some problems but there are just to many of them to be such benevolent with Lucius.  Also the core gameplay mechanics are poorly designed. For example you have paranormal abilities which you can use to manipulate others. To use them you have to switch to them...but then you can't use anything (open doors, search through drawers etc.) as that is also a separate ability. Or later in game you get a chance to conjure fireballs but when you begin to cast them the effect will cover your sight and you will not see what's ahead of you. There are also some 'stealth' missions where you are forced to do them over and over again (and there are really long loadings) until you learn how to go through them step by step.  Well, Lucius is not a good game. But it is not so horrible as it can sound from my words either. The story is actually ok, the slowly deteriorating mental state of your family is for the most parts well done and the voice acting is nice. But the game has so many gameplay issues, bugs and other things. Also the replayability is almost none.
97	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269351837   Lucius is a third person puzzle/adventure game at heart while being about an antichrist who doesnât talk, and tries to kill off his family to sell their souls for power.    Gameplay
98	Why are everyone complaining about graphics? I'd say this game is 7,5/10  Why?  + There's porn. + You're the evil child you've always wanted to become + You can use anything (sort of) just to kill them + Did I say there's porn?   - A lil bit glitchy when you use Telekinesis - The map is poorly done   You feel evil playing this game and enjoy it at certain times, so yeah I'd recommend you to get but 75% off.  Lack of Xbox 360 controller support, but nothing a mouse also a keyboard can't handle.  So, go fulfill your evil needs playing as a Satan spawn!
99	I totally owe this game a nice review.  No, I really do not approve of lil kids being possessed murderers, but this game is somehow compelling! I wasn`t searching for guides  or walktroughs, so it stroke me slowly in time - I will take care of every single one of them, one by one.    Even my ... oh my!!     So in this emotional state, you somehow need to loose your humanity  and try to focus on the FUN parts /there are plenty,  like the TRICYCLE, changing weather, some achievements, the way you need to listen,  watch and follow clues, the automatic innocent status, because you are supposed to be a little ANGEL not a little devil.. they will find out too late..  The atmosphere can satisfy your darker tastes, actually  the whole game does it. Give it a try :) Just don`t try any of it at home!! :D
100	Just finished Lucius, took me around 5 hours, and got 41 of 58 achievements.  Overall it's a pretty interesting game, you play a Lucius a 7 year old boy who lives in a mansion with his family and many maids, butlers and handymen who are under your fathers employ, except he's not your actually father, Satan is, you are the spawn of Satan who has been tasked with gather souls for your real father to acquire various powers like telekinesis, mind control and combustion. The games premise is just that, kill everyone for Satan, expect the ways you have to go about doing so are quite different and unique, the main gameplay mechanics feel like a mix between classic Hitman trial and error with it's environmental deaths. Where combining found items with environmental hazards usually result in a entertaining death cutscene and no suspicioun cast upon Lucius.  Now the story isn't great, the voice acting is hammy and weirdly paced making it sound like sentences are being stitched together from totally different actors and the animations aren't detailed either. Some of the characters are interesting enough, for example Lucius' grandfather is a hard man who has something to hide and his motives are shown throughout the game and give an interesting look on the family's rise to power and occult ties. The mother slowly losing her mind lead to some interesting ambient dialogue like her asking Lucius to brush his teeth in a loving tone then immediately telling him to bug off because he's creeping her out, it's more than likely a bug but humorous none the less. As far as visuals are concerned, they're entirely fine for the most part, there are moment's when the game can be quite beautiful and others when it looks like a scene from a cut Deadly Premonition level.   The flow they achieve between making the game challenging but not making it frustrating looking for obscure items and solutions to problems are troubling, far too often I had to look up a FAQ on what obscure non related item I needed to complete a task that could have been simply completed another, far simpler way. That also brings out how the limited the game actually is in it's structure and openness to the player, Dante's Mansion, the games only location, is large and sprawling with countless rooms and corridors but most aren't used frequently or at all.  As a closing thought, I did really enjoy the game, the absurdity of the kills and the way the narrative tries to justify 20 deaths in one house as accidents so the detective working the cases doesn't have to call the FBI, is dumb fun, and entertaining. I would recommend anyone who is a fan of the older Hitman games and likes using the environment to kill hapless victims to try this game out, you mind fun for a good weekend of kill all for the glory of old pop Satan.  + Environmental kills are fun and interesting + Graphics are nice in spots and the location is mostly well designed + Interesting idea and premise + Powers can lead to interesting gameplay mechanics  - Story is a little dumb, and stretches the players disbelief far - Voice action and animations are lackluster - Puzzles/Kills can be far too obtuse and can lead to frustration - Limited in it's scope and options to the player  7.5 out of 10
101	If Hitman had a son that son was the Anti-Christ, that son whould be Lucius. Luicius is a strange yet original game: it mix the old point and click with a small 3D open world. Your quest is to kill everyone in the house, 'cause you need human sacriface for your daddy, some guy who work in the 'underground'. If you want to be a hero, and not a villian, this is not the game for you.  The story isn't bad at all, its actually pretty nice. Sure, it takes some forced ways into the story, and you clearly see them, but they won't bother you much. At least, it didn't bother me, it actually made the game much more interesting.  The ending isn't also bad, but it left me with a feel of uncompletionist. Probably was too fast.  The gameplay works fine: you have to collect items around the house to complete goals to kill people and make the homicides looks like accidents. Sadly the difficulty goes to insanely hard that 'I don't even know what to do' to 'this is so easy that even a 6 years old kid whould do that'. Did I mention you're a 6 years old kid?  The music it's pretty fitting, but it gets repetive real soon. And expecially sometimes it bugs out, like it disappear or change theme out of nowhere and you don't know what's goin on, even tho' nothing is goin on.  The graphic its 'meh': there ain't no good facial expression, and the lip sinc its all broken, but for some reason, the ambiance looks awesome, and the gore works fine.  It seems the creator couldn't put in some good face flexes.  I've encounter some bugs and glitch along the game, and sometimes they made me restart the mission. For exemple, I opened the journal during a cutscene, and the game freeze. Couldn't move. Or in a cutscene, I was riding the tricicle before that happened, and Lucius was flying around. (this picture might contain SPOILERS)  http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/579027346723227969/8889A751021635A9C4A9E9FBBE99D46D33B78408/   Final Score: 6.5/10  Overall, the game its fun, not too long (around 6-7 hours of gameplay) but it's a nice title. Maybe 20â¬ can be a little too much for it, I suggest to get it around 5â¬ like I did.
102	It is so twisted :')  Prepare to see a lot of messed up scripted deaths, and a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up things like naked maids. Chodes and a perverted kid. All the reason to buy it :)
103	This game gave me nightmares and herpes for 40 hours.
104	Officer McStuffins is the worst cop in the history of all cops ever.
105	  Nice game with a good story. Killing all those people in all those different ways was a lot of fun, but it's a bit too limited in that area: each person can only be killed in a single specific way, so there's no room for creativity, although that kind of makes each death a bit more meaningful. There are 2 messed up achievements though: you have to play the game for 20 and 40 hours. It has zero replayability and can be beaten in less than 10 hours, but sure, I'll definitely play it for 40 hours.
106	Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.  Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.  The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.  For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.  If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say 'delightfully twisted.' It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.
107	Lucius - This game is good, its not the best though. I'd only buy it if it was on sale.  This game is very entertaining to play, the different death's throughout the game are quite good, however I think this game would be better if you could decide how to kill each person yourself. Like if you had several choices of how to kill each person.  I think the different powers you get when playing are okay, but I think they might have been a bit pointless for some parts since you barely use one or two of them. But that's my opinion I guess.   I do recommend this game, its a real time killer if your waiting for a better game to download or something, haha! Just buy it when its on sale, Â£14.99 is a bit much for a game that is only about 4-5 hours of gameplay.
108	It feels really good to be the bad guy once in a while, and it feels even better to be the one who scares and not the one who gets scared in an 'horror' game
109	Despite its ups and downs, I think overall itâs a good game. If you just remember that it is a game and it would have been really difficult to give it the kind of freedom you might have been expecting, that is.   (I tried to keep this one fairly short but alas, that just didnât happen. Prepare your attention span!)  I meant the above in the sense that this game tries to give you an âopenâ feeling to it, as if itâs not linear and you are wreaking havoc at your own expense. But when you get down to it, it is linear. Itâs quite closed and itâs more of an organised chaos then just plain olâ chaos. Given that, itâs still a very enjoyable game. I would consider this game still quite indie, so that makes me think even more that for what resources they had or what they were capable of with a small team, they pulled off a really decent game.  Because of how the gameplay is laid out, each chapter youâre given a new target and in ways it kind of felt like more of a puzzle to figure out what you had to do with them rather then you plotting your own devilish plan. Which I still found quite fun.   There was a few times I really had no idea what I was supposed to do. Especially at the beginning when you get past the early stages of the game where parts of the house are blocked off and you canât roam around as much. When the game stopped leading me to where and what I was supposed to do and I was finally able to access the whole house, I wasnât sure on how it was supposed to work. Can I pick them off in any order, do I have to do them in an order and if so, what is the order, or what? Well, after wondering around for a long time completing chores of which I wasnât sure of why I was doing either, I finally figured it all out.  So, if you get something similar Iâd just say stick with it, it all becomes clear as you go. My state of confusion didnât last too long and in all honesty I can be dumb as hell sometimes.   In terms of story it was interesting. I wasnât really sure of where they were going with it or how the whole thing was going to conclude but I was eager to find out. Itâs nothing too profound or life changing but it was definitely not predictable or disappointing.   The English voice acting in this game is a little cringe worthy at times. Itâs not horrifically bad but you can tell there is no Academy Award winners amongst the lot. The worst in my opinion being the stereotypically drunk Irish janitor.  With that said, I donât think this game is primarily English. So I can see how the English voice acting might be a little lacked if they were focused mainly on another language.   Moving onto graphics. The graphics are pretty decent and I think I would say that âscenery and general surroundingsâ-wise is where its strengths are at. The AI and character models however are not the best. I got a very âGarryâs Mod videos before Valve Source Filmmakerâ feeling off of it at times. I might be over exaggerating a bit there. I think itâs just the expressions and slight glitches to the models that gave me that feeling. The AI is very robotic, the characters wonder around the house replaying a laid out routine (which I guess they have to on some level, seeing as certain characters need to be âluredâ to a certain place and you can only do that by waiting for them to lap back around to where you need them). They also shout the same sets of dialog at you whenever you get within a certain radius of them (doesnât even matter if thereâs a wall between you, you WILL get yelled at through walls).  Just to moan about the characters that tad bit more and bore you all to death when itâs not really necessary because I actually like the game, I am going to mention the lack ofâ¦ wellâ¦ characterâ¦ that I felt from our little man Lucius.  This isnât something that bothered me all that much but I thought it worth mentioning.  I love the concept of playing as a slightly younger character. âAmong the Sleepâ Is what Iâm going to be comparing to. Among the Sleep was a game where you played as a toddler and the child like mannerisms and little gestures and what not in that game really impressed me. You walk, talk and generally act like a toddler. You run too fast? Youâre poor little baby self will fall over.  Maybe this wasnât the best comparison to use seeing as the obvious age difference with the two characters in the two games. A 2 year old Vs. a 6 year old is hardly the same. But I kind of felt that the fact Lucius is so young and therefore it being so disturbing him being so sadistic, wasnât emphasised enough. I kind of felt like I was just playing as a midget adult. Which, I guess you could argue he isnât like a child at all and maybe that is the point? But, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if Lucius had more âdemon childâ like characteristics. Especially given that your character doesnât speak, mute characters usually need something to show their character in others ways then just talking. Or maybe I am just over analysing!  In terms of achievements this one is very doable. I played through the whole game and ended up going back for some achievements (which is easy to do seeing as there is a chapter select included). Iâm currently at 97% and in honesty the last two I need are baffling as too why theyâd even add them in. The last two are for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours. Now, Iâd say I must have played through the game one and a half times. With that Iâm at 9 hours at the moment. Now, with some simple maths you can obviously see that youâd need to play the game a nonsensically amount of times to actually get the 40 hour achievement. I know itâs titled âIâm addictedâ but I think Iâd actually feel genuinely worried for anyone that played a game about a demon child murdering people that many times. I think Iâll just idle for these last two! Other than that though, itâs an easy 100%.  EDIT: I have found that with the two last achievements, you cannot idle the game on the menu screen! You actually have to be in the game for it to work! (Hence why I have 72 hours on record, not just the 40 I need. Took me a while to notice it wasnât working) I thought this was worth mentioning for any achievement hunters out there.  All in all, despite me moaning and droning on about certain things, I would say this game is great and well worth a try. Itâs something a bit different and unique. It also has a sequel of which I think Iâm definitely going to be trying out. If youâre looking for something fun and mischievous to play then this one is a good place to start. Overall I got a very positive feeling off of this one.   TL;DR: Quite linear, interesting story, kind of cringe English voice acting, decent graphics, alright characters, an easy 100% and generally a lot of fun. Definitely try it if youâre looking for a bit of mischievous fun.
110	Want to learn to kill people easily?  Want to know the secrets of a killer?  Want to spend a great time, playing something really good, considering, you are not too sensitive?  Play Lucius, you'll enjoy the game, for sure.
111	The game has quite a bit of cool aspects that I listed in pros. Ultimately I got bored and was not as entertained enough by the aesthetics to continue running around the mansion in search of items to use. I do not play this type of game frequently. I lost interest after a few hours of playing. I may pick it up again in the future.   Pros: -The story is interesting -The graphics are decent -The gameplay is fine -Neat secret rooms -Worth the price i paid ($ 5-10?) for the time it held my attention. -A good story unfolds as you advance and you get neat abilities  Cons: -Conitnuously walking around the house to find items that aren't explicitly/implicitly obvious or close by. This may cause you to walk around aimlessly for a while getting absolutely nowhere.. (or I am just not good at it.) -The time it takes to find items caused me to lose interest 
112	Game is incedibly unstable. It will slowdown and then crash if you break too many bottles. Did I mention there's an achievement for breaking bottles?  There's no manual save, so when the game crashes, you'll lose a lot of progress.  It controls poorly and perhaps worst of all, simply isn't all that fun. I can't recomend it.  EDIT: I've since finished the game and have softened a bit on it. The executions are creative if not necesaryily logical and the plot is coherent if unimaginative.   Between the instability and less than stellar gameplay, I still can't recommend it. It's the poster child of good idea, poor execution.  But if you get the game for free, and you're a fan of the Hitman series or hidden object games, it's worth a playthrough if you can get past the bugs.  Edit 2: And for you achievment hunters out there, Lucius has 2 time based acheivements. Play for 20 and for 40 hours. However, this game only takes about 10 hours to complete and that's if you're really taking your time. Each mission only has one way to solve it so the game has no replayability and the achievements force idling, but here's the kicker. Lucius can't even idle properly. If you alt+tab the window it doesn't count. Being at the menu doesn't count. You have to be in-game with the window in the foreground.  Yea.
113	definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard. I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only 'redeeming' characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.
114	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
115	Such an interesting concept, but such a poorly done product.  Pro: 1, interesting and immersive setting 2, quite a novel experience 3, nice Artwork (Skins, Landscape change with season, ...) 4, NPC development - distress grows as the game proceeds 5, sidequests (chores)  Contra: 1, the main character should depict a reckless, evil child - but no mimicry at all seems like a puppet -&gt; immersion lost 2, only one (two max) sentences per person per chapter, quite repetitive 3, clipping errors, items vanishing after telekinesis 4, some random audio artefacts (could be hw related) 5, powers should increase each chapter, but you only use them in the most basic form - no real progression 6, single solution problems - no replay value or deviation from plot 7, strange quest updates. like getting the pistol early requires you to retrace the steps to open the safe again (which is empty of course) 8, no saving between chapters   A bit more freedom, less plotholes and the sequel could be great.
116	Simulator of little killer. If real father is devil, why boy can not kill everybody? Daddy gives to him supernatural powers and he starts to kill from buttlers to family. One map - his house, in which so many cruel deaths. But only one thing is unintelligible - why nobody wanted to be fired after 3-5 accidents in the dangerous place, or they just did not have choice. 8,3/10
117	I was actaully pretty excited about this game so maybe I went into it with higher expectations than what I should have had.  All in all, it was a good buy for the summer sale; I got it really cheap (like $5 or something like that?). It's a fun concept and the progression with the powers seem nifty, but it's mostly the side quests that put me off. If they had a better tracking system for side quests, it would be a bit more fun, but they expect you to navigate a house you have no idea how to navigate. The only help you get is a map that only shows the direction of the main quest, but if you want to do any of the additional quests (which I did), you have to look up guides on how to find things, otherwise your'e scouring an enormous mansion without any direction or hint on where to look.  I don't have a problem doing the chores, but they need to give you a hint on where to find things - even if it's just a little one. You're either spending too much time trudging around the house looking for things, or you're looking it up online.  The voice acting and facial animations are poorly done. That's not TOO important for me, but it was a bit distracting from the cut scene.
118	Unfortunately, a game that looked so promising, turned out to be far from that. Lucius is a very simplistic point and click game that offers very little immersion, gameplay or anything else. The puzzles are mundane, if you can call them puzzles. You can complete the story in maybe 2 or 3 hours, if you can stand it for that long. The game offers no replayability and there are quite a lot of bugs around.  Avoid.
119	 The Devil is in the details
120	I've seen some reviews mentioning this game was some kind of killing sandbox.  This thing is completelly linear, annoying and unrewarding. Keeps you seeking random items in random places of a terribly designed mansion for kills that are too simple.
121	TL;DR: If you want a buggy satanic open-world-ish puzzle game,this might be the one for you,if it was cheaper.  This game is short and buggy.It didn't feel like a satanic murderer sandbox,like most reviews and curators have said,but rather a game that would belong to the puzzle genere.I,myself,have experienced quite a few (maybe a lot more than just a few) bugs trough my 2 times finishing the story.The one that bothered me the most was journal entries literally not appearing no matter what I done.My ouja board was the only thing that helped me commit the murders.They would all at once pop up only after I killed the person,and of course I had to use a walkthrough at certain points,even if it is not a thing I normally do.The other annoying bug was Lucius getting stuck in the ground in certain points of Dante Manor,making me restart the chapter.Kristen Stewart has MORE facial expressions than the main character,that doesn't really even look like a 6 year old,and this logic really ruined the immersion for me-basically,in that manor of rich and respectable people he was the only main character that dressed in a suit.A 6 year old.Not his dad,not the detective that tries to catch you,not his mom,only his grandfather if I'm not mistaken.The other bugs I was talking about were visible but not always ruining the gameplay,things like models becoming colourless,glitching out,etc.And the only thing I found is to blame were lazy developers,for even grammar is not correct sometimes,usually in the MAIN CUTSCENES.The Dante Manor,the place where the action of the game happens is also pretty repetitive itself,having two mirrored parts,only with different room layouts,giving the big bad house a repetitive feeling,and even despite it's maze like corridors,trust me,that layout is so simple you'll don't need the map anymore from chapter 6 onwards.The hitbox of your final spell 'Combustion' is very rough and not tweaked for individual models,it can only hit the chest I think,nothing will happen if you set someone's hand or foot on fire (so real).The turn-the-crosses-upside-down system is a bit cheesy,or cliche,whatever you want to call it.And if you may want an explanation to my 40 hours of playing it,I left it open,because there is an achievement where you need to play 40 hours,and as the other are really easy,with 3 quarters of them you have completed before you know it,it would be a shame to now make this one a perfect game...hell,even Dark Souls achievements are less annoying than leaving this damn game open 40 hours.
122	I can't really say it's bad.. but.. not enough hints, poor graphics, no possibility to choose how to kill.. if taken on sale ok though.. The main idea is very interesting, but i had to check on the net how to do some murders because i really had no clue.. 5.5/10

124	 tl;dr -&gt; In Lucius you play as an anti-social devil child who must kill different people in graphicto satisfy your father, Satan. Think Hitman, but if you were a satan-spawn and had much more restricted, linear gameplay.   First off, I want to make clear the fact that I really enjoyed the game and played it to completion, however, I have a very specific reason why I have given a 'do not recommend' rating - which will be explained below. Suffice it to say that I do not support certain types of developer behavior/gameplay mechanics when playing games.  I had the pleasure of having this game gifted to me by one of my very generous friends, and he wanted me to review it once I had a chance to play. Thanks again!   If you enjoy devil/demonic themes, graphic violence and death scenes, and being the son of Satan, than you will enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are good - the detail in the character models and background (ex: rooms of the mansion) are well-done. The music and sounds are good, and the BGM really matches the gameplay and themes - adding to the atmosphere set by the game. The story is okay, but nothing too fancy - you are a demonic child and must kill people to satisfy your father, the devil.   The controls are simple and easy to learn - the tutorials are always quick and helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, the most difficult aspect of the game is probably figuring out the specific ways to kill your targets. To remedy this, you can unlock the music box, which is infused by Satan and will show you 'hints' whenever you activate it. In order to unlock this useful item, you must complete almost all (you can miss/ignore one) available chores in the game. Examples include throwing out the garbage, cleaning your room, and finding your mom's missing earings.  Overall, the gameplay is decent - each chapter requires you to kill someone in your mansion. Admittedly, the regular mansion setting may become boring, however, the game compensates for this by progressively unlocking more parts of the house to be accessible. When you begin a chapter, both your map and journal will help direct you to your target. Usually, you will be given good hints in your journal regarding the next steps to kill your targets. Again, if you find yourself having trouble, work to finish off your chores so you can unlock the music box.   As a devil child, crosses weaken your powers, so you must turn any crosses upside down to negate their effects. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new powers, like telekinesis, mind-erase, and combustion. Tutorials are provided by Satan whenever you receive new abilities. You can fail chapters by revealing yourself - which occurs if you use your powers (primarily telekinesis) within sight of others. Something I liked about the game is how you can do things that make subsequent missions much easier - usually by reducing time. For example, if you like exploring and picking up all available items, you will probably pick up an item that will allow you to progress through a future mission without having to double-back into the house. The house is fairly large, and the map helps a lot in orienting yourself with the landscape.  At the end of the game, you    have one of two routes to select, which changes the type of boss battles you face - I don't believe this changes the ending   . The ending is a bit anti-climatic, but the overall journey and cutscenes are pretty good. A number of the death scenes are fairly graphic, so that is something to be aware of if you are particularly squeamish. There are 20 chapters, allowing for a variety of death types and related puzzles. There is also a    peeping tom segment where you watch a maid taking a bath (you see breasts and some bush)   .  For achievement hunters, achieving 100% is not that difficult, however, there are two extremely ridiculous achievements - one requiring 20 and the other 40 hours of playtime. Note that this DOES NOT mean idling time, but actual game playtime. From what I've read and experienced, you cannot leave the game running with the menu on, or even stand straight. Some people like to have the W (forward) key held down so the character is always walking. Another silly achievement is cycling (unlocked by doing chores) for x miles because the achievement for sprinting x miles can be completed within one or two playthroughs. I have a big problem with this style of achievements because it is essentially gametime mining - and I absolutely HATE artificial-game-lengtheners. If you take your time with the game and do two playthroughs to    try both ending routes, when you could just as easily load the chapter and select the other option   , you could PROBABLY stretch the gameplay to ~10 hours.   The two achievements require 20 and 40 NON-IDLING hours. I find that absolutely ridiculous, given the amount of time it takes to complete the game. As an avid game reviewer, I just cannot accept or support this type of behavior. If these achievements were removed, or reduced to reasonable hours, then I would immediately switch my 'do not recommend' to 'recommend.' Even if you are not an achievement junkie, I cannot encourage this type of gametime farming - because I know there are always people willing to 100% complete a game.   If you like role-playing as the son of Satan, wrecking havoc on your family household in the name of evil, then give this game a try.   Recommend, but DO NOT support stupid game design practices as seen in the achievements.  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews 
125	I got this game as a gift, and oh boy I'm so happy about it.   The game's concept is simply amazing. You are pretty much the antichrist as a child and you kill people to please Lucifer and get stronger whilst not letting people find out about your real identity. The game is set up on a huge victorian-style mansion, with a lot of rooms to explore and designed in a way that it doesn't feel repetitive or confusing at all.   The gameplay  kind of mixes a sleath-ish style with an old-school game where you have to really search the rooms, collect objects and use them intelligently to complete each chapter. In fact, this game reminds me a lot of older games in the sense that it looks rather rough but presents an amazing gameplay experience.   The soundtrack  and voice acting were rather bad. The voice acting seems to be rather desynced with the model's mouth movements. It really seems as if the game was poorly dubbed from another language other than english. The soundtrack is rather repetitive and very uninspiring.   The achievements  are the best part of this game. They are rather easy to get but can be missed if the player doesn't pay attention. The only bad achievements are the 'I like this game' and 'I am addicted' ones, that the devs added to try to stretch the gameplay time. Fortunately there is a guide that teaches a method to work around them.  Overall this is an amazing game that is very underrated. You should probably buy it.
126	Lucius was a cheesy horror B movie style game. It follows somewhat in line with the story of the movie Omen. Youâre a child whoâs been possessed by the devil and given powers to murder people. Itâs a pretty straight forward game with not much difficulty to it.  It was a decent game to play which had some funny and cool death scenes. It does have a slight challenge of trying to figure out what you need and how to kill your target. Itâs all based in and around the house you live in.  Controls were a little wonky but do their job. I even setup my own configuration with the steam controller which worked out pretty good. Only issues I had with it were movement on the bike you can get for Lucius to ride around on.   Graphics werenât bad just looked like something from years back. They get the job done and thatâs all that really matters when playing a game. The look on Luciusâs face was a little disturbing.  Overall it wasnât a bad game to play. Itâs pretty straightforward and not very hard to complete. You can get most of the achievements from pretty much just playing the game. Give it a try sometime as it should be easy to find a cheap copy floating around as itâs been bundled before and I think even given away for free.
127	Meh, I have mixed feelings about the game. As much as I feel playing as the Son of The Devil, I cannot stop feeling this game is a little bit boring, after some of the few chapters. What makes it playable is the killings, and the end is climatic as Hell.  Get in on a sale day - itÂ´s a game to play and finish during a weekendÂ´s time, if you are into satanic stuff or if you despise the Abrahamic religions.
128	I can really only recommend this game if you get real cheap (right now it's 90% off and thus $2 making it worth it), but since the normal price is $20 I can't recommend this game. The reason I was interested in this game is because of the obvious: you're the son of the devil and you kill people. However the story doesn't really go beyond this (just the brief musings of the detective at the end of a chapter). You barely, if at all, get to know any of the people before you kill them. When there's no personality or character development with the characters then there's nothing felt when you kill them. I could forgive this if the ways that you setup the deaths of people weren't the very definition of linear. This too could be forgiven except the steps you take to setup the deaths are also very unintuitive. They aren't even puzzles; it's just a process of figuring out what weird way the developers want you to setup the next person's death. There's almost no thought or intelligence involved on your part.  Another thing I was interested in, like most people I'm sure, are the deaths themselves. Considering this game was supposed to have earned an AO for Adults Only rating from the ESRB (refused to avoid complications with release) I was a little disappointed. A couple of them are gruesome sure, but they've got nothing on some of the fatalities in the Mortal Kombat games (which are rated M for Mature). There is a kill that Lucius himself gets to personally make, but I was highly disappointed when we don't actually get to see Lucius do it. One minute he's standing there, and we know what he's about to do, but the next he's done it and we saw nothing. Boo!  You are slowly given 5 different powers to make these deaths happen. They can also level up in power when you make a new kill. Only problem is the concept of leveling them up is absolutely pointless because there's only 1 way to setup the death of a person and you are always at the right power level to do it. You don't get to use certain powers when you think you could either, because again there's only 1 way to make the deaths happen.  Pros: +Voice acting was decent or better, especially Lucifer's. +The basic concept.  Neutral: +-A couple of the deaths are cool. Most are forgettable. +-It's pretty easy to get lost; a minimap would've been nice. At least there is a map and a marker telling you where your kill target is located.  Cons: -The story lacks any depth beyond the obvious, and the characters themselves are given no time to develop or have much of a personality so that when they do die we the players don't care one way or the other. -Figuring out what to do next is part luck and part tedious searching of rooms and objects to find the right thing to interact with. -Completely linear death setups that don't allow creativity of your mind powers or anything else. -Mind powers have no depth despite being able to level up. -The graphics are pretty poor. Could be forgiven but the animations are also lacking which doesn't help the already lifeless characters.  Despite all this I am interested in the sequel and the promise that it corrects some of the issues here like linear deaths.
129	The Devil  literally  made me do it.
130	This Game was so awesome.I can't imagined what was in product mind when he start release this game.This child is so demonic.I finish this game and the final verdicted is:I waiting for Lucius 2 ((:
131	Lucius is a third person adventure puzzler where you basically play as the kid from The Omen. You are the son of the devil and are out to kill everyone by figuring out how to use your environment and use your demonic powers, without getting caught.  The graphics are good for what it does, and the gameplay is satisfying. It also has some really gruesome death scenes. Characters act like people, they slowly grow more and more tense as their world gets worse.  Recommended for fans of horror and adventure alike.
132	Nice little 3rd person puzzler. 3rd Person point and click gameplay.  It is incredibly buggy though. Sometimes finding items can be a little hard. Most of the powers seem to be useless except in certain contextual areas.  Game looks okay. Fun to play.  I'd get it on sale but I'd get every game on sale. It's definetely unique, so if you are into puzzle games and want something different, buy it. It's better than the sequel.
133	  While the premise is interesting, the amount of glitches and the lack of in-game direction leaves an unholy taint not suitable for anyone.
134	This game isn't an awful game by any means, but it does have some issues in my opinion. The whole 'kill everyone, hail satan' aspect is pretty fun and the murder puzzles are logical but complicated. For each puzzle there is only one solution, you have no room for creativity. Also many of the puzzles require certain objects that aren't very obvious. If you can't remember where something is or you don't know what you need to find, you're screwed until you read or watch a walkthrough. So i wouldn't recommend this game to someone who rages or gets frustrated easily because it will probably be annoying for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy murdering the people who fed and raised you for 6 years of your life (virtualy of course) then you should definitely buy this game. Graphics are nice, fun concept and Satan is involved soooo buy it
135	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale. Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...  For achievement hunters: Easy 100%. A small guide or couple of play throughs with plenty of exploration is needed. A full play through doesn't take many hours.
136	At first when I played this game I thought it was going to be some fun little satan goes on a rampage sandbox.  Sadly, it's not.  This game is really just a lot of searching for objects and occasionally doing some optional side quests. The cutscenes are alright but it's not as fun as I thought it would be. However, I will admit that Lucius has a great walk.   Would I recommend it? Not at the full price. If you get a good sale on it, knock yourself out then, but don't expect too much out of it.
137	While the premise for Lucius is full of promise and a refreshing take on horror, Lucius spends more time aggravating than rewarding you with some truly nagging nuisances, questionable execution, and general inconsistencies. You play Lucius, a formidable six year-old child. Born on the 6th of June, 1966 (you can do the conversion), Lucius has the honor of being the anti-Christ and all the light-hearted responsibilities that come with it. Visited by his dad on Birthday number six, Lucius is tasked with carrying out the whims of his father: murdering all the inhabitants of Dante Manor.  The game is comprised of nine separate chapters. Each begins with a voice-over and a notebook entry on who your next target is, and concludes with a grisly homicide and a follow-up visit from Satan to grant Lucius new powers and to bolster old ones, such as telekinesis, combustion, and mind-control. While many of the kills are creative, entertaining, and sometimes morbidly funny, what the game often requires of you to reach that moment of satisfaction often results in frustration.  As an anti-hero six-year-old Satan spawn, youâre quite the amalgam of bad-â¥â¥â¥ and unsuspected hitman â but without much motive or directive. Each kill requires you to piece together sporadic clues to determine what items or tools are necessary to manipulate your target or lure them into places they might not otherwise go (such as face-first into a stove top element to light a cigarette).  For those who enjoy all aspects of the discovery process, clicking around in different environments and ultimately finding what youâre looking for can be rewarding â although the emotion I frequently experienced was exasperation. With little feedback that youâre on the right course, the game can quickly stop being fun. Because of each missionâs strict requirements, the intended payoffs act more as a relief to pent-up frustration for finally getting it right. There was nothing more disappointing than going into the kitchen and being unable to pick up the butcher knife. The mission requirements are often unclear, as almost the entire mansion is free to roam from murder one. Further, there is no initial tutorial on the sequential nature of your murderous imperatives, so youâll need to start clicking early, often, and indiscriminately. Where the frustration often comes in is when youâre desperately trying to find the next required item to trigger the next scripted sequence or dialogue, so you can in turn use that clue to get down to business. The Manor is highly-detailed, huge and pretty much unrestricted in accessibility from the beginning. This gives you room to explore, but sometimes finding the necessary tools necessitates a click-fest of drawers, cabinets, and items lying around, until you find what you need. The game is plagued with some annoying glitches, clipping problems and hit detection, breaking the flow of the narrative (like characters getting stuck, objects flying around mysteriously and unpredictably after manipulating them, or the camera auto-moving to a 1st-person perspective when near a wall, which is quite jarring).  Graphically, the game isnât ugly, but a lot of the colors are washed out, the lighting is unrealistic and interferes with other sources (like the outside light interacting with ambient light), and the animations are jerky. The cutscenes are entertaining but suffer from poor camera placement and direction. Subtracting from the presentation are the unacceptably long load times. This compounds frustration when occasionally youâll fail a mission because someone may have seen you wielding a screwdriver that you had no business wielding, or overtly using your telekinesis, drawing attention from those around. There are no waypoints, so if you fail, youâre back at the beginning, but first youâll be staring at a load screen.  The in-game music features some fun, weird, bugle-filled atmospheric tracks, sometimes employing the cellos, violin crescendos, and orchestral choirs that are common of the horror genre. Sadly, the music is often on short loops, and can get annoying or simply feel out of place during parts of the chapters. Speaking about out of place, the gameâs voice acting is B-rate at best, suffering at times from a poorly-translated script and inadequate direction. This was especially disappointing due to the game being heavily story-driven and reliant on verbal or conversational cues that felt detached.  Despite the gameâs ambitious premise, its many shortfalls overshadow the things it actually does well. The murders are always a treat. Coupled with Luciusâ deadpan death-stare and the ludicrously lavish and ridiculous ways in which targets reach their bloody ends, there is often a sick, dark humor that pervades the game. This is also apparent among the surviving residents and workers as theyâre picked off one by one, slowly slipping into depression or insanity, and little Lucius just stands there, taking in all the madness, while still conducting his everyday business of putting away his toys and brushing his teeth (these are sadly further nuisances â chores â that break up the narrative but add to the hilarity). The entire game takes place at Dante Manor, an enormous, sprawling estate with dozens of rooms to explore, drawers to rifle through, and objects to steal for your nefarious ends. While the ultimate demise of each target is often original and unpredictable, reaching that moment typically mimics a âTake object A to manipulate object B to get target C to do task Dâ. As such, there is little freedom in getting to the end result. This is not a sandbox game and does not follow the open-ended format of, for example, the Hitman and Manhunt series â but that difference isnât necessarily a flaw, as it serves a purpose by bolstering the narrative.  Lucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives. If you enjoyed The Omen series (which this game generously borrows from), then you might find something to like in Lucius. Its unsatisfying ending, that despite leaving many questions unanswered, at least leaves the option open for a sequel that is perhaps more refined, tighter, and better-executed. 6/10
138	The puzzles can be really irrationaI. The delivery isn't fluent, a lot of switches between tutorials, missions and story elements. I hope Lucius 2 is better. Still recommending it for its pricing, idea and originality. No regrets.
139	  I spent almost the entirety of my time playing this with no idea where to go, not because I wasn't sure how to complete the objective, but because the design of the house in this game is abysmal and the map is useless because half the time it doesn't have any markers. When I was where I was supposed to be and completing the objectives this game was fun, but those times are few and far between with all of the monotonous searching around this terrible house
140	This is a brutally dark and amazing game. If you really believe you are Lucius, the 6yr old spawn of satan, than you really understand how twisted and psychologically messed up this game truly is and you can really admire its beauty.  Pros: ~You are the 6yr old spawn of satan called Lucius. The story is quite intriguing because of this. ~It is challenging because there are unique (though linear) ways to complete objectives. ~The magical abilities are a nice added touch because the player does not feel like a normal 6yr child. ~Great narrative during cutscenes. Its very interesting to hear a different perspective on the events taking place. ~Relatively short game. 15-20hrs one walkthrough. But if you REALLY like the story/game you want MOAR! ~Realistc. In the sense that, the people in the home, act like theyre just living in a home and do random house things.   Cons:  ~ number one con. The game is too short. Simple 15-20hrs to complete (maybe shorter) but youre left wanting more. ~Sometimes the objectives are confusing. You have to complete objectives in a specific way which might not be obvious. ~You end up running into walls ..... A lot..... (ps. Hold shift to run. I didnt know this and spent at least half of the game walking at slow human child speed) ~The character models aren't top notch. They dont look realistic. This doesnt bother me but it might bother others. ~Controls are bothersome when first learning how to use abilities.  ~Telekinises needs work, levaiting and placing objects is just messy but can be overlooked because its not used often. ~ Cutscenes. A lot of cutscenes. You dont like cutscenes? you might not like this. You like cutscenes? ignore this con.  PS: Don't Agree with me if you have played the game? THATS FINE!!  EVERY GAMER experiences one game differently regardless if your a twin, a quadruplet, a lover of all games etc etc. Agree to Disagree. I listed what might be noticeable cons to the game but THAT DOES NOT MEAN that the game is horrifically bad, EVERY game has AT LEAST one good aspect to it, even if its not obvious.
141	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale.  Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...
142	âââââ - 'Worth your time, give it a bash'  PROS: -Playing as a villian is great fun, especially the spawn of satan. -Killing people in various ways has never been as enjoyable as it is in Lucius, almost hitman like. -This game is funny, mainy due to its faults but Lucius does not take itself seriously at all. -You have to use your innotive, the game does not tell you where to go, instead you must listen carefully and pay attention to your notes. Getting used to the map is also crucial as the house is big! - Although the story is corny and a little far fetched it worked and it was just like a tacky horror movie. - Fun achievements, the type that make you want to go back and play certain missions again.  CONS: - Its unpolished for sure, I dont really mind it as it played into the games enjoyable charm but animations are poor and controls are clunky. - Grapically the game is not brilliant  VERDICT?  An entirely daft premise and not exactly good delivery but the game is somehow one the most enjoyable ive played, which is worrying cause you play as a serial killer.
143	Good game  Check out my video guides if you need any help with achievements.
144	Fairly short game but it's fun, the achievements are easy and the story's good
145	An interesting game by a studio that dared to try something different. The final result is a rather linear, buggy experience that mostly has you running around a huge mansion hunting for clues or interactable objects that have to do with your current target. You'll mostly end up finding items you will need in later chapters, but you get to keep the items for later anyway. This makes the later killings much easier than the earlier ones, since you almost always already have a clue as to how you can use items A or B that your found 2 hours earlier for this. Not all solutions are particularly straightforward. Sometimes the clue you need is dropped in a single line at the start of a cutscene and is then never repeated again. ('Fetch us some [X] and turn on the [Z]!') Other times characters will not shut up and will give you one hint after the other. ('There's a CRUCIFIX in our BATHROOM!' *wink wink*)  The game is strongest about halfway through, when you've gotten used to the controls and the layout of the manor, and you're starting to experiment with your new powers. The later kills and especially the finale involve some sort of time pressure element, which was very unwelcome.  The finale itself is a buggy mess. The game crashed twice and bugged out three other times during the final 5 minutes of gameplay, all at seperate unrelated moments.  It's nice that you got to choose from two different finales, though (action or puzzle), but in the end neither was much of an enjoyment.  Get this game on sale only if you think you'd enjoy playing the antichrist riding around a giant manor on your tricycle, mostly hunting for clues and objects. Otherwise, don't bother.
146	Total disappointment. Graphics look great, nice evil story. Gameplay is tedious, annoying, and a waste of time.  How to play (spoilers?): run around a house. Your mom tells you to clean your room. You clean your room. She gives you another chore. Other people give you stupid fetch quests. You run around picking up clothes, or looking for a bottle of wine. You gather an assortment of random objects and you try to figure out what to do with them. And, it only saves when you kill someone. So, if you run around doing stupid chores for an hour, then you have to quit ... well the next time you play, better get ready to do chores again. (I thought people played games to escape the boredom of everyday-life activities like chores ...) You get clues which are useless - 'I should mess with this charcter'. You then proceed to try every item in your inventory to 'mess' with him, with no luck.  The killing isn't clever or fun. It's not like you have a number of choices, and you choose how and when to kill certain people. You have to kill a certain person on a certain day in a certain way using certain objects in the correct order. Don't be fooled by the beautiful packaging - it is tedious and annoying.
147	If only my father was the Devil.
148	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
149	Lucifer's son. What a lovely boy.
150	Lucius is the son of the big red guy with the horns who wants souls,. In order to get supernatural powers he must orcastrate âaccidentsâ without anyone suspecting him..
151	LUCIUS REWIEW -Lucius The Son of Lucifer-  Yea almost everyone knows this game this kid born in a day called with 6-6-6 numbers Lucius meets with Lucifer in his 6th BirthDay and he is a bad boy after that day -What is our mission in this game? We are playing this game for finish story mode with trying to kill people with useful equipments and with our demonic powers -Graphics are not that great but when you are in the game Game's Story will help you to forget about graphics while playing   -So is it worth to buy it? Yes For SinglePlayer Story Lovers
152	Even though I got this at a 90% discount ($1.99), I was still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and wouldn't recommend it even at that price.  There's so much potential here, but the whole experience was messed up by frequent bugs and poor design choices. I'm normally very forgiving of bugs in games, but so many of these seemed like easy fixes that I felt like the product was rushed or lazily made.  The theme and enviornments are fun, as are the sidequests, but there are odd floating objects, crashes to desktop, and puzzle/action sequences that are extremely unguided and frustrating. Some puzzles are so counter-intuitive that you will either need to look up a guide or try to brute-force through a puzzle by 'pixelhunting' for the item you need to interact with. Probably half my playtime was spent being stuck, and when I finally found the answer it wasn't one of those 'DUH' moments, but rather 'that wasn't clear at all!'. The end sequence is so frustrating that I had absolutely no satisfaction from beating it, and was glad it was over.  A little more bugfixing and polish would have gone a LONG way here.  Can I get my $2 back?  Also, the acheivements are terrible! 40 hours playing this? Yeah right!
153	If you enjoyed the movie The Omen you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear story game with objectives and side objectives to complete. The Side objectives are completely optional unless you wanna nab all those achievos. The collision with objects can be a little wonky (your telekenesis tends to make items flail at lightspeed which is bad when you need to move items to a specific area) and the collection of items required for missions is cryptic. My biggest complaint would be for one mission where you have to place an object in a VERY specific spot to trigger the event. I won't say which one specifically but I was running around the yard for like 15 minutes trying to find this damn spot. Other than that (and getting stuck in a coffee table) it's a pretty fun game!
154	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 8 hours of fun.
155	It's so fun to kill and manipulate people who love you.. oh, jeez
156	Let's be as clear as we can about a few things up front: Lucius is not the best designed game. Its puzzles are often meant to be solved by sending you on a linear path from clue to clue, but that path can be broken by the fact that it's a fairly open world. An NPC might send you to a specific room and the game might expect that you pick up a certain item from it and infer from context that it's to be used in this chapter. But if you picked that item up 5 chapters ago, you might be struggling to make that connection, and instead scour the room for ways to use any of its other set pieces. Some mechanics are clumsy, there's a bit of pixel hunting, and the logic stringing puzzles together can be weird and opaque. You should play the game with another person or a guide to help hammer through it.  All that said, Lucius is pretty fun. For all its kludginess and opacity, it still lets you murder everyone in the house in exchange for rad powers from Satan, and there's a simple joy in running throughout the mansion inverting all the crosses so you can live like a tr00 kvlt six-year-old of the bitter frozen necrofrost. If only you could wear corpse-paint like the band Immortal to let the normals know where you stand.
157	In this game your the Antichrist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Gameplay 6/10 creative ways to kill people but it doesnt give u almost any information to help u so use google story is decent 7/10 achievements 10/10 loved it made me laugh . Music 8/10 creepy :D  Overall 7/10 this game has its flaws but its a good game   
158	Playing as the six year old son of the Devil (like in The Omen) was really fun. Similar to Hitman: Blood Money, the levels are big and the objective is to find ways to kill your target. Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.  The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.
159	Awesome way to kill people. The story is common (horror movie and â¥â¥â¥â¥) but the gameplay is somehow, really good. You'll love your Uncle's perversion and be really HAPPY to kill your family and... servants. Just try it, it's really fun!
160	EDIT REVIEW:  Ok.. well there is now an auto save and a save after every chapter. So yeah... this game is excellent. After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want?  Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!!      ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.
161	Great in concept, absolutely indescribably terrible in execution.
162	I bought the game with high expectations, yet Lucius couldn't cover them.   Cons:  It's literally a puzzle game, but a boring one. Disappointing ending.  Bad story line. Makes you just want to get over with it.  Pros: Lucius' face expression.
163	D:  Well it started like this :I the middle was like this :O the ending was D:
164	Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have 'Stealth missions' that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.  Pros:  + Great Idea of the game + Barely funny + Free movement + Open world (Mansion in this case) + Nice skills  Cons:  - A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible) - Bad face factions - Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime) - Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun) - 6 Hour duration average - 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours - You cannot do anything but the quests - When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again - WTF final  My score is 6/10
165	First off, let me start with who I am. I'm a rare bird in the gaming world being a middle aged female with a career and the usual middle age responsibilities. This lends me to games which don't require hours of controller practice, though there is the occassional first person shooter I enjoy, eg, Red Dead Redemption.   Lucius is an adventure game of the Myst genre with well integrated puzzles to solve but no real controller work. The puzzles are a bit too easy. I didn't have to look for a Lucius wiki. I'd give the storytelling a B+. It's a decent game to play on a slow weekend. It won't take much longer. The steam price is appropriate for this game. Worth playing but I wouldn't have been happy with it if I bought it at it's original retail price, just not much depth.
166	Can totally tell they made a big effort with this game, but only really worth it on sale.  Awesome ideas, they just haven't been executed to their full potential.  The creativity going into this game is amazing but it feels like they poured all of their attention into the concepts and then gave up half-way trying to put them into a game whole-heartedly.  It's still a good game, it can get so boring wandering around a mansion, which is easy to get lost in. (And pick up literally everything that you find, it'll come in useful later and saves running around looking for it.) Perfect for people who like to think outside the box, or people who just enjoy murder. 6/10 would devil again 
167	nice game. i want the 2nd.  edit: omg they are doing it !
168	I love this game, it's so evil! If u like horror movies u will like it. The story is based off of The Omen.

170	Although Its Very Glitching, It Was Really Fun In The End. I Loved The Brutal Ways The People Died. Even Though, It Was Sorta Perverted, It Was All Equally Funny. :3
171	This title quickly rocketed up to one of my favorite games of the last decade; itâs not flawless, itâs not a blockbuster or a triple A spectacle, but Lucius is exceptionally different, well executed and darkly captivating. I feel that itâs fair to assume that revealing your character to be an evil, twisted little demon child does not merit a spoiler warning. Lucius (even his name is evil) is an extremely rare phenomena of a character; even though he is the main character and you play as him, he is the single most horrifying part of playing this game. Obviously there are no jump scares since you are the one in control of him, but what is terrifying is how easily this fictional child brings out this dark evil personality from the player. The core of the game is a point and click murder mystery with the awesome twist that youâre the âbad guyâ and your goal is to not get caught. The mansion that the story takes place in is a bit confusing when you first started, and the map is pretty unexceptional, but after the first couple chapters youâll quickly get a hang of how itâs all laid out. Some of the optional quest objectives can be a bit tedious but the main missions are relatively easy to work your way through without feeling hopelessly stuck. The atmosphere is perfect, starting out peaceful and opulent then progressively sliding into emotional turmoil and fear. Lucius is absolutely incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.
172	Free the demon inside you and fulfill your destiny as the Devil's champion in this bloodchilling thriller game. Taking a part in a series of murders, player controls Lucius - a child... that kills.  The game's concept itself could be considered as something we have not yet seen (at least, at this large scale) in games generally. You play as a little boy who is not what he seems to be. Gameplay basically is similar to  Hitman  franchise, but it's not the same thing as you do all these bloody deeds with the child's hands (and his devil mind).  I give this game a high mark as it was a great experience and I have completed the game in a single day (evening and night, to be precise) because I couldn't have stopped once I've started.  ...Oh, one more important thing. it's not a game for kids!!! Even while main character is a kid, the game is violent and intense in some manner, so keep your kids off the screen! I'm serious!

175	Lucius lets you play as the titular 7 years old Antichrist, you'll be killing a whole mansion just to appease Satan: while as fun as it sounds sadly the experience is marred by quite a few problems.   PROS:   -great soundtrack sets the tone for the game  -gory kills  -you'll develop some fairly interesting powers  -an expansive mansion for you to explore  -being a 7yo murdering spawn of Satan is surely fun   NEUTRAL:   -the game is VERY bleak, you're murdering/framing innocents and there's no sense of humour whatsoever to balance things: so I guess such a dreary game isn't for everyone   CONS:   -sadly there's only one way to kill your inteded victims, this makes the game experience quite restrictive  -some of the objects needed are small and/or stuck in hard to find places, keep a guide handy if you get frustrated  -stealth sections can get annoying  -clunky inventory  -no controller support  -repetitive npc speech  -last boss battle feels pretty silly   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457387627   While Lucius might look like an Hitman clone the restrictions put on who/how to kill and the object hunts required to find the items you need makes it game more of a puzzle game than anything else: it's quite hard to shake the feeling that the whole gaming experience is fairly limited and that it'd have been so much more. Still, if you can deal with the limits the game puts on you and do not get too frustrated by the pixel hunts it can provide a few pleasant hours as you try to figure out what to do and enjoy the bloody results of your labor: just get it on sale when it drops under the 2$ mark.
176	Great little game.  Its not that long, but it defo makes up for length in atmosphere. I would bet my manhood that the devs are fans of the Omen....  For Â£1, you cannot go wrong here!
177	This game is pretty cool, funny to play, even if you will dafinetely need a guide to finish it. But seriously what are that achievements? 20h and 40h for a 7-8 hours game is insane. Maybe if there were more ways to kill or idk, multiple versions of the campaign. Anyway, buy the game, it is good.
178	Always wanted to be the little â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you know you were, but didn't want the â¥â¥â¥ whooping if your parents found out? Well this game is for you; going around offing people you don't like or just anyone in general. As the spawn of Lucifer you go around murdering people to send their souls to him.   That's basically it; however the game doesn't hold your hand, even if your stuck on a certain part and have no idea what to do, the game will not give a hint even after 10 minutes. This is where my frustrations lie; I don't want to be going around looking at every little thing that I might be able to use. Even though I game a lot I still consider myself to be a casual gamer, as I don't want to tediously do things such as look around for things to contaminate for example: I knew I had to poison someone and went into the kitchen and couldn't find anything resembling a platter to contaminate. I went onto Youtube and found that it was a basket I had to infect. Keep in mind that this is a rich family and the maid who took the food to the person always had a platter for her!   If you have patience and can get into these kind of games I would recommend it.
179	6 year old kid killing his whole family for the glory of Satan. And you are that kid armed with demonic power. Each murder has to look like accident so they wont throw your â¥â¥â¥ in asylum, or yet worse, catholic church. The concept actually sounds better than actual gameplay looks like, but it is worth trying.
180	When I first time entered this game,I was like 'Wow,I'm a little boy who is possessed by the Satan! Wow,look I can make fire and move things! Wow,graphics are so dark and atmospheric!' But then the game started. You wanted to murder people? No,you will do it when we tell you. You wanted to use superpowers? How dare you?! It's only for cutscenes! You wanted to have fun? Huh,so naif. The story is good but gameplay is monotous and boring. 5.5/10
181	Great game, completed it in 1 day.
182	Lucius is one of those games that has a very interesting idea, but executes it horribly. This game sounded like it was going to be waaay more fun then it turned out to be.   I can't say much about Lucius, because as you can see I only have about an hour of playtime on record. I didn't choose to only play an hour, the game is just so buggy that I couldn't manage to get any farther. Half of the time I can't play because it glitches so much.   On top of all that, the whole game is very linear. The entire gameplay consist of finding the item you are supposed to find and then using it on the objective. (ex: find screwdriver click stove, wait. Find lock, click freezer, wait.) There are no paths to branch onto, and no choices the come with the game. You have to do what the game wants you to do, and you have no free will to decide yourself. The most side missions you can do is to do your chores for money.That usually involves picking up blocks and putting them in a chest.  Even the powers in Lucius cannot be used freely. Towards the beginning of the game you are granted different powers. Sounds cool right? Not really... You are told when to use that power and you can't use it any other time then when you are prompted to. With how buggy the game is too, the powers can be a hassle to use.   Another problem with Lucius is the voice acting. It's... pretty bad. Also Lucius himself lacks character. He doesn't show emotion, change his facial expression, say anything, or do anything to show that he is a character. Sure, he is possessed, but that's no excuse. I'd rather him do a cheesy evil grin then be a walking cardboard that is there to do one objective to the next.   I may have only stated negative things about Lucius this whole review, but I will say that it could be worth it if hugely discounted or in a cheap bundle. The story can be somewhat interesting and the deaths are great to watch for the sadistic side that we all have. It's not a horrible game, but it's definitely not worth the $10 price tag. Especially with how buggy it can be. I say pick Lucius up on sale ONLY if you like very linear storytelling. Oh, and also pull up a walkthrough because the game is almost impossible to figure out without one.
183	The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic 'Omen,' and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents. The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!
184	I love the concept and story. But sadly the painfully linear game play and cut-scenes (seemingly every time I take a few steps) make it utterly impossible to immerse myself.   There is literally only one way to kill each target, and the game makes it perfectly unclear on what you're supposed to do. This ultimately leads you to Google the solution, at which point any amount of enjoyment flies out the window.  Here is my playthrough of the first hour of the game via my Youtube Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwjnW0NjZ6o 
185	6/66  
186	  Become the son of the devil and be his deadly weapon in this interesting graphic adventure that reminds us of classic horror movies such as The Prophecy or Rosemary's Baby. Innocent, formal, introvert... but also cruel, machiavellian and very powerful. Lucius has proposed himself to satisfy his father's needs by offering him a true blood bath.     LONG VERSION
187	Very slow and annoying that you cant skip a lot of the cut scenes. I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow
188	I went into this hearing all positive reviews on gamesites, raving videos about it &amp; thought it would be good. It started off &amp; was decent, third person sandbox game in a limited environment, a focus on solving puzzles &amp; murder, playing as son of the devil. Oh how I was wrong.  After the first 2 or so murders though all novelty started to run thin, a character would say something in passing to satan-child, devil tells you to get souls, proceed to go through specific path to kill the person. On the way you can do various chores with your powers, pick up blocks with telekinesis, steal underwear from a maids room to wash it etc.   Graphics were decent, better than I expected but not amazing. The story was interesting to start but became boring fast, not as fast as the story decayed though. I won't spoil but by the end it just decided to wrap things up too rushed &amp; uninterestingly, while hinting at a sequel I hope won't come. About half way through it just became a chore to play, there's no way I'm even going to bother with the achievements I haven't got.  Although I hate comparisons, some people like them so here we go. With the (very) limited sandbox &amp; single choice murders, you could mistake it for a portable version of Assassins Creed. Happy? No, nor am I as that was a bad comparison but the game made me unhappy I bothered with it, so get used to the disappointment if you're going to buy it.   Cons:  -Limited interactivity with game world -Poor controls -Poor story -Bland gameplay -Too scripted (might just be me, prefer choices &amp; options in a game like this) -Over the top murders, we're talking the sort little Timmy dreams up only to find his mum being called in by the teacher to send him to psychiatric help, all the while imagining all the ways they could both meet a gruesome fate -Bad ending -No replay value at all, unless you want achievements -Nudity used 50% through to try &amp; entice the player -Everything else in the game -The price, $20 is WAY too much for it, I'd even say the $5 I paid for a bundle with it was too much. If you see it at $2, grab it &amp; be numbed for 5 hours  Pros -Graphics ok for indie game -Powers were cool, not enough to do with them -Good concept  So the tl;dr, interesting concept, really poor execution. If you're swayed by nudity, you can peek on a maid, if you want a decent game then go elsewhere. Maybe if you're 10-16 this will be good, otherwise it's too...forced feeling.
189	If you like puzzle games and you wanna be the bad guy for once, get that game ! I really enjoyed it and I strongly recommend it. Although it's a little bit short (6 hours for me), it's totally worth it to get it, at least on sale if not for the full price. Enjoy being mean...
190	Haven't even finished it yet, and I'm in love. Pretty f***** up game and the story is decent. You play a six year old who murders everyone in his house because the Devil wants their souls. How much better can it get?   Ran into two bugs. A few lighting issues where it looks like the light from a flashlight is coming out of an NPC's face (happened on two separate occasions), and a bug with Will in the garage. (Spoiler Alert?) DO NOT MAKE HIM INTERACT WITH THE RAG. He will start walking in place, and then you need to start the chapter over.   It's unique and genuinely entertaining, and the gameplay and environment make you WANT to explore. Meaning you don't get really annoyed when you need to figure out what to do next.   I'd give it an honest 10/10.
191	Hey and this is my review about this game.  It is a demonic game. You play as a kid and follow orders from the devil to kill people.  he has to kill an order of people in the most craziest way ever. Animations can sometimes be funky. You have to do something first before the person will die. Sometimes u have to do some side tasks to be 'a good boy' which will unlock other things. You have to explore around and collect some items. The music is very well done too! You can have mulitple profiles.  You CAN'T play with the controller, which is a shame. Because their is potential for it.  Let's Try Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq5Ne0fEG4Y  Let's Play Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67ocOvAhfGQ   The game is quite interesting. i do not want to spoil it but i give the game 8/10
192	This game is too cryptic not to have a save system of some kind (either checkpoints or manual saves). If you fail certain sequences you have to start all over again from the beginning of the chapter. After the first few missions it becomes nearly impossible to figure out what you have to do to eliminate a target.

194	9/10
195	You are Lucius, you are the anti christ, you are death.  Play as a small quiet child named Lucius, born to a rich senator and a loving mother. You live in a large mansion, with maids and butlers that make your life easier.. in different ways than intended.  Normally maids and people of service are there to clean or fix, or even get you things when you are too lazy to grab them yourself. Not for Lucius, these servants are souls waiting to be reaped for the hellfire home you call hell.  But of course you are just a child with weak powers, you can not just reveal yourself, that would mean certain death and prolong the rebirth. No, you will do this silently and as if accidents have befallen your estate. What better way to absorb the poor souls of innocent men and woman then by 'accidently' killing them?  The gameplay isnt very linear sometimes, so that can be frustrating for some people, me included. I found myself looking at guides to find certain items or to find out where I need to go next. The mansion you are living in is also massive and complicated at first, really confusing you more than needed.   The deaths are fun, giving a sense of accomplishment when you kill someone.   You can break stuff, mind control people, erase their minds, use your mind to move objects and burn people alive.   About 5 hours of gameplay if you play it to finish, not including achievements or general exploration.   I'd say give it a shot, and if it gets too complicated or annoying just pull up a guide from the steam overlay or on your phone for ease of access.  Personal Rating: 3.5/5
196	Lucius is a funny little game with a great concept. Both the visuals and voice acting are surprisingly good for this kind of game. The story and characters are alright and it is beyond charming riding around a tricycle in your fathers mansion plotting a sinister murder. The execution isn't perfect though. The point and click adventure style part of the game works for the most time alright however there are some far fetched puzzles and some annoying item searching in there. There are also some stealth missions in the game which would work surprisingly fine if the game didnt restart the entire map every time you got caught. This dumb save-system drags down every single part of the game but it is especially noticeable in the stealth missions. There are also some action-based missions in the game which are quite awful. I would still recommend the game to anyone interested despite its flaws simply because its concept is so unique and entertaining. So if you find this game available for a cheap price, go for it! It will be an interesting experience no matter what !!!
197	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. If you like context dependent 'find the magic pixel' games wearing the disguise of a puzzle/stealth game then this is perfect for you. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR? Omen fans? Were people really clamoring for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and contrived plots? How about broken stealth segments that rely on repetition with little to no indication of where enemies are? I can not emphasise enough how terrible this game is.  You play Lucius, the antichrist born through the machinations of your grandfather who made a pact with the devil to gain power and money. Now you have to go through a mansion and kill people as offerings to Satan in an effort to increase your power. This is done by finding little items hidden throughout the one location in the game and using them to engineer traps or situations that you can influence through your satanic powers that end with someone dying. I guess it's a good game for... snuff enthusists? The payoff to solving the puzzles is a gruesome cutscene sometimes followed by a new power to use that are highly sensitive to context. There's no experimentation, no alternate paths, just a set puzzle with one often obscure conclusion. God help you if you don't know where to get an item that you need to solve a puzzle. It'll usually be tucked away, some colorless chunk on the washed-out palate that you need to click on. Speaking of items, there's an inventory where you store particular items that relate to the story but there's no differentiation between the items you can pick up and the junk that is strewn throughout the house that you can just pick up and HOLD. Sometimes you'll even need to just pick up the items you can't put in your inventory! The house, which is the only setting, is featureless and huge. You can run around up and down stairs, but if you turn a corner too fast or make some minute adjustment with the camera you're going to get lost. Every room and every hallway looks the same, but after about 4 hours of playing I stopped having to refer to the map every 10 seconds.  The characters are all terribly stiff archetypes capering around and delivering lines through terrible voice acting. Not many lines were recorded, so expect to hear repeated dialogue a LOT. Another part of the story is told through what seems to be the diary entries of a detective named 'McGuffin' (hilarious) but I have NO IDEA why these segments were included. Who cares about what some detective is doing when that isn't the focus of the game at all? Why make that a thing? There's no mystery being solved for the player. You know EXACTLY what's happening because the 10 minute intro sequence spelled everything out for you. No tension is built through this parallel exposition and no new information is gained. It just turns into a boring sequence of people jabbering at each other, faking emotion while delivering tired and predictable lines that usually pan out like this: 'I'm a detective who can't figure out why people keep killing themselves.' 'Something weird is going on and the my upcoming election can't handle the scandal if the public gets wind of all these people killing themselves in my home.' 'I know. It's so WEIRD though.' Now repeat that between every one of the 18 chapters. This game was boring, frustrating, contrived, cheap, brought nothing new to the experience, had shoddy controls, barely any mechanics, and was a genuine pain to play. Don't buy it, don't play it.
198	This is the plot of the first Omen movie, but then also taking place at a same location as in the second movie, a mansion that is. Even the birthday party is included right at the beginning. So this is simply ''Omen - The game'' (for those who are familiar with it).   Good stuff:  *Assuming it has been well tested or been worked on by great programmers, seeing how I've never experienced a single bug in it myself.   *The atmosphere is probably what holds it up. Like a weak and sole supporting beam. It makes the game enjoyable enough to go on and see what the next death is gonna be like. Built up with the characters in the mansion getting more and more tensed after every accident. But other than that...   Bad stuff experienced (as feedback):  *Graphics are too dark in some areas to make out details.  *Music does not hold enough variety.  *The controls, or specifically in this case, the camera perspective, is working against you when you wish to highlight and interact with objects.  *The Gameplay offers very little to do other than just progressing the story. Apart from being able to acquire three more or less helpful items, after doing minor tasks, there are no side quests at all or alternative paths in the game. This makes it much too linear and thereby cuts it down rather short.  *There is no challenge. The toughest part in the game, is to control the telekinesis with your mouse movement, in order to swing objects at people. That's about it.   Conclusion:  I don't recommend purchasing this for more than 10 Euro/12 Dollar
199	I was drawn in by the idea to experience a bit of 'The Omen' perhaps, but the execution is poor. Very clucky controls what frustrate at times making it had to naviagate the world or select objects to interact with. The worst is during what was a firey confrontation, I fell through the world as I attempted to turn a cross upside down, only to do it again when I respawned. The third time I passed through a locked door and could not reenter to finish the fight.  Overall, it is very sloppy. The story line was what I expected but after the 11th 'chapter' the initial novelity had worn out.
200	Atmospheric game.8/10
201	Killed everyone in the house and still considered a good boy by my satan dad and my mom just for doing chores and just by murdering people     10/10 for parenting
202	 Check Out my Full Review for Lucius Here!  [uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]   This game is just riddled with problems. It styles itself as a sort of logic puzzle game but the problem is, you don't have half the pieces to the puzzles. You have to find the pieces by trial and error to eventually solve the puzzles and murder your entire household.  Look at my avatar, it's holding an axe. When I successfully use puzzles to murder someone I should be clapping gleefully in a way that makes the FBI agents attached to monitor me feel very uncomfortable. I should not be feeling like my own brain is beginning to melt inside my skull to the point that I actually thought on the level of insanity of the developers.   A walkthrough is pretty much required for this game and I'm told that if you just want the story you can watch a movie called The Omen and save yourself the time. If you can get it on sale for under $5 there are some fun missions that you'll enjoy playing. I don't recommend it for any more than that unless the developers release a major overhaul.
203	Lucius .. Oh god .. Sorry for playing that game!!  Lucius - Is a son of Satan ! He is supposed to kill every single person alive in the manor he is living : Dad , mom , butcher , maid and etc.  The way Lucius kills everyone reminds me of a movie : Final Destination   EVERYTHING IS JUST COVERED WITH BLOOD!! If it's not , It was probably a poison (Sad Story)  Okay , let me tell you smth. about the plusses of the game :  + You are a son of a Devil !! + You can get a tricycle , so you can cycle around the house !! + Fans of such a great movies like : Saw , Final Destination will love the game for HUGE amount of 'Accidents' + You have super powers + Nudity  Now , minuses :  - â¥â¥â¥â¥ TONS OF ANNOYING BUGS (Starting from a simple AI glitches , finishing with a chance of not getting mission finished) - Animations of the NPC's  - OVERWHELMING BRUTALITY !!!!!!!! - Nudity (Yeah , it is + and - )  Actually , the game is pretty cool ! I can forget about the problems and keep playing the game forever ! Sad thing .. I still need to check 50% of a games on my Steam Libary and CD's 3:   Also , LUCIUS 2 IS WIP!!!! (Guess where the Lucius has been taken :3)
204	kill kill kill kill with a little boy. HOW AWESOME IS THAT ?!
205	i liked the game enough to play it through, but it was a very rough cut out of what could have been a great game. the npc's constantly repeat the same things over and over which gets quit irritating. there aren't many clues to go off of so switching between abilities to see what may work as an option is quit frequent and often i needed to resort to youtube for help. the story is pretty bad in script and logic. however i will still give it a thumbs up because it was everything that i expected to be which was a low budget b film video game take on the movie 'the omen'. my final words on it is 'to get it on discount'.
206	this game really grows on you. really interesting and i recommend it
207	WOW. Great game.  666/666
208	I got this game when It was on sale for 99 cents, And It was worth it. It's very neat and interesting, Sure, It may be full of bugs. But I can guarantee that you'll always find your way around them. I would definitely recommend this game.
209	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
210	Almost good as movie :D 10/10
211	The House is now 90% crime scene tape :/ and all because Lucius wanted a tricicle
212	Well I thought it would be a mix of Hitman and King's Shining. But it's not. It's more like point-and-click adventure divided into 18 peices and you have to kill somebody in each piece. Playing as a little boy. You don't have any choices, you just need to figure out the right way and do it. The game has 2 most stupid achievements in the industry: 'play for 20 hours' and 'play for 40 hours'. I mean you can finish the whole game in 10 hours playing very slowly.
213	9/11 would make me wanna kill my family again
214	Lucius is a unique game. It is a brilliant puzzle game, figuring out how to use your powers and things around you to kill various people, even having a story that even though not fully compelling is made bareable by the great gameplay. The mansion is a joy to explore and its had top standard gore. If you like challenging puzzle games with a dash of blood, this is the one for you.
215	I would recommend this game. I like the concept of the game and the story. I think this isn't the kind of game you play for the incredible graphics and the game also has some bugs. But overall it was good fun, I liked the tricycle!
216	At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.  The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid 'Lucius'. Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.  Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.
217	An amazing concept, a unique idea, greatly executed.  Despite some minor bugs and some aspects that may be updated (such as some collision bugs), Lucius properly mixes and blends together various genre in one product: stealth, point and click, puzzle, crafting, open world in one game.  You play as the six year old Lucius, a kid who literally works for the Devil as his personal cook as your task will be to bring him souls to feed him. In the vast Dante Manor there are many individuals to choose from while keeping the good-boy attitude not to raise suspects. While murdering members of your family and their servants, you will be asked to perform chores like brushing your teeth, tidy up your room, finding objects etc. These chores will slowly award you special objects.  As you kill people, you will strengthen your evil skills and gain new ones.  I will not spoil much of the game itsel as it's a continuous surprise.  My advice is to purchase this genre-defining game!
218	It's pretty linear, and it's full of bugs. But regardless, I found it to be such a unique game that it didn't matter. It's just one of those diamond in the rough games. If murdering an unsuspecting household one by one as a 6 year old boy riding a tricycle sounds like your kind of day, then definitely check this game out.
219	666  I enjoyed this game!  + story + cinematics + devil/hell things + you feel like a badass! + two ends   - sometimes glitches - kinda hard puzzles (I used walkthrough)
220	You control a six year old serial killer with supernatural powers such as, climb the stairs riding a tricycle , getting stuck inside a wall in the closet and many other awesome powers.
221	Some of us were just made to play as demonic spawn.  The mechanics in Lucius are far from perfect, but the story and aesthetic make up for all that.
222	I literally just bought the game yesterday and I love it, only wish I have gotten it sooner, but I saw there's a sale and I got it. The puzzles, the story, the graphics, it's like none of the kind you see out there. Please note that this is a very hard and challenging game, but It'll never bore you as you'll continue to explore and test the many missions and mamny charachters.  8.5/10 Would definitely recommend.
223	Fun and easy achievements. I wouldn't really recommend it if you're looking for a quality game but it occupied me for a while and if you like killing people as a mini-Satan then this game is for you 6/10
224	I quite enjoy this game because I love horror games. This kid is a badass. It's a skillful game and it makes you think. Def would recommend especially getting 1 and 2 for $5.  7/10
225	Great games for satanists 7/10 - Would kill entire family again
226	I completed the game in 3 hours, it was a good and a fun time killing people , of course i had to use tutorials as without them i would be still on first mission haha, maybe next time without them :D
227	[SPOILER ALERT] I don't know what's going on. I locked someone in a freezer and they froze to death. I spoke with the devil and removed the lock from the freezer. I now have telekinesis. I didn't really need it when I rigged an oven to watch a man's face burn off. Send help.
228	Cool horor game :(
229	I can only recommend this game! SO much fun!  - Running around as a 6/7 year old and killing people while making it look like an accident is just awesome! Even tho its a freaking awesome game, i wouldnt pay 20 Euros for it. I waited and got it 66 % off, and that is worth every penny!  Fun-factor: 5 out of 5 ! = Go buy it at a sale!  (A must have in your gaming collection) 
230	Well this game is one of those buggy/gitchly games but in all it was quite fun you know if being a demon child doing all types of puzzles is your thing
231	This is a clever concept that falls fairly short in execution. The game mechanics are simple enough, just find the right combination of objects in the correct steps and watch things unfold. The puzzles start out fairly simple, but then start to get to the point of being illogical. There are also numerous graphical glitches (bike doesn't steer, objects floating slightly above shelves, etc.) and the VO is sub-par. Overall though, the game ends up being mischevious fun and looks decent. I would still recommend it.  6.5/10
232	this game really grows on you. really interesting and i recommend it
233	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
234	Picked up maids panties, learned how to use a flashlight, killed a maid in a freezer. 10/10 would be antichrist again.
235	Have you ever wanted to play as a psychotic serial killer child who kills everyone? Well look no further get Lucius the most awesome game ever greated it made me go all WHAT THE ACTUAL FÐ±Ð°ÑÑ Ñ Ð´Ð¾Ð»Ð¶ÐµÐ½ Ð´ÐµÐ»Ð°ÑÑ...jk the game is actually pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Graphics look like it were pooped straight outta Lucifers butt and sticked together with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Cutscenes are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible because graphics+terrible lip sync(looks like they are saying really SFAHJAIFSHOABDJFOHBDHBFHJSDBHFA).  Still for some reason i had fun with it ;) just wait for a sale tho.   5/10 Devil Tricycles in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MEDIOCRE!  Also if you have a under 7 year old sibling i would recommend to check on them and make sure they are not really the Devils son/daughter
236	A horror game with psycho kid completing hitman list under contract by lucifer massacring people around .
237	Very good. Play as the spawn of satan, and you kill people. What more do you want?
238	your father is the devil and you need to murder everyone in your mansion without anyone suspecting you (as if its an accident). fun story, pretty decent graphics for its age/genre. 8/10
239	This kid Lucius is one sadistic little manipulative â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. A fun dark game out the gate that builds on evil at a consistent rate. Watch for subtle clues and think outside the box when stuck in tasks. This game unlocks that mean little kid that we all have inside and amplifies him x100. Worth a play when it goes on sale.
240	I completed the game in 3 hours, it was a good and a fun time killing people , of course i had to use tutorials as without them i would be still on first mission haha, maybe next time without them :D
241	Some of us were just made to play as demonic spawn.  The mechanics in Lucius are far from perfect, but the story and aesthetic make up for all that.
242	Cool horor game :(
243	Fun game, you have to love killing people in a dark style or something. Worth my 94 cents xD  Leuk spel, je moet wel van mensen doden in een rare stijl houden ofzo. Het is mijn â¬0.94 zeker waard xD
244	Very original game, worth the price and very fun in a sick kind of way!  Could improve with better instructions and tutorial and faster loading!  Overall very cool game! :)
245	Im thrilled with all of this.... KILLING!! *laughs evilly* WAHHAHAHAHAHHAA
246	The only thing that was bad was the bugs but the game is still fun. Its like Hitman but Satin Edition
247	very good but kinda hard to understand what to do next after you have set your target but yeah that's what we have google for.
248	become mom's favourite kid , made a maid suicide , froze a maid to death , electrocuted a naked maid in bathtub , killed the butcher with his own saw , killed the gardener with land mower , poisoned a pervert , burned a mechanic with gasoline and fire , killed an old man with dagger , made the piano fall on the janitor , made my maths teacher shoot himself , made a man suffocate to death , did eye surgery with water bottle and killed a bartender , lit some priests on fire , burned a guy's face who was trying to light a cigarette , made fan cut the head of a cop .  Yeah im an innocent 10 year old.
249	First off, .The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing. But A nice gameplay though as i am playing it after 3 years of release . Nice Story Cant Stop Playing
250	Ok, so I usually play console games and have just recently turned to the 'Pc master race' and this is one of the first games I have had to play with keyboard and mouse. The reason I start by saying this is that all I've been seeing, here on steam, is people complaining about the controls. So, how does the game feel is a good question. The answer, to a non-traditional keyboard and mouse player, is pretty well, there are a few moments later in game where I needed to use my right hand to hit number keys as I used my left hand to control movement, but other than that no probs.  Another thing is I see people saying that the game is a buggy piece of bleep, and though that is subjective most people take that as a warning sign. I'm not going to say this game is the most polished thing ever but it sure isn't what people are making it out to be, and I did encounter a few bugs such as my journal not updating halting progress, and I got stuck on some clutter behind the bar. Sure that sounds bad but a simple restart of a checkpoint and you should be good.   Then on to how it looks, and I'm fully aware this is personal opinion but I think this game is stunning, the animations in cinamatics aren't the best but they're on par with some AAA games I've played.   So to story then, I suppose if you couldn't gather this from everything to do with the game you play Lucius a spawn of Lucifer (the Devil) and you're killing everyone, in a Hitman-esq playstyle mixed with evil powers. It's like a mix of the Shining and the Omen, and thats a really good thing. And the game offers alternate endings which all wrap the story up well. Heads up if you are Catholic or Christian and are easily offended you may want to pass on this one.   As my first real pc game I thought this was a very good start, and for the price of 20 bucks I feel (pardon this horrible phrase) that I really got my moneys worth. So check this out guys, ya just might like it!
251	Cleaned up my toys. Brushed my teeth. killed the guy who was cutting the pork. great simulator if you want to remember what it was like to be 6.
252	Special thanks to Sudden for buying me this game....anyway on with the review.. It's like if Damien had his very own video game! You take control of this kid that was possessed by some dark shadow â¥â¥â¥â¥ or something idk, BUT, the game picks up when you start killing each of the staff in there one by one. Very fun to see them die knowing you're the little â¥â¥â¥â¥ who started it.
253	Got into my house and killed my family then I started playing Lucius 10/10 would play again
254	I suspect that the early plans for Lucius involved dropping the son of Lucifer into a small open world filled with people who need killing and offering multiple ways to perform said kills. After the first couple of more scripted kills would offer a tutorial on how the game's mechanics functioned, Lucius would then be unleashed to study, stalk and ultimately execute each member of the household in whichever order the player wished. Sadly, this isn't the game we get. Instead, the game feels like it was massively scaled back and forced into a different, more linear mold about halfway through production. Instead of building traps, staging 'accidents' or setting people against each other, the player is instead forced to trigger scripted deaths using inventory items and a suite of flimsy magic powers that felt very tacked-on. You kill your targets in the order that is scripted for you and the game will sometimes set everything up so that basically all you need to do is pull the trigger. Yawn. I give Lucius an A- for concept but unfortunately, the execution of concept is equally (or more so) important and that's where Lucius fails. There's still some entertainment to be had during its 5-6 hour campaign and it floods you with achievements for almost no effort, but in the end it falls a little too short for a recommendation.
255	The game is good as in the gameplay and story. -Achievements are quite easy to obtain except the 'Time' achievements, 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' which I get to later. -It's quite linear to say the least.  -There's a side quest to do where you do these chores and you obtain an item when you, I believe, do two or three chores everytime. The most fun in the game was the item that you would get third time, the tricycle. You could literally cycle up the stairs and go faster than walking by pressing 'Shrift' to speed up.  The price to me honestly isn't worth it (18,99â¬), but I can't complain as I got it in a giveaway. -That being said, the week long deal offers 95% off as of typing this review (30/08/2015) which is a good deal.  Now onto the 'Time' achievements. It's one of the most dubious and stupid achievements I've seen yet. You basically play 20 hours to earn the first one and then 40 hours to earn the second one.  -Though the storyline is like 8 hours (For me it was 6 hours including all the achievements except the Time achievements) and if you want to complete all the achievements, an extra 1-2 hours would be the assumption.    
256	This Indie-game is the perfect combination of 'The Omen' horror-film and gameplay from 'Hitman' franchise.
257	Good game with good graphics. You control a kid (the son of Lucifer) who is able to use telekinesis and others superpowers to kill people that you hate, but you have to hide your murder as an accident.   SO, use your brain and kill all these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing people you hate and improve your mind.  I really recommend this game same if your action's circle is limited.  
258	As I bought this in the sale, I think it's worth my money. Absolutely in love with the appearance, mostly the garden.

260	Lucius is a awesome game but can be hard at times. You need to find out what to do and eventually you'll get caught doing it or moving too it. Really frustrating at times but that's all part of the game. :) I loved the game, the killing parts are the best. xD
261	Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.  'Lucius' is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there. I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.   Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first 'Lucius' to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.  'Lucius' has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing 'good boy' status by doing mundane chores around the house. My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though. 
262	Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)
263	Good game with good graphics.

264	Losing yourself in a giant mansion that looks more like a labyrinth SIMULATOR 2012 5/10
265	It's like the prophecy and you're playing with Damien. Seriously, it's pretty funny, specially how the things change because of this. If you don't get this type of stuff too serious, play the game and have fun.
266	Death to all.....
267	It's hilarious!
268	Loved this game. Hated everything about the ending, both the puzzle and action version were extremely frustrating! Completed the puzzle ending after lots of attempts only to find the steam achievements for the last 3 deaths were not recognised. Having now gone the action route I have been able to kill the priests and get the achievements but cannot get the dad in the right place to dispose of him and finding that it's game over after one hit from him is frustrating.
269	Very fun in a sadistic, creepy, serial killer type way. Controls are a little hard to get used to but once you adjust it is quite fun
270	damien returns in the sequel to the 1990s omen movie
271	This game is pure evil. You play as Lucius. The child of the Devil. It was very interesting and I felt pure evil playing this game.
272	Only just started this game however i can't recommend it highly enough. It's like hitman except youre the child of the devil and have to go around knocking off family and friends.... What could be more fun than that. It's only Â£1 on steam at the moment too..... Grab it quick!
273	Puurrfect. When you're not on edge, you're taking up too much space.
274	i really enjoyed it. the first stealth adventure i have completed legitimately
275	Enjoyable combination of Hitman and The Omen. The gameplay is linear and you're not offered multiple solutions to issues, but the atmosphere and story are enjoyable enough to keep you playing. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Lucius thus far.
276	Murder your whole family.....
277	amazing game pewdiepie plays it yay but all together i think it'sawesome :D
278	Only just started this game however i can't recommend it highly enough. It's like hitman except youre the child of the devil and have to go around knocking off family and friends.... What could be more fun than that. It's only Â£1 on steam at the moment too..... Grab it quick!
279	I really enjoyed this amazing game. 8/10.  + interesting storyline + not too easy + puzzle game + few side quests + the house is big and enjoyable + the powers are simple to learn + deaths were entertaining and creative + peli on suomalaisten tekemÃ¤ ja sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ hiukan suomalaista insidelÃ¤ppÃ¤Ã¤ joten se on mainitsemisen arvoinen plussa :)  - felt like the game wasn't long enough - the graphics are not most appealing but it makes the game look more scary - characters (doesn't include lucius or lucifer) were kinda impersonal - voice acting wasn't that good - if you fail a quest you need to start the whole chapter all over again  I maybe wouldn't buy this at full price but when it is on sale it is a must have.
280	I loved the original Omen movie. But as much as it tries, it gets nowhere close to the heartbeat of the original flick and the gameplay is frustrating rather than fun. This would have been better implemented as a Telltale story than this horrible point and click borefest.  Cons. -Terrible voice acting. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Demon powers are not actually any fun to use.  -No Controller support.  Pros. -Deaths are grizzly. If you like that sort of thing. -Graphics ok. -Worth a couple of bucks on sale.
281	Very fun game. sometimes challenging, sometimes gruesome, always entertaining, NEVER dull and maintains a good balance between logic and imagination.  The creators have done a great job of creating different scenarios for you to follow and figure out. Inside or out, the ambiance and graphics are very nice including the use of HDR. Dynamic weather keeps things looking pretty all year round and there are lots of nice finishing touches to keep your eyes busy. The textures are amazing.  The sound is nice and uniform throughout and along with the soundtrack adds good depth and atmosphere. Both graphics and sound come together to create a memorable environment where even just standing around is pleasant.  The plot is also good; although sometimes predictable there are always a few unexpected twists that are good for a laugh or two. One of the best things about the game-play is that you can explore at your own pace without being rushed (unless there is a specific reason).All this creates a fun, immersive and laid back approach to 3rd person adventure gaming.  There are walkthroughs online to help you out if you get really stuck, but if you use them you will get no since of satisfaction and inevitably feel like you've cheated yourself rather than won the game.  Game bugs are so few and minimal they are hardly worth mentioning. i.e. while carrying socks or underwear they might get stuck on a door (but they will release if you keep walking). The trike might (very rarely) rise a foot or two in the air if you run over an object (but will fall down again as you carry on). Once, the security guy walked right through me.  These are very minor, infrequent things that detract nothing from the game or gameplay! Especially if you have the imagination to immerse yourself into task at hand.  If you don't like something about the way this game is made (bugs or realism) i suggest you learn programming and try making your own game first Before going on a 'i'm a bug snob' crusade.  If you are religiously sensitive then this is not the right game for you. If you are religiously sensitive i can't imagine why you would even want to play.  Understanding that this is a game and not real life will go a long way to allow you to appreciate the experience that the creators are sharing. Just enjoy the ride and you'll have fun!  Review score 666 out of 10  Do your chores! 
282	First of all I can't really understand why this game has mostly positive reviews. Death ideas are clichÃ©d. The plot is non-existent. Shooting someone with a pistol, or using a fireball results in a hit-and-run like effect on the victim. Hitman 2 required a full clip to be emptied on a victim to get this effect. Lucius' cannon would flabbergast even Dirty Harry. The fire extinguisher scene from the end of the game should occur in the game studio during the production phase. The 20h and 40h achievements are an offence in their own right. Especially that the playthrough takes 10 hours if you take a nap in the meantime. It's good that you can sleep through their completion.    - 'Unique 3D horror adventure gaming experience' - depends on one's definition of 'unique';  - '3D Open World' - to some extent;  - 'Cinematic Cut-scenes' - but surely not climatic;  - 'Breathtaking Atmosphere and Stunning Visuals' - breathtaking like a cockroach on a kitchen table;  - 'Harness Supernatural Powers, including Telekinesis and Mind Control' - if you can harness the game physics to move items;  - 'Experience the terror of a classic tale from the horror movie genre' - terror indeed.  Shiver Games breaks the fourth wall by making the player scared with how the game is made, not by the game itself. Cheers on that!
283	Got in in the Bundle Stars Â£1 bundle, probably the best pound I've ever spent xD  7.2/10
284	I mean, you controll a BUCKING DEVIL! I will spell it letter by letter; D E V I L, Demon Evil Villian Incarnation Lyar. Did you watched Omen? This is Omen the Video game (well this was kinda obvious). Anyway, this is hilarious game, kill those petty mortals, show them da pawa of HELL!
285	In 30 years of gaming i have never played a game where i have felt so dissapointed- you generally get something out of a game.... this was so childish in its relentless grind of how to kill over and over- no real storyline...definately no plot twists. this has been the only game wher i feel i will never get the time i wasted on playing this back! Never felt this way before...sorrry!
286	I got best walkthrough
287	As a horror genre freak and gamer, i truly love this game :D
288	I have seen better games. There is only one way to kill somebody (sometimes really stupid) what is just boring. When u finish the game u have no reason to play it again what makes game really short. I think this game had very high potential but game developers ruined it.
289	Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by 'The Omen' movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&amp;click- and 'Hitman' -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)
290	Great game. 7/10 :)

292	Awesome and creative game with an eery soundtrack. There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.  Unfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.
293	Amazing game with an amazing gameplay. Even the music is creepy. Everyone who loves creepy stuff should play this game!!
294	You are Lucius Wagner, a 6 going on 7 year old demonic boy. Your goal is to kill your family and everyone inside your mansion. Your father is running for senate, but with all the death going on inside his home, he fears he will lose. Nobody suspects that a 6-7 year old boy has the capability of commiting over 15 murders.  The game took me about 8.5 hours to beat and get 56 of the 58 achievements, the two I didnt get being the 'Play 20 Hours' and the 'Play 40 Hours' achievements. It was fun while it lasted, but paying $20 for a game that took 8 hours to beat seems a little overpriced. It has a good story, and its extremely fun and intriguing, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. It would be worth every penny if it was only $10.  
295	Don't look at your map since it seems it will always tell you what you need to do next. There is no option to turn this off. Note that I have only played the game for about an hour so I don't know if this goes away. I just stopped looking at the map altogether.  With that said, if you're looking for a game where you play a character like Damien from the movie The Omen, this nails it.
296	Play as six year old Lucius the Antichrist and murder people horrific ways. Seriousely though this game is completely evil. Riding around your house on a tricycle on your way to kill somebody is freaky.   Lucius is a pretty decent game if you like creepy games. The controls feel incredibly smooth and the graphics look nice. My only complaint was that the ending felt unfinished, like they just ran out of money (being an indie game this is probable) and/or forgot to add the last five minutes.
297	Despite all critics, it's not a bad game at all. However a lower price than 18.99 â¬ should be more appropriate.  (I got it for 1$ but it's worth it for 7-8â¬ or less)
298	This is nothing like finding nemo
299	The son of an unholy marriage; the game Hitman and the movie Omen. You get to play the 6 year old antichrist as he murders family and staff members in a variety of creative ways. If you're a fan of classic horror movies like the Omen and the Exorcist you will probably love the various references to them.
300	Great game. 7/10 :)

304	Meh Gets boring really fast, poor house design, difficult to know what you're supposed to do, or where you are, very linear, not recommended tldr: sucks deek

307	A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain. Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.) You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder. As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.  For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter. Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.  A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.
308	10/10 would sacrifice souls for satan again :^)
309	Murdering people with telekinesis, mind control, and pure evil distate for humanity? When did they start making video games about Hillary Clinton?
310	Omen like adventure game with a hint of action. Not too durable in time. Graphics are old generation and you will stuck in some bugs. Gameplay is linear. For adventurers is something different but it will be very easy to finish it. Nice for spending 3-4 hours.
311	the good boy lucius
312	A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain. Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.) You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder. As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.  For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter. Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.  A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.
313	What can I say. The game is pretty neat, the story runs well and you will not be bored. The graphics are average and the controls are not hard.  The only negative might be that sometimes it is not clear what to do.  I'd give it about 80%.
314	You play as a 6 year old who's the son of the devil, and your job is to murder your entire household. Who can't relate to that?? 10/10
315	this game.... wtf.  you play as a little boy that is the son of satan, el diablo, lucifer, wtfe you wanna call him. in this game you are in a huge mansion with many rooms to explore, you fine clever ways to kill the people living here, the maids, mechanic, buttlers, friends that visit, etc.  the way you kill each individual person is set, so if you kill them with a piano, that is the only way to kill them....so you cant switch it up.  you do need to sneak around and dont want to get caught while killing someone.  you need to collect items to finish you're murders.....like a screrw driver to unscrew/loosen things, or a lock to lock someone in a freezer, etc.  you also obtain special abilities/powers to help kill f****ers  you can also do good things, like chores around the house.  it is an interesting game, a different concept from abnything ive seen before and it is worth a try. though i doubt after beating it i'll play again, doesn't seem to be much replay value.   PROS: runs great no bugs or glitches ive seen kill people for no reason special abilities make you feel like anti-christ decent graphics nudity &gt;:) (cant have a satanic game without, just dont make sinse. jk) there are lots and lots of people in this mansion  CONS: the placement of all the residents and where they walk to and come back to seems to be set and doesnt change the replay value of this seems to be 0, once you beat it, there is nothing new gonna hapen next time through this game will upset jesus groupi... i mean good citizens that go to church &gt;:)   dont take offence to my review if you are a church goer, i'm only kidding.... or am i ;)   HELL yes i recommend! 7/10
316	I loved the concept - playing as a 'Damian' evil child while hiding your murders is a fun idea, but the game hides puzzle pieces too well while giving you the solutions to the puzzles too easily. I knew exactly what to do, but had no idea where to find the tools to let me do it. That's not fun. Also, this horror genre usually has beautiful children be evil - because the contrast of innocence and beauty with the vile and evil actions is chilling, but the artists for this game made Lucius a dough-faced plumpkin. That and other minor issues like cut-scenes that aren't cut as tightly as they should be hurt this game, but they could easily be overlooked if the puzzle pieces had been easy to find. I like figuring out how to do things, but I became bored immediately when I discovered that the game wants me to search all over for whatever items may be required to pull off a murder.
317	evil game full of killing ppl for our lord
318	This is an amusing game, but a very limited game. Obviously the graphics aren't the main draw, though they're serviceable. The main issue with this game is it's simplicity. I was hoping for a bit more openness, but it's a rigid storyline with rigid goals and only one way to do things. And it's not always clear what you should do.  Add to that an ending which is lackluster due to poor aiming controls and a cramped little arena, capped with an obscure final moment and it falls flat.  That's not to say the game isn't worth a little time and a little money. I picked it up for $2 during a sale and I don't feel I wasted my money. It is entertaining. Just not worth dropping too much green on it in my opinion.
319	I would like to like Lucius for it's rather unique theme (in the world of games anyhow) and an interesting idea, but the on-the-rails experience was pretty unrewarding in the end. Good for a few giggles here and there, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really, REALLY want to play as a demonic little boy and the game is part of a sale.
320	I bought the game while it was on sale for $5.49, I played through the entire game to see how it turned out, but it is the most twisted, f***ed up game I have ever seen... I mean you can   mind control someone into killing themself by jamming a cross into their face over and over  ... It is a VERY Linear story, so you must do at least 90% of the things only one way(with no direction from the game as to how to do these things, IE: wiki will help a lot), but for the other 10% its more or less do you want them to kill themselves violently, or very violently...
321	This game is terrible. The idea is quite interesting, but the game is so poor in writing and programming that it is ruined from the start. The kills are probably ok for the most part (although there are some VERY silly ones), but sometimes you have to get items you wouldn't have even remotely considered getting for this kill, it gets ridiculous. The animations are just god awful, they are pretty basic and ruin most of the kills. Finally, the game is poorly optimized so even with a good rig you will get some fps drops, not to mention that on some parts I got stuck (usually in the garden ladders).   
322	Cool concept, quite poorly deployed. Incredibly linear, with very little actual choice. The map is horrendous, missed opportunity. -5/10
323	4.9/10 the devil is in the detail. Hmmm. This game really shows the good and bad of indie game production.  On the one hand it's a unique and interesting game concept, the sort of thing which the big guys would shy away from. On the other hand, it's not very well executed, and there are a number of bugs and glitches.  On the one hand, the story is pretty well put together, and not just dashing off another sequel, on the other hand, the game does become a little linear, with very few actual choices (you have to play for the kill in the cutscene, even when your twisted mind can see something better.)  It  is  fun and engaging, and easy to get the hang of, but when you open a drawer and it passes through a chair, people talk to you through walls, or you pass somebody on the stairs and end up riding on their head and looking through the ceiling, it breaks your immersion. Give it a go by all means, but don't expect too much.
324	its a good game that makes you the son of the devil and have to kill everyone in the house stratgicly. you stealth, tfs (third person shooter), and so much more. try the game cause it dosent get enough love. 
325	You command Lucius a child who seems to be under the influence of Lucifer. Lucifer tells you to kill people without getting caught to collect souls for him which in-turn makes you more powerful and you unlock more abilities which Lucifer teaches you.  Sound awesome right? No...  The biggest flaw is this is NOT a horror game like you may think. It's more of a 'mystery game' where you go around trying to find clues on how you are supposed to create each murder. The game is VERY vague with hints, and more often then not, you'll have no idea what you are supposed to be doing causing you to mindlessly search this house until something crosses your mind.   If mystery crime case games are not your thing, I'd suggest staying away from this game...  Although....with a guide it is 'somewhat' enjoyable causing drama, and watching people die as a child. Many games don't include children, and being a child-murderer has a slight charm to it.
326	I love this game :3
327	Its a good game i will Recommend it to Hitman fans and Those who like Anarchory and Devil's
328	Loved this game. This game is so dark but I couldn't go away from my computer when I started the game.  Graphics : Starts to be kind of outdated but really far from unplayable, they're decent.  Storyline : The overall storyline was good, some of the puzzle in the games are very hard but they're logic at the same time, liked it.  Other/Mechanics : The mechanics of the game are simple to learn but sometime they might be frustrating at times.
329	hmm...this game is suck, some objective not give you some hint, hint what must you do. it only give you some desc i spent my time to beat puzzle in here, but i give up i chose to see guide, this game make me frustrated, i bought this game because i think it's will be likes hitman but with lucifer theme. but...yeah i not recommend this game. Score: 2
330	I really wanted to play that game... but I can't. Too hard to play for me on mouse&amp;keyboard in this kind of game's I have tried playing, but well..  anyway game is not bad, just need controller ;F [Xbox] I'm gonna review it, bcs its cool game and I couldnt to dislike it just bcs no controller. I' m gonna wait for controller. Have fun, bye  Hey.. I'm back, so 1 day after writing this review I decided to play it on mouse.. and with time I learned it. `Funny thing is that - Tom is Like Bald from â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s - He was f* Susan more than 1h. `Interesting is that - there are nudes, I didint expect it, but ok `I could feel again like small boy [7y] and I have had to make chores, it was cool also soon I'm gonna get new bike. `But ' NPC`s ' are a little bit annoying, they just have 2 texts.. and always when I walk they talk a lot of s* to me `U can find HINTS [ what u have to do now ] when u end this mission or part of it.. that's pretty annoying [ not always ] `Also this house is f* huge, always getting lost I think that's all Still recommending ! Have fun, bye
331	You get to mess â¥â¥â¥â¥ up!!
332	Lucius is a puzzle game where your goal is to assasinate people in order to please your father lucifer without being caught in the process, each time you make a sacrifice, you become more powerful on one of the different evil magic areas, telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and fireball, although fireball is only usable in very specific ocasions. The graphics are not bad at all, controls are ok to play with, sadly you can't use a gamepad. Some of the deaths in the game are very gruesome, sadly there's not enough graphics quality to back that up. For achievement hunters this is a easy game to get them all. I do recommend.
333	Good game. Teaches you how to kill in a lot of ways. Has some one or two NSFW and really horrendous achievement system.  Really? An Achievement for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours? One can finish this under 3 hours. I played about 5 hours maybe. Some hours I was AFK. I didn't skip cutscenes and took my time. I can't see how one could play this for 20 or 40 hours. It has a good story but after that you're definitely finished. Not so much repeatability.  But overall, good game.   This has been bundled SEVERAL times. Don't get this at full price. Find a trade or get this on a sale.
334	recommend this game. Its challenging but the guides help. If you choose to use a guide i recommend 'Lucius :3' if you comment wuth questions he'll reply with an answer
335	This game is heavy on the satanic stuff/brutal killings orchestrated by a creepy kid! Not my fav game by any means but for under 2 dollars it has merit. If you get to the end o game, theres two ending to pick from; an action ending where you can blast people with your best moves, or a puzzle ending that makes you have to do VERY specific things in order.. Was quite hard doing the puzzle ending, especially since I'm terrible at puzzles lol. But yea just a heads up that the action ending is likely more fun than the puzzle ending I did. Overall pretty fun game, pretty nasty at times though !!
336	You get to mess â¥â¥â¥â¥ up!!
337	Fun game for failed-plans saturday :)  Basically, if you are a fan of the  Omen  movie series, you should consider this game. Imagine you are the Devils shild,, given few supernatural powers and a stask to arrange accidents for everyone in the house. Definiely  not worth lets say 10 Euro , but at the recent discount, it is a good investment. Why? Because the game takes about 8 hours to complete while watching movie only 2.
338	In short, Lucius is a dark little title that sees you playing as the son of Satan. You roam around your manor doing dark little deeds all in honor of your father. If you are the type of gamer who enjoys adventures games similar to the Sherlock Holmes series, and you also have a very twisted sense of humour, than this game is for you. It's not mindblowingly amazing, but it is a fun game to play when you do not fancy something very skill-based.
339	difficult tutorial with satan...
340	It's one of those games whereby the murders are all scripted and all you have to do as the player is to follow said script. It's disappointing in that aspect but other than that, it's an interesting concept and a decent game to play. I'd advise to get it when it's on sale.
341	More of a puzzle solving game, where the puzzles are murders. Some of the cutscenes are humourous, but the gameplay is linear and replay value is low. Still, achievements are easy to obtain.  6.5/10
342	tedious but thats just the best bits  
343	I got to play the Devil's advocate. 9/10.  Just quickly going to mass to ask for forgiveness.
344	I really enjoyed this game. A lot of people say the voice acting isn't good. The great music makes up for it IMO. I however think the cutscenes are very weak and annoying at times (specifically the last chapter STAHP). That is really my only complaint.   This game is Satanic af. 2 dollars for 8 hours of entertainment!
345	Filled with dark and creepy (dare I say ****ed up?) stuff. Enjoying this game is probably a really good reason to get your head examined which in this case is not necessarily a bad thing at all! Getting this one -75% is a steal so go for it!
346	Keep calm and kill everybody for the Glory of Satan!   666/10
347	10/10 - Took pictures of Uncle Tom screwing the maid. Looked at mommy in the tub through Uncle Tom's porn room. Killed a bunch of people. Very frustrating. Now I know Satan only has his 'horns' when you shine a flashlight on him. Stole a gun, and bullets, and killed everyone by going to the vault, and entering '6/6/19/66' (Lucius's birthday).
348	No quicksave or manual save function and no indication when the autosave is made. During the 2nd Satan tutorial mission the game spawns the box I'm supposed to telecinetically put a toy into right under me. Guess what, I can't jump, or move outside the box. Yes, the demonic spawn got owned by a cardboard box. Guess what, have to reload autosave. Guess what, game wants me to replay the whole last chapter again. No, thank you.
349	You can cycle upstairs and burn thousands of priests alive.
350	I got this game from a bundle and I didn't expect much from it.But the game is actually pretty good if you are into clever puzzles and storyline driven games.  The graphics are ok-ish even if sometimes they seem to glitch out or look weird,I didn't pay much attention to them because the main feature of the game is the clever ways you need to figure out on how to kill people around the house.The gameplay is linear but it's not boring because it's extremely satisfying to see the cut-scenes after you kill someone.There are even some side-quests but they feel like chores..wait..the side-quests actually tell you to do your chores.  I really enjoyed going through the game.It has a captivating story and I think it is worth picking this up from a sale or a bundle even if it is only around 6-8 hours long.
351	  'YOUR DAD IS VERY UPSET ABOUT YOU, LUCIUS'    I still remember in the early 2012 when I saw first pictures of the game and then trailer, I was like oh damn, we gonna make some rampage with this little evil son of devil right? But then again, let's be honest.   You was able to do more rampage in GOAT SIMULATOR than in this game.   Anyway, I was still pretty excited about it and I still was in first levels of the game but that has changed when you realized that there is one certain way how to perform the kill and you need to find it. Well, yes I do understand that most of them needs to be done like that, to prevent being suspicious but if Shiver Games put in the work, and make various ways like that, that'd be brilliant. But level-design was not bad, I'm just saying if there was more to do that would be very good. Also I saw somebody said that we should get 'beautiful Lucius but instead we got some fat plumpkin because evil goes within beauty' I do agree with that. Soundtrack is average, no tracks you will truly remember.   Whole story was pretty stupid, and it was not even progressing like I wish it would. Those 18 episodes were pretty down except few ones e.g. the one behind wine cellar. The powers that Lucius possess was really nice and various and that is good point. Steam Achievements was pretty easy but devs crossed line with some of those, when they tell you to be on 7 hours long game for over 40 hours. Currently it is changed so it tracks you time by Steam Library, but back in the days the tracker worked only when you was inside game, no menu, no alt+tab, no Steam Overlay and that was pretty pathetic.   Big and I mean trully mega big point goes to  Dante Manor  because that place is exceptional, truly beautiful and awesome. One of the best gaming spots I have ever been in. I did not even mind to walk around that big place from point A to B because it was joy.   I really want to put up THUMBS DOWN, but then again I start to think that it was not that bad journey and I will still give it UP. Lets see what second Lucius can do.    EDIT: 7 HOURS LATER - NA NA NA. Screw this game. I am changing thumbs to DOWN and rating from 6 to 4.    Bonus Point: Dante Manor   Rating: 4/10
352	Near as bad as Anna. Congrats! Could have been a good game. But a LOT of little details come and screw the game. Plain history, unsuprising ending .... Sadly, forget it.
353	Not bad. Goodstory. 7/10
354	What's more fun than being the Son of Satan?    Methodically killing everyone that lives in your household starting with the help and working to your family members without anyone suspecting a thing through a series of sometimes difficult puzzles? Absolutely!    Lucius was the first game that I ever purchased for Steam in 2012 and have continued to love the same since then and would highly recommend this classic to those who even just enjoy the gore-factor alone (let's get this straight- GORE from a 2012 game which shouldn't deter the squimish). I have honestly enjoyed playing through this game and watching as my actions create grief amongst the family, sending members into insanity, anxiety, and paranoia as you get away with murder upon murder through fifteen chapters.    My only issue with Lucius is the directional issue of the game itself, sometimes glitching and resulting in a level which is impassable which has happened a few times which I picked up items before the actual time that I needed them- or had no idea what I was doing in the level at all due to minimal direction. Other than that (and some slight issue with controller support) there are not many negatives to Lucius than sometimes rushed story/chapters and a semi-cheesy plot that parallels the Omen. Not to mention how uncanny Lucius' model is on top of the fact that he does not speak ( which is fine since the awesome voicework of the rest of the cast makes up for it compeltely with emotional delieveries of lies! ) and some slight animation lackage ( which I'll give leaniancy to since it is a 2012 game )   All and all, I would definately recommend this game to anyone who has had the hankering to be the murdering Son of Satan!   
355	Amazing Game. Enouth said
356	When Hitman was a kid...  
357	killing simulator  it was fun  thanks the awesome group AccidentlyReviewed for the game
358	Really wanated to enjoy this game, been eying it for a while. Boy, was I let down, probably just my expectations but this game is very linear, has basic point and click puzzles, nothing special/interesting to do and seems very short. Great concept, needs more to it. Was worth it at 99c but I purchased the bundle at $10. Second game looks like it fixed some of these issues but appears to have far too many issues to stop me from getting a refund on the whole thing. Probably would've considered a $5 on just this one, but I can't.
359	killing simulator  it was fun  thanks the awesome group AccidentlyReviewed for the game
360	  One of the best games I have ever played... Wow. Everything was on point. Except for some subtitle mishaps but that didn't affect the experience much.  10/10  Had to use a guide, though, I didn't want to click through all the interactable objects in the game :D  The guesswork got boring at one point.
361	Third-person 3D real time adventure game where you're a satanic psycho killer little kid with satanic powers who goes around killing people. The missions are all 'kill the next person' sort of tasks, so far. There's a stealth aspect to the game. The game seems to be rather demanding 3D hardware-wise as my nvidia 770M (equivalent to a 660 desktop card, basically) runs rather slow on default settings (1920x1080 high detail). Lowering the detail level to medium helps a good bit.  Looks nice, but this sort of game isn't really my thing. I'm marking it 'recommended' anyway just because I like the general idea of a game where you get to be a satanic little psycho killer kid who goes around breaking things and rigging stuff to kill people. (Oops, accidentally dropped the hairdryer in the tub.) But the game mechanics are still rather limited.  I got this game cheap in a bundle.
362	Play as young demon Bruce Wayne but this time you get to kill the parents!
363	Achievements ' Paparazzi ' ( Take 20 pictures. )  What did i do ?  F12 , 20 times.  What did i not get ?  Paparazzi Achievement .
364	The game is very good! I had played it many times and enjoyed it.
365	Very good game, especcialy for those, who want to play games with light part of fantasy. Game is something like Risen 2 and Harry Potter, but it's something better.  
366	Awsome game, i love playing it c:
367	has potential, almost like an interactive version of the omen. but i got bored with it really fast, id suggest grabbing something else unless its really cheap.
368	Well first off one of the only reason's i bought this game was the price tag at the time was about 6$ which i would pay for this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥, First the story sucks all you have to do is kill people with you powers you got from hell (which all suck and are hard to use) Second the controlls are terribale to move sideways is hell, also where you get the powers from Weird hgg? so many things wrong with this game just dont buy it it's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
369	Locked myself in the walk-in fridge.  Karma's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10.
370	Bought this game to make my bed and clean my room.  10/10 would play again.
371	Lucius Is A Very Good Game, However, If You Play With A Laptop On This Game It Could Get Very Laggy And After Killing The 2nd Person You Need A Mouse. If You Do Not Have A Mouse Then Your A Bit Stuck
372	I'd like more if I can freely kill ! 66/6
373	Lucius is a very interesting game, you play as a child with powers. I enjoyed the story and at 1 part you can see boobies  69/420
374	wish i could leave a review,downloaded it a wk ago n cant play it as its quite laggy on my pc n it wont let me play it on another pc,tried downloading it again but no joy ,any help ??
375	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.
376	This game is hilariously bad.
377	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.
378	Good game. Think Hitman, but it takes place in a Mansion and you play as Lucifer's son. I Love the detail on Lucius, he looks like a ....devil.  Performance could be better, I was playing on a lower end laptop and it ran, but stutterd every now and again. Would still rec for good story, setting, and very immersive.  7/10
379	I'm Christian.
380	If 'Hitman 2' had taken place in the early 1970s with a charming 6 year old boy you would have LUCIUS. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the early 'Hitman' series in which you pull off murders (making them appear as accidents) in order to reap souls for Satan. There is so much more to this game and a lot more forward-thinking than anything in the 'Hitman' series. Planning is key along with some 'just the right time' scenerios to allow you to fly under the radar for some time. Pull daily chores like cleaning your room, which you can do via telekinesis as you gain unholy powers as you progress; help out the mechanic or gardener or kill some charming employees, friends, and family members. This game is definately worth the $3 I got it for and it will be remembered and replayed for ages to come.
381	Game is fun to play, it has interesting mechanics and gameplay. But sometimes you will get stuck because you wont know what to do and game gives you only hints. But if you ever get stuck there age good Community Guides that will help you.
382	great game 
383	Lucius is a very fun game that can last for hours. I highly recommend it for people who love games with action, puzzles, and a bit hard challenges.

385	Wanna be son of the Dark Lord? Here you are then.  Great game!
386	Oh boy, oh boy! What is better than being a Son of Satan and killing bunch of innocent people in your house while nobody know it's you...
387	A twisted game that is definitely for horror fans, if you love movies like The Omen then this is for you. IMy only complaint is that the killings are scripted so there is no freedom on how you kill your victims.

390	This game is hilariously bad.
391	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.
392	loved the game and story But there are like 2 bugs that made it were i had to restart the level to get by but that wasent a big deal at all i played chapters 1-3 my first night than I started today again and beat it in like 8 hours ha i say well worth the money
393	Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high). I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a 'good boy' or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final part that has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise. Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.
394	Play as the son of Lucifer, just make sure the grown ups do not catch you or it is back to your room and no dinner.
395	Good game, but you only realise its potential 75% through the game. Not enough playtime. 6/10
396	i love this game because it combines my two loves the first being puzzles and the second being satan. the game has a unique atmosphere and perspective, i love any game that lets you be the bad guy. i enjoy this game for the same reason i enyoy TTT in garys mod except i like this more because it forces you to be more intelligent and it means i don't have to deal with other people. i can't right a review on this game without mentioning that i broke it, there are stones that appear on the grass in the garden which you use in a puzzle late in the game, under no circumstances should you pick them up until you need them. a particularly like the things little things in this game like the crow that sits on the tree staring at you. i also need to point out that upside down crosses are not satanic. this game has one of my favourite depictions of satan in it because it is the spiting image of someone i know.
397	Really good game, puts you in the view of the killer as you have to try and kill people using creative situations. You have powers such as mind control, and telekenis, only thing bad was it was a very short game, beat it in about 8 hours. Would i recommend this game? I would DEFIENTLY recommend this game.
398	'Lucius' Developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global. It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970âs and is a horror adventure game.   Gameplay 6/10  I enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didnât have any expectations. Itâs in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you donât have much choice in what happens. But, itâs got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also donât talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.   Music/sound 5/10  The soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. Iâm not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much. Creativity 6/10 This story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that itâs a normal adventure game.   Graphics 8/10  The graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics theyâre a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting theyâre fine.   Replay Value 5/10  The replay value of this game isnât much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.   Enjoyment 8/10  Maybe Iâm a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun. I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.   Overall 6.5/10  This is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just donât expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.    References.

399	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.
400	This game is hilariously bad.
401	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.
402	Whether you might find Lucius worth picking up can quickly be deduced by whether the basic concept sounds like it could carry a game for you. Playing as the son of the devil you utilize a number of psychic powers and everyday household objects in specific situations to orchestrate a series of unlikely and over-the-top âaccidentsâ (murders). Does that sound fun and like something you could do for 6-8 hours? Then come on board. But if youâre expecting it to be more than that, or if you were hoping for a sandbox experience that lets you decide how to use those powers then you probably wonât get what you want out of it.   Itâs of great importance to note that Lucius is less Bully/Saints Row and more Monkey Island/Mystâ¦justâ¦with more murder. Yes thatâs right despite appearances this is for all intents and purposes a real-time, fully 3D, point-and-click adventure. Things are rarely action oriented, instead forcing you to locate a number of items and utilize them in the correct location alongside a host of generic powers such as telekinesis and mind-control to arrange your targets untimely demise. Essentially being your average adventure game puzzles wrapped up in a macabre aesthetic.  This wasnât a negative to me, but if you were hoping to be let loose in a world where you could unleash your powers on a whim in any way you could dream of youâll be disappointed. In fact, itâs quite the opposite with a few exceptions and if you use your powers outside of the areas theyâre allowed youâll likely receive a game over. Since part of the story is remaining undetected and making the murders look like accidents or shifting the blame on to someone else youâll lose the game if someone catches you lighting things on fire with your mind or the like. Thereâs some leniency there and itâs not so strict as to be aggravating, but it does limit what you can do. Even in the areas youâre meant to use your abilities you have to figure out the exact way the developers intended for you to use them to solve the puzzle and cause the murder. Again this will be a negative for some, but on the opposite end it does allow some of the murders to be really excessive and over the top since you can cause things you could never have orchestrated on your own.  It does however highlight one of the big problems I have with the game. Some of the powers feel pointless and you can really see this when some of them are only used once or twice in the entire game. For instance a power you get later in the game is pyrokinesis, the ability to create and control fire with your mind. At first this seems really neat but the game quickly comes up against its own wall. Since youâre supposed to be stealthy and subtle there really isnât much use for this ability outside of two places where itâs shoehorned in. And of course using it anywhere else immediately gets you noticed and get a game over. Telekinesis and mind-control are used rather frequently, but otherwise the other powers feel throw-away and serve little purpose.   The secondary game mechanic is the occasional stealth bit. Usually you get to âhide in plain sightâ by virtue of being a child. But a couple missions call for sneaking around the house after dark. These are pretty simple as long as you keep your wits about you and watch the patrolling guardsâ flashlights. This also shows off another useless ability in the form of âmemory eraseâ which is supposed to be there to quickly make people forget they saw minor things such as you wandering around after dark or levitating objects. You can use it only a few times a mission but itâs more than enough to make the stealth situations criminally easy, and even then I had to use it a grand total of one time. Still these sections have some very nice lighting and are quite ambient.  There are some sidequests in the form of âchoresâ such as taking out the trash, doing laundry, and helping people find valuables they misplaced. Yes, that really is as boring as it sounds but it serves an interesting point in that it makes you look like a normal child. As the game continues on and more-and-more people die everyone begins doubting each other, especially you. But if you keep up the act of appearing normal their reactions are less extreme. I donât know if they figure you out if you donât do the chores since I always did them, or if their dialogue just changes, but either way it was a nice touch. Bonus points for you getting âgiftsâ for doing enough of the chores, though only one in the form of a tricycle that lets you move around faster is of any real use.   Aesthetically the game is very nice. From an actual graphical stand-point itâs an average looking game, being neither great nor terrible. But a Gothic Victorian setting with a very carefully crafted and detailed house to explore makes the graphics themselves a non-factor, as the architecture and degree of detail present is fun to look at regardless. A muted color scheme, hazy filter, and a perpetually dreary skyline punctuate and bring the macabre, grim setting to life. This is laid against the backdrop of some rather creepy old-timey Vaudeville inspired music that fits the setting perfectly.   Most of the games bugs are graphics based so Iâll stick them here. The game doesnât have any truly game-breaking bugs but it does have a host of minor hiccups like characters teleporting a few feet, physics enabled objects getting stuck and âstretchingâ across the screen, characters getting hung-up on doorways, and some funky hit-detection. Again nothing game breaking, but some atmosphere breaking stuff to be sure if thatâs enough to turn you away from buying it.   Story-wise things work but are nothing special. Did you ever want to play the Omen as a game taken wholesale? Well thatâs what youâre going to get. Though at times it seems like the game canât decide if it wants to be The Omen word-for-word, or The Omen with some parody tossed in. For the most part itâs played completely straight but a few scenes and characters seem like they are there almost as a joke. Not a âHa haâ laugh out loud funny joke, but a sort of pervasive dark humor. Some might enjoy this but for me it felt out of place because most of the game takes itself so seriously. Additionally the ending feels rushed, it comes out of nowhere and is more than a little underwhelming. I got enough fun out of the rest of the game to forgive it, but the last few chapters feel like they had half of the time and work put into them being shorter, easier, and not requiring nearly the same level of mental thought to solve the puzzles.  Overall I enjoyed Lucius and I think thereâs a lot to come here for. But the game isnât without issue both from a design and technical standpoint. If you come in expecting a game where you get to cause some over-the-top murders from the role of son of the devil youâll probably be entertained by what you get, but if youâre expecting a revolutionary experience or some unknown gem of a game youâll likely not find what you wanted.
403	What a sadistic child. XD
404	For who like to play adventure games with a mix of psycho killing horror then this a game for you! Regardless of the non high graphics you have a good story line. You need to preform a variety of kills, collect items and combine some, set death traps and much more.
405	Cool game about little Devil. 8/10
406	Ever wondered what it would be like to be the spawn of Satan? Well here is your chance! Really cool little game with some clever puzzling elements and lots of gory deaths. Think of it as 'Omen The Game'. Recomended.
407	I'd say the movie 'The Omen' was an inspiration for this game. You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Killing staff members in your giant mansion while 'Daddy Lucifer' occasionally visits to give you new gifts. Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in. So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed. The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level. But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.
408	I got it in a steam sale and it was really cheap, like less than a cinema ticket, and its pretty cinematic and heavy enough on plot to keep me satisfied. All in all a pretty good game. An achievement hunters dream.
409	It is kind of free world, as far as the house goes, so I had to resort to a walkthrough to figure out what I was supposed to be doing next. Other than that great game.
410	Creative game, like seriously. Through out the game u feel like ur getting away with everything that u've done, and at the end BOOM u r son of satan and u burn everything down MUAHAHAHAHA, ahem.  That being said, the bicycle control is weird and the achievements r just unreasonable. I mean really, 40 hours? Who would play this game for 40 hours?  Other than that, I had fun in this game and its definiely a game u should try.
411	Surprisingly a good game with decent graphics, just let down by all the bugs and ****ed up things.   7/10
412	Utterly Linear, laggy(bad performance), generally boring, AWKWARD controls, terrible graphics(them character models) and the worst of all, it is all built around the philosophy of the one-way path gameplay to goal. Nothing like the multitudes of choice you get in a good Hitman game, lets say which is exactly what this game should have been like(Hitman as a Devil child with Super-natural powers). Instead you get to click on objects and wade through the terrible designied interface system un till you connect the dots metaphorically with some object(s) which are pre-determined to then finally allow you to kill some sterotypical house dweller in some very sterotypical pre-determined ways. Note PRE-DETERMINED, this felt more like a puzzle game to me than some crazy/inventive sandbox killing fun as an Omen child clone.   It's not worth even an hour of your time. I personally stopped playing after 4 missions it was SO terrible and laborious to wade through, has the typical cheesy investigator is getting suspicous of supernatural happenings storyline to from [insert random devil child movie here]. Oh and the investigators name is MCGUFFIN... even the Developers think this game is a joke, clearly.  Lets hope Lucius 2 really delivers the Hitman-esque Omen game that many of us, including me want.
413	This game feels like a bad joke. It also suffer from most common problems in puzzle games. Only redeeming factor for me is the gruelsome murder scenes, but even this is only mildly entertaining.

415	Really good game, puts you in the view of the killer as you have to try and kill people using creative situations. You have powers such as mind control, and telekenis, only thing bad was it was a very short game, beat it in about 8 hours. Would i recommend this game? I would DEFIENTLY recommend this game.
416	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and cool gameplay, the soundtrack is good. This was a unique experience playing that game and I liked it a lot.
417	Spent 10 minutes running around the house trying to find the maid, only for her to be in the room next door from where I last started.  Genius/10, would get lost again.
418	Lucius. I can keep going on and on about this game. It's so freakin' awesome! Simply be a kid of 6 years old and murder your family and friends around it! Funny and cool. The graphics are not that good, but it will have to do. The game is about Lucius, the 6 years old kid. The story is about him, he is the devil's son. At the 6th day of the 6th month on his 6th birthday (or let's say: 666) he becomes evil. His first kill is the old maid, which we don't care about, since she had too much icecream (you'll get the joke when you play it).  One thing creeped me out the most, since that the graphics aren't that good, the face of the people don't show any emotions, not that much at least. For Lucius this is even worse, his black eyes, looking through your skin, no emotions, only pure evil. The game is not scary at all, but his face scared me.  The only spoiler I will make is that there are 2 different game-ends, you'll have to pick the one you are attracted too.  It's no open world, that's the saddest thing about the game, you can not leave the house/garden. It's actually a really small map which you can walk in. Luckily you'll get something better later, to move around.  I recommend this game to all of you. If you like to play the bad guy some time, then this is it. Murder your family and their friends for fun, nobody expects the kid to be the killer! Watch out for some signs though, they make you weak. For a decent price, for me at least, it's great. Though, it's only singleplayer, so it still might be too expensive. If you buy it: You're awesome, Have fun!
419	  very funny and yummy
420	I first played Lucius with high expectations but it only took me less than a hour that despite the great concept and promisse of this game, it failed deeply to deliver. For those of you who don't know, basicly the premisse of Lucius is that you're the son of Satan and he speaks to you at certain times teaching you new powers/spells and when you find a certain person on your house he'll tell you that you need to kill her. I understand that some games are better done if they restrict the player options ,in order to experience a story for example, but in this case I feel like the death of each one of those individuals being scripted didn't actually helped that much. Sure the developers created on their own way for each person to get killed in order to unfold the story which takes place around you and the detective which is investigating the deaths on your house along with your family but I feel like if they allowed to each player kill those people using their 'imagination', per say, and their powers it would be actually alot more fun, don't get me wrong I actually thought some of them were well made. I also felt like the game was poorly optimized because I believe the cutscenes are rendered ingame and they ran pretty poorly for me for some reason but that's maybe just something on my end. One thing I really hated was that sometimes if you wake up and you need to get a certain item in order to kill someone, if you miss your 'window of oportunity', like someone goes over to that room and they can't see and you need to wait for him to go to sleep it's actually pretty boring, atleast for me anyways. Overall I can't put myself to playing Lucius until the end because I just can't take it, the concept is great but it's poorly executed as far as I see it or maybe I just don't like the game at all. Eitherways, I don't recommend this one, beware.
421	Finally i've been waiting for so long to play this game lel.   it's alright although there have been some glitches and bugs i've come across to but that didn't stop the experience  storyline 6/10  gameplay 7/10 graphics 9/10 voiceacting 6/10  = 7/10 it's average give it a try m9
422	In this game you are kid and you are kill people its logic and fun buy this game.
423	Worst game I've seen this far. I was stuck in-game after some chapters and was never able to finish the game even with help of forums. There is also no ability to save. It looked promising but you will get detected often and 'game over'
424	Decent game. 6/10 The graphics are pretty well designed. The gameplay is a bit akward. It submerges you into the game with hardly any instruction. I was stuck on the second murder.  It's not worth the money unless you just enjoy figuring out stuff on your own.
425	This game plays and looks like it was built with a Unity â¥â¥â¥â¥ing engine alright, i'v seen â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Yandere Simulator capture the same gameplay, but compairing the 2 just makes this game look like a joke. The Story for Lucius was amazing, hands down, 10/10, but the execution was down right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid. If i am the son of satan and i can launch â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fireballs to kill people, i should have the option to do this. This is what makes Yandere Simulator so much better, it's not even finished yet, and i can already tell that it is better than this game. 3/10, Amazing story, voice acting and graphics, but the gameplay â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks.  Edit: I forgot to mention, i beat this game in a single afternoon while eating a pizza. Puzzles are not creative and boring. Dont buy Lucius 2 either, Lucius 2 goes for the kind of, do it yourself type of game. But that game down right glitched and did nothing to make me entertained. This series of games is stupid, make a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing book with the same concept to enjoy this to the fullest.
426	This game is extremely buggy and hard. I couldn't even finish it because of all the glitches. Plus, there are no checkpoints, so if you fail a mission, you have to restart everything, even if said mission takes a tremendous amount of time. I also had to go online to finish the puzzles... On the plus site, there is: One scene with boobs One sex scene Gory cut scenes if you're into that... 
427	demon babies make this game amazing buy this game and you get the chance to be satans little boy and murder your own family for satan with satanic powers!
428	If you liked the Omen you will love this game.
429	I showed my cult this game and they seemed to enjoy it, the Featheriver ward of the Mormon church approves!
430	Picking objects. Picking objects. Combining objects. Cleaning up bedroom. Killing. Picking objects. Picking laundry. Killing. Meeting father sometimes. Killing. Getting caught by night and game over because I must go to bed. I AM THE SON OF SATAN YOU GO TO BED MORTAL !!! Losing all objects. Picking objects. Killing. Picking objects. Being technically stuck in the court with no way of walking out of there. Loosing consciousness because a dumb player decided to stop the game and never play it again.
431	it's a cruel story to kill everyone in the house including his own dad and mom, i just love lucius mom and NOT his dad ! if i could choose i'll choose his mom to stay with lucius, btw this game is so epic, try and enjoy guys !!! ^^
432	well this game is really something ive never played just appears in mylibrary so i did buy when i t was appearing so since its techically not there heres part a lemon cake recipe (NOT THE FULL RECIPE)   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). ...

To make filling: In medium saucepan, mix together 1 tablespoon lemon zest, 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1 tablespoon cornstarch until smooth.
433	I showed my cult this game and they seemed to enjoy it, the Featheriver ward of the Mormon church approves!
434	Would kill people as a demonic child all over again
435	I Luv This Kid
436	Game about kid, who's killing everybody satan tells him to kill.
437	don't bother. Buggy unfinished and Linear. Frustrating endgame, poor design. Decent concept but no imagination and very scripted use of powers. Dissapointing
438	The son of the devil possesses all the grace and maneuverability of a pontoon boat with rocket thrusters. Who told you people this game was finished? It is a struggled just to walk through a door. Seriously. I'd like my $5 back.
439	This game had me frustrated. The puzzles are sometimes stupidly hard to solve, even with clues, which will have you running up and down the hallways over and over again until you start screaming yourself red in the face. I found myself looking to the user made guides more often then I'd like to admit which left me feeling like a $3.00 hooker with a skin disorder. On the up shot, the guides were very well put together and very helpful if not a little presumptuous at times.  I don't recomend this game for anyone with attention problems which, lets face it, is most gamers. The graphics are nice and although it lacked the horror aspect, which is what I half expected when buying it, the story is fairly well written.  I didn't hate this game. I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone based on my experience with it. If it wasn't for the guides I would have given up on this game soon after pressing play.
440	It has a nice concept, but ultimately the game is just very poorly executed. On the technical side I've experienced numerous glitches and a few crashes. In-game the inventory and 'mission log' are very awkward to use, and the map is broken. The game offers little support for your objectives. As it has some puzzle elements this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the game has such tight grip on how a specific objective or 'kill' has to be executed that some kind of support would be nice. The fact that the game's kills are largely scripted doesn't even bother me that much. The main frustration lies in the fact that you have to carry it out exactly as the game wants you to. For instance, halfway through the game you are tasked with carrying water outside without gaining any suspicion. As all but one character are in the same room this could have been as easy as taking a bucket from the laundry room, filling it with water and carrying it outside without bumping into any NPC. Instead, the game wants you to go to a very specific room and take a very specific object to carry the water around. Unfortunately it doesn't end there. Some of the more interesting sections have you sneaking through the mansion at night. As some of the NPCs are still awake you have to take care not to bump into them. However, as the game is rather unforgiving in this, such sequences quickly turn into trial and error. In the game, you use specific powers such as telekinesis and mind control to achieve objectives. A downside is that simple things like picking up stuff or opening doors are treated in the same manner, meaning that this form of interaction also has to be selected from a hotkey. This became frustrating when I spent five minutes trying to open a door but wasn't able to do so as I still had telekinesis selected as active ability. When using a power such as telekinesis or mind control you have to aim extremely careful for it to take effect. Towards the end, this became so tricky that I had to go to the options menu to considerably lower my mouse sensitivity. The game has some annoying invisible walls (or rather 'fences') placed around some objects which obscure your ability to toss fireballs past them. A plus side is that this is one of the very few games where you play a true villain (not just an antihero) and that the atmosphere is very nice. It is just pitiful that the game is so poorly executed.  Tl;dr: nice concept; bad execution.
441	It starts out pretty well but quickly turns into the kind of adventure game where you need to keep the walktrhough open in the Steam browser as murder plans become more and more convoluted. Moderately entertaining if you find the premise entertaining but ultimately very flawed - particularly in terms on pacing and escalation.
442	If you're seeing this review, then you're probably very interested in 'Lucius', a third person action-horror game where you play the son of the devil and go around reaping souls in pretty gruesome ways. While the concept looks good on paper, execution wise the game goes only halfway.  Whether intentionally or not, it's pretty humorous going around as a little kid and messing things up around the manor. The character himself never talks throughout the game, which is pretty creepy and is even made reference to at one point in the storyline. The abilities you are able to use are cool as well, like mind control, telekenisis, and even fireballs! (although you can only use that ability at specific points, mainly scripted events). Unfortunately that's where the positives really end, the storyline of the game is pretty bland and not very in-depth. Not that long into the game you'll start to get somewhat bored of it and would rather just go back to your own evil devices. The cutscenes (which I'm pretty sure use the in-game engine) are god-awful, ranging from out of touch lip syncing, wooden voice acting and PS2 textures. Another thing is that actually figuring what to do next is a challenge in of itself, most of the time you'll be wandering around the manor, bumping into different rooms and accidentally finding important items. The worst part is if you fail on a mission, you have to start the ENTIRE mission all over again, which mainly happened for me during the stealth sequences in the game. The worst kind of Trial and error. Overall, this game is only really worth getting if it's at a low enough discount (75% or above) and even then save it for when you don't have anything else to play. It's not worth the wait or hype. Again this is my opinion, if you have a different view and enjoy this game wholeheartedly then that's great! :) But for me, it was a mediocre experience.
443	Game is crafted well and has a good storyline to it. But for me personally it lacked anything else, you do a same routine each moment and you don't feel that you have accomplished anything.
444	You can't save the game, for starters. So everything you do, you have to start all over again next time you want to play. If you can manage to play it all in one sitting, then props to you. The story is only mediocre at best. The game play is only 'alright'. All in all, it isn't enough to capture my attention for more than an hour.
445	This game seems half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like they released an alpha and then just ran with it.
446	Game about kid, who's killing everybody satan tells him to kill.
447	I Luv This Kid
448	A really cool game that I believe was inspired from The Omen movie. You play as Lucius, the son of Lucifer. Lucius was born June 6th, 1966 (666 incase you haven't figured it out lol) into a family where his grandfather was worshiping and offering sacrifices in a hidden chamber all the way since his kids were young (Lucius bio father and his brother), which is the reason the family is so rich.  The game starts when Lucius and his family are celebrating his 6th birthday when Lucifer visits him in a vision and points him to kill the maid. After he's done it, while Lucius is sleeping Lucifer visits him in his dream and teaches him a new skill. And that's basically what the game's all about, killing people and learning new abilities to use to kill people marked by Lucifer, until the end where you all the choas happens (won't spoil it) and you leave the manor as an innocent young kid and taken away by the detective after the fire that was burning down the manor.   You can do many things other than solving puzzles and killing people around the house like tricycling around the manor, annoying people, messing around with your abilities, getting detected and then erasing the memory from those who saw you use it, doing chores for your parents and people who work at the manor which gets you some gifts like the tricycle, music box and a boad game.  - Graphics: 6.5/10 but it really isn't that important to me. - Story: 8/10 It was entertaining and fun. - Gameplay: 7.5/10 Could've been better. - Price: I got it off BundleStars along with a few games in a bundle for $2.49 and it was totally worth it. If you don't like the full price, just wait for it to go on sale and get it along with Lucius II.   Final score: 7/10. Good and fun game.
449	Game about kid, who's killing everybody satan tells him to kill.
450	I thought this game would make funny hilarious knee slapping youtube video material, that would have been fun if the title screen would load.  The only load i want now is your onii-chan's, so hand him over â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
451	This game is awesome, love the atmosphere and the storyline!
452	Get yo' creepy kid on in the best 'Scare Your Parents' simulator of 2013.
453	'It's like Hitman with Lucifer' - IGN  I rate it 666/13 would hail Satan again.
454	Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.  Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.  The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.  2/10, take your money else where.
455	666
456	If you're an antichrist you'll enjoy it - If not you still will, but feel kinda sorry in the inside ;)
457	This game is very funny especially when you are with friends... Very nice graphics and music.
458	Woo
459	Now I played it twice, it is so good. A super nice story and excellent graphics. The Tasks are really difficult sometimes, but then when you see the animation of the person who died, you feel already better :D. A must play game!!!
460	Woo
461	I have a lot of hours recorded in this game. On this, on other (old) accounts.  Why? Because it is simply amazing. I can do many things in it. Actually this is game where little kid Lucius, one sadistic little manipulative being is loved :3 (illuminati xD)  This is a fun dark game, thats build on evil.  When stuck in tasks, you have to think. That's also great thing, cuz u are helping ur brain. In this game, you also learn a lot of things.  The voice acting is not that good, so i think it's about 8/10. Voice acting and lipsync often failes. With fun, this is also one 'MORBID' game.  Most of the time, you have no idea what to do 'cuz there is no hints where to go. Huuuge house sometimes becomes boring, when u have to wander around it over and over. Can't kill how u wants. Anyways, i recommend this game from heart, everyone should play it !
462	Enjoyed every minute of it.    Hope I am not going to hell for playing this game :D   
463	Got it for free... So..  10/10 Would farm cards again.
464	Enjoyed this game a lot, as it reminded me of a film series called 'The Omen' which I particularly enjoyed. This game's practically a movie tie-in! Loved gaining the powers and using them to brutally or carefully murder all of the house's occupants. However, I did have to look up the next step in certain chapters using a guide, as the notebook tips can sometimes be incredibly vague, or not show up at all. This game is not without its glitches. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
465	This game is like a day in my life. So I find it boring.
466	COOL BOY AND THE BAD BOY
467	Epic game. I fu**ing love it ^^
468	While the gameplay is fun, there just isn't enough of it. There are far too many cutscenes in this game.
469	Super uber game to play if your not a lill pusi.
470	  nice but the game dont let do things on ur way
471	This is my revew on Lucius and I have to give it a 4/10 because there are bugs and alot of them and thats not really a bad thing because only one is game breaking and thats only happens for in my words the better ending. As for the other bugs they just break the immersion of the game. Also at almost random the frame rate would heavaly drop to almost a frame per second and everything would come to a crawl. Also the game has a hard time at really telling you what you really need to do and at times I had to use Youtube to finish some chapters because of how poorly the game told me on what i had to do.  On the other hand the game is kinda boring 'unless if you like games like this' the cutscenes are well done, and for the most part the voice acting is good. Sadly I really cant recommend this game unless its on sale because in a way the game gets you to kinda want to kill off the people in it other then your mother, your first victim, and the butler other then that the people you kill kinda had it coming.
472	+good storyline +cinematic insertions +interesting achievements -a very hard game for those who are not familiar with the genre 'quest' -booring gameplay  -a lot of bugs but I recommend it
473	The idea of this game is not bad, but very boring is implementation. I would like to sleep when it is played.
474	An extremely novel game in overall concept. Unfortunately, while the concept feels like it should be akin to an open-ended level from one of the Hitman games, the result is more like a series of finnicky, overly precise puzzles that rule out perfectly valid solutions in favor of one inexplicably correct path. The end result is just some of the worse sins of adventure game logic applied to murdering people with satanic powers - which makes that great idea a lot less fun than it should be.
475	It has a good story; It has a awesome soundtrack; It has a creepy atmosphere; It has interesting objectives; It is on Halloween 2014 SALE!!!!!! Grab it now!
476	I got this for 99 cents Just watch a cringe compilation video for free
477	i was peeking throw a hole in the wall staring at a woman in a tub she was naked 100/90 will replay that mission oh and this room uncle tom is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing again you get to see i was all over that but i said to my self let it be................... ;_: i cri evy time
478	It's ok... 8/15
479	satans spawn mwhahahahaaa ! shame there is only one way to complete puzzles, I strongly recomend the second one over this.
480	I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said 'click this, put this here, someone dies', and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.
481	  Cool concept. A point and click adventure game where you are the child of Lucifier sent to destroy everyone in your mansion. However, it isn't executed all that well. There is only one way to solve puzzles that require specific items and actions which are far too unclear. Also a lot of the time the game becomes 'click the correct pixel'. AI is also basically nonexistent. NPCs only walk along predefined paths and constantly get stuck.
482	I have a lot of hours recorded in this game. On this, on other (old) accounts.  Why? Because it is simply amazing. I can do many things in it. Actually this is game where little kid Lucius, one sadistic little manipulative being is loved :3 (illuminati xD)  This is a fun dark game, thats build on evil.

Anyways, i recommend this game from heart, everyone should play it !
483	This game is not God awful, but it's not very good, either. I would only recommend it if it were on sale.  Lucius spends most of his time murdering innocent people in his (easy to get lost in) mansion. Each chapter is a new person to kill. Gameplay is completely linear. You cannot decide to kill the maid right now and kill the mechanic next and then your mother. You also don't get any freedom in deciding how anybody dies. The game does at least have some creative (somewhat unrealistic) deaths, though, it's sorta cool to see somebody's face get sawn open.  Each chapter requires you to kill each individual in a *very* specific way. You can usually get a good idea what the game wants you to do (poison, nail guns, revolvers...) but you may have trouble figuring out exactly how the game wants you to accomplish your task and you will likely need to refer to a guide to figure the exact actions the game wants you to take. It's annoying that it's not more clear.  Another con to this game is the fact that you cannot save in the middle of a chapter, which compounds the previous issue I have with this game. You are undoubtedly having trouble figuring out the exact steps the game wants you to take, so every time you mess up and get a game over (which can be pretty easy to get) you get to start the *entire* level over, re-picking up items and getting back to the point where you can try to experiment and see what needs to be done, just to get another game over and do it all over again. It's very tiresome.  The powers could have been done a bit better. The mind control power is rather obscure, you can't just mind control someone to take your gun and go shoot somebody else, (That would be fun!) all you can really do with it is pick a person and pick an object to interact with it. You'll need to place items from your inventory somewhere in the environment first, that that threw me off the first couple of times. The telekinesis also controls really really badly. One kill in particular in the bathroom is super super hard to pull off. Luckily it lets you try multiple times very easily but considering how badly the telekinesis controls I wish it would just have activated the kill once you got close enough; you've figured out the exact actions the game wants you to take, and that's all this game really is.  You also have to avoid getting caught and stealth doesn't work the way you might think. This isn't like Thief where sitting in the shadows means you are unseen, being stealthy just means, once again, taking a path or doing some extra action that the game very specifically wants you to do in order to be unseen, though the memory wipe power is very useful for this.  There's not a whole lot of thinking you get to do yourself in order to continue murder people without getting caught. It's a shame; before I got this game I was thinking you had to constantly think one step ahead of the detective to keep getting away with murder but the game will always hold your hand and say 'You'll have to not be seen here,' 'Hide evidence here,' and 'It doesn't matter if this person sees you anymore, because you're about to kill him.'  The graphics are alright, they can be a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sometimes. The game has some minor little glitches in it as well but nothing to ruin your experience or figure out how to work around. The story is pretty dull and the characters are not very engaging (though you are going to kill them all anyway.) I do really like the music.  The clunky and disappointing end bosses are a perfect representation of this entire game. If you like the concept and want to see what having some devil powers are like, get this game on sale. You can have a bit of fun with it, but it's definitely not worth $19.99.
484	I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME BEST GAME VEVER 10/10
485	Lucius was a fun game but at times it felt more like a chore to complete this game. While the story was entertaining it was a little bland and the only thing that made up for this were the innovative kills and humor in said kills. Not only did the story struggle to entertain me, but the constant running around the house to find the most minute details aggrevated me to the point of looking at walkthroughs to find what I missed and where to go. I really wanted to enjoy Lucius and on some level I did, but if I were to give a rating it would be a 6.5/10. I think it didn't live up to what it could have been. I'm kind of in the middle about this game. Be warned that you may spend a lot of time roaming around wondering where to go.
486	Ever want to play as a demon child. â¥â¥â¥â¥ Yeah! Kill all the people!
487	most of the time when i buy a game similer to this i think i wasted my money but with this game i made the right choice the player plays as a ten year old boy whear u are the devils son and if yore a strong beliver of god this game is not for u it is very satanic but still a good game i give it 8
488	Murdered a lot of people in a house over the course of several months. Went home and decided to play Lucius.   It's pretty good.
489	This game is so broken jfc
490	Do not buy this game. Trust me, it is not worth the 20 dollars. Only buy this game if it's extremely cheap on sale or you really wamt to play it for yourself. Even then, you will only be provided slight entertainment. You've been warned, I'm not entirely sure why this game has such high praise.
491	I bought this on sale and got 10 hours of entertainment. The deaths are creative and gruesome but it's a shame there is only one for each target, this considerably reduces any replayability. What a shame there isn't a level editor.
492	Just couldn't stick with it. Cool concept though.
493	That so.... interesting
494	if i say that this game is awesome im wierd?  what ever it wont affect you...its just a game  66/6 would hail Satan again! ... im screwd :')
495	do you like games? do you like hitler? do you like games that the main charater is hitler as a child? if so you should seriously get his game! very educational
496	Although the story is just filled with plot holes and therefore unimaginable, I did enjoy the concept. The cinematopgraphy was incredible and a joy to view (just look at the screenshots I took), however they were unsupported by poor voice acting throughout. The only voice actor I found believable was the actor playing Will.   Further, the games way of giving you a certain item to display hints on your hud was flawed as it didn't just show you hints specificially for the mission you were on, but instead, (I kid you not), it showed you hints for future missions aswell creating total confuson.   An example of a plot hole I identified: -There is no way Lucius' parents are fine with never hearing Lucius' voice before, actually no one should be. However, they live day to day fine with it. Further, everyone in the house doesn't seen affected by the murders in the manor expect for the mother displaying a natural character arc.   TL;DR: +Great game, great cutscenes, interesting concept - Poor voice acting, flawed help system, can't sympathise with characters due to lack of intentions and character arc.  
497	I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.  It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.  Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.   In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.  Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.  Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.
498	If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the game major source of fun which is killing.  You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!
499	A-MAZE-ING! You are the little kid from The Omen. It's brilliant.
500	just dont waste your money on this game
501	Fantastic game!
502	It had so much potential and fails miserably.
503	When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced &gt; Conflict Arises &gt; Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy &gt; Oddball Makes Friends &gt; Oddball Gives Up &gt; Friends Rescue Oddball &gt; Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, 'BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!' Adam Sandler's all like 'This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?' Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like 'I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol' but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.  8/10 Needs more Adrian.
504	If you're looking for a positive review, then you're in the wrong place, HOWEVER, if you're here for a tremendous chicken Stir Fry recipe, THEN LOOK NO FURTHER!  - Serves 4 - 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook - 325 calories / serving - Healthy  INGREDIENTS:  - 1 orange, zested and juiced - 2tbsp soy sauce - 2tbsp sesame oil - 250g (8oz) tender stem broccoli - 5cm (2in) piece root ginger - 1tbsp sunflower oil - 1 garlic clove, finely sliced - 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced - 150g Straight To Wok Noodles - 400g (13oz) chicken fillet, cut into thin slices  METHOD  Step 1 - Mix together the orange zest and juice, soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside.

505	Very entertaining game!  Visuals are very decent: 6.5/10  Music is great: 10/10  Story is all right: 9/10 (if you like horror/mystery genre) Voice acting is good: 7/10 The animations and the cutscenes is where this game falls short: 3/10 (bad lip syncing, awkward hand gesticulations and head bobbing, unpolished facial expressions: all these make this game a parody, not a horror)  Gameplay is solid, I didn't encounter any bugs. This is basically a puzzle game when you're looking for ways to eliminate people by making it seem like an accident. The gameplay is very linear, you have only one way to make it right. I can't rate it, this kind of games is not my usual cup of tea.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but mainly for its story aspect, we had quite a few laughs with my girlfriend while watching the cut-scenes or observing interactions between NPCs.  There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to solve the puzzles.  My personal score: 6/10. Recomended if on sale under $10.   
506	Waste of money
507	I feel that this game has no freedome of playstyle. It is very boring and I would not recommed it to anyone who likes to stay awake while playing a game!
508	A-MAZE-ING! You are the little kid from The Omen. It's brilliant.
509	Killed a person, put my toys away. Killed another person, helped mommy. Killed yet another person and helped my mom with laundry.  She called me a good boy. I called it a night.
510	just dont waste your money on this game

515	Game is highly frustrating because in 99% of your time you have no clue what to do, until you go to google, then again frustration, pain and time waste, then google again. The name of a game should be 'Find an item in tremendously large mansion'  Same issue like with Legend of Grimrock II - unintuitively hidden quest/puzzles/items are just a fun killers.  what a shame, this game could be such a great experience
516	Very entertaining game!  Visuals are very decent: 6.5/10  Music is great: 10/10  Story is all right: 9/10 (if you like horror/mystery genre) Voice acting is good: 7/10 The animations and the cutscenes is where this game falls short: 3/10 (bad lip syncing, awkward hand gesticulations and head bobbing, unpolished facial expressions: all these make this game a parody, not a horror)  Gameplay is solid, I didn't encounter any bugs. This is basically a puzzle game when you're looking for ways to eliminate people by making it seem like an accident. The gameplay is very linear, you have only one way to make it right. I can't rate it, this kind of games is not my usual cup of tea.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but mainly for its story aspect, we had quite a few laughs with my girlfriend while watching the cut-scenes or observing interactions between NPCs.  There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to solve the puzzles.  My personal score: 6/10. Recomended if on sale under $10.   
517	just dont waste your money on this game
518	Fantastic game!
519	I got to carry underwear to the laundry room. 11/10
520	I really wanted this to be better... disappointed that I bought it...
521	I feel like a psychopath        That's really high
522	Soothing music and backdrop 11/10 Recommended for casual gamers
523	I am not impressed. It gets pretty boring and repetitive pretty fast. Including the idea is rather bland, simple minded, unoriginal, and many aspects of the game are very dull. Many of its 'missions' have too little guidance and leaves too much for you to figure out on your own by some miracle. And there are also poor graphics which should not effect gameplay however in numerous occasions graphics glitches occur and materials often clip. There is alot that needed to be worked on in this game, it may have some potential to be decent...somewhere in there, but I don't see it. I strongly recomend that you do not play this game. Honestly, this game should be free, there is absolutely no reason at all for it to be $ 9.99. If you were to pay one dollar for this, you would be paying two dollars too much.
524	2/10
525	.
526	Lousy controls, repetitive missions, bugs, underwhelming nudity, welcome to hellâ¦.
527	Lucius starts out promising, but completely fails to deliver any interesting gameplay. The entire game feels like a tutorial, holding your hand and slowly introducing new concepts on the way. Every 'puzzle' is either incredibly obvious or makes no sense, but is either way handed to you. The various powers you are given are only useful in very specific situations and sometimes plain don't work since the puzzle does not call for them. All in all, highly disappointing from something so promising.
528	So this is what it's like to control a whale.  It's creative, but what it really boils down to is a 'Use the hints to press E on something' simulator.
529	Lucius is a slightly interesting, yet generally bad game. The story centers around Lucius, the devil's alleged son who has been asked to murder people in demonic ways. It's not combat-oriented, you just cause accidents to hurt/kill people.  It's new, but also quite bad. The story is lame, and the dialogue is drawn out and boring. Gameplay itself is excruciatingly awful. Killing random people by locking them in a freezer is not only unnecessarily gruesome, it's also not fun at all.  Don't get me started on the animations and graphics. Not that it's like a bad port, but they just did a terrible job modeling the people; mouths and voices are also not in sync.  Overall, a waste of my money.
530	Worth price of purchase to play a stone faced baby who spies on people boning and bathing.
531	.
532	The controls are nigh-impossible to work with. On top of which, the game lags incredibly hard. Would not buy again.
533	This is the worst version of Home Alone I've ever played.
534	'Yawn' Go and play GTA 5 Instead.
535	So much wasted potential.... 3/10
536	I died February 16, 2013.  true story.   or was it March 28, 2012  I can't seem to remember.
537	Don't touch this game, unless it's a few bucks. It has some bad optimzation issues, boring/tedious gameplay that just isn't fun. It's a unique game, but there isn't much there to warrant a play-through.
538	So much wasted potential.... 3/10
539	is a good game Good story but when you kill a black people is kinda' racist you know?
540	For those seeking to establish a religious career.
541	Well I can't really look at this game objectively since I watched a playthrough first but I love the game's story. I mean who wouldn't wanna be an innocent little kid murdering everyone around you without getting suspected? xD (Just kidding)  Anyway I love it, my kind of game! :)
542	yay im son of satan this is going to be fun!....... god this game sucks..
543	This game is broken, feels rushed and look like absolute GARBAGE....4 hours in I encountered glitch tht completely breaks the game. Now i need to start from the beginning...........dont waste you're time on this game
544	This game is so bad.  DONT BUY THIS GAME!
545	Lucius is a game about a little boy named Lucius who, on his 6th birthday, is approached by Satan, who is apparently his father. Lucius then begins killing inhabitants of the mansion in different ways in order to give his father souls. I was very excited to play this game, especially when I bought it on sale for $1.49, but I ended up disappointed. I felt that the storyline was very generic, and since I played with a controller, I also felt that the controls were sort of awkward, particularly when using telekinesis. One of the things I found most annoying was that the instructions on what to do were sometimes very vague. For instance, when asked to take the trash out, not only would I have to go searching for the trash, but also for a place to take it to. Then at one point the game hinted that I should find some way to mess with one of the inhabitants, but I spent 30 minutes running around having no clue how to do it. On top of that, the map was sort of confusing and the game crashed the first time I tried to change the resolution. This game is really fun whenever I know what I'm doing, but it gets frustrating when I spend thirty minutes looking for one item or place because I'm not very observant. The graphics are really good but I wouldn't spend more than $5 on this game.
546	They took my ball
547	Boring game with no choices to make. AI has terrible line of sight issues, detecting you through walls and doors sometimes.
548	&gt;Woke up &gt;Slapped my mum's â¥â¥â¥â¥ &gt;She said 'Lucius, clean your room' &gt;Stole Gene's matches &gt;Cleaned my room and got 25 good boy points &gt;Stole a screwdriver and broke the oven &gt;Slapped her â¥â¥â¥â¥ again  &gt;She told me to brush my teeth &gt;I did and got another 25 good boy points &gt;Gene lit his cigarette and the oven blew his head off &gt;Mum walks past while I'm standing in a pentagram &gt;Game Over  10 / 10 would get rekt by me mum again 
549	Awesome game,looks good, but there are to many conection problems. I dc'd a few times to many.  I'm gonna wait for the full release.
550	A pedophile touched me after this ;(
551	Nice game 8.9/10
552	Great Game!! I feel so evil while playing this!! I sooo reccommend!!!
553	Totes just became the antichrist, What a good way to spend a sunday.
554	Game for such christianists as Judas actually was.  66/6
555	Totes just became the antichrist, What a good way to spend a sunday.
556	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this house is big
557	I love this game but it doesnt tell you how to kill the people you have to figure it out 1 guy took me atleast 30 or 40 minutes
558	Pretty interesting concept
559	its Unical game
560	Negatives:  - Graphics quality &amp; frame rate. - voice acting - gameplay and level design.  I paid around Â£1 in a bundle acceptable price.
561	Lucius is an unpolished game with a unique setting. The game is totally linear and there is no freedom to try different things. It's no Hitman. It plays more like a point'n click game so there is absolutely no challenge at all once you know what to do. The puzzles were either very easy or just frustrating imo. I wouldnât call any of them âchallengingâ.  I ran into some bad AI interactions and minor bugs as well. The npcs repeated the same lines over and over again and they often spoke on top of each other. Towards the end it got annoying to hear Nancy (the main characterâs mom) constantly ask you to do laundry when I had already completed the chore very early on. The game crashed a few times and one time I clipped through the staircase wall to the outside of the manor. I also ran into many minor flaws which made the game feel unpolished.  Still, it was a somewhat enjoyable experience and worth the 1,89â¬ I paid for it. In my opinion you should only consider buying Lucius if itâs on big sale and the premise sounds interesting to you.
562	fun game but sadly not worth it. too much lag in game even with everything on low and im above the requirements. not happy at all.
563	CHRISTIAN REVIEW: This game can suck my motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing DlCK EAT â¥â¥â¥â¥ ANTICHRIST â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥

567	fun game but sadly not worth it. too much lag in game even with everything on low and im above the requirements. not happy at all.
568	10/10 Jesus and barney simulator
569	This game felt like it was made in a few hours. It's just really, really bad. If you want to kill people in more creative ways, I'd highly recommend the Hitman-series instead. I got it for 3 bucks though, so thank god for that. I also got some of the money back by selling the Trading Cards.
570	Great concept, graphics for a game like this it's okay. You are Lucius, a little boy and a killer. It's like (Hitboy) ;) and movies like 'The Omen'  You can open every drawer and cabinet, turn on/off every light. You can unlock 5 specials like telekinesis. You have an inventory and you can combine stuff. People talk to you and if you listen you can get infos about your next kill. If you finishes a job you get a final sequence with your kill which is mostly very violently and brutal bloody. Not for kids... but with kids. XD   -Points for too lineary story. Every kill has only 1 solution. Find this solution is sometimes really hard. You have to check out the big house for every little piece you maybe need. Try everything and you will find your way.  Another -Point for the ending. 1st it was terrible hard, 2nd it was harder if you dont know what to do and 3rd, it was too short. Final Fight and immediatly Credits.  Price is ok and i was entertained. 7/10
571	Murder and boobs
572	Indie Homicidal Delight  There is no reason not to get this on sale, unless you're under 18 years old.
573	If you loved the movie The Omen, be it the original or the 2006 remake, then you will most likely love Lucius.  The game and story are extremely linear, and by that I mean that there are zero deviations whatsoever. So don't go in expecting you're going to sandbox murder people as a kid. You'll always be within the mansion or in the garden outside, so deal with it and the lack of side missions. There also isn't much in the way of music, but that's okay; it makes it easier to throw on some metal to set the mood.  Now, the different methods in which you execute people are absolutely visceral, however pre-conceived they may be. You get to eff up a ton of people in the game, and each person dies their own unique death. There's a decent amount of challenge involved during some of the kill scenarios, especially more towards the end of the game. Stealth is key to not getting caught at times, while other times you simply have to figure out how to lure folks to their demise. Did I mention your father, Satan, will visit you from time to time and bestow new abilities unto you for doing his bidding?  The controls can be somewhat clunky at times but it's not too awful. It's a minor inconvenience and a small price to pay for a game as unique as Lucius. It's a total Omen simulator, from start to finish. The price of $10.99 CAD is a steal for a game that will last you a good 15-20 hours, although Lucius is found in bundles quite often and has been known to go on sale for a whopping $1.00. So ask yourself... do you like horror, murder and gore? If you answered yes, this game is for you.   Rating:  4.0/5.0  - Excellent, highly worth playing.
574	I was not happy with my old review, so I am making another one. Lucius is a bad game. Lucius is a VERY bad game. In Lucius, your objective is to kill a specific target without being caught, Like in Hitman. However, in Lucius you are given no choice as to how to kill your target. There is only one way to take out your target, and its usually the most obscure, annoying, and hidden way you could possibly imagine. What also sucks is how you never get to 'experiment' to learn your surroundings. Walk up to some guy with a gun and shoot him? Instant game over. You dont get to see the reaction of what you have done, you just get that satisfying 'GAME OVER' we all love. It is also a buggy mess, ive had to repeat levels numerous times because a bug occured making the level unbeatable. Dont waste your time or money.
575	Don't waste your time.This game is soooo freakin BORING!!!I had to take a nap after playing.
576	its good i recommend it

580	Okay. so pretty pointless, the veiws make it hard to sewe because the size of the kids stupid head is always in the way, the graphics look like a N64 game &amp; it was soooooo boring, I will never get those hours back! Thank you for wasting my time! (That was sarcasiom, I hate you for wasting my time &amp; hope you fall of the grand cannonion!)
581	Very poorly optimized. Couldn't even run it with my gtx 860m at medium, no Vsync settings.
582	Devilishly good fun. ^-^ Can't wait for the second installment.
583	When Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966, nobody expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy but everything changed on Luciusâ 6th Birthday,  when his true calling was revealed to him.   Equipped with supernatural powers, take control of Lucius as he begins his blood filled tour of horror through his own house, using Hellâs powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that will minimize the population of the Dante Manor one by one by one.

WORD OF ADVICE DO NOT PUNISH YOURSELF BY HAVING THIS IN YOUR LIBRARY  NO WAY IN HELL IS THIS WORTH A SINGLE CENT!
588	I would give this a 10 out of 10 but im dead
589	Good Story. 4/5
590	fun game but not worth, becuse it last like 8 hours...  (and the game has some bugs at the end . but you can be lucky and not get any as well)  Loved the game otherwise...
591	...Huh I guess I liked it.
592	This game lacks absolutely on being funny. The big problem here is that you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA of what to do and you find yourself wandering like an idiot in the house. Which is, as you may argue, NOT funny. The game lacks totally on giving informations about itself and about how to acomplish on tasks... Decent graphics, meh for the voice acting, definitely boring. Don't buy.

598	Good fun, although pretty buggy at times...   
599	Completely evil and completely twisted 10/10
600	Lucius may have itâs flaws, yes. The graphics and the voicework needed more work. The gameplay can get boring after some time and doesnât leave a lot of room for your own choice but all in all I actually felt like an evil little boy. I actually felt like I was playing the game of The Omen and I had a lot of fun in the process of killing my new virtual family. So if you are a little sadistic like me and liked The Omen and games like Manhunt, Lucius is definitly worth picking up.
601	It's creepy, satan talks to you in your room, and you get to kill people in all sorts of fun ways. I've always wanted to play it cause it looked cool and I am not disappointed.
602	Bought this one on a whim, tempted by its description. No regrets, lads. Lucius has this nice feeling to it. Something like first Mafia and Max Payne 2. There's no shooting and you play as a six year old spawn of Lucifer born on 6 6 1966(jesus...) but resemblance in serving the plot and world is collosal. Gameplay straight out of Hitman series with some supernatural powers.  Had a lot of pleasure playin this, it was a one day blast without a rest. Not every day you are the bad guy without morals, or are you?
603	Near-broken game design is saved by a fantastic environment and the novelty of the story. Play it, but play it with a walkthrough.
604	Excellent Finnish depressiveness simulator.
605	Love this game. It has a few tricky moments and the occasional tough puzzle, but any game like this should in my opinion.  I'm excited to play the second one!
606	Needs quick saves as i am stuck trying to sneak around in the dark to find my Grandfather . YES , i did it .....nope , i must sneak to get super glue and back . Grrrrrrrr . Overall , it has been fun
607	This is a short, demented puzzle game where you play as the son of the devil as he goes about his father's requests to kill off everyone he knows. Surprisingly challenging puzzles can be find here. Clever levels in general, lots of achievements, and a decent sized map to explore. Definitely pick it up on sale!
608	This is a really fun game that gives you the feeling of being the bad guy. You do the harm, you are the charackter that all the others should fear. To me, this was very exiting. I have never played a game like this before. Absolutly worth a try, you will absolutly love it!
609	An interesting game concept; play as a demonic possessed kid and kill off the household. It's kinda like playing the Sims if you were Satan.  You free roam around the house looking for a way to kill your next target, set everything up, then let the brutal cutscene commence. Most of the puzzles involve just setting up the murder in the house, which the game kinda helps you with so its not like you run around clicking everything. Some of the murders are a bit mild, like you just poisen them and watch them die. Then you get to most of the others which escalate to the level of sawing a guys face in half with a saw. So if you like gore, this might get you off a bit.  Though the game is short and can be completed pretty quickly, its best to wait for a sale to buy. Even though the game is kinda amusing and interesting, it's content is still not worth $20.
610	Darkness, evil and fun make this game a fantastic play. I love the aspect of being the evil protagonist along with kill everyone without getting caught. Highly recommended play, I only wish there were more games like this out there.
611	A really fun game, there are some bugs... But worth the money
612	The graphics are ok. The plot it's pretty nice. It's cool that you have to do bad things and kill people to be more powerfull. The SFX and BG Music are good. The movements are kinda weird... Lucius looks like he is walking on a slippery floor
613	This game is awesome! it has a good atmosphere, and the puzzels are amazing! it kind of reminds me of the movie The Omen... great movie BTW it has Omen (being a 5 year old boy) and Lucius (a 6 year old boy) killing other people, but Lucius has Lucifers powers. And i like that a lot lol. but if a 6 year old with Lucifers powers ever tries to kill me IRL i would probally cry ;-; but like i said, Amazing game and i would really recommend that you play this! &lt;3
614	I play as the Devil's son.  Yum, yum.
615	This game is not about graphics nor about how long or short it is. The game is set in the perfect mood. One thing I don't like its the idea of how slow you are even when running. I can say this game at least gets a 8/10 and that's because it can also be a tad boring at times. The ending of the game was not cool, mostly because you are left hanging with the 'what happened?' and it isn't funny. But over all, I believe you should give it a try
616	Get to play as Satan's son. 11/10 - IGN
617	Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution.   Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.
618	If you have ever been curious about what an antichrist would be like as a child, Here ya go. Seriously!
619	I loved this game since I saw a youtuber play it and just had to play it myself. the only small problem I had was figuring out what to do at times
620	i absolutley loved this game it was a puzzle and a action but a bit gory not recommended for some one with a weak stoumach but another good thing in the game was the enviroment there is a huge mansion and then the yard and all the rooms i mean like you have to kill your teacher so you have to talk to people to get stuff to kill your teacher the sneaking is a bit hard tho if you are bad at that sort of stuff(like me)but ya a great game over all
621	Lucius is a game very heavily based on the movie 'The Omen'. It's a great game that places you in the role of the devil's child Lucius. Despite it looking like a horror game, it is not really scary since you are the threat that's killing people on the go. You get a big mansion with a lot of staff in which you will kill them one by one in seperate chapters.  Overall the game feels like a puzzle game, and a pretty tough game at that. I really enjoyed playing it. I'm just going to list some positives and negatives below:  YES Great idea for a game Big location Gruesome deaths A lot of backstory on most characters Awesome demonic powers So much death!  NO A lot of bugs and glitches Controls make you feel like you are driving a tank instead of controlling a 6-year old Bad voice acting for some characters Not scary Very linear  Despite the games awesomeness, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. In the second chapter, the mom kept walking into the door leasing outside, despite it being locked. Also, the telekineses power is very hard to use most of the time. There have also been a couple of instances in which I hard to start a chapter again because people would not die when they were supposed to, or stayed put when they were supposed to wak out of the room.   Despite all of this, Lucius is an awesome little game that puts you in the bad guy's shoes. A part 2 is on its way, so let's hope the developers have learned from their mistakes and will release an awesome sequal!
622	Impressive game, which puts you in a skin of a child posessed by the devil. Child needs to give souls to his father - Lucifer, by creating 'accidents' that take lives of people around big mansion he is living. It is very cruel game, that shows every death in slow-mo and with maximum details. And it purely unique and very fun to play. Beaten it in one evening.
623	I love this game,is so perfect,but the final....I wanted more
624	The premise for this game is pretty effing fantastic. You're the antichrist. Reborn into the child of a wealthy couple. Hellbent on doing the devil's bidding and fulfilling your prophecy as a killer, you set about racking up the numbers by offing kitchen staff and houseguests alike. Highly recommended to game collectors.
625	Lucius is a game that puts you in control of a child, the child of Lucifer to be specific. Without spoiling the story, you are the antichrist, making sacrifices to Satan in fun, creative, and very gruesome ways.   *Gameplay*
626	Absoutly Stunning Creative Ways to kill people.
627	Best to play this when no one is home. killing people 10/10 gameplay 10/10 using various items in mysterious ways to kill interesting 10/10 movement 8/10 (game gave me headache from glitchyness in tight conrers occasionally)  I reccomnend getting onsale as Lucious 2 recently came out but this game is very good too.  not as easy as you would think.
628	To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.  Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.   Grab this game when it's on sale!
629	I'm slightly depressed I actually spent money on this game. Why... why would a second game be made.
630	You play Lucius, on a quest to grow your powers and please your hellish father by giving him souls.. And of course you need to find ways to release those souls!   I enjoyed most of the puzzles and challenges to accomplish this but lost patience with a few. Some of them were obvious but still left a deliciously evil satisfaction when you completed the puzzle. One or two left me without a clue where to begin.. This may have been more me.   The game takes place entirely in the mansion and leaves you feeling lost when you first start to explore (you get a map though!... and a tricycle in which to travel faster at one point too). It felt very open, but the gameplay and story was still linear. You had opportunities to find some objects before they were needed so this was nice during the course of exploring and looking for what you actually did need.  The voice acting was alright, but the faces of the characters were completely wooden. Lucius was completely emotionless.. more statue than evil boy.. But maybe this is part of the 'evil boy' look? I thought Lucifer (wooden) face and voice were the best 3:)  There were only two or three points where being able to run/move quickly and aim correctly were critical... It was a small very minor exercise in frustration to get these parts done right but still done easily. Lucius' running and riding the trike were about as good as you could expect for a puzzle game.  I would probably get this while on sale vs a full price, but if you enjoy short puzzle games like this, then it might be worth your full $19.99. I am definitely excited for the next Lucius game. I hoping the developers add on this and bring us a smoother moving and more complex story with even more challenging puzzle.   8 of 10
631	Got pushed outside of front door on last mission. Last boss(?) couldn't get me.  10/10
632	Definitely worth getting, its like a puzzel game, but you kill people.
633	Oh man I just love this game to Death (literally ;) )   You're a little boy going around a huge gorgious mansion getting souls for your daddy Lucifer? Sounds gruesome, it really is though. But for a murdering type game I find this rather fantastic, can't stop playing it.
634	Such a great game
635	It's better conceptually than it is in execution. The house is in essentially the same state for a majority of the game, and even though months have passed by in game, some characters stay in the exact same spot saying the exact same things until you end up killing them. It's a good thing that figuring out the murder puzzles and be quite fun and challenging at times.  Lucius reminds of the old flash games I'd play, but the graphics and mechanics are obviously way better. Much like those games, though, I wouldn't expect to get more than a day's worth of fun out of it.  Try it out. Kill some people. Witness the storyline. Expect to uninstall it because there's not that much replay value. It's worth it for a run through, though.
636	a good way to spend your time being evil 7/10
637	666
638	The Power of Christ Compels You! - To buy this game.. like now. No seriously its fun!
639	Rly nice game
640	This game was made for me.
641	You can still play this if you belive in god  LOL
642	This game centres around the mis-adventures of a sweet 6 year old boy whos life gets turned upside down.  Fun game. quite glitchy but for the price i enjoyed it. Looking forward to the sequal.
643	yes its nice game
644	I have enjoyed this game so far and i'm glad I bought it, but I probably only bought it because it's on sale, but either way this game is a good horror game in my opinion.
645	An interesting game concept but it gets frustrating and tiresome at times. It's definitely something I would recommend, but only on sale.
646	I liked this game.
647	Great idea, sub-par execution.  Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime 'achievements' to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box 'hitman'-esque game.  Perhaps the devil really is in the details?
648	Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20. It is exactly what it says it is. A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist. Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.
649	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.
650	Did you ever watch that movie called The Omen? This is pretty much that.
651	I love this game,is so perfect,but the final....I wanted more
652	Impressive game, which puts you in a skin of a child posessed by the devil. Child needs to give souls to his father - Lucifer, by creating 'accidents' that take lives of people around big mansion he is living. It is very cruel game, that shows every death in slow-mo and with maximum details. And it purely unique and very fun to play. Beaten it in one evening.
653	Lucius!Idon't think that is a Horror game at all,because is not scary;I think is a half adventure and half puzzle game,in fact you have to find ways to kill every member of your family with various infernal powers and objects,that sometimes are easy to find,sometimes not.  This game reminds the 'Omen' movies that are a must to watch if you like horror movies with satanic characters.  I played 10.5 hours to end the story with a bit of exploration and to complete all the second quests and,finally,I think that Lucius is a very good game to play,but not spend 20â¬(yes,I'm Italian :D ) to buy this game!Wait for some sales,like I did!  Thanks for the attention!Bye ;)
654	This is a fantastic game if have ever laughed at any of the death scense from Omen or thought that the first Exorstist movie was funny for trying to be scary.
655	Im not into horror games usually but this game I found really fun and I would recommend getting it.
656	fun and creepy and funny-ish
657	Monotonous killings, and only a few ways to do so makes this game rather lackluster. After waking up and seeing old Satan himself telling a 10 year to go do the dirty deeds is entertaining in itself. Sadly after trying to sneak to kill someone It is dissapointing to be caught by your mom who scholds you and tells you to march right back to bed. If there were more customization options then the linear story and powers this might have done amazingly. 4 / 10
658	I find this game boring soo far soory but damn I am getting sleepy playing this. It has some sort of potential for fun game but I dunno not for me it's sketched to much, with plenty bugs which are making comedy of this. For few bucks you can try it. I will play it for few more hours, but my immersion got destroyed and story is not that engaging either.
659	Stuck To The Wall   10/10 Would Stuck Again ðð
660	Not very fun at all. 
661	Worthless abilities, glitches everywhere, way too easy and one of the worst endings that I've ever seen.
662	This game really warmed my heart.
663	While an interactive Omen sounds promising on paper, this game sags under the weight of bad level design and bad character models and lip syncing (not to mention some pretty uninspiring voice acting).  It's most cardinal sin of all, and the one thing the game should have going for it, is the actual kills and puzzles are straightforward and bland. This trip to hell is not worth taking.
664	I liked this game a lot, and it reminded me of the cult classics 70's movies ''The Omen'' and ''The Exorcist''. Also, the methods of killings are original and Lucius's powers are awesome, especially mind control and combustion. To enjoy better the game while playing it, I recommend the listening of heavy metal bands who uses satanic themes (Slayer, Mercyful fate, Black Sabbath, etc.)
665	Very cool :)
666	You play as the 6 year old spawn of Satan, and every month or so, you target a victim (well, the game targets one for you) and by ways of a puzzle you get him killed, so as to claim his soul for Satan. In return, Satan promises to make you stronger, and every once in a while will grant you a new ability or upgrade the level of one you already have. The abilities are senseless however (more on that later), and solving the puzzles so as to get to the killing or murdering is more of a chore (even if the 'rewarding cutscene' is entertaining). Speaking of chores, the game even has some for you. Luckily they don't seem to be mandatory, though the game doesn't really let you know at first. Completing enough boring chores, which will have you running an errand for someone or looking for an item you will only have the vaguest idea of where to find, would grant you presents. Which I couldn't find any use for.  The entire game is based in one big mansion (it does have a garden I guess), with some new parts of the mansion unlocking as you progress through the levels. Each time you wake up, the game gives you a new target. It's an interesting thing to call this one a horror title, because you are actually playing the horror yourself, and that doesn't help the game scare you in any way. Though some of the deaths are gruesome, the poor graphics and crippled animations almost make them funny. They're meant to be rather cringy though. The premise of the game is an interesting one, but it isn't bolstered by you playing it. The plot has something going for it with an interesting overarching theme of a detective trying to investigate what the hell is going on in the mansion, but it isn't especially good, it's just one of two things solid about this game. The other being that the voice acting is surprisingly well delivered, though it is too held back - by poor animations and character models.  The graphics are poor. Beyond outdated character models, bad lightning effects, the game is lacking in environmental shadows. The textures are at least decent. The animations are outdated, but by outdated standards, not the worst (especially the face animaitions). Sometimes they warrant a giggle or two. The biggest problem with the presentation however is to do with tonemaps, with many crushed blacks and oversaturated filters that make the game uneasy on the eyes, also during gameplay, it just doesn't look good and much of the detail is lost as a result (the problem is visible in the screenshots). No AA options is also a problem, and the game doesn't seem to support DSR.   The mansion is rather dull. You are restricted to the same, boring environment, which is rather big and confusing, with many rooms you'll find trouble keeping track of, simply filled with furniture and very little of things interesting to look at or find. The map has no useful indication of where a person is likely to be. The game does nothing to help you keep track of your objectives, or pursue them. It is a point and click puzzle in the most traditional way, with no freedom whatsoever to solving the puzzles. While that is fine, the game has some weird, or unintuitive solutions to some puzzles. Many times you'll just run around the house not sure where to go, what to do, and you will have to resort to a guide.  The abilities, and their levels, are pointless. While you can use telekinesis on objects instead of picking them up with your hand, every puzzle and every interaction relating to a puzzle is specific, you cannot decide which power to use in order to kill your victim, it's all predetermined. The game could just as well keep it more simple by tying your abilities into one button which would serve this one purpose of 'supernatural' tinkering with puzzle elements. The levels of those abilities also make no sense, there is no significance to the level of the ability you are using while solving puzzles and they are gained through story-progression anyway.  The fact that you have no freedom in solving the puzzles or killing victims in different ways is not a bad thing on its own, although that would have made the game a lot more interesting to play. The problem is that the linear puzzles put in the game are boring, and like many adventure point and clicks they suffer from not making a whole lot of sense sometimes, or not being very intuitive at least, because the solutions are so specific, having to do with items scattered around a huge mansion you'll have trouble finding.   The mechanics of the game are also cluncky, and the controls suffer from the third person perspective - you play a short character, so sometimes to use items you'd have to go into weird camera angels, making it difficult to see the item you are trying to get to. Sometimes your character blocks the view of items you are searching in or controlling, and picking things up and moving them around and all the puzzles would have been easier to control in first person view.   All in all, the game is simply sub-par on almost every level or aspect of it, disappointing in many regards and only pleasantly surprising in plot and voice acting.
667	gameplay is not too hard and regardless of bugs and inconvinient control, the plot is easy to make me addicted. 8/10
668	good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is    when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says 'now, you don't need matches!' immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.    when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up    pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hunters' to my parents and housemates.   
669	Very Good Game. Epic story! Everything is perfect except 2 achivments: Play 20 hrs and Play 40 Hrs.. There is no content to play the game for 40 hrs..
670	It's better conceptually than it is in execution. The house is in essentially the same state for a majority of the game, and even though months have passed by in game, some characters stay in the exact same spot saying the exact same things until you end up killing them. It's a good thing that figuring out the murder puzzles and be quite fun and challenging at times.  Lucius reminds of the old flash games I'd play, but the graphics and mechanics are obviously way better. Much like those games, though, I wouldn't expect to get more than a day's worth of fun out of it.  Try it out. Kill some people. Witness the storyline. Expect to uninstall it because there's not that much replay value. It's worth it for a run through, though.
671	I'll recommend only if your computer is not as â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up as mine. This game works in slow motion and the I can't do the 1st mission, which is lock the maid in the freezer, byt locking the door when she enters to clean. The game is bugged for me as she doesn't enter the freezer and stay on the door cleaning and I can't close it and lock it. If your computer is as â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up as mine, so please do not buy it, cause it will be a waste of money. *sighs*
672	Creative, fun and brings out the devil inside you. What else can anyone want in a game!!! 7.5/10
673	So very interesting but buggy. You play as the Antichrist, a kid who murders everyone. It is dark and gruesome but the graphics are not amazing so the gross parts are not too bad. It's buggy as well and hard. I could not beat it without watching play throughs. All that being said it's still a super cool game pick it up at 50% off.
674	A really good game, and very interesting as well. I plan to get the sequel.
675	Love it a few glitches but amazing game!
676	It doesn't really give you free roam and the puzzles it wants you to solve can only be done one way and that way is the most annoying because you have to wait until your victim gives you hits like 'I'ma go fix the piano.' Not worth asking price. I believe I paid 5 dollars for it on sale. I'd wait for that again.   (Edit) now that I think about it, it was actually a gift... But it was on sale for 5 dollars at one point.
677	The game is really short, I finished it in 2.8h, but it was really nice to play. It's hard to understand what we need to do but we always find a way.
678	This game is buged sometimes like when i had to kill Agnes. At night when i break the lamp this mother****** cop always spot me. I've spend an hour on it without succed.
679	Low budget and somewhat on the easy side (took me just about 5 hours to beat) but if you are a fan of horror movies like The Omen (which is the obvious inspiration here) I recommended it on a sale price.
680	Despite the gameplay seeming too linear and samey, after picking it up discounted it's an enjoyable to kill time with..and people..
681	thought this game is an open-world game because of the video. I WAS WRONG!
682	This games so creepy :v
683	This game really helped.
684	This game is a great game its solo but fun!
685	In this story there are no good endings unless you're the spawn of hell that survives and misdirects the blame for everything like a strategic murderer such as Lucius.  I don't recommend this game for the weak-minded, or weak-spirited.     The Story~
686	This Game is very creepy and fun to play! You feel like you are the star villian in a b rated horror flick. Must buy for horror movie fans. Game play reminds me of some tittles I played in 90's , where you were always trying to figure out what items went with what and once you found them where to use them. I plan on buying 2nd one hope its is as good as this one.
687	This game centres around the mis-adventures of a sweet 6 year old boy whos life gets turned upside down.  Fun game. quite glitchy but for the price i enjoyed it. Looking forward to the sequal.
688	You can still play this if you belive in god  LOL
689	Fun game. It's nice to be the creepy little kid and not running from him for a change.
690	Great game but is very difficult... at least for me.
691	One of a few games where you don't play as good character, but as bad character. Riddles are sometimes quite hard, but with using the thing, that most of us wearing on our necks, the riddles can be solved without bigger complications. Dante Manor is a big residence that's worth of exploring. Warning: Innocent people die in this game :-)  Verdict: 9/10
692	Scariest part of this game is finding a stray lego block in the non-plastics section of my toybox.
693	Best game ever 10/10.  And this was the most usefull review in the history of reviews.
694	Wow what can i say?  One of the best single-player games i ever played before..  Amazing soundtracks and the graphics are just amazing..  U play as a 6 y old little antichrist boy..  Is fun as hell i completed the game in 6 h do so its kinda short :( I would say 666/666
695	If you hail Satan I would recommend this game
696	Was not prepared for lewd scenes.  10/10
697	10/10 would sacrifice to Satan again.
698	6/10  At first couple hours, I thought this game is quite boring because how the game machanic it is. It doesn't give you freely how you gonna kill. It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze. It take you to survey around a very long time until you familiarize with. -linearity with killing method for each chapter.  btw, still recommend this game when it sale. (yep, I got this game on sale for 1 usd)
699	Like hitman,but with kids
700	It's like The Omen inside of a video game...Need I say more?
701	Overall, I enjoyed Lucius and the funny moments that arose when I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes that roll after each kill. It did glitch (cutscene wouldn't activate) for me in the last chapter, but other then that my gameplay experience was smooth sailing. If you're not a fan of games with linear and restricting gameplay then this isn't the game for you. Most of your time is spent looking for items to kill your target with. Also, unlike Hitman which i've seen this game compared to there is only one way to kill each target. The puzzles for the most part are pretty straight forward, and not much of a challenge. After the first couple of kills it gets a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time in the world of Lucius, and do not regret my purchase. If this game is on sale I would highly recommend picking it up.
702	So what is this game about; you are playing as the son of devil 'Lucius' and in every chapter you have to kill one person in a specific way. There are 18 or 19 chapters. I liked the cutscenes also, everytime you kill someone there is a cutscene. I had a few glitches and at the beginning i wasted like hour because i couldnt see my mouse on the screen. I couldnt play this game full screen, so i had to window it. Sometimes i had to restart the game because it glitched on some parts. I got stuck to walls and objects if i was near them, but it only happened like 2 or 3 times. I am fan of horror and adventure games, so i love it. I like the surroundings, i like the mansion, i like the characters of the game and i love the soundtrack also. Even tho i had few glitches and problems, i gave this a recommend because i think people who like horror or adventure games may like this game also, as i did. &lt;:
703	(Spoiler Alerts) Ok so the game is fun but there are some huge freaking problems. My main one being: THAT CHAPTER 05B IS BROKEN! There you are, awake at night to get rat poison, and on your way to get it, your mom wakes up and you have to hide. Thats reasonable right? Except that once you go out of hiding when she walks downstairs, you can still somehow get spotted by her through the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ FLOOR! Then once you get past that, you probably won't be beating that chapter, because you ave to break a light to distract a detective. You can break it and he walks into the darkness to see if someones there, so you should be able to enter the room, right? Nope, because the detective will turn and see you as soon as you make it within 2 feet of the door and SPOT YOU INSTANTLY!!! FIX THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥!!! Other than that though, from what I've payed so far cuz I still can't beat chapter 05b, its fun and I reccomend it.
704	This is a short, demented puzzle game where you play as the son of the devil as he goes about his father's requests to kill off everyone he knows. Surprisingly challenging puzzles can be find here. Clever levels in general, lots of achievements, and a decent sized map to explore. Definitely pick it up on sale!
705	Love this game. It has a few tricky moments and the occasional tough puzzle, but any game like this should in my opinion.  I'm excited to play the second one!
706	I saw to people doing it.
707	I liked this game.
708	-saw mom trying to walk thru a closed door -got stuck on the floor like if i was swimming in it -sneaked past mom while making all the noises in the world -got stuck in a level because the detective decided to see me because I was 1cm left to the spot i should be (what?) -had to take the garbage out but lost it in the middle of the living room, during day time, because the room was too dark (even tho if you look from outside, it's quite bright inside). -killed someone instantly with rat poison, even tho that stuff takes it's time to actually kill someone (right?)  i don't even know anymore
709	To Be honest i got this in the sale for a couple of Pounds, i have only just played it because i thought it looked a bit old and boring. i was not wrong, without the the help of youtube walkthroughs on some of the tasks, this game would be near impossible and my god that house is impossible to find your way around. spent a long time wandering around looking for one room and ending up in the place i started, only to get lost again. but after i got the idea and figured out the complicated ways you have to do everything it wasn't so bad and it has a good concept, i will be getting the 2nd one just to see how they have improved it and to be honest i can't wait!
710	Awesome concept but objectives are very vauge
711	The lag in this game needs to be fixed
712	Abnormal game... so dizzy during playing. However it is a good game with logical mission.
713	An interesting game concept but it gets frustrating and tiresome at times. It's definitely something I would recommend, but only on sale.
714	now im i want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ susan THX :D
715	I bought this game at a store Harvey Norman and I have to run it through Steam..I paid good money for it and am unable to play it..it wont even launch..what a waste of money
716	I beat this game only because I felt I had to. There is no freedom in this game or strategy/skill. It's literally point A to B. There no creative aspect of it; there's only one way to kill a person, and it could take you a lot of time just to figure out how to do it. I give it 8%/100%  Do not buy.
717	I maybe should blame myself for how much of a let down this game was. I purchased it under the assumption that it would be a haunt and kill reminiscent of Sega genesis game that I played as a youth (The name escapes me as I write this review). Lucius is not this type of game. Lucius functions like an old style adventure game, where when the specific criteria is met, the story can move forward. I feel bad because this game could have been a gem, it has about seventy percent of what it needs to be a good game, but thirty percent off is enough to make all the difference. Do not purchase this game under any assumptions of what it is, i'll explain it quickly, Someone visits the home, do exactly the right thing with the required items and that is all.   Simply put, rating 4/10
718	Nice Horror Puzzle Game Love It
719	I really like this game. I'm going to college to be a criminal/forensic psych major. So this is candy for me! :)
720	Lucius, the son of Lucifer, I love this game, it is amazing, one of my favorite games. I recommend it to you. It's kinda difficult, it has some bugs, but it is still a good game. I recommend it to you.
721	Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.
722	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
723	I'd like to say it takes quite a bit for me to write a negative review and I'll be as fair as I can be in evaluating Lucius. Pros: + Interesting concept, especially if you enjoyed 'The Omen' movies + Good Scenery + Decently made creepy â¥â¥â¥ kid (with those black soulless eyes)  Cons:  - Short (it did take me 6 hours to finish the game, 70% of the achievements done, and I wasn't trying) - No character development for anyone, whatsoever - Meh voice-acting - Falls flat in the story department - who am I kidding? There is no story, just the average day-to-day life of a satanic six year old hell-bent on murdering everyone he meets. - The missions and gameplay are ridicuously linear, and by this I mean you can not advance a mission without completing a certain step and there are no alternative paths. You have to kill THIS person, exactly this way, no exceptions. There are no choices made or options left up to the player. - The gameplay was frankly a bit boring. I had to force myself to sit down and finish the game and feel no inclination to ever come back to this game, even uninstalling it after I finished.   All in all, if you're looking for intuitive, active gameplay with a rich story, this is NOT the game for you. If you're looking for more of a narrative game experience, this is probably more along your lines. I would not pay the regular $10 for this game - my friend bought it for me as a gift during a sale for a few dollars, and I'm not sure I would have paid that.
724	Hi guys, may the satanism and blasphemy be with you!  While my introduction rises the best welcomes of the year, I've played and finished this game and this is my opinion. Step 1 - if you don't like puzzle game with classic satan cliche' it's better if you look elsewhere, but if you get this game under the helloween moon, a bit for fun, and a bit for curiosity, you will not regret.  The game focus on how to kill people of a house without be directly involved. This means no shotguns, no direct approach, no fireballs... (maybe). Anyway you have to inspect the house, find elements and merge them with the environment to produce consequences... people react to consequences and in that fault you may arise into the lucifer domain, killing without a trace.  A part the story that is enough funny and ironic, the game is serius and grab from pagan legend the history of possessed people. In any case you are the Evil there, so you don't have nothing to fear about. This make the story a horror story.. fo the others!  Well it's all funny? Yes... someway. I've noticed a couple of bugs (the most bad was at the last scene, so I had to reload the game to have the game complete... and this was disappointing) but in general the quest are interesting. You will have to use also superpowers during the game progression, with an insert of new mechanics to complete the job.   Boring is also the saving system. If you quit, some object and actions you have done will be erased. The checkpoint are of course the kills. Graphics is detailed but a bit plastic. Your character move and play without saying any word, while the people of the house always repeat the same things.  Well, if you are going to get a smooth and interesting halloween this is the game for you. Do not expect it will last a life.. just a couple of days to be finished.  Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10
725	I really enjoyed this game, absolutely worth the money if you like these sort of games.
726	I really liked the game. It's pretty cool and the graphics tho *-*
727	The music literally ruins this game. It would be better suited to a Home Alone movie than a game about murder. Voice acting is terrible.  Clunky mechanics.  Bought it for $1. Want my $1 back.
728	Bought this game on sale because it seemed interesting. I lost interest the moment the bugs kicked in. I've had framedrops on cutscenes, a bug which forced me to redo several chapters due to picking up an item too early and the game not recognizing it being picked up.  Overall this game isn't worth the 21.99 it's listed and it's definetly not worth most people's time.
729	Clunky and poor story but, I still enjoyed the game all the way though.
730	Watched Pewds play it.  I thought I was womanly enough to play it myself.  I. Can't. Play. This. Without. Someone. Besides me.  Overall a great story-based killing game. Role reversal is always fun. Instead of being the Hero, you're the bloody murderer. A 6 year-old professional killer.
731	If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10
732	Plain tedious.
733	great game //
734	How to be the antichrist. I had fun killing those meat bags. lol
735	Recomend or not. It is hard to decide with this game.  The graphics arn't that good, but for the price I have seen worse. It is a very linear game with not that many options of what to do or not. The majority of the achievements are easy and fun to get if you ignore the 20 hour and 40 hour achievement. The game is much to short to get them without wasting electricity of the pc keeping the game active while you find something more interesting to do.   The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.
736	It's just boring, no creativity at all. Only one way to kill every person and after three kills I just got fed up of it.
737	Its a great game.
738	I've played this game for only a short time, but I've found the experience to be long and drawn out. The system doesn't give you any way of assistance of navigating this confusing place, that is the Dante Manor. If you had a more defined area to explore and search in, the pace would have been much faster and would have made for a much more novel game. But as it stands, the game is fraught with small irrtations without relief. The only source to find a way forward with the quests is to access walk throughs online.
739	Funny and worth the price.
740	Game about waking up in your room after night talking with Satan.  8\10 would kill again..
741	Great Family fun for all &gt;; )
742	The idea of using an environment to kill people is pretty neat. It's reasonable story and decent objective, although some of them might be a bit too vague to figure out and then end up taking forever. But overall is good. The music is pumping and pleasure to my ears, which is one of the best thing about the game.
743	That moment when u do the tour of the house,to find the victim ! 69/10
744	Makes me become Satan. FeelsReallyGood.  Recommend for those who want to murder any of your family members ^-^.
745	+ Plot and the characters were very interesting. I also liked this games black humor and soundtrack (dark and mysterious).  AND tricycling round the mansion. yess  - Damn buggies I recommend this game if you want to play as the son of the devil.
746	demon child. 10/10
747	Lucius us a good game. It's a great stress reliever, the deaths were pretty amusing (morbidly amusing), and it had enough content that you could take a while to beat the game. There were bugs that made levels impossible to finish and forced you to restart the entire chapter (Chapter 13 specifically, using telekinesis on a certain item could cause it to fall in a place where you couldn't get it again. I had to restart it five times), and sometimes it was overly difficult for no reason (Chapter 10 specifically, sneaking through the mansion if you don't get the glue before you start the mission is god awful), but overall, I really enjoyed the game.
748	lucius, the most evil kid on the planet earth
749	Lucius is a point and click story that takes place at the sprawling mass that is Dante Manor. Reminiscent of everyone's favourite little demon seed, Omen, you've got a lot of work to do for your infernal majesty. Dante Manor is a large place, especially for a young lad like Lucius. With a plethora of corridors and rooms, it can sometimes be confusing (it was for me, for many chapters until I learned it like the back of my hand) to get around. Thus, becoming lost within its many chambers and lobbies.  Your objective; reap souls for your true father. Sounds easy enough, right? Each specific kill requires you to carry out specific actions with certain items and sequences which can sometimes leave you scratching your head as you go delving into every room within the Manor looking for the one thing you need. Despite this, every kill is well thought out and creative, making your toiling worth the while when you see your victims eviscerated.  The atmosphere within Dante Manor is somewhat of a two-faced creature. On one hand, during the day, you have the grandeur of the estate. Accentuated by its gothic trimmings in the form of the sound track and formality. It seems calm - as if all is well. Contrast that to the way it carries itself at night. The despair drenched piano pieces, bleak ambience and the all too pervasive echoing of footsteps and doors being used really inflames the urgency to remain undetected or even be swallowed up by the Manor itself.  The only thing I can really discredit Lucius for is its few glitches that will require you to do no more than restart a chapter, I.E. being swallowed up by the Manor's walls or an NPC misbehaving. Overall, a great game that'll have you scratching your head on occasion and will even have you laughing if you have a taste for the macabre, accompanied by a fitting soundtrack. I'd definitely kill again.
750	A little bit buggy and laggy, but I don't have a great PC. On the lower settings it helps this. Overall one of the more fun games I've played. Fun, great story, good mechanics. Awesome game overall.
751	If you ever dream to be that demon lovechild no one ever wanted and a bunch of fanbases scattering around to praise your mighty-ness whatevs, at least Mr. Lucifer is your father.   but mom hates you dad hates you your servants hates you grandpa hates you police hates you.  10/10 recomend. 
752	DO NOT miss a chance to pick up this game for the discounted steam price! I repeat! I mean cmon you play the son of Lucifer. the stealth mechanics are one of a kind and spot on, the story line is wonderful, there is loads of sublte, dark humour throughout the entire game. this game was very well planned out and put together! please play the first before you play the second. did i mention you play the son of lucifer. puzzle meets stealth, gorefest, with thrills and chills. its a must own. no real glitchs either. runs smooth and offers hours of fun.  8/10
753	This is a splendid game! Great graphics and story line! I would totally recommend it! Only negatives about this game is if you're super religious it might offend you and the plot and gameplay can become extremely slow and hard to navigate. Overall a great game for the little demon in you :)
754	I watched Pewdiepie played this game before so i had interest in buying it. At first i was like hmm should i buy the game or not... But i was like meh.. F*ck it! It took me 6.5 hrs to finish the game.  #PlayedWithWalkthroughs #noob   Pros: -Has a great story -You can unlock cool stuff like a bike if you're a good boy! (if you do some chores) -You get to see some ;) (you'll see) -Decent graphics  -Decent voice acting -SATISFYING KILLS AND SH*T!  Cons: -Some characters in the cutscenes have late reactions (LOL) -There are some bugs but its minor. -Few powers sadly :( -The game's kinda short tho -YOU DEFINITELY NEED GUIDES AND WALKTHROUGHS TO FINISH THIS -Can be boring at times if you don't know what to do...  10/10 would Recommend this Unholy game :P  Give me a +rep in my profile if you found this review helpful :)   Thanks!
755	The gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are.There is almost no explanation of what to do it or how to do it.So this is what it's like to control a whale. Last scenes are stupid and the ending is just horrible. Bad voice acting and limited gameplay most likely contributed to it.  So much wasted potential.... 5/10    
756	Lucius has an intriguing premise, but some not-so-original adventure-game flaws.
757	+ Plot and the characters were very interesting. I also liked this games black humor and soundtrack (dark and mysterious).  AND tricycling round the mansion. yess  - Damn buggies I recommend this game if you want to play as the son of the devil.
758	In my opinion the game was ok at first some bugs, and glitches here and there, then came the midnight missions you only have to do two. Now the first one was easy but the other i was hiding behind a door and someone saw me. Tried to use memory wipe but it was useless. Overall the game is ok but i just do not like it.
759	this is game is fun, a little bit creepy and pervert... lol
760	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
761	Bought this game on sale because it seemed interesting. I lost interest the moment the bugs kicked in. I've had framedrops on cutscenes, a bug which forced me to redo several chapters due to picking up an item too early and the game not recognizing it being picked up.  Overall this game isn't worth the 21.99 it's listed and it's definetly not worth most people's time.
762	Every were that Lucius walks death follows of corse when people start to be murdered no one points to a child. This charming young evil child has captivated my soul hes almost to cute to say no to. his handsome father (the devil) almost makes me want to sell my soul to him. though i dout the devil has ever look so handsome in a game correct me if im wrong. Lucius will make your sick little devil love heart come out this game almost feels like it was made for me. The sick and twisted way that Lucius thinks is almost to much to for my girl hood.   This boy pulls off murders better than most real life adults. This boy is what nightmares are made of.  though i only have nice things to say. i spoiled the game for my self by watching someone play this and the seconed one but there so good &lt;3  
763	its a good game a really good game but its not for me.
764	It was rather fun a murder puzzle when you do the kiling. Simple but entertaining
765	10/10 would recommend this game. Within the first ten minutes I killed a woman by locking her in a freezer and my mom made me clean my room. 100% worth it.
766	The concept is brilliant! Sadly the pace of the gameplay is too erratic to hold my interest.   Long periods of point-and-click style play happen between tasks/murders which vary in difficulty, seemingly at random. Generally in games keystage challenges become exponentially more difficult, but in my (short) exploration of this one it seems one task can be virtually impossible to complete followed by a task which is ludicrously simple.   It is challenging, in some instances overly so; actions expected of the player can be very obscure with no hints, once you've finally figured out what you have to do it can then be a feat of superhuman dexterity to complete your mission... creaing a serious anticlimax. It is frustrating and slightly tedious in alternating intervals. This is not helped by the fact the game mechanics appear to struggle with a controller, there are a great many graphics glitches, odd bouts of lag, and reloading from a checkpoint takes a very long time.   Perhaps the game is just older and I am being unfair. It is also possible that I'm just not suited to this type of puzzle solving as, to be candid, this game very quickly felt like a chore rather than a joy which is a pity because, as I said, the concept is awesome.
767	this game make my laptop working so hard ,i hope this thing not gonna blowup -_- ,but i like this game and game play is really cool,hope you add Graphic Setting on option ,
768	Meh... meh lmehm mlehm. I guess some people will enjoy it. I did to begin with, and currently having a really hard time figuring out if I'm sad I spent money on it or not.
769	When I bought this game I thought it'd be a quick little indy game that only lasted an hour or so. In reality it's pretty long for the price, and really fun. I got this and part two for 6 bucks in a steam sale, though i'd have been happy had i paid 20. Nice graphics if you care about that sort of thing, and well put together. So far I haven't had any problems with glitches and such either. I like this game a lot and it's pretty creative when it comes to how you kill your targets. It's dark, sinister, and you really feel like a creepy little devil child. It almost feels similar to a less complex hitman game, though instead of an assassin you're a devil child with a few satanic powers.
770	no this game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥
771	'Yeah, accidents happen all the time. What makes you think it was MURDER?'
772	I liked the game:  Good: A really different game than what I am used to. Dark story, with creative ways of gaming. Bit forced (linear), especially locked doors that shouldn't be locked. Murdering people in different way is fun anyway!  Mum stalks me! (is that good xD?).  Bad: I don't know how to explain this without spoiling, but some things you are supposed to do at some point, aren't really that easy. Playing this for 40 hours achievement? NOPE! 20 hours? I don't think so.
773	A sadistic little piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ kills everyone in the house including priests?! Love it. 5/7.
774	Wow... This is a hardcore scary number one indie game!!
775	Too scared to play this by myself  10/10
776	I looked at this game for a long time when it finally got on sale. So I went and bought it. My little brother warned me against getting this game. He said it was bad. I ignored him. I owe him an apology. He told me the controls were hard to work with and the plot was stupid. Lo and behold, the controls were hard to work with. Not at all helped by how the framerate likes to bounce up and down like a hyperactive child in a bouncy castle going through a sugar high. As for the plot and story , I don't know what to telI you on that front because I was too busy having a wrestling match with the controls to find out what the story was.  I was so unsatisfied I requested a refund, which I normally never do to a game that is on sale. I am really disappointed in this game and myself for buying it.  Just go watch one of those 'demonic child movies' I heard about. I'm sure you'll get the same experience.
777	Pretty good game to kill time with. Decent graphics, many possibilities. It has it bugs/glitches but in the end is really entertaining. Strong 7/10 for me.
778	So much death, t'is good
779	Darkness, evil and fun make this game a fantastic play. I love the aspect of being the evil protagonist along with kill everyone without getting caught. Highly recommended play, I only wish there were more games like this out there.
780	Game is awesome ! I love it ,graphics are grate,story I'd say is interesting and I like to be a paranormal kid in game so yeh game is worth it ;)
781	+ Plot and the characters were very interesting. I also liked this games black humor and soundtrack (dark and mysterious).  AND tricycling round the mansion. yess  - Damn buggies I recommend this game if you want to play as the son of the devil.
782	Remember in Oblivion (Elder Scrolls Series) when you're in the dark brotherhood and you get to kill the house guests? This is a roided up version of that very short quest. But you can't be too blunt or obvious about your kills, no crouching with a sword this time, instead you've got to watch them, learn what they do... and proceed through your plan to ultimately sacrifice them to your 'father'.  Its a great game and I recommend everyone try it at least once.
783	That moment when u do the tour of the house,to find the victim ! 69/10
784	The game concept and story line are certainly refreshing. This game would be great if the control werent so clunky. This game also have the usual annoying cursor accelerator. Lucius shoud BURN whoever created the ACCELERATOR!! so annoying
785	Nope.
786	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Satan simulator  10/10 Would see Tom having sex again
787	not the best voice acting, some bugs here and there but for an indie developed game the graphics are quite well done. This is a morbid puzzle game and fun one at that. It's fun to get a game where you are the bad guy and its nice to have one where you actually need to put thought into it. 9/10 good fun if your into adventure puzzle games, just a little buggy sometimes.
788	While I was initially disappointed that Lucius wasn't a a free-for-all murder-athon something akin to Naughty Bear, I did grow to enjoy the game when I finally reconciled that it was completely scripted. You play as Lucius, supposed son of a very wealthy politician, when you find out on your sixth birthday that you're actually the son of satan. Your real father then tasks you with killing as many people as can, for with each soul you sacrifice, your powers will grow.  Each murder is its own chapter and puzzle with varying difficulty. Your map will always lead you to the person you're supposed to kill, and from there you must figure out the method needed. You journal, as well as the dialogue from other people within your household, will give you hints on how each person is to be dispatched.  The murder scenes can be quite graphic, and there is some nudity, but if neither of these bother you, go ahead and buy the game at full price, the game is worth it.
789	I love watching peopleplaying the game. I don't like to play it myself. I love killing people, this game is funny and brings up good jokes on the way. But, since the game is old, I find the controlring system kinda annoying and buggy sometimes... Still recommending this game for people who want to record for youtube or play with friends!
790	Lucius has an intriguing premise, but some not-so-original adventure-game flaws.
791	The game is pretty cool, I really like the storyline. The puzzles can really make you think.
792	I saw someone having sex, and I imidiately went to my favorite porn site...       woot m8! I BET U WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME! &gt;:(
793	I Really Enjoyed This Game, I Completed It With All Achievements (Easy). The Ways You Kill The Manor Residents Was Fun &amp; Hilarious At Times.
794	although i like this game a lot, the game crashes after chapter 5 and i cant play chapter 6, even so the game with that offer is one of the best choises you can make, its 1,49$, if you lost the chance then for 9,99$ the game isnt worth it, cause it has some bugs, it should propably be around 5$ to worth the money, if it was without bugs then 10$ is no problem.
795	Who would of thought being the son of Satan would be so fun?
796	Great story instensive game
797	Lucius haeve a nice story .  I invite you to play . Hope you enjoy
798	It's a fun game and the premise is interesting, I only wish there was more freedom to do what you want.
799	If you don't have super high expectations for video games, &amp; really like creepy/ macabre stuff, this game is right up your alley. I also appreciated playing the roll of the bad guy for once, &amp; to have all the answers that everyone else is trying to figure out.  The story is engaging, albeit pretty cheesy &amp; predictable, but I got more of a feeling of old-flim nostalgia than annoyed at it. I'd give the story overall a 8/10.  The controls were pretty good on a XBox 360 controller, &amp; I was able to run the game passably on a toaster of a laptop.
800	Yes a game where you can kill innocent people as a devil child XD
801	atmospheric game
802	You play as the six year old son of the devil (like in The Omen). The goal is really simple: In each chapter, you have to kill someone in a SPECIFIC way. You have to find some items, put them (or interact with them) at specific places to achieve your goal. For me, it's not a problem. As long as you're okay with that, you'll enjoy it as much as I did!  Cutest little devil. &lt;3
803	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale. Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...   A small guide or couple of play throughs with plenty of exploration is what is required. A full play through doesn't take many hours.
804	Fun. Some cults and stuff.
805	Sick game
806	  I'm always scared yet I'm the one causing terror (à¥ËÌ£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£oËÌ£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£ à¥)â¼Â³ââ
807	Loveable, cuddly, with just a bit of evil.
808	Quite fun. A little irritating on occasion, but all in all, worth every penny. I suggest you give it a go.
809	IM SO EVIL.
810	Your a little rich kid â¥â¥â¥â¥
811	The Power of Christ Compels You! - To buy this game.. like now. No seriously its fun!
812	Rly nice game
813	Rating: 8/10  This game was actually pretty fun (in twisted meaning), with nice graphics and creepy soundtrack. The whole story is situated in one huge manor, and there are many cutscenes before and after 'murder', so besides enjoying great 'puzzle-solving' game-play, you also have a feeling like watching a movie, pretty sick movie about demonic child. Every death is unique and requires time to figure out how to manage it (some are quite tough).
814	yo guys i think you should get this game it is gory but funny has a good story hope u like it
815	The Omen: The Video Game. Wait wait wait.... copyright preventing them using The Omen. Damn close enough. Ever wanna know how the kid got around killing everyone. Lucius will show you... Minus the b-rate voice acting and script this was an amazing game. Too bad it's trailer spoiled a few of the awesome deaths. 7/10
816	Super fun especially if you enjoy causing people pain and most of the time...-&gt; (death) ^-^
817	other images glitching onto the screen repeatedly while trying to play and while in the menu
818	I'm not far into this so far, but it's loads of fun. If the idea of playing The Omen in the style of the Hitman games sounds like fun then this is very much for you :)  So many smiles pass my face :)
819	This game killed my video card. 11/10 HELP ME PADRE FOR I HAVE SINNED.
820	Lucius was a pretty interesting game. The concept was pretty unique, although it would have been nice to be more creative with each kill. Replay is kind of dead since once you've played through it once, that's pretty much it. Nothing really is added for replay value.
821	WAS OKAY not really a fun end 
822	I just spent the last 6 hours playing through this insane game - and I loved every minute of it!   As the classic narrative goes (closest resemblance here is Rosemary's Baby), Satan is invoked to claim a child as his offspring - that would be our protagonist Lucius. He then continues to teach the boy in the sick ways of doing his bidding - the player takes over this role then. There is a total of 18 chapters and each contains a mission to creatively murder one or several people in a way that pleases his Dark Lordship, all while avoiding any suspicion and planting false clues and evidence.   Technically this game is well done. The graphics will certainly not win any prices, especially the textures of the surroundings, but on the other hand, the effects look good and the characters show a variety of body language, facial expressions and are lip-synced. The gamneplay/controls and what little menu (inventory) you need are smooth and fine as they are. I especially liked the audio: a variety of atmospheric music (and the annoying music on the tape that you will sooner or later hand to the driver - which is meant to be that way :D ) and good voice actors.  Overall, this game is unique: it's sadistic, dark and twisted, sometimes even humorous (depends on your kind of humor of course ;) ). The kill sequences, that crown your triumph at the end of each chapter, are a bizarre and wonderfully gruesome mix of sensation and childlike wonder - in the way children sometimes enjoy litting ants on fire and the like. An always fascinating and gripping ride from start to finish. 85% in my book.
823	I really like this game a lot. Even if it is repeatitive as other says, i liked it. I found this game fun to play. I reccomend this game to people who don't have such high standards on games just here to enjoy a game.
824	Best horror classic game as i say! personally i feel like this game have been made special for me , i feel so haPpy and satisfied playing this crazy game , just killing ppl left and right ! feels So epic .. i always loved magic powers as well as so here you go all what you want exist in one fkin game called lucius its also clearly based on the movie called THe Omen ... !!
825	Great game, I loved everyminuet of it.
826	Whats not to like about playing the bad guy? This little gem of a game is devilishly fun and brutal. For a game made in 2012, the graphics are really good, in my opinion, and the game is very well polished. Some of the kills are really nasty to watch, for example the Butcher. If you are Christian or do not like things with references to the Devil and Satanic symbols, DONT PLAY THIS GAME, but if you dont really care, give it a whirl!
827	great game creepy as â¥â¥â¥â¥
828	On 6/6/66, in ward 666, a boy named Lucius is born. Six years later, Dante Manor, his home, is shaken by a series of gruesome murders. No-one knows what to think. Has the house been cursed? Take control of Lucius - akin to the Antichrist - and his satanic powers to wreak havoc. This game is not for the faint hearted, there are a lot of gory scenes and a few sexual ones. Villain protagonists are always fun, and this game is no exception. There are some truly messed-up deaths here. This game contains aspects of stealth and puzzle, as you try to figure out how to pull off your next demonic act, without arousing the suspicions of anyone else. The one major letdown is the considerable lack of information. You have very little idea what to do, and this can prove rather difficult in such a big house with so many tiny details. I also experience a few bugs and occasional crashes, but it does not impact gameplay too much. Apart from that, the gameplay experience is rather pleasing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the supernatural, stealth, puzzles, or just plain murder. Enter if you dare...
829	I saw someone having sex, and I imidiately went to my favorite porn site...       woot m8! I BET U WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME! &gt;:(
830	Bought this game and it's broken, I can't even get through the intro because the items won't cycle, my mouse wheel works fine, and about half the time when I bring up my notepad, nothing. not that it maters because I can't progress any further.
831	'How to kill your family' simulator.
832	A little bit buggy and laggy, but I don't have a great PC. On the lower settings it helps this. Overall one of the more fun games I've played. Fun, great story, good mechanics. Awesome game overall.
833	is a fun game to play
834	Pros  Fun game Good youtube content Fun kills BYCICLES CONS Linear story not very creative gets a bit repetive  0 replayablity
835	Despite the bizarre 500 ms delay every time it has to load a .wav for someone to talk and similar technical glitches, I enjoyed this because it's completely different fare than the usual.   It's fun to run around as a demonic kid planning tricky ways to kill people. I barely needed to use a walk-through, not sure what this says about me personally.  I ran it at 4k and ultra high, was very playable. Bit rough and unpolished in places but still worth picking up at an extreme discount.
836	I really liked playing through this game. It is weird. It is a good 'puzzle' game. However the game does bug out a lot on chapter 13 and is probably one of the downsides of this game. If they made patch for this game I would have enjoyed it more but unfortunately there is no patch yet. It can get boring because you are only able to go around the mansion and a small garden  My Rating: 8/10
837	bought it just for intrest but man did it mess me up mentally but im not gunna let my taste make a bad review if you like the evil puzzle games then this game is for you just becareful when you play at night i had to delete this game cause of how bad i felt lmao 'its just a game does no justice...
838	6/10  At first couple hours, I thought this game is quite boring because how the game machanic it is. It doesn't give you freely how you gonna kill. It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze. It take you to survey around a very long time until you familiarize with. -linearity with killing method for each chapter.  btw, still recommend this game when it sale. (yep, I got this game on sale for 1 usd)
839	good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is    when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says 'now, you don't need matches!' immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.    when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up    pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hunters' to my parents and housemates.   
840	I didn't find the game to be that interesting or intuitive. There's no motivation from the main character to bring about the horrific deaths of other people in the house except 'Satan appeared in my room one night and told me that if I murder people I get more psychic, I am totally okay with this.' Like, okay, sure. I'll fumble around with no hints and kill people I have no/minor grudges against, sounds great.
841	First blood was pointless and not rewarding. Next scene was like, 'WTF'.
842	Can brake bottles of vine!  10/10 broken bottles of vine! :wasted:
843	Monotonous killings, and only a few ways to do so makes this game rather lackluster. After waking up and seeing old Satan himself telling a 10 year to go do the dirty deeds is entertaining in itself. Sadly after trying to sneak to kill someone It is dissapointing to be caught by your mom who scholds you and tells you to march right back to bed. If there were more customization options then the linear story and powers this might have done amazingly. 4 / 10
844	I find this game boring soo far soory but damn I am getting sleepy playing this. It has some sort of potential for fun game but I dunno not for me it's sketched to much, with plenty bugs which are making comedy of this. For few bucks you can try it. I will play it for few more hours, but my immersion got destroyed and story is not that engaging either.
845	Not very fun at all. 
846	Okay I first heard of this game by watching a Youtube streamer play it and I can say I sat and watched him play the entire game and enjoyed the storyline, the game play and even the fact that the main character is not your usual protaganist. I really wanted to play it so I went straight onto an e shop to see how much it was, though unfairly I was unemployed at the time so I could not afford to buy it so imagine my surprise when today on Steam it was reduced and I had money to buy it at last. I played it straight away and although I am rubbish with keyboard controls I found it quickly enjoyable and amusing. The dark story despite having seen it all before was much better than any goody two shoes story of heroism I was used too simply because of the idea of the story despite there not being a great deal of story anyway. I really suggest this game to any gamer type.
847	Reading other reviews there's a lot of condemnation for a linear point and click style strictly story line game. Makes a change really with all the open world games out there and 'lets see how many different ways you can come up with to kill people'. If you want open world, free choice on actions and outcomes then this game is definately not for you. It's basically a game version of The Omen type story. Without giving too much away, small boy, spawn of satan, kill you family and develop your powers. It's very imaginative in how there is little guidance and you actually have to think on how the game wants you to do the murders without getting caught, with only a little guidance on where your next move takes you. All in all I believe it is a charming little game dedicated to one of the classics in the horror genre which puts you in the place of the demon child. If you like point and click type games, free roaming but with a very scripted storyline and an intelligent game you have to think about then I would definately recommend this game! :)
848	Love this game~!!!!! Can't wait for Lucius II.
849	 Lucius... aka Antichrist Simulator from Damien Thorn, in The Omen (1976) movie.   The game itself plays a lot like the Hitman series, minus the shooting aspect. Like the game name says, you play as Lucius, a 6 years old (midway in the game, you get 7!) who was fortunate enough to had been born in a satanic invocation. It doesn't take long to go around, learn the basics and then, get on with it on your murder list!  There isn't much to be said about this game, concerning the story and gameplay. It gets the job done and honestly, I can't understand the gaming industry bashing this game. I liked it mostly for all its numerous faults and cons and it was satisfying enough to keep me interested and playing till the end (game is about 6 hours long).  PROS: +Antichrist antihero (feels weird and cool at the same time! Be THE creepy kid with powers!). +Creepy, tensed and gory atmosphere during the murder scenes. +Game is challenging enough to keep you guess the next step although, you can always get a walkthrough guide to speed things up! +Lots of exploring to do in this huge mansion.  CONS: -Some gameplay mechanics weren't responsive fast enough, especially during that Chapter 10 stealth mission. Patrolling grownups could see me even well hidden through walls and doors. -Straightforward linear killing list. -At some chapters startup, the game lacks direction as to where to go, what to do as you roam around the big mansion aimlessly. Quite irritating! Better read a walkthrough as I sure did around Chapter 5. Also, the map could use refinement! -The chores side quests are really worthless and only time sink. I suggest you simply ignore them... well the ones that you can as some could be mandatory, like that tape cassette for Micheal. -Save-game mechanic is atrocious. No quick-save, no auto save midway in a mission. You are forced to start a chapter and finish it so you can be sure the game saves your progress there.   OVERALL: Faulty game but entertaining enough (to me though) to keep you playing until the showdown. Lucius felt exactly like 'The Omen' simulator and it was a decent entry for this franchise. I do expect the sequel to surpass this game especially on the visual aspect as it is very lackluster (yes, game looks quite ugly), the gameplay mechanics and game direction with a better pathing on a reliable map.  RECOMMENDATION: Loved The Omen movie and loves creepy adventure styles game? This game is for you! Just, wait for a decent deal before forking you dough in this game.  RATING: 666 / 666 ... 6.66 / 10
850	This game is not what I was expecting, and my standards weren't even that high..
851	Lucius is a puzzle game, where the puzzle to solve is murder.  The replayability is very low. The puzzles aren't always challenging, just frustratingly clueless. And often repetitive.  I finished it under 5 hours. The only reason I have so many hours on this game is for that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ achievement. 40 hours ? Really ? Nobody would ever play this game for that long without the achievement there ...
852	I came, I saw, I was the kid from the Omen. Although the getting caught parts got rather annoying, the game itself was fun. It was linear, so I do look forward to part two.
853	it's a fun game with killing so basically if cod and satan had a baby with only one gun usage, it would be LUCIUS :D and to be fair its a medium long game with fun thats gonna make it my favorite series so go on buy this game and lucius will murder the holy blood of his family
854	This game is one of my favorites, now that I have played it, and completed it in about 9-10 hours. I got it when it was on sale before Lucius 2 came out, and I'm so glad it was on sale and I had found it. No regrets on buying it, but now that it's no longer on sale as of right now, anyone interested in getting the game at the normal price, don't question it, you won't regret it. Especially if you love to kill people for no real reason, creepy demonic stuff, and I do enjoy the most in this game, because some parts are a little confusing, trying to figure out exactly what to do [or how to kill the person] that it will put that person on a 'repeated' schedule in the game until you figure out what you need to do, so you don't need to rush or panic that you can't figure it out for a while. I highly recommend!
855	Lucius feels more like a point and click game with a third person interface than it does a stealth/horror game. The world is too big. There isn't much room for creativity. It seems you need to find the one item that will allow whatever the next death sequence is to take place. The voice acting is stilted. The writing is pretty generic. All in all, life is short and there are stronger games out there to play.
856	Have you ever seen the movie Omen? No? Me neither, but I'm sure you're familiar with the trope of the eerie creepy son of Satan character arc that can be portrayed in some of Hollywood's most frightening films. Now, instead of playing the hero one would think they would be, you play as LUCIUS the hell spawn himself and roam about innocently your parents manor, using your new found powers to end the miserable lives of all who reside there.  The game itself has a wonderful concept, BECOME the horror, and while it may sometimes be delivered poorly due to some level breaking bug or the fact that you're spotted once and then you have to start ALL over again I still think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Now, this isn't a action game, sort of. There are parts that heavily rely on action, but the majority of the game is spent in the puzzle world. Think of it like Hitman and your run of the mill puzzle game clash heads. Safe to say, I definitely enjoyed the puzzles (IE Murders) a lot more, action was too clunky and felt like it was tacked on.  Anyways 7/10 Would try again.
857	I thought this game was rad, it lived up to my expectations 100%. This game has an awesome cinematic feel, and the visuals are pretty damn good. The voice acting is lackluster at most points, but there's occasionally a shred of real emotion and that's pretty nice.  The puzzles are pretty neat too, there's a lot of forshadowing (whether on purpose or not) due to being able to see what you can use your abilities on, so it's pretty satisfying to finally use something you've had in your inventory for a while, Although it can be a pretty big boner to realize you need to go find an item you should have already come across. A couple of the puzzles seemed pretty obtuse and confusing, but I get that way with most games like this so that might be just me THANKFULLY the game offers a pretty basic hint thingy which is optional so you don't have to deal with spoiled answers!   The only reaaaaaal downsides I have to say are that there are definitely some glitches. I've been launched through the stairs quite a few times and while it's hilarious it's also inconvenient, but I don't remember having any gamebreaking bugs or anything. Also for being sort of presented as a sandbox, the game is linear as hell and there's no room for variation which kinda sucks but it's still fun figuring out all the prebuilt sequences. Thankfully I hear the sequel is truly openended and has traps and such so heyyyyyyyyyyyyy  I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEQUEL BECAUSE THIS GAME IS GOOD AND I WANT MORE
858	you need to kill a guy by tinkering with gas cooker, the gas is in the whole freaking kitchen but the guy doesnt give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and still lits up the cigaret, â¥â¥â¥â¥ blows up hes burning alive you just look at him gain more power no body suspects a thing. 666/10
859	The Game Is Awsome Butt You Better Have Nice Computer Because it lags
860	Framerate is bad on my computer that is WELL above the recommended specs. On top of that I just wasn't drawn into the game. Felt cheap. Interesting premise with the fact that you're the devil's child and all that, just didn't hold my attention.
861	TL;DR = I got to squash someones head under a grand piano, 10/10 would play again whilst playing again.  Not a bad game really, played and completed this when it first came out and I remember thinking at the time it wasn't worth the full asking price but as I have now picked it on steam for 90% off it is an absolute steal.  the subject matter is fairly original as I can't remember any other games that let you play as the son of the Devil a la Omen style (please feel free to comment if there are others like this so I can play them).  Graphically it's not too bad at all and sound wise there is some good effects when you are roaming around setting up your little 'accidents'. Options wise, other than the ability to rebind keys and set resolution there aren't many PC options but in all honesty it doesn't really make a difference. I have played this both with a K/M and a 360 Joypad and there is no real difference both are good methods of control for this game.   Buy this on sale play it get the trading cards (there are cards even though they aren't listed on the store page) and unleash your inner Devil.
862	Detective mcguffin versus Satanic Machina... I wasnt joking the detective is literally called mcguffin... This game is messed up...
863	The game seems like it was meant to be something else. The tools are there to make a more freeform game where you could plot deaths but as things stand each 'kill' is pre-detirmined for you and there is only one way to kill that person. A bit too linear
864	*Possible to change*   At this point, I have not finished the game but I can confidently say that I enjoy it. I find it kind of buggy and hard to control Lucius at times - which may just be my computer's fault - but overall I like the style, story and idea of the game. You get to play as a (very small but deadly) villian. You get to have Satan as your teacher. You have an open mansion to explore and discover. And you also get to slowly ruin your parents' lives as you cause an omen in their home.   Similar to a point and click game but your given other powers that don't only include picking up objects or shutting off devices etc, but the ability to use telekenesis and mind control and also combustion. You can only acquire your kills in specific ways, you cannot choose the way you kill people. It can be puzzling at times but the map normally guides you around the house and your journal gives you hints at what to do next.   I bought this while it was on sale for $1.99 and I'd reccommend it at that price. It's entertaining and keeps you going. I've been waiting forever to get a hold of this game for cheap and now I'm looking forward to see what Lucius II will be like.
865	This game is intensely fun, allowing you to play as the unrepentant villain in a Hitman-style game that never feels to big or too small. As you learn the mansion, you zip around looking for targets, because this game doesn't believe in giving you everything on a silver platter, and I like that. It looks great, and after five hours I only experienced one glitch. My only real complaint is the initial unforgiving nature of the stealh bits, but it's later rectified by a skill you get. This game is worth every penny you spend on it, and I'd reccommend this to anyone who likes stealth-action-puzzle games.
866	Game has a good idea but unfortunatelly it is too lineer. 
867	You can be the son of the devil and kill people 11/10 hell yeah
868	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
869	Mt bom
870	i recommend to you this game only if you love to kill people or bobes!!
871	personally i really like this game concept  9.5/10
872	i love this game so mush i love it A++++++
873	Lucius is a puzzle game where your goal is to assasinate people in order to please your father lucifer without being caught in the process, each time you mkae a sacrifice, you become more powerful on one of the different evil magic areas, telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and fireball, altho fireball is only usable in very specific ocasions. The graphics are not bad at all but it's poorly optimized, controls are ok to play with, sadly you can't use a gamepad. Some of the deaths in the game are very gruesome, sadly there's not enough graphics quality to back that up. For achievement hunters this is a easy game to get them all, except the play 20 and 40 hours ones.
874	Lucius is a game that puts you in control of a 6 year old spawn of satan. The story is the vein of the classic horror movie, The Omen. 666/777
875	Rather then a horror game or a game that stresses freedom of choosing whom the character kills, this game is more of a puzzle game... Figuring out how to linearly kill another character whithout getting caught... Not what I expected.
876	THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS, BUT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO MAKE EVERYTHING A SPOILER!    Lucius is an outstanding game where you play as a 6 year old boy born on 6-6-1966. Somehow he is the son of Lucifer and notices him as his father, and thus he gains his demonic powers, which you will use to murder, and aid in sucicide, many people. Including your own parents! While you murder the people that goes along with the game story line, police, detectives, and everybody else will start to take cauction in the house. SO BE CAREFUL, and try not to get caught, This may be the only frustrating part of the game. So I would suggest a guide to help get items early to save time later, and so you can understand your main objective. Also enjoy this marvelous game.    95.5/100 bananas :D
877	I cant recommend this enough. I love this game after finishing it yesterday i have added it to my top 5 favorites of all time. The story line is amazing. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay is a little challengeing but amazing. I really love thi game and would recommend this to anyone. I love it soo much!
878	Normally in games playing as the bad guys and killing people is fun. In this Devil's child simulator the act of murder is not satisfying or entertaining, it's an unpleasant chore, because people that you must eliminate to progress through the game, are actually nice men and women and killing them feels like a terrible thing to do. The deaths in this game are way too realistic and unnecessary brutal, the protagonist's character in nonexistent, and the plot is paper-thin. Forgettable and unimpressive.
879	horrible just horrible.. just sits at the screen with him sitting in bed playing with the toy.. doesnt go any further.. pos game
880	This is pretty good. Some bugs, but according to others it's very rare and most people never get them as there may be a 1/20 chance you'll get one per playthrough. In any such case, just restart from the beginning of the chapter. Very fun murder although the plot with the church sounds too circumstantial.
881	Its a fun puzzle-game, and the puzzles are all about killing people with unnatural powers. If you ever watch 'The Omen',- this is the game varriant.
882	Kinda fun and brutal game where you get to be the son of Satan. It's great that you are not given the straight orders. Instead you are given some clues and you have to figure out what to do. 5/5
883	I'll tell you now lucius is no walk in the park for some people. You must think outside the box to get these puzzles and finish your victims. A good game that should be recommended to all those people who love puzzle games!
884	I donât know where I was or what I was doing in 2012, but I canât see why I did not grab this game sooner. This is one of those games where you get deep into the story so much so that you lose all sense of time until you finish the game and then have that â what now?â look on your face as you thrust for more. I really liked this game.   What I liked:  The storyline: It gives you a bit of background on the Lucius as to he just fell out of the sky. The story make the player connect with him and get personally involved with him. Freaking awesome!!   What I did not like:     Conclusion: This is a game I would highly recommend getting. It may be a bit old, but it is outstanding in my opinion. I did not have any trouble starting the game, or playing it and I donât recall any bugs that made me not want to play the game. It does have some replay value and a mini survival like game at the end which I liked also. Awesome to say the least.  
885	Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't. You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.  In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.
886	A great violent game, different ways to kill people and a common but well-told story. supernatural abilities and 2 alternate endings. 8/10
887	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Satan simulator  10/10 Would see Tom having sex again
888	A good game, good gameplay and okay story 7.5/10 Try it.
889	Clunky and poor story but, I still enjoyed the game all the way though.
890	If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10
891	This game is glitchy peice of crap.
892	I want to enjoy the game but it is extremely buggy. Its been out for years yet I don't think there has been any effort to fix those bugs.  It took me around 10 minutes to place the car in the box when trying a new power. I knew what I was suppose to do, but the game refused to let it happen. As well as when the man goes to 'fix' the piano, he starts going back, I'm like uh...hello? aren't you suppose to fix it? I follow him, he goes to the bathroom and says well it must be broken my schedule says it is, lemme check again. Basically its stating I didnt break it when I did. Thats glitchy. Downright glitchy and annoying. Basically I'm just playing this game for achievements / a time saver but I'm dissapointed on how they portrayed the game and the unnecessary glitches.
893	tl;dr: 'Eh...'  Pros: Hail Satan  Cons: Lacks direction, quite short, bit buggy, somewhat overpriced.
894	Bad voice acting, cliche dialogue, cheesy horror, bad camera angles, very linear gameplay, horrendous control setup, missions that require too much waiting that fail at your first mistake...  This game just feels like a hassle to play.
895	Lucius is a very good horror game! Go for it. You will have a great time. :)
896	got game free .... ideal master!!
897	im my opinion im a christian but i dont act like one and this game was the opposite of christian and i loved thye gamae like dude what game is better than being able to saw a guys head in half.
898	Kill everybody, 10/10 would never...... mhm always play again!
899	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥. I'm so glad I got it for free.
900	what a boring â¥â¥â¥ game. unsensitive control and you have to sprint all the time he walk slow af. money wasted
901	This game contains some of the most old school and classic deaths ever just. wow i haven't seen those deaths since Tom &amp; Jerry but instead now the victims actually. But admit it you probably jsut buyed this game because of the nudity didn't you, you probably got a dirty mind. well atleast you didnt't come for the story because that is â¥â¥â¥â¥. it develops poorly let me tell you the story and how it develops. Warning: absolutely jsut boring spoil;ers you probably already new. you turned 6 years old and find out you're the devils son great now go kill people in your household because your dad wants you to that. thats litarelly it. nothing changes! but ofcourse you came here to mess around or for the nudity. you probably came for the nudity (pssst the sex scene is random and the shower scene is at chapter 14 but you haven't heard that from me). and most importantly its a fun game, well if you have dark humor like i do its fun. the gameplay is oke to i guess doesn't have any replay value theres no secrets well theres one but you get there via story progression but for an open world game the fact that theres no secrets just dissapoints me.  +Old School Deaths for all the people who came out there mother before the year 2000. +â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ +Naked Woman, Shower, nuff said. +Fun for people with a dark sence of humor. -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ story -No replay value  The game is fun and hilarious but if it had a better story or even the slightest bit of replay value it would had been a higher score. 6/10. The potentiol is there but the developers missed there change. i don't have much hope for the sequel being any better or even good at all but for that we have to wait and see.
902	At first impression I thought this was going to be a demonic Hitman game but as I've further played this game I noticed this is more of a point-and-click adventure game. Concept is basically collect your items, find your target to eliminate and basically watch the person die. It doesn't really have freedom like the Hitman games unfortunately it's very linear. Quite honestly, the game is a little boring. You're just Lucifer's wild child and you go on a murduring rampage. Nothing too deep about it but it's built upon a generic horror flick. I guess the only thing that makes it worthwhile to see is seeing some pretty gorey cutscenes but other than that it's not worth the full price. I would suggest getting it on sale.
903	The game looked really promising and it gets to be really cheap on sales (around 90 cents), but it's so buggy that messes up the game.  You literally have to start over chapters due to the game being extremely buggy and causes you to be unable to process the to story.  Cons:  -The facial expressions are the worst. -Memory wipe power was worthless. -Some controls are clunky. -Most abilities are lame. -The House / Enviroment design in the game is rather poor. -The game offers no replayability. -The story is very short, you can beat the game in around 2-3 hours (if you can stand playing it for that much). -Too linear. -Boring concept.  Pros:  -You can ride a tricycle on your way to commit murder.
904	Really enjoyed this game. Unique concept and great story.   My only negatives are that there was always a 'right' ability to use and finding some of the stuff was fairly difficult. 
905	It was fun at first. Quickly got borning and repeated.
906	The game was actually boring
907	I really like this game. I'm going to college to be a criminal/forensic psych major. So this is candy for me! :)
908	Recomend or not. It is hard to decide with this game.  The graphics arn't that good, but for the price I have seen worse. It is a very linear game with not that many options of what to do or not. The majority of the achievements are easy and fun to get if you ignore the 20 hour and 40 hour achievement. The game is much to short to get them without wasting electricity of the pc keeping the game active while you find something more interesting to do.   The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.
909	Lucius, the son of Lucifer, I love this game, it is amazing, one of my favorite games. I recommend it to you. It's kinda difficult, it has some bugs, but it is still a good game. I recommend it to you.
910	Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.
911	The game was pretty, engaging &amp; overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, &amp; exploring is a bunch of fun.   My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.
912	The controls made this almost unplayable, I wish I could have used my controller though it would have only helped slightly. You move so slowly and if you try to run it goes crazy which makes manuevering around very hard and disorienting. I saw potential but I can't play this game with these controls...
913	Good game it teach me how to be a psycho and how i feel to be a son of demon
914	666/10 will kill again.. and again.. and again! AND AGAIN!
915	So I'm not one to play games with a linear storyline from beginning to end. But Lucius was one of those games, though could use some work, had me entertained throuhgout... I mean how often can you play the son of the devil and go around killing people?   I do recommend this game and even though it's not a huge game it's still very enjoyable.  I did a full playthrough of the game, just in case you get stuck at some points. Here's the first episode to taste what the game has in store for you.   https://youtu.be/yeizmSoOvsM   
916	If you ever dream to be that demon lovechild no one ever wanted and a bunch of fanbases scattering around to praise your mighty-ness whatevs, at least Mr. Lucifer is your father.   but mom hates you dad hates you your servants hates you grandpa hates you police hates you.  10/10 recomend. 
917	This game is all about doing chores, hanging around in the house, and trying to kill the people you don't like. And that's basically my life too.
918	Very linear gameplay would have been fantastic to let loose and murder them all as you see fit whilst trying to cover up everything you do so they dont figure who you really are but that being said it has a story so it probs needed a linear stucture for its own purpose for what it is; it was a good game and i enjoyed lil jimmys murdering antics.   - 'Best background windowed running game simulator' you can get!   666/10 would leave the game running in the background in a small window again....
919	REALLY FUN GAME has a few issues but still fun game
920	Why Is My Game In A 3D Effect Please Help Turn It Off
921	Good, but story too short. :/
922	It was rather fun a murder puzzle when you do the kiling. Simple but entertaining
923	I really didnt like this game, my friends invited me to play this game i spent 15 dollars on it i think,  all the hype came from pewdipie i guess.   4/10
924	We are part Satan in this game.   RECOMMEND  10/10 
925	Bugs, bugs, bugs, inconsistencies, stupid scenario, low fluidity, bugs.
926	Shoved a man's face into a lawnmower, would do again.
927	In my opinion the game was ok at first some bugs, and glitches here and there, then came the midnight missions you only have to do two. Now the first one was easy but the other i was hiding behind a door and someone saw me. Tried to use memory wipe but it was useless. Overall the game is ok but i just do not like it.
928	This game is so buggy. So slow, it's only 16-18 FPS when the gameplay start but it goes 60 FPS when the movie play, We don't watch the movie dude, we want to play!!!
929	Remember in Oblivion (Elder Scrolls Series) when you're in the dark brotherhood and you get to kill the house guests? This is a roided up version of that very short quest. But you can't be too blunt or obvious about your kills, no crouching with a sword this time, instead you've got to watch them, learn what they do... and proceed through your plan to ultimately sacrifice them to your 'father'.  Its a great game and I recommend everyone try it at least once.
930	Cool Game.
931	Good, but story too short. :/
932	Always wanted to worship our lord and savior Lucifer?, the lord of the underworld, but your parents never allowed you, then this is the game for you.
933	Super sometimes stealth and sometimes bug :D (BUG TO MAKE IT FASTER)
934	Well its easy:   - Don't play if you're a good person!
935	.
936	Well ! I have finished the game in 10-11 hours . The game was fun ! Really fun ! Some puzzles were harder but it is not so hard ! I think i will replay this game in the future !I like the ideea of beeing a 6 year old son of a rich family and kill all the members of the house...one by one ... story 9/10 ....muzic 9/10 .... overall 8.5/10
937	Would love to play this game, purchased it, but it does not work with my hardware. The scroll on the mouse doesn't work correctly, so you get to a point you can't do anything.. You can't modify that control setting, so you are pretty much screwed.. It looks like it would be a good story, but it's like a book missing half the pages.. get's to the point that it is a waste of time..
938	I mean who doesn't wanna play the Devil's son and go around killing your family's hired help?
939	It's a tough call to recommend Lucius. The premis behind the game is solid. You play as the anti-christ being trained by you real father aka Satan to hone your powers on your birth parents and their staff by killing them all one at a time without being caught. The execution however is rocky at best. Stiff animations and an overwhelming lack of instruction leaves the experience more frusterating than it needed to be. One more than one occasion I started a chapter not knowing who my target was so I wandered the huge property of the mansion, checking every room I could think of for nearly 45 minutes before I finally caved and checked online. That's a bad sign for game design. This is an indie title and if it wasn't released during the Halloween season there's no way the producers would be able to justify the $30 price tag. My bet, this title is going to see a price drop and if you're curious about it, wait for it to a $5 sale and pick it up, otherwise, you're not missing a lot here.
940	This game gave me a good impiression for the neat graphic. Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.
941	Awesome game, cool content and great 'killcams' :D
942	Best and most goreful villain simulator ever. Also nude and sex scenes for forever virgins like me.
943	10/10
944	Nice game!
945	Got this on sale, never finished the game, but I can just barely recommend this. It's good to play for awhile in the beginning, but after a few murders it starts to get a bit repetitive. I quit after the reporter guy in the basement. The house is also extremely easy to get lost in, especially since you have no minimap and have to open the map over and over to make sure you're going in the right direction.
946	When I bought this game I thought it'd be a quick little indy game that only lasted an hour or so. In reality it's pretty long for the price, and really fun. I got this and part two for 6 bucks in a steam sale, though i'd have been happy had i paid 20. Nice graphics if you care about that sort of thing, and well put together. So far I haven't had any problems with glitches and such either. I like this game a lot and it's pretty creative when it comes to how you kill your targets. It's dark, sinister, and you really feel like a creepy little devil child. It almost feels similar to a less complex hitman game, though instead of an assassin you're a devil child with a few satanic powers.
947	..
948	ur an evil kid trying to annihilate ur own family.
949	this is the best game i am the son of satan 10/10 for killing the plumber
950	Two words defines this game. THE OMEN.
951	Great game,very hard,but still a great one 10/10 would kill people again
952	Good game totally worth it ..
953	Lucius is an compelling complete mess of a game that sadly manages to sour itself right at the end.  The game is a point and click game where you play as Lucius, a 6 year old millionare child that for some reason is in leagues with Satan, and is tasked to kill the other people in his house discretely to harvest their souls. Everything in the game takes place within the giant open family mansion where you have to gather clues, find items and do your chores to figure out the solutions to puzzles involving killing people in more or less creative ways.  This is all conveyed in the style of a 70's B-horror movie akin to The Exorcist, only it seems to be somewhat aware (or charmingly unaware) of the goofyness of the situation and cranks up the cheese to hillarious degrees, with overuse of 666 symbolism, slow motion head explosions and cartoonishly unlikable house residents to murder. The game's attempts at horror falls incredibly flat out of the gate in other words, though it do manage to be bloody hillarious instead which is what got me hooked through the entire thing.  Because the thing is, the game itself is not very good. A lot of the time you are given very vague hints of what to do and it ends up with tons of walking around the house searching for interactive items, the magic powers you get such as levitation and mind control only seems to want to work half of the time, there is some horrible early 2000's license game style sneaking sections, and the final boss fight was completely broken for me until I reloaded a save. The game also has ludicrous loading times even on high end computers, and it looks like an upscaled PS2 game in a lot of regards despite seeming to use a surprising ammount of power to run.  However along with those bad things are a lot of fun 'bad' things too. The physics engine is super wonky and makes doors and objects flip out at times, which is especially apparent with the ragdoll physics going into full Goat Simulator mode whenever they happen outside of cutscenes (if you get hold of the gun earlier than intended you can have a lot of fun with this). You can unlock a tricycle to help move around the house quicker, which breaks the laws of physics around stairs and other things. You sometimes spawn mid air or partway underground when starting a mission. Lots of weird unintended wacky things that is really funny whenever it do happen.  The truly bad parts really do tear it down a lot though, so even if I did enjoy big chunks of this game in a Troll 2 sort of way, the truly abysmal parts dragged it way too much down to outright recommend it. If you are interested in so bad it's good horror cheese and physics wackyness, grab it on a sale, but stay away at the current full price.
954	clunky but fun
955	too easy to beat
956	Definantly recommended for hours upon hours of fun. This game is excellent for those who are into horror-ish ames, or, with the right sense of humor, a few good laughs.
957	When I originally bought this game, I was unsure if I was going to like it or not. Let me start off by saying I really did enjoy this game. One thing I should mention is that I personally didn't believe this game was so much of a 'horror game', it was more of an interesting story about a posessed boy, nothing in the game is really 'scary'; however, the game doesn't fail to include several violent and gorey death scenes. Only complaint about the game was that it went a little quicker than I wanted it to, but luckily, Lucius 2 is available to anyone who enjoyed the game!!!!!!! Would definetly recommend to anyone who is up for an interesting (but not too lengthy) story.
958	This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary. So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10
959	I love this game. I wish I could be a murderous child chosen by Satan in real life, but this is okay too.
960	this game make my laptop working so hard ,i hope this thing not gonna blowup -_- ,but i like this game and game play is really cool,hope you add Graphic Setting on option ,
961	im my opinion im a christian but i dont act like one and this game was the opposite of christian and i loved thye gamae like dude what game is better than being able to saw a guys head in half.
962	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥. I'm so glad I got it for free.
963	You're a kid trying to kill your parents so basically you're in a really gory Stewie focused episode of Family Guy
964	8/10. This was a hoot and a half. Surprisingly difficult in parts, too. A TON of cut scenes, but the fact that you're playing the evil character somewhat makes up for it. I do recommend it, but be prepared for those cut scenes!  Pros: -Story -Puzzles -Someone has done walkthroughs  Cons: -Too many cut scenes
965	Very fun. Don't go into the game as a sandbox murder game (that's the sequel). It's a puzzle game and as such there is not a lot of replayablity as there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles. Think of it more like a 3D Phoenix Wright game and you'll enjoy it. Little Lucius is very fun little murderer to play as and watching the family (especially the mother) go nuts as the body count in the house rises is a treat. The murders are also all pretty inventive and fun to watch. Some are just downright gruesome. Give it a playthrough with these things in mind and you'll probably like it.
966	Really loved the game, and obviously the fact of beeing son of the devil &gt;:3. Funny to play, average cutscenes, but not as interactive and 'free' as lucius 2 in my opinion, cuz you have to follow the rules and have limited space to work with. BUT, it doesnt prevent it to be a good game!  Probably a 8/10, and recommendable! :D
967	Honestly Ive played through this game and almost 100%'ed the achievments, in my personal opinion a brillaint game would definatley recomend it. I found hours flying by and me saying to my self, just one more murder. The story lines okay could be better but overal I'd definatley say give it a chance.
968	i enjoyed it. killing everyone + my parents was pretty cool. the only thing i disliked about it was how ambiguous the puzzles were, things got better whenver i realised i had to do the chores my mom told me to do in order to get a compass which sort-of-kind-of shows you where to go.... who am i kidding, the compass is sh it.
969	Its a good game yo, get it, i wouldnt of paid more than Â£6.99 on it though
970	Excellent game. Only thing I don't like is the walking + camera mechanics, they seem off but easy to get used to. Definitely a creepy game with interesting cut scenes.
971	The obvious vote for the game will be 6,66/10 (isn't funny?). No, really, the game is somewhere in between 6 and 7. Worth a try.
972	As you can see I haven't played this game so much yet, but I've already found a couple of issues with the game, that's quite off putting for me.  First of all, the 3rd person view they've decided on using for the game, is incredibly annoying. Lucious's head is in the way a lot of the time if you need to have a closer look at things (which you often do), and at too far a distance, it gets hard to see what's hidden inside all the drawers and cupboards.  Secondly, I have to admit I was a tiny bit disappointed at the lack of a 'sandbox' mode, when this game is being described by the developers as 'Open World'. I can accept the premise that the house and the surroundings is the only area you can be in, but the fact that it isn't sandboxed, and it feels like you're being forced to do things in a certain way (where's the fun in that?) is definitely a bit off putting.   However, when all that's said and done, I haven't played that game that much yet (mainly because of the 3rd person issue), so as such, this review can mostly comment on the mechanics of the game.   The actual game itself, and the premise for it, seems amazing (which is why I bought it in the first place), so hopefully these things will manage to negate the drawbacks of the game.  I'm still having trouble getting into the game because of the way they made 3rd person viewing, and the lack fo any 1st person viewing, but I'd still reccommend this game try, if you happen to find it on offer.
973	can i have some help after the intro it just gives me a black screen but the music is playing
974	My name is my own, but I assure you, it is important. My review is rather simple and to the point; Luciud is a fantastic game insofar as it is not only well written and acted, especially for an 'indie' developer, but the game itself is rather well made, easy to learn and presented well. The graphics, while not on the level of those super-realistic new games, are just as good as any, and better than I would expect to see. The voice acting, whilst not always on-cue, is itself fair. I have yet to finish the game, but I also have yet to encounter any sort of graphical, scripting or other errors one usualy finds in the 'bigger' games of today, bugs being so prevailient within most engines, I am supprised to find a 'clean' game. Now for the story, the one thing I hold highest in any game. The story is amazing, well written, well executed and in plain simple english, it is great. If this game were a book, it would be a great read and I would have trouble putting it down. You can be assured that apon completion of this game, I will be purchasing the next Lucius title, quite happily.
975	This game is hard as a Mofo. It's very confusing (you need a walkthrough because stuff just isnt obv.) Maybe im just horrible and stupid? PROBABLY :p. The graphics are nice, its not crisis but its surprisingly pleasing to look at and runs great on maxed settings. I'd say its a mixture of a puzzle game and a horror/supernatural thriller mystery? Yeah that works. I wouldnt pay the full $10 but on sale it's a great addition and lasts around 6-10 hours. :) I give it a 7/10.
976	Great game with a great story. The controls are sometimes frustrating, but its not really a big issue. The story is kinda short. Still its one of the best indie games on steam
977	Why Does it Feels so Good ! So Good To Be Bad !
978	Super fun though it ran a little slow (Probably my computers fault) but it was still very playable 10/10 would play again.
979	This game makes its players struggle through its endless bugs, truly awful voice acting/animation, and cheesy dialouge with overuse of slow motion that gives the game an almost comedic tone.  Never the less, I did force my way though the levels, and I still got some fun out of it, but otherwise I'd really not reccomend this. It is just too shoddily made. 4/10.
980	A sadistic little piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ kills everyone in the house including priests?! Love it. 5/7.
981	So in this game you play as a kid who kills people........also hes â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Get this game.
982	thsi game is fun and the creative ways to kill people are awesome. only problem i had was the camera was not what i was used to, but it was still good.
983	This game is short but sweet it took me 7 hours to finish and is a breath of fresh air, original, fun and keeps you wanting to see the story unfold.  I really enjoyed this game despite having issues with fps drops all the time on low settings with better then recommended specs.  Still really good game and worth playing 7/10
984	Freaking amazing so far, I am having fun haha my thoughts considering I haven't finished yet I am hooked at the countless possibilities, I am gonna see it through! If anyone needs a gameplay on it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEEXCM7wx8 
985	10/10
986	It's a good game, but if you outsmart the game, it breaks
987	I enjoyed this game. You're on a pretty tight leash and can't do things creatively, but each person has a specific death with an absurd cutscene. Sometimes its quite difficult trying to figure out what to do and you'll find yourself running around the mansion for a long time looking for a small item, but you eventually figure it out. I had fun playing this and would recommend it. Not the best game out there, but worth it, especially if it goes on sale.
988	This game is all about doing chores, hanging around in the house, and trying to kill the people you don't like. And that's basically my life too.
989	nice game, i found this game in youtube, when pewdiepie play it.
990	This game is amazing and so great. It's like Hitman, so if you're a fan of Hitman then you'll love this game too
991	anti-christ? anarchist? kill them all. rule the world, watch it burn!
992	10/10 would kill again.
993	Give me back my money
994	This is a terrific interactive horror. I reccommend wholeheartedly.
995	Nice game.
996	This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it. It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. Go buy it if you want to play it, I had a fun time with it, and I believe you won't be disappointed
997	It Game so Good
998	I can finally be the evil dude in a game! Ever wanted to be the murderous son of Satan? Oh you have!? Then get Lucius! :D
999	Is a good horror game .
1000	Hastalavistagaming played it and its AWESOME
1001	  pretty good game
1002	Too scared to play this by myself  10/10
1003	Lucius was a lot of fun. Bought 1 and 2 on sale for around 5 bucks. Definitely recommend!
1004	im on â¥â¥â¥â¥in rampage
1005	You play as Lucius a little boy who receives orders from the Devil himself ordering you to kill various people in the mansion in where you live.  In order to do this you will have to roam the huge mansion in search of items which you can use. Figuring out which items to use on a person and how to perform the execution without being caught can be tricky and you will have to use your brain to figure out the best way.  Overall a pretty fun game grab it when it's on sale, it only takes around 9 hours to complete and the achievements are easy.
1006	This game is fun and interesting, but sometimes funny glitches pop up.  Also don't expect too much, because there are some annoying bugs. Achievements are easy and fast to do, except 'I like this game' and 'I'm Addicted' achievements.  Good story, fun to kill those people, good sounds.  8.5/10 
1007	Amazing game, Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^
1008	I really want to like this game. I want to like it so much that I played through the whole thing, despite realizing how bad it was going to be 20 minutes in. It's right up my alley with its grizley subject matter and over-the top style. Everything is lovably purple, with the number 666 showing up pretty much anywhere any kind of number is called for. On that level the game is brilliant.   But aside from a lovable style, there's not actually much of a game here. There's no freedom, no challenge. Each level drops you into the house, where you follow a line on a map until you run into a certain NPC. The game shouts 'There! That's the person you're trying to kill on this level!' Then you check your notebook for some hint at how the game wants you to get that job done. You follow that hint until you reach another hint, then follow that hint, and so on, until someone dies. There's never more than a single path towards killing any given target, so there's no decisions to be made. The only thing that might actually be considered a challenge is figuring out what the hints mean. The hints oscilate between so obvious as to be trivial, and so obtuse as to be useless. There's no happy middle between the two. No sense of satisfaction in figuring stuff out.   Then there are the times when you need a tool that isn't already in your inventory. Some specific item, like a screwdriver. Your first instinct is to go look for where you'd keep a screwdriver in your own home. Is it in the garage? The tool shed? Nope. It's on a table in the sitting room. You just have to wander around aimlessly, scanning every drawer and surface while you wonder if you're missing something that would make this fun.   The demonic powers are also a little annoying. I could ignore the fact that the telekenisis never feels right, or that the fireballs are basically only available in pre-scripted sections of the game. That stuff, to a degree, makes sense. But the ability to make people forget seeing you doesn't even work! The moment your seen, all of the controls go completely dead, so there's no opportunity to use it. I went so far as intentionally getting caught multiple times in a row just to try and figure out what I was doing wrong, but it's no use.   The game's cutscenes are too numerous and too boring. And even as numerous as they are, they often fail to explain things. Without spoiling anything, the game's story makes a few strange leaps forward that I still don't really understand. Several characters apparently come out of nowhere. Halfway through the game everyone starts talking about my uncle. Your mom even tells you to stop bothering your uncle, because he's been complaining about you lately. Meanwhile I'm left to wonder who or where my uncle is, because it's the first time I'm hearing about him.   I'm disappointed that the game wound up being as bland and boring as it is. The graphics are nice and clear, the controls are mostly pretty solid, the deaths are reasonably creative. In most respects the game is a competently assembled thing. But there are just too many problems for me to give it a blanket recommendation.   I'd say you should buy it only if you meet two criteria: 1. You, like me, think the premise is AWESOME.  2. It's on sale for less than $3.   Otherwise, give this a pass.
1009	A short way in and already frustrated. I can't stand it anymore. It's not like it has no shred of entertainment value, but I find it far from a fun game.   It's linear, so you have no choices in how it goes - I had hoped for a little more creative space, but that's my faulty expectation I guess. It's more like a chore-like puzzle than anything else. At one point you need to gather laundry... somehow you can only do this one â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sock at a time. It's a minor thing, but the annoyance builds. And why the hell do I need to do that with 2 housekeepers in the house? WTF.  It's buggy... I had a bug right at the cinematic after the tutorial. Lip sync is off, clipping in animations. At one point you need to avoid your mother, but her pathing is so utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that she gets stuck on the staircase, or in an open doorway, fails to open a door and just keep walking at and away from it.... and half the time the game just games over right there. I just can't get past after 8 tries. It's bloody annoying, because it's not the challenge but the game that keeps me from progressing. At other point you just know that you need to use a specific item, but you move on because your cursor doesn't trigger a use function... only to find out wih google you needed to target a specific micro part that takes a while to get your cursor on right. Come on...  After a bit I just lost interest. Oh, another person needs to die. Okay. It's a nice theme, but the gaming element is just weak. I will try to finish it, but it just feels like driving with the handbrake on and a steering wheel that will only turn left.  EDIT after a few more hours: On the last few missions, my save file is corrupt and I can't play it. It just crashes when I load it and I really can't be bothered to start the earlier mission again. The entire experience was meh, no replayability, the steam achievements are not challenging because you get them after each scripted kill. I spent near to no money on it, so no harm done there, but damn don't bother with this.
1010	I wish that I could show you the screenshots I took while playing this game. Lucius came at the right time for me after playing a game that had no killing whatsoever, and I am so happy to say that it overdelivered in terms of the violence I was looking for. Despite the graphics being undercooked for a game that's only a couple of years old, the voice acting being a little under par, and almost every puzzle in the game consisting of only four steps, what Lucius lacks in polish it certainly more than makes up for in graphic, satisfying, violence. Having picked this one and it's sequel up for less than a cup of coffee in a recent sale, I probably wouldn't have even played the first instalment except that I saw it had been released in the last couple of years. â¥â¥â¥â¥ I'm glad I did though, because it would have been a huge mistake to miss out on this little gem! Reminiscent of early PS2 games like Hitman, just shorter, and with more gore and less guns... but Satan... and a tricycle... so yay.
1011	I bought this and Lucius II in a bundle (I haven't played Lucius II yet) for like $1.75 or something.  For the price, I guess it's been okay?  It feels really empty, poorly explained, the video and audio aren't synced at all, and it just seems like the game is trying to keep you busy with simple tasks over and over.  It's like a poorly made Hitman clone, but with only one way to kill each person.  Rating: 2.3 / 10
1012	Anti-Christ Simulator 2012   Probably the only simulator game you can find out there with a story.
1013	The game has some really inspired visuals and interesting ideas; the plot is simple, but the storytelling is neat, with backstories and subplots, and the and everything is entertaining for the whole duration of the game. Some bugs and interactions may be cause of involuntary hilarity: higly recomanded for fans of b-movies 
1014	DO NOT miss a chance to pick up this game for the discounted steam price! I repeat! I mean cmon you play the son of Lucifer. the stealth mechanics are one of a kind and spot on, the story line is wonderful, there is loads of sublte, dark humour throughout the entire game. this game was very well planned out and put together! please play the first before you play the second. did i mention you play the son of lucifer. puzzle meets stealth, gorefest, with thrills and chills. its a must own. no real glitchs either. runs smooth and offers hours of fun.  8/10
1015	Apart from some glitch encountered with the notebook and chores missions, it's one of the funniest game I've played. Awsome achievements!
1016	After completing this after around 10 hours, I guess I have a few things to say about this game.   The only game I have played that is similar to this would be Among The Sleep. You know, where you're playing as a child and you'd really hate to see the kid get mauled by anything. Only this is different. ATS is a cute little toddler with his teddy, Lucius is a little psychopath and he reminds me of that kid from Ju-On. There's an order where people get killed by this little prick. You'll also need specific items to kill them. Maybe you'd want to blast them all to buggery with this fancy fire power thing you get half-way into the game but NO, you can't because that power only comes back to you occasionally (for reasons beyond me), you have to fart around the entire manor getting items needed to orchestrate the perfect murder. Most of the time you'll be on Youtube watching walkthroughs because you've run around the manor so much you're getting motion sickness and WHERE IS THIS STUPID TRASH THIS WOMAN WANTS ME TO TAKE OUT.   Get it during a sale, like I did. I wouldn't pay its full price even though it's only Â£7 because I am tight like that.
1017	This game that put a smile on my face. ( ï¾ â ï¾ )
1018	  I'm always scared yet I'm the one causing terror (à¥ËÌ£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£oËÌ£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£Ì£ à¥)â¼Â³ââ
1019	Loveable, cuddly, with just a bit of evil.
1020	After playing this game i literally googled 'how to make a pact with satan'.. The game has nice storyline and convinced me I could be the decendent of lucifer (praise be to him) himself.. Anyone who loves to manipulate peoples' life and be the cause of their suffering then play this game..Finished it in a few days though with some walkthrough help..
1021	Lucius is a very fun game. The story is very fun and it can be very chalenging at times. I am not one to like puzzle games but I found my self really enjoying this one. It is a great mix between a horror game and a puzzle game. Overall, I would give this game a 8/10 and I would recomend it.
1022	This game gave me the weirdest boner. Anyone else with me.
1023	  Now now, who doesn't like to brutally murder some people? I surely awakens that little devil that's hidden deep within you~
1024	First time getting a boner from a horror game.
1025	Its a pretty good game. I finished it in about 7 hours.... (the rest was just in idle to get achievements). It has some bugs still, and maybe its my computer but the graphics are alittle wonky at some points. Either way, it was a fun game, and I'm glad i bought it.
1026	very entertaining and SPOOKY
1027	Killing people the the anti-christ with mind powers is fun &lt;3
1028	Very surreal game, totally gonna ruin my life 11/11 love it
1029	i like trains but this is good game
1030	Finished this game within 9 hours and now I have to wait (idling) another 31 hours to fully complete all the achievements. Ggwp!
1031	This is one of my favorite games. If you like stealth or assassin games, you'll like this one.
1032	Hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and also for a bagde
1033	Nothing would make me happier than if this game was brought to XBLA!
1034	A really misunderstood kid is Lucius, one of the creepiest kids in games but so utterly, devastatingly adorable beyond measure!!!
1035	old but good story
1036	good game but dont take your time in between plays or swap with a controller in between you will forget all controls (or at leastr i did) and have to start over
1037	For as awful as this game handles there's a certain satisfaction in finally solving the puzzle that makes your groundskeeper stick his head in a lawnmower. The schlock writing and audio lifted from  FreeSounds.com  (which accounts for over half of the credits) makes this a fun, if very... VERY flawed, experience. Suggest to get on sale, if possible.
1038	As much as I love the thought of channeling my inner steamy Satan, the glitches in this game are too much for me. End of Chap. 2 when practicing Telekinesis, the cardboard box doesn't even spawn to put the car in. Restarted multiple times. Replayed both chapters multiple times. Redownloaded once. Even left it running for 30min at the bug for the hell of it. -Peace out Dante Manor-
1039	reminds my of a horror move and as a 'expert' horror movie watcher as myself i realy appriceated the story line along with the pulling attraction of suspence 8/10 
1040	I didn't have high expectations for Zombie Driver HD, but it's suprisingly good fun mowing down zombies in your car! My fav mode to play is Slaughter (survival) where the zombies keep coming which also has an online scoreboard to challenge your friends. Story mode is repetitive and gets pretty boring; there is a lot of content for the money though! Blood Racing is OK but most enjoyable once you get a good ride. Decent array of weaponry &amp; cars to choose from which are all upgradable (off course :p).         Aussiedroid's ZD:HD Players Handbook&nbsp;
1041	This is a strange little game really - it's kind of like super sprint and micro machines but in a sort of open world setting where you do missions which involve driving from A to B and you have to kill as many zombies as possible. Its a great little mish mash of genres to create something a little bit different and it works. It even has boss fights too.   It also has a racing career mode too and the races are kinda nuts really as you try stay in front, kill zombies and win to earn more money to buy better cars, upgrades and weapons.   The only real con to the game so far is the poor voice acting but then I didnt buy this for the voice acting or immersion really. I just wanted a fun little game to go between other games that didnt require me to amass an encyclopedias worth of knowledge about builds, techniques startegies etc but would let me rip loose and feel like a boss. This game does that.  It aint no FORZA but then you don't get to kill zombies in FORZA. brought it on sale - totally worth the money.  ---- edit --- and still loving it a few weeks later. Ace game to go to everynow and again for thoughless violence
1042	Turn your brain off fun. Great amount of entertainment for the price. I actually made money by selling the cards that I got from the game. Win/Win.
1043	I bought it for the badge and the 'cute' red skull-emoticon. But it is surprisingly entertaining and varied, if you hate pedestrians... It looks very nice and gory - must have been forgotten by the german FSK-moralizers. Car's control sufficiently, but don't use the keyboard, otherwise your hand drops off.   Nice. - 7.5/10
1044	Zombie Driver HD: The remake of... Zombie Driver. Both games are mad fun. This one is prettier. Not really a lot I can say about the game. You are a cabbie who winds up in the middle of a zombie outbreak and gets press-ganged into working for the military. But he gets chainguns on his cab so cool I guess. You shoot stuff and get money. Three different modes: Story, Blood race, and Slaughter. Story you know, Blood Race is best out of X number of rounds tournaments with different game modes and slaughter is arena zombie killing. Stupid fun, moderately easy to 100%. Get it sucka.
1045	Look like GTA top down style view but it's still very interesting! :'&gt;
1046	This game is simple is awesome! I have several friends who play and leader board competitions between friends keeps me coming back to defend my scores. The graphics are well done and the physics are excellent. Playing with a controller makes the game more enjoyable as well. Hoping for Zombie Driver 2 with multiplayer.
1047	        YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Cheap PC Games: Zombie Driver HD Review&nbsp;
1048	This remake of Zombie Driver adds some new content and modes to play, though the modes are kinda useless the base game itself is still very enjoyable and fun. A top down isometric GTA style view except now with more zombehs. Choose diff vehicles and enjoy mowing them all down. The plus for the remake in HD is the controls work much better instead of the confused mess they were in the last version. The tournament mode is sorta meh, rubberband racer AI, weird things that make your car flip over or spin around. Ignoring the modes which are a failed experiment, the game itself gives what all zombie fans want more of, more zombies! Lots of replayability with mission select so you can test out all the cars to get your zombie fix.  Rating: 10/10 Value: $9.99
1049	How many ways are there to kill zombies now? A lot more than there needs to be, thatâs for sure. I was socially inept enough to jump on the zombie bandwagon before it was cool, back before 28 Days Later and the Zombie Survival Guide brought them back from their long post-Thriller twilight. Iâve cooled on them enough that zombies as a bullet point is more likely to drive me away from a game, so keep that in mind while I explain just how much I enjoy Zombie Driver HD.  The main draw of Zombie Driver is the story mode, posing you as a nameless motorist in a city beset by the undead plague. Every mission takes place on the same wide-open GTA-style map, sending you to different areas to rescue survivors, destroy zombie strongholds, or defeat enormous bosses. Ramming is sufficient to splatter most zombies but for bigger targets there are weapon pickups scattered all over, giving you machine guns or flamethrowers to cull the hordes with. Youâll also find repair pickups (which you will need because damage can come in huge bursts) and money, used between missions to upgrade your cars. And that is cars plural, because you unlock sports cars and limos and police cruisers over the course of the campaign. Thereâs not a lot of variety in the missions and the characters are all voiced so badly itâs funny, but they make simple excuses to run over thousands of zombies.  The driving really is the best part of the game, appropriate for a game called Zombie Driver. Your vehicles are different degrees of responsive but all are fast and all make satisfying messes out of the undead. Youâll fight different kinds of zombies including dogs and giant exploders and worse, and they all erupt into fountains of giblets and leave crimson streaks on the pavement. Itâs a viscerally satisfying game, even if the sound effects arenât always up to the task of capturing the slaughter. Weapons do tons of damage and clear out crowds, and you get mounting monetary bonuses for long streaks of carnage. Much like in Carmaggeddon, Itâs easy to lose track of mission objectives just because youâre having so much fun roadkilling things.  The HD in the title does indeed mean this is a remaster of a previous Zombie Driver, but with more going for it than just prettier graphics. The campaign is longer, with a full 31 missions and several new bosses to battle. There are new vehicles as well, which can also be used in the gameâs Blood Race and Slaughter modes. Blood Race is, again, much like Carmaggeddon where you race against other cars, crushing zombies and blowing up your opponents to progress. Slaughter is you against mounting waves of zombies with its own progression system of weapons and upgrades. Youâll find plenty to keep you busy as long as you enjoy plowing through zombies, and when itâs done this well thereâs really no reason not to.
1050	 Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn. Days go on and on. They don't end.  â Travis Bickle, Taxi Driver (1976)  And still too many zombies to run them over ;)  After 16h (one-time story, all-gold Slaughter mode, all Blood Race tournaments): PROS + immersive (don't know why: :P) + nice graphics and effects + mixed vehicles + Slaughter mode  CONS - average-bad cameras in relation to the game's speed - sometimes really freaking annoying - cut scenes that can't be missed and which also consume missions' time - even if the mission doesn't have a concrete time limit... suprise, countdown continues - main campaign is little too long, because missions are repeated - final boss with regeneration - Blood Race (Race is good, but Eliminator's too chaotic and Endurance... strange mix of time driving and killing zombies) - a few minor bugs     Subjective rate : B- (this game doesn't deserve either the thumb up or thumb down. That's the truth. It's in the middle, but really only for z-fans. Or Carmageddon/GTA1&amp;2 veterans.)
1051	Good game, easy to pick up and play. Lots of action and variety of weapons. Different modes of play were also fun.
1052	So far I've only played through a few hours of the story mode so this review relates to that. I'm looking forward to trying race mode later.  I always have a nostalgic hankering for a decent top down driving game but am usually disappointed. Zombie Driver HD however is fantastic fun.. Rich environments much of which you can destroy, engaging story, awesome voice acting (in the best B movie tradition), convincing hoards that can swamp you if you're careless, great explosive visual effects, quality audio and HUGE zombie bodycounts.  While you are required to develop a certain amount of driving skill it should'nt be too frustrating for novices of the top down style. missions can be completed at a slower pace, sticking to the streets but don't worry about leaving the road, the maps are sensibly designed so you don't constantly get stuck on scenery or in dead ends. As you become skilled with the handbrake you'll be pulling donuts and rail gunning through hundreds of bloody undead.  The different vehicles work well and purchaseable upgrades mean you're always tempted to stray from the mission to grab extra cash found around the city.  The atmosphere created in the game is great, weather changes, night time lighting, the army presence, shadows of jet fighters roaring overhead, vehicle getting covered in blood and a constant tension created by time critical mission elements all add the feel of this great little game.  One thing I would like added is the ability to move the camera a little to scan the environment. Playing with an xbox controller this seems untuitively what the second stick should be used for, although it's arguable that you shouldn't be able to see much further than the street you're driving in.  So in my opinion the developers have done a great job of creating a top down driving game set in a zombie apocalypse, if that sounds like something you need, you should probably grab it in a sale like I did, or at full price if you're feeling flush.  FUN.
1053	Its mindless fun, just go kill stuff. Great to pass time or just play when you dont feel like anything. But I only reccomend it when its like 75% off or more.
1054	Just drive back and forth until it feels right. When that doesn't happen, go make yourself some french fries and just keep goin until the screaming stops. When you're done with the fries, keep goin until your car is upgraded enough that you no longer slow down when the zombies become to thick. Do not play this game in real life unless you're sure there are zombies out on streets in your city. Apparently the military is too busy to kick some zombie â¥â¥â¥, so they have enlisted you to run over some zombies using all sorts of zany vehicles with many possible upgrades.     Just remember to keep goin!
1055	Love this game, its really good to play if your to tired to play a hard game like Fallout3.  Loads of replay value too, i am on my Third playthrough and its still just as fun.
1056	Wow, this was a deal for $3.00 with all the DLCs. Excellent, solidly well made game, experienced none of the problems other players reported. Tons of fun to play and even good single-player story campaign. I even bought a controller just for this game and now its among my favorites. Great way to release all that road RAGE!
1057	Zombie Driver HD. well first of all this game is not 3D but its sooo Awesome because its also same like L4D2 or Dead Island but this time its with Cars!, and i have to say This game actually made my day if im feeling a little bored for some reason and yes i Recommend that game to play.    Rating:9/10
1058	The Story: Basically those lovely Government Scientists have been having some creative fun with their chemistry sets. Causing a lovely accident that has turned the inhabitants of an entire city into shambling aggressive Zombies. Which of course you are asked to kill as many as you can while doing missions for the military.  Game play: What can I say. Its top downish drive shoot and ram to kill zombies, while doing missions. All good ol fun if you like killing zombies.   The Graphics: They are simple and good enough in my view for the game. But for those who are picky and want things looking really like real life then this would probably effect them. But for this game I say its just right.  Controls: Controls are simple nothing to hard to learn. SWAD for movement LMB for shooting and RMB for Nitro. Petty simple there is other combos for the the controls as well as game pad. But I just stuck with the Keyboard n mouse. Still fun with them.  The Music: It does go nice with the game. It even had the feel of some older games, the names escape me at this point though. It certainly fits the style of game.  The Reply Value: With the other game styles you can get and the dlc. There is some reply value in it. Plus am sure the any zombie killing lover will reply it a lot.  Bugs/Glitches: I could not see any bugs or glitches that could effect my game play of this game. But remember that's not saying that they might pop up for others. But for me none what so ever.  Overall: Its a fun zombie killing game, with some nice graphics that suit the game. Easy to use controls, music that go's with the game in my view. Certainly has reply for those zombie killing lovers. No bugs or glitches that I can see. Story was to me generic, but that's me. So in my view this is a nice game to play. So I give it a 7 out of 10.
1059	So this game is hella fun...People still say 'hella,' right? Anyways, more important than the entertainment to be had, in my opinion, is its value to achievement junkies. If you're anything like me and have difficulty getting it up for games that don't have a nice fat achievements, this game will be your mistress. I beleive this is the only game I've gotten 100% on, but I havn't been hunting on PC long, as I believed Steam lacked incentive to obtain achievements. I recently discovered the achievement percentage, and mine was 22%. Pathetic. Figured I'd start bumping it up by playing the bottom game in my library, and beleive me, my child, I picked the right one.   
1060	Zombie cats, dogs,humans, fat people, plants, buses, shipping containers, Mounds, and  the Father of all Zombies! and we get to mow most of them down with that beautiful front bumper and KILL THE REST WITH GUNS!!!!! got game + all DLC for $3 totally worth it.
1061	[NOTE: All of my reviews are based off of value for money/comaparison to price. I purchased 'Zombie Driver HD' for 69p with a 90% off voucher.]  To start. This is one of those fun little games that you would play when you don't have enough time to play a missoin on a bigger game but want to play something. (Damn those poorly timed meetings.)  Story: A zombie acopalypse strikes. You are a taxi driver in a large city who is saved by the army. However, the army is limited and you are needed to assist in rescue efforts and clearing zombies out of certain areas. You car can be outfitted with various weapons and armour types. You can unlock new vehicles by completing secondary mission objectives.   Gameplay:  There are powerups/healthkits/weapons that you can collect around the map in a mission to make it a bit easier. You can Run over, Burn, Shoot and Blow up as many zombis as you can. There are also minigames such as races and wave survival. It is fun to play for those timess you are bored and want to play a full campaign.
1062	This game is an outright blast! Nothing beats using a car to mow down some zombies in a very well-detailed world. You can play in story mode, Blood Race and of course slaughter mode for some quick &amp; awesome zombie killing. Well worth a buy for some casual play and it even utilizes nVidia's PhysX.
1063	Great Story, but repeats it's missions pretty fast. Many Vehicles, extremely huge masses of Zombies and nice weapons for every situation.   Also a great Race Gamemode with destroying the other racers and a Arena-Survival Gamemode where you can try to survive. (Obvious, isn't it? xD)  I recommend this game for friends of Racers that like to drive over zombies in a bird's eye view.
1064	You can hit a building at full speed and take no damage... You can destroy other cars with ease and take no damage... You can destroy fences, street lights, cactuses/trees and take no damage...  But you can take damage when a zombie throws trash at you...
1065	Stupid amounts of fun, highly recommended!
1066	For the cheap price of this game and the level of fun you'll have, you might be quite surprised when you play Zombie Driver. Its basically what you might expect in terms of its name but just the realism and fun you can have with the vehicles alone is great mix. Along with a few interesting extra mini-games to keep you going. The game has alot of heart to it and the overall control of the vehicles is based upon the vehicle itself or how you read the city and not from bad game mechanics. You might lose a few times in some levels, but the overall result of this game definitely made you feel like a total badass zombie killer. And isn't that what we all want? ^O^
1067	Got this on sale along with all DLC. Easily one of the most fun games I have played. Well woth the price. Would love to see even more content or possibly a sequel.
1068	I'm not the world's biggest fan of driving games. And surely I'm not the only die-hard horror fan who has to started to grow weary of zombies. But this game is actually fairly awesome.    Beautiful graphics, logical maps and understandable physics. What more can one ask for in a game where the objective is to drive over and gun down hordes of zombies in heavily-accessorised cars? If there's a better zombie-driving game out there, I'd sure like to see it. Good, unclean fun.  Verdict: 9/10.
1069	I actually really like this one. Not sure if there's anything bad to say about it. It's not your Triple-A title with a rich plot and surprisingly innovative gameplay but I don't think that it intends to be that. If you want to let off steam, this is it. Kinda like Nation Red, only in a car.  Quality is also very good, visually and technically. Oh, and good controller support; playing it with a Xbox 360 controller.  One of the few games I like to get back to now and then and still enjoy it. Recommended.
1070	  Blood, cars, guns, cars with guns, explosions and, of course, zombies! What' not to like about this game. It has a decent campaign (4-5 hours), although it is kind of repetetive (no more than 5 type of missions), but every single one is satisfying.  The weapons feel great, the driving feels good and the camera may make you dizzy at first by there are 3 more option to change to.  *You have to play the game with a gamepad. The keypord controls are very clanky. Apart from the campaign there are to more mods to play, racing with others through zombies, and surviving waves of zombies. To sum up, fun game, worths the money, use gamepad.
1071	I love this game, the blood mode racing is pretty hard, but the story made is really fun.
1072	It's okay. Repetitive and the end missions are stupidly unforgiving though.  It's fun for a while, at least. One to pick up when it's cheap.
1073	Very entertaining game. Has 3 game modes and multiple vehicles. Story mode has 31 missions and they are kinda short. Race mode is a little difficult on my opinion, but fun as well. Slaughter mode is great but a little exhausting. The gold score is high and you get points very slowly. But you get used to it and actually don't even pay attention to the score while playing. Really enjoyable. Better than I expected. Great addition to my library.
1074	7.5/10 What an awesome little game. Easy in, easy out... I enjoy little bursts of this while waiting for friends to come online to play + I only paid .99c for it. Supper Value!
1075	I didn't know this game existed until I received a coupon for it, then I found out how addictive it was to run zombies down in a yellow cab. This game is awesome, if a bit buggy at times, and is definitely worth a look.
1076	What's more fun than killing zombies?  Running them over with a nitro boosted bus that has a flamethrower.   9.999999/10 Would flamethrow again. 
1077	it's alright.
1078	mmm i love this meat delicious zombie racing game. it gets you entertained and never makes you feel embarassed/annoyed. graphics are really good, i don't see any problem with the camera look, it makes fun in gameplay. plot is standard. basically it's a nice game to relax/chill. you won't regret ;)

1080	Zombie Driver is a damn good game, but if you read my recommendation for the original version, you knew that already. This HD version adds some choice features like rechargable turbo, boss fights, an extended story mode, and a guest appearance by the van from L4D's Crash Course campaign. It's a classic top-down driving game in the vein of Death Rally or the original Grand Theft Auto, with plenty of fast action, violence and fun to spare. It's a simple pleasure with no multiplayer, but it's got a triple combo of story missions, races and survival modes. If you didn't play the original game, then this is the version to get. So strap in and gun that engine, those zombies aren't going to splat themselves.
1081	7.5/10 What an awesome little game. Easy in, easy out... I enjoy little bursts of this while waiting for friends to come online to play + I only paid .99c for it. Supper Value!
1082	Really fun game driving round killing zombies in a kitted out killing machine of a car, good if you just want to play something fun for a while to pass time, after a while gets abit repetitive but its good as a time waster.
1083	All I can say about this jewel is ''OH MY GOD IT'S FUN''. Basically it's a bird's eye view zombie shoot/ram/blow up game that will fill your heart with joy and sometimes frustrate the hell out of ya. Gameplay is excellent and so are the graphics and sound effects. Variety of game modes, customizable vehicles and weaponry will keep you busy for hours.  So get out and ram some zombie arses :)  cheers
1084	Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto. Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.  Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over Â£2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.  In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best 'indie' game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.   Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.  Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.  Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.  Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.  Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.   I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.  Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.  If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.   ***EDIT***  Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.
1085	This game is the biggest example why graphics isnt everthing.
1086	Probably the best $2 I've ever spent on the world wide web. Who doesn't enjoy hood mounted death machines on a taxi? I for one enjoy very much what I recently spoke of.  I award this game 8 rum and colas out of 10.
1087	I bought this game way back before it was on steam and enjoyed it. Was pleasently surprised to see it on sale recently and decided to buy it, even though I have the original version of the game. Well worth the purchase. Graphics are updated, as well as parts of the story and gameplay. You drive around running over and shooting zombies. What else do you need? Great for killing time when you don't feel like playing a big in-depth game. Worth the couple of bucks I paid for the complete edition.
1088	Wow. For a quick action fix heavy on the mayhem you need look no further than ZD HD. Sooo much better than the original. Easy to pick up, hard to master but pure fun all the way. This game is worth it, especially if you can grab it on sale. Works great with a controller. Story mode, race mode, and slaughter mode and a lot of achievements make this a versatile and fun action game. Whether you play for 5 minutes or 5 hours, you will enjoy this one.
1089	The title of this game basically tells you all you need to know about the gameplay: run over zombies with your selected vehicle. You run over zombies or kill them with weapons attached to the vehicle while completing primary and secondary objectives in the story mode.  The story mode has a basic plot that is very typical for zombie based games, not ground breaking. It looks like another apocalypse. Your mission begins with a briefing from General Blofeld that you must clear out an area filled with zombies or rescue certain people who are being overwhelmed by zombies. As you go about your mission, you run over zombies while your vehicle gets covered in blood and earn combo bonuses. These combo bonuses continue to multiply if you continue to mow down zombies in a bloody mess, something like chaining your matches in Audiosurf. The top-down perspective looks like the first 2 Grand Theft Auto games and the action looks like the Carmageddon series since you are constantly causing a bloody good time around town.  The weapons are scattered around town and all are pretty useful. They include flamethrowers, machine guns, railguns, rocket launchers, and nitro. All weapons can be upgraded using the cash you earn from each mission completed. The nitro really speeds up your car and helps you reach your destination faster, but it is also useful in getting out of a tight situation when being overwhelmed by large numbers of pedestrians that could potentially make your car explode.  Vehicles are varied and range from taxis to buses. Some vehicles are more useful than others in some missions. The military may ask you to rescue 8 people in a given mission, so the best vehicle could be the bus because it has a carrying capacity of 48 people. All vehicles can be upgraded for more speed and better ramming ability. Even with the variety of weapons at your disposal, ramming zombies with power slides and using nitro to go full speed ahead is still more common than shooting.  The zombies range from regular zombies to exploding zombies. The regular zombies are small or medium in size and there are many zombie dogs run over. The real challenge comes in the form of exploding zombies. Exploding zombies are the fat zombies who can detonate themselves when they get near your vehicle. You can be earning great combos while killing 300+ zombies, only to be ruined by a group of 3-4 exploding zombies who commit suicide next to your vehicle, causing it to explode.  There are a few bosses to battle in the game. These bosses can only be defeated with enough firepower using the various weapons in town. It is also necessary to use defense by running away from them when they are ready to attack. A lack of defensive moves will lead to certain death. In addition, the zombies will never leave you alone during boss battles. So, while you are running away to restock ammo the zombies are chasing you. When you are firing away at the bosses the zombies are still attacking you.  There are other modes in the game that add to the zombie splattering fun. There is the blood race mode and the slaughter mode. The blood race mode is about tournaments that require you to compete in different events such as races, eliminator, and endurance and have bronze, silver, and gold medals available. Races require you to finish 1st for gold and you can destroy vehicles by ramming them or with your weapons. Eliminator events require you to cause as many wrecks as possible while going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. Endurance events require you to drive around with a bomb stuck to your vehicle going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. The trick in Endurance events is to kill zombies and destroy as many objects as possible to contribute to the time remaining. The slaughter mode is a good old fashioned zombie killing, splattering entertainment. It is all about killing as many zombies as possible from one wave to the next until your vehicle explodes.  The graphics are decent and, while not dazzling, they provide a well-detailed environment. The death animations look cool and make you feel like it is so much fun making your vehicle all red in blood and guts. You can hear the zombies writhe in pain very loudly when you splatter them all over your vehicle or when you blow them away with your weapons.  The vehicles handle well, as the physics feel realistic during the times you have to turn and perform power slides. They also feel realistic according to the type of vehicle. The muscle car feels very fast whereas the bus feels slow, but very powerful for ramming zombies. The super car feels like it is both fast and powerful since it combines all the great attributes of speed and power.  Some may be disappointed by the fact the Zombie Driver HD has no multiplayer. True, there is more replay value after playing the story mode because of the blood race and slaughter modes. However, those who love multiplayer action will not have any opportunity to compete in multiplayer mode.  I think Zombie Driver HD is a lot of fun to play. The story mode feels a little bit short in length, but it is still entertaining enough. The blood race and slaughter modes provide more entertainment and replay value for a low price of $9.99. All the zombie crushing and splattering fun makes this game worth your purchase.  My Score: 7.5/10 
1090	Once you get past the touchy controls, you'll enjoy.
1091	This game reminds me of Death Rally. If you enjoy top down zombie killing, worth the pickup. Story mode was not overly long, but I could see me coming back to replay this for a 'quick fix'
1092	It's actually not a bad game at all. It's very fun and addicting. It would be good if the game had a free roam in it. I love the blood in the game :D. Got it for 0.70â¬ using a coupon :D :P
1093	Nothing innovative, nothing impressive, but it managed to give me the thrill and excitement of driving around a decently rendered city in a badass vehicle and killing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s of zombies while doing it, for me, that's simply enough.
1094	Very addictive,I recommend you to play it!
1095	This is bloody and fun. =) Everything I gonna say is in the demo so yeah, play it. =) It's fun.
1096	A wild crazy zombie game, for the fans of gta 1 &amp; 2 who want to run over every pedestrian without feeling guilty...after all, they are zombies! great guns and modes too
1097	Only get this game if you have a gamepad game has keyboard controls but it's not precise enough in my opinion. also of note is that keyboard controls can't be configured although I worked around it by using autohotkey.  recommended because I can't say I'm not recommending it with the very little I played (yes I'm missing a gamepad)
1098	Ive finished the main story now. Almost a good game... Some fun, but the Cut Scenes are the MOST ANNOYING I have EVER seen. You cant skip them, even when repeating a mission. I cant believe that they would put such a stupid restriction on the game (and from what I have heard, they WILL NOT change it, despite many complaints). They are TERRIBLE. The voice acting is poor (it comes across as cheesy / fun the first time or two), and the cut scenes ruin the pace of the game. Not to mention the stupid difficulty changes in each mission. And Im SICK AND TIRED of every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission being timed in one way or another. Create a game that is potentially fun, then not allow you to actually enjoy it (except in other game modes maybe). Would have gotten an 8/10, but I have to give it a 6... it does its best to ruin the long term (replayable) enjoyment of the game.
1099	A very fun game. Works best with a x-box controller.
1100	Total.â¥â¥â¥â¥ing.Mayhem.

1103	A very fun game. Works best with a x-box controller.
1104	Need for Speed + Carmageddon + Left 4 Dead = Zombie Driver It took only 20 hours to get all steam achievements for this game!
1105	Great game for carnage fun.
1106	Controller highly recommended!! While the storymode gets a bit repetative, the extras like slaughtermode and the tournaments really make this game fun to play from time to time. The gameplay is pretty much everything you see in the trailer, with a boss here and there.
1107	Fun game and a perfect choice for achievement hunters
1108	Great arcade game. It has different game modes and a good amount of unlockables. It doesn't become boring, even after hours and hours of gameplay.
1109	Fun game, worth my 3 bucks, killing zombie is fun
1110	Play the game while listening to Highway to Hell.
1111	great game. it is with cars and zombies :)
1112	Lots a fun.Crushing zombies left and right
1113	Very lucky get it in promotion price very nice to play, challenging and recommended to play.
1114	I love this game its almost the zombie shooting and lot of costomozition and differents game mod
1115	Fantastic little game :') played the original.
1116	If you hate Zombies, then yes get this game !  7/10 would stay in my car, during the apocalypse - IGN
1117	Have player through the campaign. My review is: Absolutely fantastic!!!! 10 out of 10 as a platformer. Addicting gameplay, good graphics, great variety of missions and adversaries. I could not wish for more. This game is simply a must buy for everyone who likes zombies and racing.
1118	Very under rated and deserves more buy's only 20mins in but its already hell fun
1119	Zombie Driver HD is a good for game for people who wants to save people and the world.  Recommend.
1120	Maul zombies with cars. What more could you want?
1121	Nice game
1122	A fun combo of a driving and zombie game.
1123	This game... IS AWESOME!
1124	CRAZY !! BRVTAL  GORY !!  Imagine  Dead Rising Series + Carmageddon + Dota  yeah  DIS GAME  
1125	Definitely worth the money. Very fun game. Love killing zombies.
1126	It was fun for 30 minutes.
1127	Love this game! Its the kind of game you can go too after getting too stressed out on another OR just dont know what to play!  11/10 for me!
1128	Awesome game. Works great with controlers.
1129	Simple mindless fun.  Just drive around and mow down zombies.  Car mechanics are well made and fun. Objectives are decent enough. Not much to the game but does it well enough for the price.  Figured i needed a game like this for when the mood stikes, would recommend for others in need of a top down arcade game like this.  
1130	Game have really good graphic &amp; music, is really funny to play (boosters etc..) really good, 8.5/10 ;)
1131	This game is actually quite a good title, i find the gameplay is quite enjoyable and mostly it's challenging.
1132	This game is crazy fun. I got for $1.00 with my rank ups and I have to say it is very well done. If you like running over Zombies in that old format similar to the original Grand Theft Auto, Why not Zombie Driver? It's got a ton of features including updgrades for your vehicle and weapons. Give a shot.
1133	Fantastic improvements over the original game; day/night cycle, weather system, longer campaign and missions, new weapons, new mobs + bosses and new awesome vehicles like the tank (which kicks â¥â¥â¥ ofc) and the firesquad car... If you liked the first game, this is definitely a must buy and even if you never heard of the original, still is a must buy (cheap @ IG for 1$ atm)
1134	An honest brutal title to this game that you can't help but admire, The game that wastes time deliverying or experimenting with some new turn on dispatching contemporary gaming's most overuse ememies, It's basically just you and your car on a familar birdseye view format nostalgia on the early years of Grand theft Auto and the whole population full of zombies and some surviours in the whole state. Over the course of the game you smash through them causing a lot of destruction with weapons and choses of cars and school buses, fry them with flame throwers and rocket launchers and leveling up as you proceed further in the game. The game itself is quiet imaginative and creative all around, it's stupid and unrealistic, gory and quiet fun.
1135	great graphics, hard as hell, can make you dizzy if ya got bad sinuses..lol Nice upgrades, overall pretty nice little game.
1136	Fun Game but i recommend using a game controller, just to hard to steer with the keyboard
1137	So I got this game because I got a coupon for 50% off and thought why the hell not. It's been a pretty fun game so far but I have to say the gameplay is not that versatile. The missions u have to do are pretty much the same the entire time. You either have to pick up some survivors or destroy some zombie nest. And at times it feels more like your just focussing on collecting health and ammunition for most parts of the mission. The game on the other hand reminds me a bit of the very first GTA, and who doesnt like a bit of nostalgia.
1138	amusing zombie game, driving the car over the bodies feels like the old days playing GTA3. the animations are pretty similar.  the story mode is fine, there is also an arena and racing mode, many different perks, weapons and unlockable cars.  enough enemy types and simple controls round the package.  only bad points are the low quality sound and that its singleplayer only.  all together its sure worth the 8,99â¬ and fun if you like crunching some zombies!
1139	wow its good game I'm Like
1140	One of the best Zombie massacring games EVER!
1141	If you like killing the undead with cars that has gun on the hood, YOU! will love the shooting cobo, you will love Zombie Driver HD
1142	top down zombie slaying at its best!
1143	A good fun game. Lots of mission.
1144	++
1145	This game perfectly blends old school top down GTA with brutal mass zombie slaughter. You drive cars equipped with machine guns, flame throwers, rockets, shock weapons nitro boosts and more. There are plenty of weapons, vehicles and game modes to choose from. The great thing is that for those that grew up with GTA 1 and 2 on the playstation 1 there actually is a 'retro camera' mode where the free camera will fix itself just as the good old days.  The game is only 10â¬ and when on sale it goes down to 3â¬ INCLUDING all the DLC. This game is dirt cheap even at 10â¬. The story mode is well thought out, voiced, filled with multiple giant maps and a wide variety of different missions. On top of the pretty extensive story mode there are a ton of challenges, zombie killing combo modes and even races! The death races are crazy fun and brutally hard and those alone will keep you busy for quite a while. What's even more incredible is that for that small price tag, you don't only get a game jam packed with content, it actually looks really damn good too! Better than most more expensive games.  It's seriouslt almost a crime not to pick this up, especially when you are running into it when it's on sale.
1146	If you like to run over zombies with vehicles, get this game :D
1147	I only got this game because it was on sale and i wish i had bought it earlier. All i can say is that this game is a blast! Who does not love driving around in fast cars mowing down zombies with gun, flamethrowers, missiles and lasers? The story is amazing and has a ton of levels. And if you get bored of that there is the racing and slaughter mode to top it all off! Hours of fun and a game you can come back to when you get a bit bored. Would recommend to all gamers out there! - 10/10
1148	Story is good, Blood Race is good, Slaughter is good. 3 Modes, whole lot o' zombies.
1149	Zombie Driver HD's relatively low price point and reasonable replay value make it easy to recommend, so long as you aren't expecting something of full retail quality.
1150	I wouldn't say I'm a big fan of this game but.... seeing as I have the original 'retail' version a couple of times, I guess I must be.           YouTubeâ¢ Video:  â A Quick Look @ 'Zombie Driver HD'&nbsp;
1151	Game of the year, every year.
1152	blood and zombies 11/10
1153	it scary
1154	Rating: 7 out of 10  Genre: Driving Shooter / Zombie Killing  Thoughts:
1155	Very good taxi driving simulator.
1156	Kill them all!!!
1157	cars, zombies and weapons!
1158	Best game ever played, simple, efficient, most basic game but the feeling is so ....
1159	This game is good with action-packed fun!
1160	Buy this if you like puzzle game.
1161	very funy when driver over car in the city of zombie
1162	Really fun to play in short burts
1163	It's really funny and good to relieve one's boredom.
1164	Great game not that pure great but still great  Nice Graphics Great SoundTrack ...  the thing is that this game is not that easy . its fun to play but that easy.  In general way speaking ,its a pure blast ,if you are looking for something that has a top view arcade style game
1165	A mindless zombie killing game. Best described as lizard brain porn (you don't need to conciously think about it, but it still is pleasing).
1166	Great game for a cheap price
1167	this game is surprisingly good, i like it. the camera is a bit iffy, but a good game overall
1168	Kill kill the zombie !! A nice drive-in game.
1169	This is a very addictive game, buy it play it. You won't be sorry!
1170	Really Nice
1171	Its different from other Zombie games for sure but the camera controls are a bit akward but stil fun at times as long as you dont completa a mission and get killed on the way back to the base.
1172	It's cool and imersive. I recomend it, i just have a bit of troubble controlling the vehicles. Could be me or my hardware wish i could try a game pad on my PC. perhaps that would solve the controlling isue. Graphics are great and the game is challenging. Like the upgrades available for vehicles. Unlocking some, are fun! :D
1173	it is a great game, i recommend. every missions is diferent and i don't geat bored of playing this game.
1174	Mindless zombie fun but it eventually gets repetitive.
1175	Nothing like some Zombi guts all over you car.
1176	cars, zombies, weapons, driving, replay value. nuff said
1177	 Bottom line:  An enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games. Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!   Pros:    Video and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.   Multiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car! Sadly, I found all modes spoiled more often that not by the difficulty in identifying 'hard' obstacles and the unpredictable handling of the vehicles during collisions.   Weapon variety is decent and effective, but fairly uninspired. Power-ups are all incremental improvements until the last level, where power is doubled. Specialisation usually plays second fiddle to whatever happens to be lying around your general vicinity at the time.   No crashes in the ten or so hours spent in game (Windows 8).    Cons:    Unpredictable behaviour when hitting walls and other obstructions; sometimes you bounce, sometimes you stop dead, sometimes you instantly spin 180 degrees. A little frustrating in the main game, immensely frustrating in the race events! Came close to rage quitting a few times in this mode... Apart from this, the controls are fine (used M&amp;KB).   What 'story' there is remains utterly predictable throughout and voice acting is excruciating. I am sure its tongue in cheek, but its still horrible.   Performance drops and wavers noticeably once there are a  lot  of zombies on the screen. This is mainly an issue in arena mode, where huge hordes are a common occurence. This is on an i5 3570K with an AMD 6950.     DLC:    Mostly forgettable...   The included vehicles are overpowered and spoil the progression of the story mode a little.   If you are still looking for more of the same  after  completing the game, you won't be disappointed with the additional race and arena maps. If you are expecting something different, don't bother.  
1178	I played this expecting it to be a terrible waste of time. I am actually having a great time playing it. A great way to waste 30-45 minute time periods in between my Counter Strike matches. 8/10.
1179	Remember the first episode of the walking dead, where rick climbs in the tank, but doesn't use it to clear the walkers out?, well, this game has a level just for you. go forth, in a tank, and blow zombie guts all over the sides of skyscrapers.
1180	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.
1181	I Picked this game up on sale.  Lots of fun and works nicely with my xbox controller! I enjoyed playing it when I'm board of all my more time demanding games.  I recommend this it for its price and entertainment level it well worth the buy! 
1182	Reminds me of GTA 1. That's a good thing. Good controller support. Fun, totally mindless. Worth the voucher price, easy.
1183	Haha, epic fun. Don't expect anything too expansive though, comparable to web games
1184	Buy it and the DLC. Discounted at $2 is an amazing buy if you love tricking out post-apocalyptic cars to kill zombies.
1185	Good game! UPG racing ... alot of dead people there, survival mode and story mode.   Rate: 8.4
1186	Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!
1187	This is a very fun and addicting game with a fairly decent story. Do not play this game how ever for the story alone as you will be extremly disappointed. This game is best if you are wanting a kill them all driving game.
1188	seems like a pretty cool driving/zed killing game.
1189	Simple yet addictive guilty pleasure, Worth the 10 bucks (5 if you own the non HD version).
1190	A simple and fast/brutal action game. You may take some time to get used to the in-game camera but its lot of fun garanted. The DlCÂ´s bring some variation on skins mostly and some cars and the Blood Race is the most fun game mode to me. Take it !
1191	cool game go kill the zombies !
1192	If you're in the mood for some mindless slaughter of zombies, then this game is totally for you! Though I would definitely recommend having a controller for it, makes the game much more enjoyable.
1193	Beautiful Game , Insane mix of cars, speed, explosions, blood and zombies!
1194	I don't like zombie games and really can't remember why I bought this. You can choose between survival, racing or story mode.  Unlock cars and upgrades for those. You can pick up weapon mods like miniguns, rockets, flamethrower or a railgun. Partly destructible environment like picket fences, streetlights and parking cars.  Get mission rewards and achievements depending on your performance. Over hundred achievements and a six card set. 7/ 10  
1195	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.
1196	The closest remake of Blast Corps I've seen yet.
1197	Fun arcade style shoot 'em up game. Better with a controler IMO as the controls can be kinda twitchy with a KB/Mouse setup. Very fun romp.
1198	Such a simple game and idea yet had rediculous amounts of fun playing this game. You can rack up hours playing this and not notice the time go by. I think it will be a game compared to marmite but I love marmite and loved this! Must have in your library.
1199	HD means HD graphics but it could call Zombie Driver 2. It have a whole new champaign, with new missions, and wehicles. New wehicles like tank and dozer are fun. If you like Zombie Driver or Zombie games, you must try it.  _____________________________________________________  A HD helyett akÃ¡r Zombie Driver 2 is lehetne a cime, egy egÃ©szen Ãºj hadjÃ¡rat van benne Ãºj missziÃ³kkal Ã©s Ãºj jÃ¡rmÃ¼vekkel. Ilyen jÃ¡rmÃ¼ pl a tank Ã©s dÃ³zer amikkel igazÃ¡n nagy mÃ³ka apritani a zombikat. Ha szereted a zombie drivert vagy a zombis jÃ¡tÃ©kokat akkor ezt is ki kell prÃ³bÃ¡lnod!
1200	Buy it itÂ´s fun.
1201	Fun remake of Zombie Driver and more stuff and vehicles to play and more achievements great game :)!
1202	Are you looking for a casual game which can help you blow of some steam? You should buy this game. Do you like running over and shooting zombies with armored cars? You should buy this game. Is Zombie Driver Hd on sale? You should definitely buy this game.  This game offers hours of gameplay and satisfying content.
1203	Had a 90% off coupon, so I got the game for $1. Man....what an entertaining $1. I don't even like the whole zombie genre of games. But this somehow managed to keep my attention for 3-4 days till I beat it. The voice overs are hilariously bad, which adds a little humor to this simplistic drive-around-kill-everything game . The game itself is simple and pretty long if you take your time. Really kinda suprised I liked it....Try it
1204	Zombie Driver HD is a vehicle combat game that places you in a post-zombie apocalyptic city where itâs just you, the road and a bloody mess of zombie bodies. Outfit your car with machine guns, flame throwers and missile launchers and match the style of fun and gameplay with the likes of Twisted Metal and Death Race for the NES. Getting tired of killing zombies with a gun? How about using a car? It is as much fun as it sounds and a nice addition to a genre that doesnât get as much love as it once did.   http://iamericm.com/2014/03/zombie-driver-hd-indie-game-review/ 
1205	Great game, highly recommended!
1206	This is an awesome game i love it and hope you all buy it get it so awesome thanks so much makers of it wish i had the money to buy it right now but thanks to family share i can play it thank you so much
1207	Now in HD!!! A simple and fun zombie game. It offers cool upgrades for your vehicles so you might start with an ordinary run-of-the-mill taxi, but you will end with a zombie-splattering-engine-of-doom! Best part is, it's a low price and easy to run!
1208	run and kill zombies! simple and easy game +1
1209	this is the love child of Carmageddon and Grand Theft Auto

1211	Not bad game but the trading cards have horribly price.
1212	It's worth the price if it's on sale. I just came back to this game to review it and saw it's on sale for 2.50, so that's a good price. The full 10.00 is a bit high though. Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.
1213	buy this game cause its good.
1214	cars, zombies, weapons, driving, replay value. nuff said
1215	Didn't expect this game to be fun at all, turns out I was completely wrong. This game is a nice small type of indie where you can upgrade your ride as you smash and kill zombies while completing missions
1216	WE NEED MORE CARS AND MISSIONS ONLINE GAMEMODES MORE MISSIONS AND SIDE MISSIONS AND MORE PAINT JOBS AND MORE BOSSES AND ZOMBE CLASS MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
1217	Can't stop playing. Worth more than what I paid for.
1218	Cool enough to keep you busy when you need some blood
1219	Very good arcade game with oldschool feel that brings hours of fun. I especially liked destruction derby style races.
1220	It's cool and imersive. I recomend it, i just have a bit of troubble controlling the vehicles. Could be me or my hardware wish i could try a game pad on my PC. perhaps that would solve the controlling isue. Graphics are great and the game is challenging.

1221	This is an awesome game i love it and hope you all buy it get it so awesome thanks so much makers of it wish i had the money to buy it right now but thanks to family share i can play it thank you so much
1222	Two bucks well spent! Zombie Driver HD is a fun little game to kill some time.
1223	A lot of surprising fun. Extremely satisfying to destroy loads of zombies by running over them, shooting them, burning them, blowing them up or doing two or three of those things at the same time. Graphics are great for what it is and there is a bit of nostalgia too, the top down car driving reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 2, the first GTA game I played (lol, I was upset when GTA 3 went to a three dimensial look when it first came out and I was much younger. I thought it would 'ruin' the franchise because I loved GTA2 so much. But then I killed a hooker with a baseball bat and everything was OK, but I digress.)  I don't know if it has multiplayer and dont care as I am one of the 1% who lives in the boonies and can't play games online, but the single player is more than worth it, especially at the sale price of 2 bucks which I got it at. I'm not sure how long it is, im still working through it, but if its currently not on sale there are probably features you'll want to research to decide whether or not to spend 10 bucks on it (I think thats the non sale price).  Storyline is predictable but your not playing it for the story, your playing it to destroy zombies via motor vehicle. Have played it long enough to play the mission were you get to drive the tank and I must say it is extremely satisfying.  This is a good game, especially if you can get it for the sale price of 2.00 bucks or somewhere around there. Even if your not a fan of the zombie genre I would still recommend it. Who knows, maybe you will find you are a fan of the 'running over things and destroying them with fire as well' genre.  Simply: Good game, if you think you'd like it I can almost guarantee you would. I'd recommend more research if multiplayer is a must for you as I know it is for many gamers. Even if thats the case though, the single player is more than satisifying enough. I've used the word satisfying an awful lot in this review which I guess would speak to how much I enjoy the game and murdering zombies. GET THE GAME.
1224	this game would be awesome if the driving control was better, and not quite so slippery.
1225	This game was fun. I finished the story mod in 8 hours, so it could be longer. But there are other mods to try.  Missions are very similar, drive to escort someone or kill something. But the cool HD graphic and the satisfying feeling when you drive through the big horde is awesome!
1226	Suprisingly fun and addictive game, you can splash hordes of zombies untill you get your satisfaction. For 90c not bad not bad at all
1227	This is an awesome game i love it and hope you all buy it get it so awesome thanks so much makers of it wish i had the money to buy it right now but thanks to family share i can play it thank you so much

1229	Reminiscent of the original GTA. With zombies.  Also reminiscent of the old 1980s DOS game Autoduel, but in color. And with zombies.  Flamethrower ftw.
1230	this game kicks â¥â¥â¥ and rocks. if you dont have fun and enjoy this title something is wrong with you.
1231	Great game, highly recommended!
1232	Simply a must-have! Gameplay is addicting. Graphics are decent. Physics effects are GlOREious. Optimization is perfect. The amount of zombies on screen is incredible. Voice acting and grammar isn't the best, but who cares? Go blast some zombie Ã¤ss and have a great time.
1233	Good game. Extensive content, variety in gameplay objectives (though simple), and overall good execution of devlopment. Fair value, too, and honestly the only time I've ever wanted a game that Steam gave me a coupon for! I have two complaints, however: the controls take a bit to get used to, and those who aren't familiar with any sort of top down driving game may have trouble adapting to them, and second, the voice acting is just an abomination. I digress, as this game is very fun and can provide many hours of gameplay and many millions of SLAUGHTER FODDER! :D
1234	If you're in the mood for some mindless slaughter of zombies, then this game is totally for you! Though I would definitely recommend having a controller for it, makes the game much more enjoyable.
1235	You should buy this game, if you like zombies and cars. Soundtrack and DLCs aren't bad either.
1236	Very funny game ;)
1237	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later.

1238	Great Game Loads Of Fun !!!
1239	This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to. Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!  Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.  P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.
1240	Great indie title, with lots of fun splattering and shooting zombies.
1241	The camera is a bit dizzying at times and the controls take some getting used to, but the graphics are great and the arcade gameplay is bang on.   It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.
1242	A mindless zombie killing game. Best described as lizard brain porn (you don't need to conciously think about it, but it still is pleasing).
1243	You should buy this game, if you like zombies and cars. Soundtrack and DLCs aren't bad either.
1244	Not bad at all when bored.
1245	This game is simple to play, there are three different modes to try it works well with a controller and has plenty of achievments to get not mention trading cards, just a little repetitve but still a lot of fun.
1246	8/10 Good. The game is a perfect mix between racing and zombies, simple graphics but magnificent visuals, the missions are great, the zombie killing is intense and a lot of gore. I like this game and it is worth it.  Pros &amp; Cons: +awesome car upgrades. +big map to play in. +long missions. +sooo much blood and gore  -No free roam mode.. seriously, why?? -a few variety of weapons. 
1247	I like this game:) Recently i played on pc and the game i downloaded from windows store but the version is payable. So yee I love this game:)
1248	Good game! UPG racing ... alot of dead people there, survival mode and story mode.   Rate: 8.4
1249	If you like twinstick shooters you should like this, up there with renegade ops.  Worth grabbing with all DLC and its not expensive.
1250	A surprisingly fun game to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in
1251	I Picked this game up on sale.  Lots of fun and works nicely with my xbox controller! I enjoyed playing it when I'm board of all my more time demanding games.  I recommend this it for its price and entertainment level it well worth the buy! 
1252	Good game and beautiful game. You must try it! 10/10.
1253	Not bad game but the trading cards have horribly price.
1254	This game is fun to run over zombies and customise cars.  10/10
1255	Simple, but very well designed game. Lot of fun from driving and shooting to waves of zombies :). Another great feature - three completely different modes : story, 'survival' and races. I've completed previous version of the game and now i bought HD edition without any doubts.
1256	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old!

1257	It funny, When i kill zombies with machine gun.
1258	Pretty good
1259	good little game
1260	I buyed because I like zombie game, this is one of the best PC zombie games I have played.
1261	This game is fun, and I enjoying to play it from time to time. Beware that this game is CPU Bound, and to get decent framerates you will need a decent CPU.
1262	If you like running over zombies and blood and cars this is your game.
1263	This game is intense with the zombie killing. The driving in the game is a little frustrating they let you go fast as hell but no where near enough room to drive around in and you cant tell what you can drive through and what you cant.
1264	Simple, but very funny and gory zombie carmageddon :) Nice graphics, but the perspective makes you nuts after a while. When quit the game after about an hour of playing, the walls are melting... ;) Still, thumbs up for this little gem.
1265	This game is still good
1266	An OK Cool game.
1267	A really good game its simpale and most important fun in many ways there is few game mods and a leaderboard if you care about being number one , i bought the complete edition because it was on sale -90% and its worth it trust me
1268	such game. much fun. wow
1269	This game is awesome, a lot really! It's just... ZOMBIES! What else can I say tough... It keeps you in constant seek of achievements, 100 achievements to unlock and do all possible to get them. It's a bit annoying some of them and also throughout the story, but far from that, it entertains you for a lot of time. I recommend it to those that are patient and wants to complete everything! Good luck unlocking all achievements!
1270	such game. much fun. wow
1271	I love this game. It's simple, but very fun just running over the zombies with nitro/guns, and just making your combo bigger, and bigger! Totally get it, if you like to just hit zombies without a second thought. XD (^w^ )b
1272	Imagine Crimsonland, but while driving a car... running over and shooting and burning and exploding millions of zombies. Heaven.
1273	This game is briliant fun and that's the key word- FUN!  I didn't know much about it, but bought it during a Steam sale for Â£1-09 sterling, very cheap including all the DLC.  There is a campaign mode, a slaughter mode and a racing mode. So far, i've only played the campaign mode.  I use an XBOX One controller under Windows 10 without issue.  The gameplay is frantic, yet easy to deal with. Plenty of gore, pickups and great visuals. The overall presentation, including the music reminds me of an AAA release.  If you want an immediate, fun game for not much cash, then take a look at this game.  Thanks.    
1274	First thing: I got this for .99 cents so the bar for 'good bargain' is very low...  That said, Zombie Driver HD is a pretty nice game: I am not even halfway through the main campaing, but between slaughters and tournaments I can't say I didn't had quite some fun, let's say 3-4E tier fun ;-)  The basics are quite simple: you drive a car with weapon mounts, and go around wrecking havoc on all zombies with the misfortune of crossing your path.  There is a campaign, where the developer feels obliged to give us a justification for shooting and running over things until they are turned into a red pulp, there is a number of tournaments with multiple disciplines, like:  * Race, where you should theoretically drive fast, but instead you end up doing everything but that, otherwise the adversaries cheat and win all the time * Endurance, a race where you drive a car rigged to a bomb and where for balancing reasons killing zombies is more important than driving fast * Eliminator, where you actually have to kill your adversaries to win, so at least for once you get to do what you are supposed to  and then there is the 'slaughter mode', where you just run over zombies for as long as you can, for those who find the campaing and tournaments too sophisticated.  The game is not perfect: as I said, the competitors cheat all the time for balancing reasons (as in the plain races, where otherwise it would be too easy to win) or to make the game more fun (e.g. in eliminator they defy all laws of time and space, appearing first in front of you, then behind, ecc... just to offer you more targets) and the campaing is kind of meh, but it's a total win for 99c and a nice game for less than 4E, so if you get it on sale, it definitely is worth a shot.
1275	Value for the price I got! Don't get this game when its not on sale. A nice little game you can play through despite little qurks and plaws here and here. I got the whole game and all DLC for 1$ and thats really all this game is worth, don't pay more for it or you'll be wasting your money.  TL;DR Get this game on sale. Not worth normal price.
1276	Puzzles that actually make you think &amp; Fear that prevents you from thinking straight. Approval. \(I_I)/
1277	My recommendation: Buy it.  Pros and Cons:  + Great, creepy atmosphere + Interesting puzzles + Good story  - Small variety of enemies - Simple AI  To avoid any spoilers, I'll just say that the game starts right where the Penumbra: Overture ended. You still play as Philip, in his search for his father and the truth behind the mysterious events in the Greenland mine. While the game preserves most of the features from the first episode - like exploration, puzzle solving and stealth - the combat system has been completely removed. Personally, I think that the lack of ability to fight back makes the game a lot more tense, especially because of the very creepy enemy design. However, enemy variety is still quite poor, but for one there is a lot less of them than in the first episode, and I've never felt that enemies were there just for the sake of it.  The plot really develops in this episode, it's well written and interesting. There is a lot more interaction with characters, and some of them may even 'grow' on you (pun intended), and the whole setting is much more twisted than it was in its predecessor. Voice acting and dialogues are also much better, while sound assets, musical score and graphical capabilities remain pretty much on par with Overture. There is also a lot more variety in level design and in the overall environments. While it's not that important, it's worth mentioning that the AI is still fairly simple, and that it's not particularly difficult to lose pursuing enemies.  In general, it's a great sequel, especially in it's story. While it's scarier than Overture, it doesn't rely on jump scares, but on it's fantastic atmosphere. Definitely play it if you like horror games, but make sure to play Overture first for the complete experience.   Click here to read my Penumbra: Overture review    More reviews on my Tumblr page.

1278	Gives you more street cred than Penumbra : White Plague.
1279	I can totally recommend this game to all horror fans(that arent searching for action horror) and everyone that liked the predecessor. Thick atmosphere, creepy experience. Good and clever puzzles without being too hard, but more challenging than in Amnesia. You can tell some good thought went into the puzzle design. The unkillable enemies arent as annoying as I expected, you can handle them with a bit effort or run from then in most cases. Story is also intriguing, finally you can make something out of it, more clear than in the first part.  Furthermore, really appreciate the way the story is told: Reading notes, checking logs etc. Very fitting for a game like that.  Graphics arent too hot, especially for today standards, but you cant really say it aged bad. Enemy animations look a bit clunky, but overall the whole thing works for an atmospheric horror game like this.   Afaik there is no way for steam to get German language for all the text, which might be an issue for some people.
1280	DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PLAY IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PENUMBRA: OVERTURE FIRST pretty much anything i can tell you about this game would be a spoiler for the plot of the first game. that being said, it has improved on the first game in many ways; the puzzles are harder, the enemies are harder, the plot is more developed, and it is arguably more terrifying than the first. if you HAVE already played the first game, then there is no need for me to convince you to buy it, you will already be needing to play it after the massive cliff-hanger at the end of the first.
1281	found a scientist locked up in a room. he told me to find a saw. being a good piece of sh*t i went out to find one. found one and gave it back to him and he transformed into a zombie from the hood and chased me around only to die by being shoved into a big refrigerator  10/10
1282	I really recommend buying the whole bundle, as all three games are GREAT, with tricky puzzles and a mind blowing storyline on Black Plague
1283	1.Wait untill it's dark outside. 2.Turn off the lights. 3.Be alone. 4.Isolate from the world. 5.Take your headphones.  ...and have fun. 
1284	If you heard about or played Amnesia (and enjoyed it), you should definitely give this series a chance. Black Plague is the best from the Penumbra trilogy in my opinion.
1285	This is an Awesome game! Puzzling, creepy and mysterious! This brought me on the edge of my seat!
1286	Penumbra: Black Plague is a sequel to Penumbra: Overture, an adventure horror game with more realistic physics for more immersive interaction. It was released in 2008, year after original, and yep, still made by Frictional Games, but this time under different publishers. They say that under pressure from old publisher Frictional Games turned what was intented to be trilogy into duology, Black Plague concluding the series. It's unknown how much from planned two last episodes was fit into Black Plague, it could be possible that something important got cut. Thus some people belive the ending to be a slight cliffhanger and want Penumbra 3 to happen, while others just view it as a proper bad ending of sorts. I am leaning toward the latter.  You may notice that Steam store says 'Gold Edition'. It means that it includes Requiem, an expansion pack. Which you shouldn't think of as Penumbra 3, as it's just a set of puzzles that were cut from Black Plague without horror. Or big story. That, and maybe not cut, can't say for sure.  So, as far scary, it's a step up from Overture. Or step down. Now, instead of fighting it out with dogs, developers decided to remove weapons fully. Instead you will have the infected roam the corridors, who look like creepy zombies. And you will not be able to fight them directly, instead your only options is to hide and avoid them. Which is supposed to make it scarier. If forget that they aren't terribly efficient killers as you can just outrun them easily and not even bother with hiding sometimes. Oh well, always hiding would have been too annoying for me.  You aren't alone this time either, as the world feels more filled with other characters. Mostly human corpses that Overture lacked so much. But you will be accomplished by one sarcastic voice which isn't exactly enemy but not ally either. From one point it also brings in creepy hallucinations. Thankfully nothing that screams into your face. But then he and his sarcasm pop-up often enough that I can't help but to feel that at times game felt like a thriller with black humor rather than proper atmoshperic horror.  The story of the game on other hand is enough to make you play it not because of atmoshpere but to know what is going on and what happens next. It's not just about being alone and reading tons of notes. Things are happening right in front of you and plot twists around, as it finally get revelead and tells you slowly what is actually happening, while Overture was barely hinting at things. It was exciting. For horror-adventure. Sounds and music were good at what they were supposed to do as well. Mostly tension. Sometimes paranoia. And sometimes relaxing in a locked little room, deep in a unknown.  Puzzles felt more refined as well. Or at least they felt more fitting into main flow. Still got a bunch of standard puzzles and puzzles that make you use said physics. And throwing bricks to break stuff. And combining inventory items. Even if slightly less experimental than original.  Black Plague is a much tighter dark narrative, much less about wandering in the dark alone, but still with nice atmoshpere and horror. A worthy conclusion to duology. Or main meat of it. Depends on preference. By the way, if you find all 10 statues in the game then you will be given a password. You can use it to play a simple Space Invader-like game on one of the in-game computers. Or you can open game's folder and use it on super_secret archive to unlock bonus materials.
1287	loved every minute of this game! Definitely the scariest of the two penumbra games and this one is my favorite
1288	Truth is like sculpture - one perspective is never enough for true understanding.
1289	I need a butt plug to play Black Plague.
1290	This series astounded me! I never even heard of this game until I completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Both Overture and Black Plague are very good. I personally sided with Overture just a little more, simply because I liked the feel of the mines. Although I do have to hand it to Black Plague, the story was enhanced. This survival horror has so much to offer with the variety of thing's to find. Or if your a completionist (like my self) you can look every where in the vast mine and really delve deep in to the story. In my mind this game exceeds Amnesia because the deep thought and emotion Philip feels towards objects, scenery, and creatures is so realistic. It made me feel as if I were Philip, only more terrified. The puzzles were very well thought out, some very hard. Most games have their downfalls though. Such as Penumbra was more about the puzzles and story, rather than the horror. I admit, I jumped twice. Other than that it was not to scary. The ending was very suprising and I would reccomend it. I give it a 8 out of 10.
1291	Pretty good game. The only drawback are the graphics which are outdated, but the rest is pretty good for an indie game. Good puzzles, some good jump scare and a good story with some twists.  You can think of this game like the father of Amnesia and Outlast.
1292	Frictional made some terrible decisions involving the story, how it's told, and how the player interacts with the antagonists.  Edit: I didn't want to go into a lot of detail, but people are actually reading this review so I decided to elabroate a little. There are also very few bad reviews, so hopefully this will give people a more rounded impression of the game before they buy it. Also, I love Frictional and I can't wait for their next game. The first Penumbra and Soma are excellent titles.  One of the main characters is supposed to be this really omnious dude but they got someone who sounds like Bernie Sander's (US politican wish a hard Brooklyn accent) greasy brother to do the voice acting--it's completely immersion breaking. That character is also incredibly obnoxious, it's more like dealing with an annoying child instead of.. well, what it's supposed to be. That might have been the point, but I don't know how keeping a metaphorical fruit fly around the character's ear is supposed to contribute to suspense.  The story went out of control toward the end, think sorta like M. Night Shyamalan. Some people might like that; I think it's poor writing. It's almost on the same level of bad as The Village.  There's no combat in the game, which can be a positive, but all of the enemies are just really weak and slow, so it turns out to be more of an annoyance. They also put them in your face so much you just aren't afraid of them by the end. Of course as the game progresses more and more show up, so it's just.. more and more annoying dudes that you have to dodge and weave..  The game has boss fights. A story focused non combat game has boss fights. They're as terrible as you can imagine. There are also really gimmicky auto-kill areas in the game that don't entirely make sense. It feels really jarring to go from being chased around by actual entities then in other parts just outright dying if you don't get the puzzle right or if you're mediocre at platforming. That's not horror, especially with how dying is handled. It just turns into a quickload cycle until you get things right. While that might work in something like Silent HIll or Resident Evil, that's not good gameplay for a strictly story based horror game like Black Plague.  A lot of people really really like this game, and more power to them. The game has a really cool atmosphere and the environment is interesting and creative. Opinions are opinions, take what I have to say along with what everyone else is saying and come up with your own decision. A lot of the fluff/extra parts of the game are really good, but the core--the story and how it's told--is awful. That's why I don't recommend this game.  Edit: Added an actual review.
1293	You had to know how far I was willing to go.  You had to know how desperate I was.  You had to know how lonely I was.  You had to know how guilty I felt.  You had to know how  STUPID  I was.  And yet I still failed to do what I must now ask of YOU.  Alone-Simulator
1294	The second installment of the Penumbra series that picks up immediately after the end of Penumbra Overture. Right off the bat, the mere menu screen with it's dark, grimey visuals and it's deteriorated, darker music fills you with the dread of the horrors that await you, making you realize that everything is getting worse and more hopeless for our main protagonist. Not much has changed gameplay-wise, keeping the scares high as ever, except now, that terrible combat system in Overture has been completely removed. You will also find yourself meeting a new support character and an unexpected antagonist that evolves psychologically in the player's mind that not enough games have been able to pull off with their bad guys. To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed this game more than Amnesia and I hope anyone who has played Amnesia will feel like this one will stack up nicely to it.
1295	Kind of glitchy but it has some interesting lore and fun puzzles.
1296	Players having reveled in the oppressive atmosphere of Penumbra : Overture rejoice : The sequel remains invariably in the same spirit. Better yet, it even reflects a true rise, while the scenario is gaining depth and some of the mechanisms of the most questionable gameplay were happily balanced by the wayside. Black Plague, even horribly ugly, finally manages to create an atmosphere heavy and sticky, while carefully avoiding falling into the trap of overbidding. An unusual title worth the trip and makes us very happy to land at a relatively modest price. Under these conditions, why deprive yourself?
1297	My baby ended up without diapers because I used them all...
1298	Even though I personally prefer Overture to Black Plague, I have no doubts about recommending this game. Many people consider Black Plague to be the best in the series and it is clear to see why.  Overall Black Plague is a pretty satisfying continuation of the story. It has a longer runtime, more aggressive scare tactics, and better balance.  I am thrilled they did away with all combat and weapons, and the number of enemies was scaled back appropriately. The gameplay flowed much more naturally and felt slightly more polished compared to Overture.  A lot of game-time is spent searching/fetching/backtracking, but I never got lost and my progress was never really halted, so I wouldn't say the game is frustrating in that sense. Not always super fun to run back and forth through the same area repeatedly - there were times when it got old - but for the most part the story helps move everything along. If you can stay immersed, it is fine.  The setting isn't as compelling as the mining tunnels of Overture. Not many memorable environments, a lot of repetition due to the nature of the building. Considering this, I thought they did a great job with exploration and keeping things fresh.  I was missing the role of writings in this game. In Overture there was just enough cryptic information in the form of notes, newspapers, etc. It created a constant duality of discovery and horror. In Black Plague there were almost no interesting notes to find. Instead I felt like information was just being thrown at me from every direction and I was told too much too soon. There was almost no sense of mystery left.   Have to say I wasn't a fan of the many new characters/people/personalities introduced. There was a lot going on and I never felt isolated. Unfortunately it hurt the tension for me and I ran through the game mostly without fear. Despite that, there is a good amount of horror to this game in the form of some very effective and memorable sequences. Outstanding use of audio and light/dark.  I'm not one to get frightened, so I am stuck perpetually chasing the high of horror, looking for the fear and rarely finding it. I do love the thrill of this genre, having developed some kind of obsession with morbid material.  Some of Black Plague's scares got a physical reaction out of me (quick heart rate, adrenaline) and I'd notice my hair standing up or my spine tingling and realize the game had spooked me, even if I didn't know I was scared. It was worth it just for that.  A lot of decent scare tactics are used, along with some cheaper jump-scares, and it's a lot of fun. I enjoyed seeing what they came up with and when the game caught me off guard. It was kind of like a haunted house.  Complaints and nitpicking aside, I had a blast with both games. Penumbra delivered a satisfying experience with plenty of mystery and entertainment. It let me smile, curse, and gape in horror. Well done.
1299	WARNING: SPOILERS!!  How do I start? Penumbra Black Plague is an EXCELLENT game. Frictional Games have really defined themselves as experts in the horror genre. The first game, Overture, was good but it lacked the horror we experience in Black Plague. In Overature, you can fight your enemies with various tools you find throughout the environment. While this was a good idea in itself, the physics based movement/interaction coupled with combat made for an incredibly clunky control scheme. However, in Black Plague, you cannot fight your enemies. You can either run and hide, or die.  Most people know Frictional Games for their work on Amnesia: The Dark Descent. People believe that this title set the standard for horror games. But to really see what horror is like, you need to go back to Amnesia's roots, which all started with The Penumbra Series. Black Plague does more than just scare you. It makes you question reality. It makes you wonder what really is possible, and what is just the making of a nightmare.   You start as a Philip, a dangerously deranged man who has just been to hell and back during the first game in the series, Overture. You wake up in an a prison cell, your mind completly fragmented, with no recollection of how you got to where you are. You have to put the pieces back together through notes, puzzles, and exploration. As you make your way through the abandoned facility, you realize that your shattered memory is not the only thing you need to worry about. There is something much more terrifying thats lurkes the hallways. As you duck and dodge through a multidude of enemies, you must figure out the reason for the madness that is happening all around you.   As you uncoover more secrets and start getting your memory back, you realize that you can no longer simply escape. You discover a sinister plague, something that has taken control of not only everyone around you, but yourself as well. You must find a way to stop it from spreading to the outside world. You must destroy it! Stricken with insanity, voices insulting and deterring you with every step, as well as the many grotesque creatures that patrol each corridor all add up to a horror game that is a cut above all the others.   9/10 - A near perfect horror experience  You will thoroughly enjoy the horror that this title has to offer! (FOR BEST EXPERIENCE, PLAY ALONE, WITH YOUR LIGHTS OFF, AND WITH HEADPHONES.)
1300	While this game is not one of the most terrifying games that I've played, it made me jump out of my seat more then a few times, and the story is excellent although somewhat confusing.   7/10
1301	If you love to get chased by nakid white folk with their dangalangs flopping around, this is right up your alley...
1302	This is an atmospheric first person survival horror game at its best. Combat is there, but almost completely obsolete against your enemies. You are much better off using stealth and tactics. *Thinking*. Using the environment to your advantage. This is a real horror simulator where you are the victim, the target. You are not a survivor, you are not a well-armed super-soldier blasting his way through zombies, parasitic creatures, mutants, and the hordes of hell.   Before I go ranting about how to play this game and how it is so different from the common horror shooters that are actually *fun to play* and inevitably drive you away from a well-spent ten bucks on this game...  You're locked inside a building where nobody is your friend and all your enemies have bigger d*cks than you. In fact, they're so proud of their d*cks they're willing to display them, with a facial expression that says 'look at my big â¥â¥â¥â¥ while feeling so inferior, saddened in your depression that even the big f*cking worm prefers me to you. That if any girl were around, she would see that your â¥â¥â¥â¥ was so inferior to mine.'  Of course, you won't be looking at their face or facial expression, because you will be so distracted by the sheer, immesne size of their d*ck. Even when they try to kill you, you will not be able to help but look at the big, red, erect thing between their legs. You'll find yourself running away from them, maybe turning back to catch a few glances... and then finding yourself going back to get another good look.   You also run into these strange objects that Philip (Yes, your protagonist's name is Philip...) feels the need to masturbate with. He even goes out to say âEvery time, itâs harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.â at least *one* time in the game. I must say that it's quite an experience. I feel more of myself rushing out too... I don't want to pull out. I want to keep going. Now, back to talking about the game:  This is not FEAR. Instead of being r*ped (because steam doesn't like the R word) by an 8 year old girl and killing ghosts in slow-motion, you will feel utterly helpless as large, gray skinned men beat you to a bloody pulp and get their bloody pulp inside you. You won't care, because you'll still be distracted by their d*ck.  There's a story, somewhere, along with schizophrenia and some rather tense moments. However, it would be better without the schizophrenia and split personalities, which get really damned annoying at times and totally â¥â¥â¥â¥ the entire sense of terror and fear. Imagine getting off really hard and having your uncle walk right in and say 'Oh yeah, I used to do that all the time.' Not only does it kill the moment, but you want to stop and never do it again. Think of your dead great grandmother watching you masturbate and laughing at how you're doing it so 'wrong'. It really kills you.  Sorry, back to the game. Well, no, I've just about wrapped it up and concluded it. You'll have some 'half-life' type puzzles involving physics (Placing blocks on a lever is the extent...) and some resident evil style puzzles involving pushing boxes around. That's about it. You might find the combat system to be fun if you're really bored. You can throw boxes at enemies to try and kill them (Boxing Match). This will allow you to inspect their large d*cks more closely.  
1303	Surprisingly good, much better than the first part of Penumbra series.  Plot is more interesting, more lovecraftian. Puzzles are far less irritating. Controls are not that clumsy (or I got better in it).  Overall, recommended (I honestly did not see it coming). 
1304	Black Plague is everything like Overture! Only difference is the new storyline and puzzles to solve, all while evading the monsters. Also, the crude combat has been eliminated, making you feel helpless.  10/10  Requiem is also included within the Collectors Pack (with Black Plague), but it is more focused on puzzle solving, and has very minimal interaction with any type of mobs. Yet it was still enjoyable.
1305	After completing Frictional Games' Amnesia, which I very impressed with, I wanted more, then played Penumbra: Overture. Completed that as well, still wanting more Penumbra: Black Plague was next :p It is made after Overture, it has higher resolution than Overture and already has more elements we also see in Amnesia.  Also, no more fighting monsters, this time it's all puzzles. You can watch my first hour of gameplay here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnb7VXOmBtg  
1306	Fantastic horror game with good puzzles that are Portal-esque. It is made by the creators of the Amnesia games; if you're a fan of Amnesia, you'll definitely enjoy this.
1307	The 2001 (ish) cult favourite that introduced mouse movements into puzzle solving and gameplay mechanics, all inside a first person horror title!  Seriously if you ever wanted a cool little dramatic plot and narrative told to you whilst searching through an underground facility beneath the icy wastes of Greenland, this is whats it all about. Made by indie devs Frictional, this is THE first person survival horror to bring about the sub-genre (complete with the leagues of lets players and pewdiepies etc.)  If there was ever a time to revisit a gem from times past, make it Penumbra!
1308	Good story, respect this game! I've played these like 4-5 times through, including Overture and Black Plague.  :) I hope, that Frictional Games will create a new game like this. Atmosphere is so fricking awesome, musics. Enemies' sounds. Just great
1309	Bought on sale for a $1.99. Thankful for the low price because having to spend roughly a half and hour trying to get the game to run properly, without displaying the white screen (seen below), I have to say that it definitely was not worth the full price. Upon experimenting with the graphics glitch only seemed to make things worse until I finally uncovered a happy/medium for the graphics. Hopefully this continues to work properly. Due to this issue alone and my headaches, I've decided the game is a 8/10.     Graphics Glitch  [cloud-2.steamusercontent.com]     Graphics Settings     Advanced Graphics      Current Game Quality      Graphics Fix Guide  
1310	Main Penumbra game, about 7-8 hours of gameplay.  Wear a diaper.
1311	Like Amnesia, Penumbra Black Plague is the type of horror game where you experience pure fear in the presence of enemies, because unlike more traditional horror games like Doom or Slient Hill you don't have a shotgun or any means of defense other than running, hiding and hoping to god you're wearing clean underwear. Gameplay is heavily based on puzzle-solving and navigating dark corridors where you have no idea what's lurking around, no companions met face-to-face and real time inventory, meaning you can't just open your backpack and remain worry free from the attacking Tuurngait while trying to figure out if something you're carrying will kill it (fact: you can't kill them). My main gripe is with the subconcious alternate personality in your mind, Clarence, and how he ruins the atmosphere of the game with his grimy wise-guy voice. Running out of room: Penumbra is not nearly as scary as Amnesia, but it gets the job done well enough.
1312	Good horror game so far i haven't finished it yet but it seems cool. It's sure scary.
1313	For a low-budget game, it's pretty good. Story is somewhat interesting but flawed in a few ways, such as certain characters' roles. Environments are atmospheric, and often isolate the player. They're generally devoid of any true living beings, but you'll find that a strange presence controls the 'dead.' Though there are zombies, don't let that discourage you. They're not your typical stupid walking corpse, but more terrifying. For the price that it is, I would recommend purchasing it. Just because it's low-budget doesn't mean that it's bad.
1314	10 dollars for the whole pack..... Really, why haven't you bought it yet? Seriously? So, Overture is a truly well-done game, as the 2nd game Frictional Games, the makers of the Amnesia series and the upcoming Soma, started out with a Penumbra 2006 Tech Demo. (available for free on Frictional Game's site so try it out if you aren't sure about getting it) Then, because of it's rising popularity, they created Penumbra Overture. I really don't want to spoil anything, but it has one of the best atmospheres in gaming. Your father died. You have found a letter left by him, talking about a security deposit. You go to it, and find a note that tells of a faraway place. You go there, and you get caught in a snowstorm. So, you find a buried hatch, open it, and fall into a mine. You have to find a way out. One thing leads to another, and you are stuck in a mental hospital. That, is how they chose to start Penumbra Black Plague. And, I am only halfway through Black Plague. So, 10 DOLLARS FOR 3 FULL GAMES. and, why get Amnesia for 20 bucks when you can get the first 3 games for 10! Oh, and the games are really good.
1315	This game was amazing! It was a great horror game, and my personal favorite of the penumbra series. It had some jumpy moments and the first time you encounter an infected can be very heart racing, but not the scariest game ive ever played. Amnesia was a little more scary because you cant lose the 'monsters' as easily. But, i actually recommend this game (or series) over Amnesia because the enviornment is better/scarier. This game had amazing physics and the puzzles were extremely fun. Amnesia has a story but the objective of the game is not to beat it, but to immerse yourself in the enviornment. But penumbra has a story that is meant to be beaten, not to roam around and light candles, and its about immersing yourself in the chilling enviornment. I highly recommend this game it will be worth every penny. WARNING: DO NOT LOOK UP A WALKTHROUGH UNLESS ITS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY! THIS WILL RUIN THE GAME BECAUSE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIGURING IT OUT YOURSELF! enjoy   
1316	Second part had many interesting scenarios, zombie type creatures and a better understanding towards the game. The ending, however was not so happy but yeah overall I would give it a 8/10  Penumbra Requiem was a dlc to this part which had 8 puzzles to work with. Each puzzle had 2-3 keys which we had to find to open a secret door. Still fun!
1317	This game is absolutely amazing...The horror experience was very nice, but the story...the story was very fantastic and somewhat philosofical, I really recommend this game to everyone, it's a masterpiece oh-and be sure to play overture first because that's the first chapter of this series and I could say it is as good as this one 10/10
1318	Worth buying for 2.50 in the summer sale!
1319	Another brilliant game from Frictional. Or TWO games, rather!    One word of warning about Requiem, though: It's pure, 100% puzzle-solving. Well, okay, a couple of treacherous bits of jumping and timing here and there...but apart from environmental hazards, there's no way of dying (i.e. no 'enemies')...which makes it less of an action/horror game than the others, and yet oddly spooky and suspenseful in spite of all that. I still spent a good deal of the game half-expecting something nasty to jump out at me, but alas...! I would in any case heartily recommend this pack to anyone who enjoyed the first Penumbra and/or Amnesia, though would suggest that only those who enjoy the puzzle-solving antics in and of themselves proceed to Requiem.    (Oh, and don't attempt to play the latter if tired and grumpy, 'cause there's head-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing aplenty. Personally I waited 'til I was in a particularly 'intelligent' mood - which doesn't happen often, let me tell you - before committing myself to a session. Though I will be the first to confess, I'm pretty dismal at these puzzle-solving games!!! Stare me in the face all you like, chances are I STILL won't see you...)  Verdict: 8.5/10.
1320	This is the best game of Penumbra series. The puzzles are challenging enough, and the enemies are absolutely scary! I love it.
1321	in this game you play as world-renowned adventurer phillip mummy who is in greenland (i don't think it's a real place they probably made it up for this game) looking for his father who sent him a letter telling him not to go to greenland. i don't know what happens next because a dog attacked me in the dark so i turned off my computer
1322	You have Space Invaders. 10/10
1323	Although not scary to todays standards, as a kid I had a blast figuring out the puzzles and getting spooked! A good well rounded horror game with really cool puzzles.
1324	Quite good overall. The captivating nature and excellent production values of Penumbra: Overture are present in full in this sequel, and the story is brought to an interesting conclusion. I did find it less satisfying than Overture though, owing primarily to two flaws. First, the problem with the enemies has worsened, in that they are rather unchallenging and in fact I found it very difficult to take them seriously at all, certainly not as much as the plot tried to sell them. Second, there is a noticeable shift away from horror and more towards rather lacklustre sci-fi, and the darkness of the theme is broken by comedic elements owing to a certain, shall we say, character that accompanies the player throughout most of the game.
1325	It's like Half-Life and FEAR smashed together. An old game, but a classic! Glad I played it. For a few bucks it's worth the 5 hours it'll take.
1326	Very nice continuation of Penumbra overture I reccomend to play overture first and then black plague.
1327	The Penumbra series is one of the only horror series left in modern gaming - story driven, challenging, dark, and believe it or not, scary. People call Doom, F.E.A.R., Dead Space, and Resident Evil 4-5 horror games even though they're no more than just shooters. If you're looking for something more authentic and deep, then give Penumbra a try. Remember to play them at night.
1328	5.5ish hours long for me.  This is one of the most engaging and suspenseful games I've played, even though it has clearly dated graphics (eh, I'm a graphics person to some degree, sorry :P).  But no, this is like 10 times the game Amnesia is (no insult to Amnesia lovers), but hopefully Amnesia 2 will be more like Penumbra than the first Amnesia.  So what to say, what to say... Well, this is one of the games that came closest to scaring me; instead, it gave me awesome goosebumps at times, and actually made me feel like my character was going insane. Trying to find that one item that you need can be a pain at times, but wasn't too distracting.  The plot in this game is really quite good, though the end scene with Clarence was a bit disappointing. However, I can easily say this is one of my favorite games now, even if the main monsters are still humanoid (Pah, tentacled monsters &gt; humanoids, anyday!)  I'd give it a 9/10; definitely worth $5. Past $5 is your call.
1329	This game is much SCARIER than the original, new monsters and the return of the worm from the first game. Things gets crazier and crazier as you progress through. I enjoy it alot, really well done.
1330	One of the best games in the horror genre.  I also recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
1331	A refinement upon Overture's formula with combat removed.  This iteration is greatly expanded and fleshed out, and is completely horrifying and tense. This formula was eventually streamlined into Amnesia.  This game is brilliant and worth playing, and in some cases, I found it more scary than Amnesia. The puzzles are also much more varied and complex, so if you're a puzzle fiend, this is the horror survival puzzler for you.
1332	Freaky game would play it again
1333	Better gameplay due to removal of most combat parts, great story and atmosphere, with amazing ambiance. Along with 'Overture' it is a must play, tip avoid the 'Requiem' part, because it is simply puzzles without any horror or tension.
1334	A classic horror game that still scares me after watching lots of people play the whole way though. I totally didn't get stuck in the first room for an embarassing amount of time... Anyways it runs and looks great on old hardware. Story is top tier and filled with content, what more could you ask for!
1335	Not only have i finished this game more than 5 times, I just keep going back.  The game has an amazing puzzle story. Some parts so hard that I raged on. :P  If you have played this game, you must have heard of Amnesia. This game is really simular.  The atmosphere of this game is stunning. I always let my friends play this game, but then somehow I end up kicking them off of my PC because I get jelly and want to play.   Do I recomend this game? Definitly. This game is very well put together.  11/10. 
1336	Nice game
1337	Apart from Amnesia, this is one of the few horror games I can actually recommend.   The graphics are ok, but the sound is what makes the game extremely athmospheric. Controls are spot-on and easy, just like the inventory system. Also, the story is very good and overall, the game is a very enjoyable experience.   The only thing which kinda annoyed me is the fact that the enemy AI is dumb. And I'm not talking about 'sometimes dumb' but rather 'full Donald Trump dumb'. It makes the game way too easy if you've been spotted.  Anyhow, the game is still recommendable due to its story and gameplay. So go ahead and buy it! You won't regret it.
1338	Scary, Scary, Scary. Just like Penumbra Overture and Amnesia. Creepy atmosphere. it is definitely one of the best horror game under the year of 2010. so yeah.... it is kinda old.... and scary. the puzzles kinda hard at time but who cares anyway. i recommend it to you who like to play horror games and who had played Amnesia.  9/10 for me
1339	Amnesia without any amnesia. I liked this one better than the first, but found myself reaching for the gamefaw guide a bit more. I wouldn't say that it was harder so much as didn't give a clear indication of what to do in a handful of places.   Clarence is a wonderful d-bag
1340	Pneumbra Black Plague Gold Edition is a very good gaame if you like horror and puzzle games this is for you.....9/10
1341	I'm not even far into teh game, and I already : - â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants once - screamed like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants twice - collected enought batteries to power manhatten - â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants for the third time.  Do I recommend this game?  â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEAH
1342	Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition continues straight after where the first chapter left off, presenting even more story from withing the game's dark and lonesome mines. It's not a sequel, it's chapter two. So if you've played Overture, make sure you get this too!
1343	Penumbra: Black Plague is the little brother of the game 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent'. It is scarier than Penumbra: Overture, but not as scary as Amnesia, but still very scary. :) If you love Amnesia, you must love the Penumbra series, too. I do. :)
1344	Made by the same people who made Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I actually prefer this one. DAMN good game.
1345	One truly frightening adventure recommended for all fans of Amnesia: The dark descent.
1346	Why does everyone think you need naked ppl in a game for it to be scary? It is scary but i mean cmon
1347	This game is my favourite horror game after amnesia and silent hill 2, i played more on box version of this game but i decided to buy it on steam while it was on sale. Game has dark and obscure climate, story is easy to pick up but hard to understand depper meaning, simple interface and menu and ...  GOD DAMN MONSTERS AND VOICES IN YOURE HEAD...  Monsters - which are called tuurngaits, scare AF and noises they made are even worse, they speak human languege but with their voice, THEIR â¥â¥â¥â¥ING VOICE.  Voices in youre head - im gonna talk about one of them :) the one thats never shut up I dont want to say anything big about him but his playing big role in all this, his very intresting character and moment when you think he's 'gone'... omg its getting realy messed up  Ending - this is what confuses peaple the most, but after you read some notes about the place and what was their doing and why are there monster and and and...  Notes - plays very important role in this game, all story and questios  are in notes, but compared to Penumbra overture are a lot shorter.   I definitely recommend you to play ONLY if you have tough head to think clearly and not to go insane ... 
1348	After Playing Only 20 minutes of this game I can already tell this is going to be spoopy.
1349	creepy stuff man... creepy stuff
1350	Good game, better than the first one. Several interesting and scary moments.
1351	Black Plague was a good survival horror game that you might not want to play at 1 am while alone in the dark. The plot really advances the story of Penumbra Overture and is also emotionally captivating. I really enjoyed this one, if being scared for 11 hours can really count as an enjoyable experience.  I do not, however, recommend Requiem. The best I can liken it to is if George Romero made the zombie horror movies Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, but then made Day of the Dead a musical romance about vampires. Let me be perfectly clear, Requiem is not a survival horror, it is a puzzle game, and not even genuinely creepy. Half the time it isn't even clear what you're supposed to be doing with the puzzles, you just kind of see there is something you can do and then do it, and everything seems to work out. Without giving anything away, it felt like an afterthought and I don't think it added anything to the story. If anything, it was an anti-climactic buzzkill with a convoluted story that did nothing to advance the series.  Unless you like platform jumping and puzzles for the sake of puzzles that have (mostly) no discernable purpose, stop at the end of Black Plague and use your imagination and decide what you want to happen from there. Since Black Plague is 2/3 of this package I still recommend it, even if my review was very critical of Requiem.
1352	Great little horror series.
1353	This game is plenty entertaining, if a bit frustrating at times and tonally inconsistent thanks to the presence of an annoying 'sidekick' character for a good chunk of the game. The atmosphere, while normally good, is at its best when there are no enemies to worry about, since the persistent monster patrols quickly become tiresome. The puzzles are the real star here, and while there are a few stinkers that refer back to the 'logic' of early-90s point-and-clickers, they're normally quite tactile and satisfying to complete thanks to liberal use of the physics engine.    Black Plague , then, is nowhere near as impressive as either Amnesia game when taken as a whole. Still, its flawed story is perhaps the most ambitious that developer Frictional Games has created yet, and its (mostly) enjoyable while it lasts.

1355	A great game with a great story and atmosphere A+
1356	Frictional's first game series continues with 'Black Plague'. If you enjoyed the first Penumbra or haven't heard of it at all yet but liked the Amnesia games and similar, this is something you may want to check out.
1357	It's rather short, but rather sweet. It was an earlier 'Amneisa: The Dark Descent', and while it's not as good as Amnesia, it's still very scary. On the unfortunate side, some of the puzzles are unclear or difficult, so be prepared to look up a walkthrough.
1358	A Classic of the horror games.
1359	I love the penumbra series :D
1360	Last for 26 mins then exit game instantly.  10/10 the atmosphere is good as fock
1361	Penumbra: Black Plague is a very fun and story rich game. It acts as a sequel to Penumbra: Overture and it incorporates many elements of the original into the sequel, like dead versions of enemies from the original and the same overall setting; (Although it dissapointingly removed weapons).   This game is mostly driven by horror, however in some parts it uses unique puzzles, which in some cases get mixed with horror; which gave an interesting end result. This game (like it's predecessor) used enemies, though the enemies in Penumbra: Overture were far less scary than the enemies in this game, for many reasons. One of which is that the enemies in this game talk to themselves when they are near you.   In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game, but you should also play the first one first as it helps a bit with the story (A mistake I made).
1362	story-story continues where overture ended.youre in a cell,you dont know what happened and because you hear someone being slaughtered you escape,through the vent,then you notice that youre in some underground research lab,where something went wrong with infection and now its spread all over the place. you encounter your enemy right after you escape from cell and when you encounter him you either a) start vomit b)go blind or c)eat your eyes for breakfast-the only enemies in this game are some kind of naked zombies and you relly dont want to think about what will they do to you if they catch you  joking aside-theyre 10 times better then dog zombies from the last game.you cant kill them and theyre design is .........ehm........lets say original (even though you keep asking yourself why dont they have some clothes.i mean where they having a shower when they transformed or what?)  next thing that 10 times better is the setting(setting in overture was mine)-i liked underground lab,it feels more claustrophobic and they are well designed(in my opinion)and also atmosphere is great  gameplay-you solve puzzles,finding objects,finding notes-typical horror adventure stuff.game has great puzzles that makes you think and notes of events that happened are interesting  if i should pick some flaw-it would be the fact that there is something that can be described as comedy relieve.later there is some voice in your head that was probably one of those zombies and when he speaks it ruins atmosphere.  overall its pretty enjoyable game and i recommend it to those who love horror  8/10
1363	Everytime I see one of those things I feel blood rushing away from my fingers, quote me on that
1364	If Overture didn't freak you out enough, Black Plague will leave you with a sizable yellow stain in your pants and an urge to seek the nearest motherly figure and embrace her until the utter terror introduced by this game subsides. Unlike its predecessor, Black Plague gives you no weapons to defend yourself with and pits you against intelligent enemies and tricky puzzles. If you're looking for a spooky physics adventure rife with adrenaline rushes and bouts with fear itself, look no further.
1365	Not to many people know about this series of games... i was Pleasently surprized by the genuinely creepy and scary atmosphere... and more then once it got me to jump out of my chair.   Requires a sharp mind to play though... some of the puzzles are extremly challenging.  (Puzzle / Thriller title)
1366	This game is scary, both with jumpscares and being chased. It is a little bit of a puzzle game, too. If you can't get past a certain part, and you are sure the thing you need is in the room, TRUST ME, you're right. Most of the times I was playing this, and I was stuck on a part, it turned out the thing I needed was in the very room I was in. Except when I was looking for something later in the game called 'substance 65' and a hacksaw, and a gas mask. Anyway, the only monsters that chase you are   these weird alien-infected things that used to be humans, and the things that jumpscare you are some hallucinations.   One last thing, there is a game before this one called Penumbra: Overture. GET IT. I don't know if I got a collector's pack because I got a deal or because they are just selling it like that now, but either way, PLAY OVERTURE FIRST. Otherwise you'll have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA JUST WTF IS GOING ON. Overture is kinda boring, and much harder both playing and with riddles, AND requires MUCH more patience, but is worth it if you wanna play THIS game the right way. so 6.5/10 wud make a crazy guy cut off his hand agin
1367	 'God Is Dead' 'Clarence Will Live Forever' 
1368	This game for me was more scarier than Amnesia 10*10
1369	Great game, there is just a dumb rockworm scene where the first game's biggest creature is dumbed down to a lethargic boss battle and the lack of the Hunter monster that is built up all throughout the first two games is a huge dissapointment. Other than that it's a great game though.   Look out for Clarence ;)
1370	Good horror mood and atmosphere. Worth playing as an improved continuation of Penumbra Overture.
1371	i recomend this game if you have the balls to play it cuase this game is both hard and scary but it is also fun so ou know 
1372	Prepare to crap yourself.
1373	These game where recommened to me by Tork/Eric, I really enjoyed them, I prefer a little more killing, I didn't find them all that scary, but I like where this series is going, I hope they expand on these, I got the whole series for cheap so it was worth it, I think I got like 15 hours out of all 3 games that are a part of this series. I like the old-school feel it had to it, kind of reminded me of a game called 'the dig' maybe some have played it, or maybe a king quest where you have to find the right tool, although far more linear than a king quest. If you like horror and suspend you'll like this, not a game for little kids though, like I said I don't really find things all that scary, but it will get your heart racing in a few spots where you are trying to avoid enemies.
1374	Amazing storyline, makes you observe seemingly insignificant details, puzzles are amazing!
1375	More intense and dark, than previous game. 8.5\10 on personal horror scale
1376	I laughed, I cried, I â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants.  This game was great, and I couldn't recommend it more. Especially for people who have loved Frictional's Amnesia series.
1377	Great game with horror and just the right amount of puzzles and mystery!
1378	More intense and dark, than previous game. 8.5\10 on personal horror scale
1379	Really scary but you can throw rocks at a zombie, then it's not so scary.
1380	With the last game being good i had high expectations for this game, and it did not disapoint. I got so connected to the chararcters and game. There was never a time where i thought 'wow this is pretty boring.' I enjoyed the hell out of this game. The story makes you think and is pretty sad. You will feel the isolation in this game. This is by far one of my favorite series and i will definitely replay these games.
1381	I laughed, I cried, I â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants.  This game was great, and I couldn't recommend it more. Especially for people who have loved Frictional's Amnesia series.
1382	I laughed, I cried, I â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants.  This game was great, and I couldn't recommend it more. Especially for people who have loved Frictional's Amnesia series.
1383	 https://youtu.be/6uvhQ5H4Scg?list=PLzVDMpjrANuXZJP9kS-UMIyv0yQ5WWVOw  One of the best old school horror games out there but have to say since it is old I feel like they could have not made such a weird ending to this series. Overall the game had it's atmosphere and that is importent. I enjoyed the game up until the end, I had no idea what was even happening. Still I would say start Penumbra Overture first then Penumbra Black Plague. Puzzles were not as hard but still challenging. I felt most of the Overture puzzles were more hard to be honest. As when it comes to threats the character Phillip only encountered the tuurngait. You had way more in Penumbra Overture but still overall game was great and had a wonderful time! That is my entire playlist for Penumbra Overture and black plague.
1384	Solid, pioneering bit of horror FPS. The first game I'm aware of to use the FPS 'grab and interact' style of gameplay which later made Amnesia such a firm favourite (this being the predecessor). I just complated it today, and it really does sell atmosphere incredibly well. The graphics are really dated at this point, but it didn't stop the scares coming thick and fast. Lots of really clever twists, and a story that didn't disappoint me at the end. I absolutely recommend this to horror genre fans.
1385	 Penumbra: Black Plague  - the beginning of the end. After leaving the abandoned mines, Philip's journey continues as he finds himself imprisoned in the so-called 'The Shelter', being even more determined to find out his father's fate; the circumstances in which he finds himself also play an important role in his decision of pursuing the mysteries behind this desolate location and its downfall.   The pinnacle of this short horror survival series is found in this game where our character not only meets a couple of 'his friends' from the previous game but he also makes some new sentient bipedal 'friends' as he explores the depths of 'The Shelter' in search for answers.  Relevant psychological themes and horror survival combined with interesting and captivating puzzles make this game an exceptional journey with a meaningful and well-made storyline. An unique experience you have to try.
1386	3spooky5me, better and scarier than the first, and with better physics!
1387	9/10 this is scary af
1388	You have a sexy jacket and you hide from sexy monsters in a sexy nightmarish land full of sexy puzzles and jump scares.
1389	Felt a little short, but I think this one is an expansion. Pretty good game, scary, great for playing in a room with friends. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Amnesia. Note: The Penumbra series came BEFORE Amnesia, so don't expect 100% the same experience. They made progress with Amnesia over these games, but they're still enjoyable.
1390	If you like a real horror movie feeling and being helpless with no way to protect yourself then boy are you in for a treat
1391	I have crapped my pants no less than eight times so far.
1392	What happened to the White Plague?
1393	Just buy it.
1394	Again dont waste your money. Glitches are numerous requiring restart from last save. When moving objects they can disappear,
1395	The best horror game I've played! 10/10
1396	Well I sorta liked it, a bit clunky and rough around the edges though.
1397	I always liked dogs. Not that kind of dogs though. ;)
1398	Great game even if it's from 2009 ! Gives Amensia a run for it's money   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCY-GqjasWA 
1399	I really love this game. Its so great, the level of interaction is huge. My absolute favorite part was   programming the circuit boards with software to get the server running  . Its really worth the money, even if its short, theres lots of fun puzzles where you have to figure out things.  Also some puzzles does have some alternative solutions that I dont think the developer thinked of.  If I really must say something I disliked in this game, was the ending, where   you get caught by the enemy and the antidote you worked for is in vain and lost since you propably get infected again. However, the ending puzzles, for example the one where you had to sacrifice yourself and then become someone else, was quite fun.    I also like that you could select between disarming the bombs or pass by the bombs without tripping the laser, for example by the help of large barrels and boxes.
1400	good game if you like amnesia you will like this its really the same but take place in a more recent time
1401	10/10
1402	Mechanically, Black Plague improves on Overture by removing combat, making escape and evasion the only tactics when confronted with enemies. This doesn't mean they are any more difficult to deal with, however. They may look substantially more imposing than the first game's dogs, but they behave almost identically, making them very easy to exploit. The other elements of the game are simply more of the same, though that isn't a bad thing. Storywise, Black Plague leaves behind the mines of Overture and throws the player into decrepit laboratories with the added atmospheric touch of significantly more sinisterly splattered blood and ominous corpses. More characters are introduced early on, though while this improves the player engagement this time around, one of them is very talkative and voiced in a manner that is highly incongruous with the setting. Think 'The Darkness'. The tone is a horrible mismatch, and the atmosphere suffers as a result.
1403	This series doesn't look like much on the surface, but if given a fighting chance, it stands up to some of the best horror games on the market and holds its own. It presents a very story-rich experience while keeping the suspense level high enough that you're always at least a little worried about what is going to be behind the next door. Some of the puzzles can be frustrating, but this game is definitely worth your time.
1404	Real horror is a connection with the audience. It taps into our insecurities, plays on our weaknesses. Real horror is scary because, simply put, it feels real.  This game didn't feel that way.   Don't misunderstand; I enjoyed it. There's a lot to love about the title, the least of which is the well-integrated physics systems and the 'realistic' puzzles. Don't expect doors to start opening just because you found a note somewhere. Not that kind of game, which is a relief.   But for all that I felt it was more 'sci-fi romp' (romp... why do critics and reviewers always use that word?) than 'survival horror.' At no point during the game did I actually feel that my life was in danger. The conditions are right. The execution is close to right. So what's lacking here?  I think, in the end, the baddies just aren't imposing enough. They're slow, and forgiving to the point that if you run thirty feet away and turn a corner, they give up on you. That and they run simple patrols. Makes this feel more like a stealth mission than a life-threatening escape scenario.  But do play it, because (before the weird end sequence), the writing is just too phenomenal to miss out on. Seriously. It's weird too see a game where the writing outshines everything else for once. It's like they took someone working on a bestseller and said 'hey, forget the book. Come write journal entries for our game.' Pretty astounding, really.  3.8/5 for me.
1405	Very fun game. Works well with nearly any computer and has an atmosphere that makes you peek anxiously around every little nook and corner.
1406	The second installment of the Penumbra series, Black Plauge ticks all the boxes its predecessor failed to do. Its not without glitches but far less this time around. The save points are more common now and the enemies far less irritating when it comes to moving your character in search for the next clue. The puzzles are once again exceptional and the tone creepy and unsettling like its supposed to be. Would definitely recommend to any Penumbra or horror/mystery/puzzle fan in general.
1407	In my opinion, The Black Plague was even better than the original, Overture. My only problems, though, stemmed from the fact that numerous puzzles were just too hard and frustrating for me. Namely, the dreaded three or four final levels. I basically had to keep a pair of walkthroughs open in the Steam overlay so I could finally finish the game. People who are far smarter than me wouldn't have as much trouble as I did. Other than that, yes, it's a good game. The plot, the premise, the backstory... everything felt much deeper in here than in Overture. There also seemed to be more substance to the enemies here than in Overture, which were just angry, mangy dogs, annoying spiders and big, scary worms, whcih seemed to have little explanation or relevance to the story.   This might be a bit of a spoiler... I noticed that much of what happened here really reminded me of System Shock 2. Hybrids= The Infected. SHODAN/The Many=the thing that is responsible for this whole mess. The Von Braun= The Shelter/Mines. The list goes on.  Anyway, I liked Black Plague a bit more than Overture, though they were both pretty good.  One last note, be careful with the graphics settings, especially screen resolution. I had problems with double images on screen, especially with the player's glowstick. I suspect this stems from the issues with widescreen monitors.
1408	Best of the 3 Penumbra games. Basicly Amnesia with a few weapons and not as nervewrecking.
1409	Really improves upon the previous game: a lot happens story-wise, many things are explained, the traditional puzzles are better (but still easy), the physics-based puzzles are less tedious/annoying and the sneaking parts are not many (so the complete lack of weapons doesn't feel that heavy).  The comic relief provided by your troll antagonist is fine, and the 'inside your mind/slightly disturbing' sequences add a nice touch to the monotony of the mine.  8/10 I really wanted the biggest hug of my life, WHY CLARENCE, WHY!!!???
1410	Amnesia was disappointing to any Penumbra fan. Penumbra held a spectacular story, while having the pros of an amazing suspense, jump scare flick. The only downsides are 1. voice acting is royal crap, and 2. if you are playing on low res machines, expect some difficulties completing some of the tasks that involve specifics in the environment. Otherwise, enjoy art in a fine form.
1411	I have to admit as soon as i got to when the infected creature appears i got extremely scared and and am dreading to play. I want to finish and beat it but it such a scary game, if you like horror games you will absolutley love this. Be prepared to scream and jump.
1412	Puzzles with horror-like atmosphere, and there are some monsters but their AI is so bad you can just sprint and jump from left to right and they can't catch you. It's my favorite game simply because the puzzles are very hard sometimes, nothing is that obvious in this game.
1413	Way 2 spooky
1414	A good sequel, trading ability to swing weapons with ability to sprint. I guess that isn't much, but the story is worth continuing. I was fascinated by the ending, though it did not ultimately resonate with me. However, the presentation makes up for the coldness of the writing.
1415	Black Plague established the formula Amnesia would make famous, and ditches Overture's clunky and poorly executed combat system. The story is excellent and the puzzles are well designed.   Requiem is an expansion that has no monsters, no scares, just puzzles of varying quality and complexity. It's pretty 'meh' overall and the way they tied up those 'loose ends' left me more confused than satisfied.  Despite Reqiem's shortcomings, Black Plague is a must play.
1416	Even scarier than Overture was, this Penumbra title ups the insanity factor and features realistic sound positioning. No more wondering if it's comming from the otherside of the wall... because it really is!
1417	this game is tons of fun and it is so worth the 10 dollars well try to get it on sale like i did but yeah still really fun and like the perfect amount of scary
1418	it good game â¥â¥â¥â¥ brix, wasn't on toliet
1419	Good games, Black Plague is the second in the episodes, Requiem is the third in the series. Don't know why they just have them numbered instead.
1420	10/10 Made by the same people who made Amnesia: The Dark Descent.   This game is Amnesia, but better, longer, more puzzles, modernised (glowsticks, flashlight; shoddy one at that) and scary &gt;:)  Expect to die multiple times by spiders, dogs, naked men with umbilicle cords to their â¥â¥â¥â¥ and rolling stones.  You are a guy who is looking for his father who he never heard from since he was born, until his mother's death. You go to greenland to search for answers.  $5 for this amazing series is well worth the money. Go and get it :D
1421	Black Plague is a game of pure terror and immersion. It is by far, the best in the series. The amazing physics and challenging puzzles makes for a great adventure. At first, I was disappointed that you didn't get a weapon to defend yourself, but in the end, it only added to the amazing experience.
1422	ITS SCARY AS â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND JUST AS HARD! Until... you jump onto a box and the ai looks at you like dumb asses...
1423	Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ m80!  This game is awesome. It took everything that made  Penumbra:Overture  Great and improved the recipe.  PROS/CONS  +GAMEPLAY-Gameplay is similar if not the same as Overture only this time with a few tweaks. You can now rotate objects by pressing the C key while holding them. Also, you can now use computers to solve puzzles etc.The flashlight is more realistic with batteries going into your inventory instead of the magic energy pile in your flashlight. To use them you click on them via the inventory.  +COMBAT-The combat in Overture had the same functionality as a toaster running MS-DOS. Thankfully THEY REMOVED THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ COMBAT!  +GRAPHICS-They are the same yet they are very effective  +SOUND-The sound design is chilling and the enemies you encounter sound terrifying. Personally, i found the dogs from overture scarier than Black Plauge's Pingas Zombies.  +STORY-The story is deep with improved characters and unexpected twists. This time you (Redacted-One does not simply READ the story!)  -LENGTH-This game is short, although admitedly it is longer than overture and will send chills down yer spine  OVERALL-This game is great, its one of the best follow ups in an episodic series i hav sen.  PS-Eventually you will find a computer with a program on it called 'Shmup.exe' it is pasword protected. The password is...  xor451  Have Fun!
1424	Serious scares. Although not as scary as Amnesia, this game provides a very authentic horror experience. A good amount of puzzles where you actually have to use your noggin. If you do decide to purchase, make sure you have an awesome headset to amplify your experience. Just my suggestion. Great game none the less.
1425	It has milk cartons
1426	Out of all the scary things to come out of Sweden this has to be the most terrifying. Its rare games make me tense and anxious when it comes to picking up objects and walking round corners, the physics based puzzles can be clumsy but add to the overall immersion.
1427	If you enjoyed Amnesia, you're in for a treat! This game is my all time favourite, and i'm sure pretty much everyone who plays it will enjoy it. In other words; dislike the game and i will commit suicide and haunt you as a ghost for the rest of your life.
1428	If you are stopped up and can't go to the bathroom then this is the game for you! This game will clean you completely out in the first 20 minutes Also some of the best puzzles. In a way reminds me of the old Resident evil games where you will pick something up at the beggining of the game and won't use it till the end. And plus it has the same feel where you really don't want to walk down the really dark and creepy corridor with the whispering voices weird growling and bright eyes glowing back at you but deep down you know you have to and then you're like this is just a game what can go wrong... well this game will make you question your manhood. 10/10 amazing game!
1429	Holy crap... I've played this game for just under 2 hours now and I've probably crapped myself harder in this game than any other. This game is terrifying!! I didn't think it would be as good as Amnesia but it's just as brilliant.
1430	If you want to only buy 1 out of the 3 three Penumbra games, this one is it. The first one got me scared overtime with a nice build up, this one throws you into the heart of terror in a second. Only get the third one if you like puzzles...
1431	still my favourite horror game
1432	I don't know much about the story,so let's talk the game itself Atmosphere is great,puzzles are OK,the graphics,really,is not so bad,when you turn all FX on it seems even quite good(if you don't care the details) I don't think this game is so scary(or maybe I'm a Silent Hill fan first?:)),but the atmosphere is really great. I want to play Overture first but there are some bugs that makes me couldn't play it,it's so sad  9/10
1433	Penumbra Overture and Black Plague are both extremely appealing games for people who enjoy getting the â¥â¥â¥â¥ scared out of them on occasion and a good story to go with the â¥â¥â¥â¥ scaring and maybe picking up some boxes and throwing them for no reason. The first title is set in Greenland. You arrive in the cold and seek shelter in an abandoned mine shaft. Mistake number one. You would have been better off dying out in the snow. But that wouldn't be a very interesting game would it? I'm rambling here... The expansion for Black Plague, Requiem, was a disappointment. That is all I have to say about that other than to state that the amount of entertainment derived from the other 2 titles makes the bundle more than worth it. I screamed out loud on more than one occasion in fright. It's THAT good.
1434	A ton different from the first, More puzzles pretty chill game   10/10
1435	Another known Fictional Gaming creation (They made Amnesia), Though this was made and released before Amnesia was produced, this game is a must if you like horror survival games. There wasn't a point in this game that I wasn't â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself. (b^-^)b
1436	The 2nd game to ever get a scare out of me (Silent Hill 2 was the 1st). It still holds up!
1437	'You there'
1438	Was a bit scared going into this game, but turned out to be pretty boring when it came to some hexagon shaped monster chasing after me. The atmosphere was scarier than the things that try to kill you. 7/10
1439	My favorite Penumbra game, followed by the first. Cool game, a bit outdated.
1440	Preety cool. Not as scary as Overture and non challenging puzzles, but it's a good game. Great thing that they removed the weapons in this one! Makes it more challenging and probably makes the game longer because off all that hiding.
1441	One of the few games where I actually paused because I was so freaked out. 10/10
1442	One of the best horror games, its like amnesia the dark descent! i can recommend it!
1443	It was a good and scary game. I'll admit it was almost or just as good as Amnesia. However certain anti-virus software can keep the game from launching&lt; I recommend checking your software before purchasing the game. Other than that no complaints.
1444	pretty good game!
1445	Sequel to Ouverture, Black Plague get more depth to the story and answer a lot of questions. Clarence make the game really interesting and the end is pretty cool!
1446	buh.... again, I reeeeaaaaaally wanted this to be scary... alas, Outlast has spoiled me rotten. T_T Was it scary? Not overly... a couple things got me good, but the atmosphere was lacking. This was not nearly as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but it was scarier than Penumbra: Requiem.  Took me 8 hours to complete... and i'm not even sure I found all those little artifacts.  The story was somewhat interesting... up until the very VERY end... but i'll leave that out. #wtf? #really? I really liked the puzzles in this one. :) They stumped me a couple times too.  Controlling.. the usual mouse-keyboard arrangement.  Bugs and glitches? I don't really remember having to deal with any. So... nothing that stood out if there was any. :)  Motionsickness? yes..... oh god yes.... some parts of walking around made me feel ill.  Do I recommend it? I guess so. As long as you don't have high expectations for the fear factor. Play for the story and the puzzles... not so much the scares. :)
1447	After the disappointment that was Penumbra Overture, although I acknowledge it was an introduction to Black Plague, this game is indeed what Penumbra is all about. Having played Amnesia before, I believe this game feels fundamentally very similar, such as a parallel game (gameplay and mechanics are exactly the same) and at the same time very different (story, context and purpose).   In this game there is an immediate sense of danger, there is no way to avoid enemies other than outsmart them, thinking fast and finding a solution right when they suddenly appear before you (while scarying the crap out of you). Also, you are CONSTANTLY solving puzzles. There is no way you can progress without solving a puzzle in the current room, every section of the game is a maze and requires going to point A to get item X to go back and open door B. and while you are going back the monsters come in.   The story is where this game falls short. The motivation of this game is finding out what happened to the character's father, it is unknown if he is still alive. While you are at that, you get infected by an intelligent virus that talks to you (annoys you mostly) and can blurry your vision, confuse you, etc. That virus character is so annoying that made me really hate him and wish it was quickly over. Also, from Penumbra Overture I was expecting a different explanation to the existance of all those monsters, and it turned out to be a very different thing.  Still, for horror game fans, it is an interesting experience, not superior to Amnesia, but fun nonetheless.
1448	Takes what was built in Overture and improves on it! Somewhat short, if you don't get stuck on the puzzles, but better in every way. Pretty scary throughout and spectacular ending! I got stuck on one puzzle which caused some minor deviation from the story but it was never frustrating. EXCELLENT GAME!
1449	the creatures in this inspired ash vs evil dead creatures in the season finale
1450	Not as good as the first one, but still a great game, very easy to get addicted to
1451	  A long one coming through 
1452	I dunno why I bought this game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself several times. Would recommend.
1453	Great puzzles (I cite the radio puzzle as the best I've seen in a game) and a lonesome, oppressive atmosphere (the setting is ripe for a horror tale) make this game a must for horror fans. For those unfamiliar with the genre it might be a bit of a dive into the deep end due to the clunky combat and the resultant emphasis on hiding rather than fighting.  The physics engine adds a lot to the game, making it stick out a bit amongst its peers (especially for its time) as you can pick up items and place/throw them as you wish. This is primarily utilized for puzzles and creating obstacles to hide from enemies.  The story doesn't go too far in this entry, mostly setting the scene for the sequel. It's worth experiencing, as it leads to something a bit more profound than what we're used to seeing in most horror titles.
1454	monster has a bigger â¥â¥â¥â¥ than me   10/10
1455	This game is quite good. I was unsure of these titles because I found both Amnesia games incredibly boring. But this game was very interesting. Ive played almost all horror games and most arnt scarey at all but this one did a good job. The creature (or whatever it is) always appears when you dont expect it and when it does appear your here, 'oh crap im gonna die.' The creature itself has a scarey atmosphere to it, the graphics are nothing to right home about but thats part of the reason why its so scarey looking. All in all its a good game worth the money.
1456	I've seen bits of this game, but for some reason It doesnt work for me. All I get when I start the game is a white screen. I can hear everyhthing going on, and I can interact with stuff even though I can see nothing, but thats it. It's a good game I just cant play it sadly :(
1457	This game picks up where Penumbra: Overture left off. This game is not as scary as its successor, Amnesia, but it has a very fascinating and engaging story. It's an interesting stopping point between the skull-numbing gameplay of Overture and the hairbrained story of Amnesia. It's not perfect, but it certainly has enough going for it to be considered a hidden gem.  If you can look past the age of the game, get it for the scares and especially the story.
1458	  nc horror game rly liked it so much jumpscares
1459	An absolute masterpiece. This is like no other horror out there. I will never forget this game.   And despite that some claim it to be ugly, or outdated, I recommended all to give it a try, please... Do it for   Red  
1460	The game that is near to alike amnesia
1461	Amnesia was frighting, Penumbra was frighting both have jump scares GO FOR IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEAHHHH
1462	scary as hell, it's right there with amnesia
1463	Very scary at times, and extremely good graphics for its time. Not the BEST, but worth a try!
1464	black plague was some scary â¥â¥â¥â¥ but then i played requiem U WANT SCARY SEQUEL? TOO BAD HERE PUZZLE â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU
1465	It was pretty good my opinion was that it was creepier than the last one the puzzles were harder i actually had to look up a wakthrough my only complaint was that it was shorter than the last one so I give it a 8/10
1466	Bit much for 10 dollars, but (currently 4 hours in) a very interesting storyline and great horror bits to it. From the same creators of Amnesia, but I think its prior to Amnesia
1467	Another game from one of my favourite indie companies frictional games, the game itself is mostly about survival and beware you are not alone, for the puzzles you have to use a fair degree of intelligence to progress this means not looking online for a walkthrough, a problem i have is the game feels very short and the combat itself is a bit of a mess but then again these games aren't meant for combat so i can ignore that, i think that with a better soundtrack and a higher budget this game could reach the heights that it so rightly deserves but frictional have done a good job with the budget available and i will be looking forward to any new horror games this company produces i give this game a 76/100
1468	I finished the Penumbra series a few months ago, but I still find myself thinking about this game and how much it kept me frightened. I'm an avid horror game player, and this is a top competitor for my scariest game and definitely takes the cake for my favorite horror game.  The only problems I ran across were technical issues in the beginning. I did need to tweak graphic options a lot but I don't have a gaming pc, and it only needed about 10 minutes of attention to fix. Oh, and it's extremely puzzle based, and I found some of the puzzles can be obnoxious; so don't restrict yourself from using the internet as a source.
1469	'AHHHHHHHH! â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU!!!! AHHH !â¥â¥â¥â¥ *cries*' Hi that was me when i played this game. If you want a game that will scare the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you then play this one (and overture first :) ) 10/10 in my book
1470	I am going to say that after SOMA, I hope Frictional tries something new out besides first person horror. It really seems that all these games are exactly the same. If you played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, don't bother playing this, it did not bring anything more to the table. The storyline and gameplay are at odds with one another, the grandiose monologues are empty and unaffective. I never felt anything but emptiness, stress, and dissatifaction the whole way through this game, and not in an aesthetically intriguing way - I just wish I never played this game. Amnesia at least made you feel like you were in hell, this game just made you feel like it was trying to tell you something but you were not sure what it was and just felt annoyed at all of its annoying voiceover and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ NPCs.
1471	Great follow up to the 1st part (Overture). The puzzles you need to solve (again, like in the 1st part, they are evnvironmental for the most part) are substantially more challenging and there is essentially no combat in this one, rather, you need to truly make use of stealth this time around if you want to survive.   As for the umbilical gibbering manchildren things running around, I just about sh*t myself the first time I saw one (you'll know when the 1st sighting is about to occur as the character you are states that you need to hide, but I wasn't quite expecting what came walking through the door next).  The lab/research facility a majority of this entry takes place in is definitely spooktacular and the graphics and sound are stll in top form (well, maybe not the graphics but the sound for sure).  All in all this was a fun adventure and I can't wait to play the final part (Requiem).  LATER (3/17/14 @ 6:30 PM EST):  Well, I finally played + completed the final part (Requiem) and I have to say it was...interesting. It kinda, sorta gave me the impression that it didn't quite belong in the Penumbra series, like it was a standalone game based, in part, on the 1st two games (Overture and Black Plague), but it was still a good game.   The puzzles were even more complex this time around and entirely environmental in nature; so much so that it should have been called Penumbra: Requiem for a Puzzle Solver. Also, (this is a pseudo SPOILER if you read on and may throw some off from wanting to play the game at all knowing what Overture and Black Plague had to offer) there were no creatures at all save for a vague shadowy form under the water in the sewer area.  Overall, this was probably my least favorite of the 3 parts in this series, but it was still fun and if you find yourself to be a hardcore Penumbra fan after the 1st two parts, then you should definitely give this one a go too!
1472	Dem creeps man!! If you're looking for a good horror game HERE IT IS, it's made my the same comany who made Amnesia, (I liked that one as well) it's got all the heart stopping thrills (mostly getting scared my noises and random things that are not scary like boxes and pips e.e ) and the freaky monsters your looing for. The storry line is awesome and fun to play though, the graphics could be a little better but all in all.... GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE HORROR GAMES!!!
1473	I can't say enough good things about this game. It's true survival horror with lots of interesting puzzles. It almost reminds me of some of the earlier Resident Evil games but without the weapons.
1474	Of the Penumbra series, Black Plague was the most thrilling. It left you in suspense sometimes wondering what is actually happening. You spend a lot more time running for your life as well. As recommended for the first of the series (Overture) you will enjoy the game more if you play in the dark and playing the whole game through. you get the most out of the series by playing it this way.
1475	Excellent survival horror; perfect mix of creepy and challenging.
1476	the best out of all the penumbra games. IS THAT A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? OR AN UMBILICAL CORD ATTACHED TO HIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥
1477	I freaking love the Penumbra series, this game is a brilliant survival horror with an awesome story. Requiem is an odd expansion - no combat, but a good little puzzler.
1478	This game is the shiiiiit!!!!
1479	If you haven't played Amnesia: The Dark Decent, this is the prior. And it's scary as â¥â¥â¥â¥. A challenging puzzle platformer that acts as a pefect subsitute for a laxative. Running around with limited light, Barricading doors to protect yourself from horrific creatures that are very VERY creepy, hiding in actual fear and all the while trying to solve puzzles and escape. It's a challenging game but still very fun to play.
1480	You will poop yo pants.... In a good way
1481	Better dialogue, scares, and puzzles than the first game. Everyone needs to try this!
1482	Seriously amazing horror game! One of the best I have ever played. 
1483	I'm a huge horror fan but sadly nothing scares me. I've been to some of the best haunted houses in America and I just have fun, but am never actually scared... (perhaps because I know it's all fake-  Silent Hill 2 and 3 were the first games to instill a sense of doom in me. They remain to this day some of my favourite games. Penumbra: Black Plague, unlike its predecessor, is another game that actually made me feel horror. The creatures and atmosphere are amazing and there are moments that make you panic. I would recommend just getting this one as the first game in the series is boring and the only enemies are dogs and spider -.- and you have a WEAPON to kill them, where in Black Plague you have nothing, ever.  8/10 from me c:
1484	more intimidating than pregnant miss draffen
1485	Penumbra Black Plague was as I feel one the best horror games in it's genre, but avoid Requiem at all costs.
1486	Beautiful. This game made me love horror games.
1487	Great Game.
1488	So, there I was thinking myself a pretty hardcore horror-gamer. I played the original, and I must admit it was freaky in the start until one truly masters that pickaxe. So... the sequel comes out and I launch it, preparing to wreck some hell hounds (or whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ they are) and step in the footsteps of HP Lovecra...- Eh, the other guy. And then Frictional Games SMACK me in the face with a wet newspaper, point, laugh, and finally lock me in a dark cage in a dark cellar on a dark night... You WILL be sitting on needles, and you WILL be whimpering (if you don't outright shriek like a little girl being surprise-tickled) while forcing yourself to attempt to master the courage of crawling out of the room and towards the next. And if you pretend to be playing this game without shaking, then you are a liar. So what're you waiting for? Get it!
1489	Creepy game but keeps you coming back until you finish it, having no weapons makes it most scary. A good one if your a fan of being frightened and on the edge of your seat!
1490	Under-rated, and under appreciated. Good story, great atmosphere. If you like your horror a little more cerebral, you might give this fine game a try.
1491	This game is only for the few who had the courage to play, other went and cried to their mothers screaming. But for Chuck Norris well, he beat it in one sitting and never flinched ONCE.
1492	Great game and definitely scary. More games NEED to be like this! Being helpless and on the verge of survival is what every horror should be about especially with some grotesque creature chasing you.
1493	The best of 3 Penumbras with a good balance between scary and puzzle solving parts. A must play for every horror game lover.
1494	Fun and terrifying even though its an old game.  7/10
1495	If you liked Amnesia, you'll likely enjoy this one as well.
1496	It's funny how much Amnesia sucks compared to this!
1497	Black Plague is scarier and overall better than Overture, but it still fails to be scary after being 1h in game. Requiem isn't even trying - it's just a mix of story-related puzzles. Good puzzles.
1498	The Penumbra series is an impressive thing to behold. While Frictional Games' follow up title 'Amnesia' managed to improve on this in nearly every way, Penumbra is still a very effective combat-light survival horror game. You might find flaws in the interface, but you'll be sweating too hard most of the time to take much notice.
1499	GREAT GAME!! with scary maps and enimies also puzzels!
1500	Best played alone. In the dark.   The dark atmosphere is a breeding ground for fear, and the interactive environment makes you feel like you're really there (honestly, having to open doors by pushing them open with your mouse might be one of the creepist game mechanics ever). The real trick to making it through is keeping your head: it's hard to solve mind numbing puzzles in a panic, and if there's one thing Penumbra can do, it's put you in a panic.  But don't get me wrong. Running and hiding is usually a very, very good idea.  If you like this, I also recommend Frictional's two other games: Penumbra Overture (the prequel) and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
1501	A must play for any fan of Survival Horror, a very Lovecraftian story, with chilling gameplay, smart puzzles, and many intense moments. Part 2 is the best, but the whole series is great and I fully reccomend it.
1502	Pleasantly terrifying.
1503	Just like the last game, you explore the environment and solve various puzzles.  This time your enemies are humanoid and you cannot fight leading to stealth being your only strategy throughout the game.  Definitely worth playing.
1504	Very fun game. I suggest buying Overture and this, if you are in the mood for some horror survival. I don't know what else to tell you. It's a horror survival game. We all know how those are already, right? :P There's no defending yourself in this game, but you can in Overture. Of course, your pickaxe in Overture is so weak that I would feel more comfortable saying you're defenseless.
1505	Not too bad. Scary at parts and challenging puzzles
1506	Strong continuation to the first. Satisfying answers to lingering questions. More institutional than Overture, which is surprisingly nice for a change. Plays more mind games. Very scary.
1507	There is just the right amount of crowbar-wielding, bloodied-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ monster men in this game.
1508	Get this game if you can its amazing
1509	Still one of the best horror games I've played. Overture was good but Black Plague fixed some small annoyances and polished the experience even further.
1510	Its part of the Humble Indie Bundle, and had more atmosphere in the first 5 minutes than AAA titles have in their entirety.
1511	Definitely more scary than Overture as well as the same great story elements Overture had, although I do feel a burning loss from Overture. I felt very immersed in the game. Penumbra Requiem on the other hand I feel isn't the best of the three. It gets rid of some loose ends in the story quite well, but I found the gameplay to be the most boring and perhaps even depressing out of the three games.
1512	Definitely one of the scariest games I've ever played, but that's to be expected from Frictional Games (They made amnesia)  The game plays like an FPS but is filled with adventure elements. The feeling of vulnerability is what causes most of the scares in this game. While a monster slowly creeps around your area, you have to debate fight or flight very carefully due to the lack of any legitimate weapons at your disposal. This is an excellent way to drive the fear of the player to the ceiling. All this is going on while you are figuring out rather complex puzzles and slowly figuring out the mysterious story.  I highly recommend getting the collectors pack for all three Penumbra games and lots of scares!
1513	This is where the Penumbra series shines, in my opinion. I'm having trouble remembering much about it because my brain seems to have blocked it out. If you're the kind of person who can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of horror games (and why would you be considering this otherwise?) you're going to love it. I found Black Plague to be scarier than Amnesia, but then I never really had a chance to get scared properly by Amnesia because there were always other people around when I was new so by the time I got to play alone I knew exactly what would happen and when, so your mileage may vary. The Penumbra pack is only $20 so stop reading this, get your â¥â¥â¥ out there and buy the games.
1514	If you are looking for pushing your limits, testing your mental ability this game is The game for you, there are 3 parts. all exiting, challenging and of course lovely freaky. so this game series is worth every single part of your money. so take a trip in your mind with this game, play it in dark area, lock the door, windows, shut the lights and have headset on with high volume. it is epic :3
1515	Penumbra Black Plague is a first person survival horror game with puzzle elements by swedish developer Frictional games  The story takes place in a underground research facility in snowy greenland and you play Phillip a thirty-year old physicist who came to greenland after recieving a letter from his supposedly dead dad spooky so the story picks up right after Penumbra Overtures Cliffhanger ending and this time round you'll realie (sorry for mispelling) on stealth as weapons have been removed making the game more nail biting when you see a monster. The puzzles are fun to do, the story is great with the inclusion of Clarence Phillips infected alter ego. The horror was great but not the horror of games like Dead Space or Metro 2033  but the horror of seeing a enemy and thinking if that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sees me im â¥â¥â¥â¥ed  but its easy to get away from the enemys in the game i'll give this game a 8/10 If you enjoy stealth games horror games and puzzle games well christmas has come early 
1516	Probably the best horror game series ever made... If you are looking for an immersive game, with a good story, nice gameplay and so scary that will make you jump (or scare the living sh*it outta you), I recommend Penumbra.
1517	This is one of the scariest games I've played so far. Doesn't beat Amnesia though. But its very very close. Has a big big dark sense to it and maybe Dark Comedy aswell? At least in my eyes. If you enjoy scary games, this is for you.
1518	This game is amazing. It has the most terrifying, heartbreaking, and revelating twists of any game that I've played before. It is a worthy predecessor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That is the highest honor that I can give.
1519	i got stuck in the first room 10/10 sos
1520	A dark room, noise-cancelling headphones and Penumbra is a combination that will make you forget what a good-night's sleep is.
1521	Amnesia's Father. And boy o' boy does this game deliver on the scare factor. Must buy.
1522	Absolutely amazing, stunning horror game. If you played and enjoyed Amnesia, this is an absolute must have for you. It follows the same basic but effective gameplay structure and the storyline is surprisingly grabbing.
1523	Fantastic sequel to the first installment of Penumbra. Perfect horror adventure game with a fantastic storyline. Fantastic ambiance to the game that will keep you awake. While I feel the 'Scares' may not be as good as the first, its still a awesome title to play. Storyline is excellent and has me wanting to explore it more and more. I would recommend anyone who owns a PC to at least TRY playing through the Penumbra games; Including the folks who 'Are not affected' by the horror / creep factors of horror games, as it does provide a good story. Those of you who are just plain scared cowards, you are excluded.. Please proceed to games like Myst or Syberia.  Rate: 8/10
1524	Penumbra: Black Plague is a huge improvment over the original, it's tense, again, the puzzles are taxing, the lack of self-defence against the terrifying monsters really got my heart racing and emphasizes the horror in an opressive, uncomprehending enviroment. And the dark humour was unexpected.  Penumbra: Requiem is different in that there's no monsters and no purpose for stealth, instead this expansion pack focuses on puzzles and tying up loose ends. The puzzles are really testing, being heavily platform focused in a manner that almost reminds me of Portal
1525	The best penumbra game in my opinion. Setting, atmosphere, horror, adventure, story, almost everything in this game is perfect. yea, there are still those points where you might not know what to do, but all adventure games have that at some point, but this game, is in fact, really, really good.   I also recommend it if you have played amnesia, and no penumbra games.
1526	Interesting story-line. Playing arround with infected NPCs and objects makes Penumbra very fun.
1527	much good, very horror, many puzzle
1528	Amazing structure and story. Lots of depth.
1529	A really scary game, and the second installment in the Penumbra series. Awesome game, with great, and sometimes hard puzzle mechanics, and a captivating story.
1530	This is the most amazing horror game I've ever played. Such a great story to it and the series just blows my mind. The scary aspect of it is just perfect, no stupid jumpscares and just the right amount of screams. :D
1531	a brilliant puzzle/mystery/horror combination in this game... If you want something different, something off the beaten track, then this game is definetely worth a go. The game takes place after the events of Penumbra Overture, where you go deeper into the nightmare to find out what happened to your father in the deserted mine and labs.   I love how they make the game very interactive to the point where you feel like your opening the doors, drawers and cupboards yourself and then â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself in the process.   Graphics improved from the first game and the puzzles are better. Also the story is solid and keeps you wanting more.   Overall a fantastic game, i enjoyed it. Totally recommend it!  
1532	This is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. The horror aspect is absolutely astonishing, I don't get scared by games, but this game at pitch black midnight with the volume all the way up may just make you â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself. You'll meet dead scientists, a creatue who takes shelter in your brain and â¥â¥â¥â¥s with your senses for fun! You'll kill people on accident!  If you haven't played Penumbra Overture, don't worry, you really aren't missing out on too much- as far as story (You really should still play it) Warning though:If you get scared easily, this game is NOT for you. There are violent images, blood everywhere, and flat out disturbing â¥â¥â¥â¥, bro. Gameplay:8/10 Horror value:10/10 Sound:10/10 Probabilty of glitching out the game beyond repair (in certain areas): 6/10 (This is based on one level where you can accidently fall out of the map and break the game) Graphics:9/10 for its time Lasting appeal: You'll play it once-maybe twice after beating it. Full rating:9/10
1533	This has got to be one of the first horror game where you don't get any weapon.
1534	The perfect horror for the children. Would play to scare my neices and nephews. :3
1535	The atmosphere is amazing! I recommend playing this in a dark room with no light and headphones on high you can't harm monsters giving you a sense of helplesness (but hey, you can still throw objects at them!) the story is interesting and the characters are great aswell the puzzles are nice you will be hooked on this game till the end!  highly recommended to play the penumbra games in this order: 1 Overture 2 Black plague 3 Requiem
1536	Very fun and exilerating with some cool puzzles.
1537	This game is AMAZING. Honestly, this is one of the best horror games I've ever played. The story is great, the atmosphere is amazing, and the overall gameplay is great. I definitely reccomend this to all you horror game lovers!
1538	This series is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. But the pack before the sale is off. its like 4 bucks. or less. DO IT. If you like Horror stuff.
1539	I had never heard of this before playing it, and I love it. It's scary, and plays just like Amnesia. five stars.
1540	I would recommend Black Plague to anyone. The most claustrophobic game I have ever played.
1541	Black Plague is a decent horror/puzzle/stealth game. Compared to Penumbra Overture, Overture was better for a few reasons. Some of the scares from Black Plauge were recycled in the sense that how they scared you in the first game was what they also used in this game which lowers the suprise element, at least for me. Black Plauge also brings in a lot of story which is a good thing for a game, but I think they might have overdone it a bit, they tried to do too much at the end. Without spoiling the end, it became very reminiscent of another popular game, story wise. Lastly, the voice in the head was annoying and killed the mood for me.   the good news is as stand alone game not compared to the first, the game is pretty good. It' s hard not to compare to the first game though as the story runs over, and if didn't play the first one, you would be really confused story wise. Anyway, good maps, great atmosphere, freaky creatures, and decent puzzles.  6.5/10
1542	Very scary again
1543	The scariest game I've ever played. The atmosphere is amazing and the story is brilliant.  You have to buy Overture as well because they're really just one game split into two.
1544	Got killed by a pingas monster wielding a flashlight. 10/10
1545	Great game, amazing story, could've done better on the scares but overall great game like the other Penumbra games.
1546	The Predicesor of Amnesia TDD in a modern(ish year 2001) setting. Its Amnesia for the scifi lover
1547	It's been a while since I have played a good horror game. This made me â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself, so buy it.
1548	Cons: The story isn't too well thought out The monsters look weird Some puzzles are slightly unnintuitive  Pros: Literally everything else.
1549	Definetly My favorite of the penumbra games, near the ending it gets a bit weird but the rest of it I was on the edge of my chair.
1550	Pros:  - Great atmosphere - Interresting story - Spooky (At times. I would say it's a 2spooky out of a scale of spooky to 5spooky)  Neutral  - The game is very puzzle heavy, and this can either be a turn on or turn off. Read all your notes and use common sense however, and you'll complete most of them without problems (Though some of them are complete bulls**t). - The graphics aren't terrible, but they aren't exactly appealing either. Though 'appealing' was maybe not what they were going for graphically  Cons  - Extremely short, like, 3.5 hours short, and that was with me dicking around, not know what to do for the most part. If you know what you're doing you can complete this in like 1.5-2 hours, honestly. - For a game marketing itself as a horror game, there just isn't much horror here, and what horror is there is kinda sloppily executed. The main monster just looks kinda ridiculous, It's just a white guy with his d*ck attached to his r**tum. Plus, you can take a handful of hits before dying, and the AI is dumb as dogshit. The game is like 65% puzzles/exploration and 35% horror.  Overall: A weak 7/10
1551	a VERY successful horror/suspense puzzle game. I found that the story was entralling (even though I never finished the 1st game: Overture of the series) and the 'enemies' were often not a major part of gameplay, I enjoyed that it was more puzzle based then run/hide/jumpscare like so many recent games (outlast, Alien: Isolation, and even Amnesia) It really beconed back to the 'golden age' of adventure games, with most puzzles making logical sense and playing out in a physics based world (ala portal). Very reminiscent of Sanitarium in that you really got the 'horror' more from ambiance
1552	Old and dated graphics aside, the environment is extremely immersive, very well paced and very worthwhile challenge. Its a true series, each game picks up where the last game ends. We need more games like this.   Simply put, the Penumbra series is awesome. Play all 3 games, you wont be disappointed.
1553	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is good yo.
1554	A natural, good progression from Overture in terms of plot (and I really like the way the main menu music has changed to reflect how things have changed).  As in Overture, the writing feels sophisticated and the actual execution of the game feels quite OK most of the time (I am not really a large fan of puzzle games, but it worked for me as it was well-integrated with the progression of the storyline).  Some people apparently don't like the ending. While I am note completely sure whether there are some logical holes in it (there's a lot to consider and remember), it does otherwise actually makes perfect sense when you consider one important and central detail of the larger plot. I quite liked the ending, actually.  If the Penumbra games are on sale, they should definitely be bought - IMO.
1555	Creepier and more intriguing than Overture with a great ending. 3/5 mankinds.
1556	This is definitely the scariest game franchise there is, and this is coming from a guy who has been a fan of horror/scary games for a long time, i have played almost every horror game and franchise there is (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Clive Barker's, Fatal Frame, Condemned, Siren, Clock Tower, Alone in the Dark. System Shock, The Grudge, Cold Fear, etc...) and no franchise or game comes close to Penumbra, scariest one i have ever played for sure, the only game that could surprass it is Amnesia.  Black Plague is the scariest one  Requiem is the less scary one
1557	I played this game off steam before so don't mind the 30 minute playtime. I invested quite a lot of playing hours into these games and I have never come across another series that did it quite like Penumbra. Satisfying story, excellent visuals, extremely well done suspensful moments coupled with probably the best interaction to the environment I've had ever. You really feel immersed in this world and invested in the task to uncover the story. I love these games.
1558	Play this game, mankind.
1559	The Black Plague is a significantly shorter game (no more than five hours, generally) than it's predecessor, Overture.  However, it's brevity is compensated by substantially more story and answers to players' burning questions on what the hell is happening in game.  Penumbra: Black Plague still suffers from a lack of variety in monsters and challenges, though the enemy is far scarier than the models used for Overture. The Penumbra series in general is quite lacking in versatility and diversity of puzzles and challenges, but nevertheless makes for a very interesting adventure.  I would recommend playing the first game to get the full story, but to be completely honest, Overture does not provide much at all to the story of the overall series, and Black Plague could be played alone with the majority of the themativ understanding still intact.  Bottom line: The series in general has a brilliant story, but being an older game, suffers from repetitive puzzles and challenges. Overture lacked these excellent story elements, and Black Plague, while scarier and more immersive, was shorter and yet more repetitive. Together, the experience is fascinating albeit simple.
1560	This game... jesus christ... this game scared the living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me. If you like horror games... this is a horror game; its etremelly scary but fun and challenging. I personally love it, but i can not play it at night or with the recommended settings (Headphones, Lights off, Low screen lighting).
1561	The developers cut the disappointing parts of Overture (combat and weak/confusing story) and added an impressive amount of depth and plot on top of the existing foundation.  This game is an exciting narrative with mostly interesting physical puzzles sprinkled throughout. A couple of the puzzles felt tedious to me, particularly towards the end. I didn't find the story to be particularly profound, though.   Even more dissapointingly, I had hoped more than anything that the game would build on the immersive, horrific atmosphere of the first episode, and genuinely creep me out even more, in the same way that SOMA did. I found that the game fell well short of this. Maybe it was Penumbra saturation, but this episode hardly felt like a horror game at all. For 2008 tech, the world and graphics are spectacular and hold up well, but it felt like a video game and not the horrifying universe I wanted to wade into for a few hours.  Fricitional -- as ever -- gets my strongest recommendation for a fun, thoughtful game that emphasizes story, atmosphere, and puzzles above shooting guns for 5 hours.
1562	Black Plague, sequel to Overture, is yet again an astoundingly good game. Several of the wonky game-mechanics of it's predecessor, chiefly unweildy melee combat, have been scrubbed.  The story, progressing ever onward, is well written from beginning to end. For a game like this, with low production values and a small dev. team, to weave such an interesting story is quite the accomplishment. It even has an ending which noticeably stirs the subtle messages earlier in the game.  A genuinely eerie game, though incredibly satisfying to progress in, figure out, and ultimately beat, Black Plague is a great game, through and through, and should definitely be tried out at the very least.  Unless you don't have what it takes? Can you play Penumbra end to end without fiddling with your gamma? Muting your sound? Reading through walk-throughs? I highly suggest avoiding the aforementioned. To do so would be to defeat the purpose of the game, and really take from the enjoyment of it all.
1563	I love the Penumbra series, I think that in terms of 'scare factor', it's one of the best games from the trilogy.   But  In saying this, the game lacks a decent storyline. Although it isn't bad, it isn't nearly as immersive as Penumbra: Overture's storyline and in fact, sometimes Black Plague's storyline can get a bit dull. So why am I recommending this game? Because I still think that despite what I've said, you will still get quite a lot of fun out of this game if you pay attention to the 'finer' details.  If you want to pretend that you're a badass by saying 'this game isn't that scary', trying playing it with the lights out. Livestream it, I'll be sure to watch -_-
1564	like a bag of chips, not lasting for long but good and enjoyable. Larens/10
1565	I've played only a tiny bit of this game at the time of writing but I have never played something so consistently scary...Forget Hiding behind your Assault Rifle and Body Armour, you have no other weapon except your wits to protect you from the darkness...Creeping through Dark, abandonned offices, surrounded by noises...You're alone...Wait! Was that sound in your head? Who's there? Friend or Foe?  This game is truly one of the few games that uses both Sight and Sound to maximum effect...Without any weapons or means of deffending yourself, you must switch off the lights and Hide in the very shadows that hunt you...Only will your ears tell you if it's safe...But then again...In a place where strange noises are in abundance, nothing can be rellied upon. Caution Advised.  Play it in the dark all alone on until dark for a truly scary experience...  One of the greatest games in its genre...Too bad about Clarence...
1566	Super scary, lot's of thinking, some stealth, auto-save and check points everywhere &lt;3. Also smooth, no grpahics or start up problems.
1567	Great if you loved Amnesia:TDD but wanted a more active, involved story and dynamic dialogue and interaction with the environment. Has an in-depth 'checking' mechanic that lets you look at stuff, and dialogue throughout the game with a 'charming' 'companion' that 'helps' you out. Practice your sneaking skills, this is some Metal Gear Solid levels of dodging through corridors, avoiding enemies. Enemies that do NOT disappear after losing track of you. Weird ending, but intriguing and cool nonetheless.  short: Fun, similar to Amnesia (same developers), challenging sneaking portions, actively involved story and dialogue. Screw Requiem, at least it's free.
1568	Cold and Spooky little dog. Dece game (5/10)
1569	A truely unrated gem of a game and one of my all time favourite horror games. It takes everything that was great about Overture, improved it, and removed everything that I hated about it. The puzzles are even better and the atmosphere is even creepier.  10/10
1570	Best horror game I've ever played. I mean, Amnesia: the Dark Descent was good and all, but it doesn't focus and the atmosphere itself, it IS really scary but that the point, it's just monsters. But this game, however, is good at both of them. There are plenty of puzzles and monster encounters, and the level desing is outstanding. I'm sorry for all of you Amnesia fans, but this game is my number one.
1571	very scary game love it! &lt;3
1572	Fantastic, really weird, thoroughly enjoyable!
1573	What can I say? Your pants will never be clean again.
1574	I was so scared I was screaming at the game and began talking back to voices in main characters head. This is what insanity feels like.
1575	'10/10 would quit the game again' damn spoops
1576	Very scary, one of the best horror games out on steam. But before you buy, there are a lot of puzzles to solve in this game. These puzzles are very tricky, so if you don't like puzzles then at least watch gameplay before you buy. This is my favorite horror game on steam so far. I like it a little bit more than Amnesia.
1577	An awesome sequel for an awesome game. Controls are better and interacting with the enivironment is smoothier. The story gets more interesting and the events are really messing with your mind. Atmosphere and enemies gave me heart attacks and made me s**t bricks. Though, Requiem is quite boring since it's a puzzle game and not horror. But Black Plague just rocks.
1578	I can't decide which is scarier... This game, or Amnesia..
1579	Despite the name, this game has nothing to do with an epidemic ravaging the continent of Africa.
1580	An awesome story with an interesting horror experience, a original idea and good puzzles.  10/10 in my opinion And you dont need GTA V graphics to make a good game either..... Also good controls, im familliar from Amnesia The Dark Descent
1581	Such an amazing game &lt;3
1582	A surprisingly great game for the price I got it for, which was around 2 dollars on sale. It requires actual thinking and brainpower to get through certain areas of the game which is a trait most modern games lack. I personally think it has aged well and while the graphics wouldn't be considered the best of the best, they hold up well and will by no means affect the quality of gameplay, which is great. Strongly recommend, both as a good deal and as a surprisingly intriguing game in and of itself. You also get two expansions or whatever which I haven't tried yet, which just makes this deal that much better.  Edit: After playing both Black Plague and Overture, I realized Overture is actually the first game in the series so I suggest playing that one first.
1583	Run around holding a glowstick while alien-zombies with long curly dongs try to eat your brains while a schizophrenic crack-junkie inside your head keeps you company. Simply a masterpiece
1584	This game have nice ambiance.But this ambiance may drown you if you are not veteran horror gamer.If you will play with the details and if you are a person who like to play horror games you must play this game.Did you like Amnesia? I should tell you this game ancestor game of the amnesia dark descent.
1585	D: The monsters are scary.
1586	The brother to Amnesia, yet just as good. The Penumbra games have a more compelling and neat story than Amnesia IMO. These games are cheap, just get them.
1587	Great game if you like running and hiding and being stranded in a base with freaky â¥â¥â¥â¥ in it..the freaky â¥â¥â¥â¥ also is trying to kill you and all you can do is hide great story and plenty of puzzles some even have the things trying to kill you with them..isn't that nice of them.
1588	Since I'm in a reviewing mood I thought I'd write a review about this game.   Honestly, I really wish there was a 'Meh' button for reviews instead of giving it a Positive or Negative because that's exactly what this game is, however I'm leaning towards Yes so I'll give a positive review.  Penumbra Overture is the first in the series, the game after this is Penumbra : Black Plague and you have an additional game which is Penumbra : Requiem which is just a puzzle-solving one. These games are surrounded in horror, puzzles and story telling.    Length/Replay Value   First thing that pops in to my mind when I'm purchasing a game is the actual length of the game and how much replay value it has. I purchased this game at the end of 2014 and didn't really touch it up until this day where I managed to finish it in pretty much one sitting. This game on average will take around 5-6 hours to complete... yes I said it... 5-6 HOURS! To me, I think that a horror game such as this deserves much more time to it. Is this game one I can go back and play? Not really. Maybe in a few years since I finished Penumbra : Black Plague a few years ago and now I've got the urge to play it again but other then that there isn't really anything to do in the game. No collectibles or anything like that. Just a game which requires you to avoid dogs, solve puzzles and be trapped in some creepy atmospheric mine. The replay value just isn't there.    Graphical   The game was released in 2007 and still looks pretty damn good considering it was released almost TEN years ago! Of course, it won't be as good as modern day games but for it's time I would have said that this game was great and it still is!    Gameplay   The game itself is actually very immersive, the music is creepy which really adds to the scary atmosphere and you are stuck underground in mines/caves with flesh eating dogs after you, massive worms and caves full of spiders, solving puzzles and trying to survive. Sounds cool right? Weeelllll... the game does start off great, the first time you enter the mine and hear the sound of a dog really does shake you up! But as the game progresses you realise that there is a lot of repetition that is used. You see, throughout this game there are sections where the level layout is very identical... similar looking corridors and mines which branch off different ways to different rooms which require you to go to in order to get specific items to progress and using them specific items to open a 'locked door' in one of the corridors. It gets boring after a while and what makes it even more boring is that the monsters that roam the corridors/mines are just dogs. In the caves there are spiders and there is a part with a worm but we're talking corridor/mine sequences... pure dogs. Unlike Black Plague where that had the Tuurngait [ http://penumbra.wikia.com/wiki/Tuurngait_Infected ], this one had dogs that you had to constantly avoid and could easily be avoided by throwing beef jerky around and locking them in cages. The Tuurngait actually carried flashlights in some stages and could see you in the dark, the dogs couldn't do that. I went through the game without getting spotted by a dog once because all I did was wait corners and wait for them to pass. That's another thing that annoyed me, Dogs are supposed to have really good noses and be able to smell stuff better than a human can yet they couldn't smell a sweaty guy trapped in a mine who was sneaking behind them or right around a corner, staring them in the face?    SCARE Factor   Now this is a hard one, I don't know if it's because I'm getting older but games don't seem to scare me as much anymore unless it's a jumpscare but we all know they're no good in a horror game master-piece. Amnesia seemed to get it right. Back on point, this game had no jumpscares but was actually quite creepy when I played it briefly in 2014. If hiding from dogs, running from spiders and worms is your cup of tea then good! The atmosphere was kinda creepy? Personally though, this game didn't really have me scared or on the edge of my seat, If I was to rate it out of 10 on scare factor I would give it a 3.5/10     OVERALL   The game itself is quite an interesting game to sit down and play if you're in to puzzle solving and a slight bit of horror at the same time. It isn't that long and isn't on the edge of your seat scary so if you're someone with a weak heart and who hates scary games then this may be for you! Would I say it's worth it's price? Yeah. However, Black Plague was scarier in my opinion. :)
1589	Penumbra: Overture is the first in a series of horror games released in early 2007. While the developers like to class this as a first person adventure game, I would also say there is quite a lot of elements of survival horror and psychological horror.   The game uses a game engine called Newton Game Dynamics which is known for it's physical and realistic simulations. The adventure portion of the game focused a lot on physics based puzzles as well as a physics based combat system (i'll get more into that later). You can also play a lot of this game as stealthy as possible. The AI in Overture is well coded and respond realistically to noises and light. There are also no guns or fire arms so your combat mechanics are based around manual weapons such as hammers and pick axes.   The combat system is the one aspect that I disliked to begin with; it is very hard to control as you actually have to swipe your mouse in the movement you would like to hit the enemy. It can sometimes get very confusing and you may end up turning your camera 180Â° without wanting to, then getting smacked in the back of the head, which at times can be the difference between life and death. I found I was able to get to grips with the technique eventually, it just took a lot of actual conscious thinking when I needed to use it. It's certainly not a mechanic I would like to see implemented in other games, at least not in this form.   Your main focus when playing is on exploration and classic adventure game object and item interactions. Most of the puzzles require searching for keys or other objects which can be placed in another object, such as batteries or motors. All of the puzzles resolution can all be found in the game; there are no wacky puzzles that are really impossible to work out. Clues can be found in books and letters, which again are found all over the game. The game is split into four chapters, each of these chapters has one 'big' puzzle which may stump you for a while, they normally involve some sort of maneuvering of some kind, for instance my favorite is a steam pump floor and you have to memorize the pattern in which steam is pumped out of the floor, that puzzle alone takes a ton of thinking and memory skills to progress.   Graphically, Overture looks like a 2007 game, this is not a bad thing - it's just very dated. At the time this would of been a very good looking game. There are however fan made texture mods which make the game look amazing, and if you are confident in installing these type of mods, I would highly recommend giving it a try.   As with most horror games, the music and audio plays a massive role in Penumbra. Like I said at the start, this game has a lot of physiological horror elements. At times there isn't actually anything physically to be scared of, however the music tempo changes and suddenly you start hearing thumping sounds, then all of a sudden you are on the edge of your seat wanting to throw your headset on the floor. Penumbra does the audio side of things brilliantly; in fact if you we to play the game without sound on at all, it wouldn't even be remotely scary.   The story mode of Penumbra took me about four hours to complete, which is a solid amount of time for a adventure game like this and I was ultimately happy with the conclusion. Luckily you don't have to pay for each of the games in the series individually, so the price for all three is very well compromised with the length of the game.   I didn't have any technical issues with the game either, the game runs at a silky smooth 60 fps, and can be played at full higher resolutions which is always nice to see from older games.   If you are a fan of the horror and/or the adventure genre of games, you will certainly find alot of enjoyment in Penumbra. This is certainly a series that I am looking forward to playing the next installments of in the future.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

1590	Would you like to know what was before Amnesia? If yes, Penumbra is for you as you have a chance to see the first survival horror game of Frictional Games.  Although not as terrifying, Penumbra Overture is still a relatively scary and interesting game where you pick up the story of Philip who has just arrived to Greenland to find his father based on the mysterious letter he'd received from him. To make it even more interesting: Philip had always thought his father had been dead.  The game puts emphasis on physics-based puzzle solving and physics based combat. Combat would be a bit harsh as usually the best thing to do is to run and other than a pickaxe or hammer we will not have any weapons at our disposal. Now, similarly to Amnesia, the protagonist has his own notepad where he writes his thoughts so this is how the story will gradually progress.   While somewhat short, Penumbra showed something new in this genre and those who liked the Amnesia games should definitely give this one a try.
1591	The best horror game I've ever played. Most of these days games rely on jump scares to temporally tug away at the player and is something there for twitch streamers and such. Penumbra will always hold a heart in my place where true horror, scare, and story blend in together.  My father, Howard, abandoned me before I was even born. And here I go following his footsteps, but this time, I won't make the same mistakes. That's all I know...  If you are going to play this game, avoid killing things. It makes things boring, and attacking is entirely removed in its sequels. Focus on avoiding and running away.  I swear, I've never muttered to myself 'I'm so damn lonely' in a game except this one. Its atmosphere is too great. Never seeing a single human being, only hearing someone, and your character's thoughts (which suspciously relate too much with me. maybe it's an edgy thing with me)  You're tucked away at some old abandoned mine with almost no hope to escape and you're not even sure why you're there in the end.
1592	This game is my favourite horror game and I have played alot of horror games. The story is great and don't want to stop playing. If you like Amnesia I think this game is for you.
1593	One of the best games of the genre i have ever played.  Great History and Investigation.  9/10
1594	By removing the Shooter element from the FPS, 'Penumbra' created an eerie FIRST PERSON SURVIVAL PUZZLE genre that surprisingly features some unexpected, nicely paced, action sequences without any direct combat from time to time. You can actually melee some foes or trap them but you'll most likely just sneak past them in the dark (unless you're being swarmed by spiders). The interface is mostly a point and click plus, where not only you get to combine elements to make your way through doors and passageways in endless halls and corridors, you also get to interact with the environment in 3D (with the occasional frustration of not turning a wheel quite right to open a hatch or not thrusting a rock hard enough to break something). It's indie games like this that paved the way for something like 'Alien Isolation' and it's still today one of the coolest games out there with a great storyline and level design. In some ways I prefer this to 'Amnesia', specially because here the dark is your friend and doesn't drive you mad like in the later game (A mechanic that was introduced in order to force you to use lights as if it was food, to recharge your sanity).
1595	  'Every time, itâs harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.â    Penumbra: Overture represents the first of three episodes in the Penumbra series. The game offers an immersive horror atmosphere with interesting puzzles and a very strong storyline, which continues straight into the sequel Penumbra: Black Plague.   The only disadvantage of the game is the stiff and sometimes frustrating combat system. Therefore, stealth should be prioritized over combat.    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.
1596	Had to learn morse code to solve a puzzle. +1 for that. I always seem to get Overture and Black Plague mixed up...
1597	Penumbra: Overture is a first-person survivor horror game with problem solving puzzles implemented in the gameplay which focuses more on survival and eerie atmosphere rather than action and gore. It is also the first episode of the trilogy.  The story centers on Philip, a 30-year old physicist, who gets a strange letter from his supposedly dead father shortly after his mother dies. This gives Philip the inceptive to follow his fatherâs clues, leading him to an abandoned mine in Greenland where he eventually gets trapped in after the mineâs entrance collapses behind him. From then on, Philip ventures through a series of events which turn out creepier with each new discovery he makes. Soon he realises that the mine is not just any ordinary mine. More importantly, it is not actually abandoned. The mine is in fact the habitat of ferocious mutated dogs, ârock wormsâ and spiders. Creepy crawly spiders.  Surprisingly, the game has an intriguing story even if its premise of searching for your lost father as a plot device has been done numerous times before. Perhaps that is due to the fact that the story, or maybe its narrative, is actually pretty well-written. Generally, most of the story is being unravelled as the player discovers more lost documents and journals from various people who worked in the mine but died in the end in various circumstances. This may require quite a bit of reading to understand what and why things are happening that way (although some things are still left unanswered by the end), so it is important not to have a short attention span. Additionally, when a particular survivor by name of âRedâ makes his first appearance, things seem to get even more interesting from a plot stand-point, in a way reminiscent of Andrew Ryanâs debut in Bioshock.  The gameâs mechanics primarily focus on point and clicking with some 'mouse swinging' when solving puzzles and small occasions of combat mixed in. Although some puzzles may require a lot of thinking than others, they are by and large well implemented. Unfortunately, there are times when backtracking is required which may or may not become annoying in time. Furthermore, the game does allow you to hide behind objects and block doors to prevent hostile enemies from seeing or approaching you respectively, thus creating a pretty basic but functional stealth mechanic.  Penumbra: Overture also boasts a great sound design with its spine-chilling ambient music and close attention to details such as foley sounds, as well as having a memorable soundtrack -- the title soundtrack shall always remain a favourite of mine. Sound design is crucial for horror games like Penumbra: Overture, and it is reassuring to see that the developers did a fine job here.  Graphically, while the art direction is commendable, the game did not age too well by todayâs standards. The animations are rough and stiff most of times, particularly for the dogs. But in most parts, the aesthetics do achieve in creating the spooky environment the developers envisioned.  The major downside of the game is its combat mechanic. Just like the way you have to approach the doors, drawers or switches in the game, the combat here requires âswingingâ the mouse which is extremely clunky and requires a lot of practice before getting the grips with it. Sadly, the experience generally ends up being always infuriating for every single hit stupidly missed by your pickaxe (arguable the main combat weapon). This is why any combat should be avoided as much as possible in this game, at all costs. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of variation in enemies too.  Conclusively, Penumbra: Overture is a game which excels in creating an authentic horror experience with genuine eerie atmosphere and plenty of mystique, along with well thought-out puzzles and an unexpected interesting story, only let down by its combat mechanic and roughness from a technical perspective. Being a relatively short game (so long as you do not âwasteâ time standing in one spot due to fear), it has the perfect length and pace. It may not be the most impressive horror game out there on the surface, but it is one which horror enthusiasts must try thanks to its unique approach and emphasis on atmosphere and less on combat which differentiates itself from the masses of generic and/or action-oriented horror games; in addition to paving the way to future superior, if not the best, horror games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or even Overture's follow-up episode, Black Plague.
1598	go into a mineshaft and get scared of dogs
1599	The first game by Frictional Games, Penumbra stands as the strong debut of the devs. Although the combat system is clunky, and the mechanics feel a bit unrefined at times, Penumbra is still a great game that contributed to the more polished and sp00ku Amnesia : The Dark Descent. Both Overture and Black Plague are able to hold their own, with plots that are connected, yet both games give off their own distinct feel. If you're late to the party, (like I,) and haven't bought a copy of the Penumbra Trilogy, you're seriously missing out on sp00ku.
1600	This game is  like  Amnesia, but like, you have beef jerky and dogs and stuff.  10/10  EDIT  i forgot to mention that you can literally hit these dogs with boulders and knock them out  i hate it - pita
1601	VR mod is available for the HTC Vive....Game play is really good...put you right in the middle of suspense....
1602	This is one of my all-time favorite series. It has adventure, a story, no horror, but is scary enough and plenty of challenges. I like it better than Amnesia The Dark Descant. Penumbra is such a game that I'll wait awhile and re-play.
1603	Got this pack once when it was on discount on a Steam Sale. Had never heard of these games before so it was a risk buy. However I was reall susprised how difficult it is. You are not given much clues or tutorials and you literally are on your own, thrown into the story. And this is something I really like. It's not dumbed down but the game actually expects you to THINK and use your brain and interact with the environment and the objects you find. It is quite hard but if you like challenges you'll be pleased. Plus the atmosphere is really good.  And the best thing is it is available for LINUX too :D  Which is where I play it (haven't checked the Windows version yet). So if you're using Steam OS or playing under a different Linux Distribution, I can absolutelly recommend these games.
1604	Amazing atmosphere as usual in Frictional games! This game here is iconic for the whole horror-game community because of how early it was made. If you're a fan of horror games and don't mind a bit outdated graphics, this is a must buy just for you to see what horror games were back then. If you want a really scary game from the same developers buy Amnesia: The Dark Descent! For an amazing story, buy S.O.M.A.! But buy this game just to see where it all started... (not really the first horror game but the first Very good one at It's time.) Thanks Frictional Games for still being here making more and more awesome horror games every time..
1605	I'm only two hours in, but I'm already having a blast.Philip excels at every form of entertainment, let it be beating dogs to death with various household items, or having witty quotes about his own health or maybe being overly proud of a fuse he made.Now at the cost of a very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lunch, available at Steam.Buy it.
1606	Really creepy atmosfere. This is a real horror game, no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing jumpscares, only atmosfere.
1607	First game for Fraction company!!!!!! It doesn't scary as hell but atmosphire is not bad;;;; Also puzzle things make you wandering. I cant wait to play next episode Black Plague!!!!  many people say next one is more scarier than Overture. If you like horror atmosphire game, you must play this game from beginning!!!!!!  ìë¤ììë¥¼ ë§ë  íì¬ì ì²«í¸ë¬ ê²ì 'íëë¸ë¼ ì¤ë²íì´' ëì¤ë ëª¬ì¤í°ë ë§ì§ ìê³  ë³ë¡ë¬´ì­ë¤ë ëëì ìì§ë§ ë¶ìê¸° ë§í¼ì ì´ììë¤ì. í¸ë¬ ê²ìì ì¢ìíìë ë¶ì´ë¼ë©´ ë¤ì ìí¼ìëë ê°ì´ í´ë³´ìê¸¸;;;
1608	Really good game, I had a lot of fun but had to stop about 8 hours in because of the spiders. I thought I would be able to handle them and I was very wrong. If you're scared of spiders this is defintely not the game for you, but otherwise I'd definitely recommend it.
1609	Great game from Frictional Games. I played it after Amnesia and really enjoyed the story.  A word of advise, donât rush trough the game. Read every note you found and enjoy the story and atmospher of total despair.
1610	run b*tch run
1611	Rating 6.5/10 Overview: First Person Survival Horror  The Good  + Creepy, haunting atmosphere that takes place in a deserted mine shaft  + Sound effects, music   + Story that slowly unravels told through logs/journals   The Average:  Graphically the game doesn't hold up very well. Textures look bland, the environments have a 'copy and paste' feel to them   Some levels are frustrating  Frustrating auto save system that will save just as you are getting attacked forcing you to use earlier saves.    Enemy animations   The Bad :  A lot of puzzles are very unclear in how to solve them    Conclusion  It's obvious this game is showing its age and not just graphically but also in its level and puzzle design. However I still found it decent for a survival horror game and worth checking out at a discounted price. Just be prepared to use a walkthrough to avoid needless frustration. 
1612	Penumbra: Overture is a great puzzle/horror game. Made by the masterminds behing both Amnesia games and the upcoming S.O.M.A. This game has amazing sounds and atmosphere, i recomend playing with headphones for the full immersion. While the graphics arent the prettiest (the game is pretty old) it is still much so worth playing, the story is great and the atmosphere is incredible, definite 8/10 for this one!
1613	Penumbra is a enjoyable experience for gamers who like puzzles and exploration. Dark, Dank, Dissused mines with Vicious dogs roaming around. Spiders, slugs and worms... urgh!  It has a great atmosphere about it and areas are small and quick to progress through. Not too much back-tracking.  The Combat isn't great but then it can be avoided with stealth. If you must fight, then use your nogging and find a way to make it easier for you and harder for the enemy. plenty of stuff lying around to make combat quicker and less annoying. The story gets alot more interesting the further in you get, So don't give up! Oh! and play this game with Headphones as it adds to the spookiness.
1614	I used to like dogs.. and horrors.
1615	This game was quite the experience - though I would like to say it was an entirely positive experience, Im not quite sure it falls into that category. I bought Overture as a part of the Penumbra bundle, and have started Black Plague with skepticism. To sum up my experience with Overture, it would have to be, 'annoying.' Though the beginning of the game provided an amount of excitement, it quickly became borderline unbearable to continue due to the ungodly spiders, the redundant puzzles, the giant rock worm debacle and feeble combat/control system. I honestly had the premonition, 'I will never play this game again.' roughly ten minutes before completing the game; which was all that I had left to carry good old Phillip past the garbage incinerator and into the, admittedly much improved, world of roving, naked 'grey' alien mutations of the Shelter. My advice is to find a trustworthy rendition of the storyline of Overture, and then begin playing Black Plague.
1616	A peaceful start, a few puzzles to learn the ropes... The game is set up. Now imagine that lovely background suddenly turns to an oppressing atmosphere, the anxiosity of walking in every corridor, that sensation of being watched or chased, forced to hide, with no clue what's going despite weird stuff happening all around you...  Penumbra isn't cheap scary game made of screamers. It is a true psychological horror puzzle game, just like an interactive Hitchcock movie that would be mixed with science-fiction elements.   Simple yet terrifying !  Probably one of the best horror game available. I totally recommend getting the trilogy!  Overture  is my favourite episode : truly oppressing, a better setting and more clever puzzles.  Black Plague  will lead you deeper into the plot, gathering suspense and revelations.   Requiem  beautifully concludes the game, and puts an end to this psychological horror tale.
1617	Penumbra: Overture is a very fascinating horror adventure game that takes the player to an uninhabited part of Greenland, into an abandoned mining complex, where the player will experience all kinds of spooky occurences and run into whatever creatures dwell inside. I actually really like it how the player is given the chance to fight the dangers, even though being stealthy is the best option to go with. Or rather, it would be if there were no glitches that the player could take advantage of; the games most commonly met creature can easily be slain by jumping on a crate where it cannot reach you, crouching and hitting it whenever it makes a desperate leap attack towards the player, but to no avail. Also the game seems to crash very often. Then again, thats probably just me skipping puzzles by for example climbing to place x instead of knocking the ladder down with something. Well, lucily those are the only grand minuses of the game that I can think of right now and other than those points, I can't help but recommend this classic to horrorlovers. Why? Because the plot is pretty interesting, the puzzles are semi-challenging and there are parts in the game where you need to think and act quickly in order to survive, this game is basically the daddy of Amnesia: the dark descent.
1618	Creepy atmosphere, interesting story. This is one of the best horror games I've played. I say it's better than amnesia: the dark decent which is made by same people.
1619	This was one of the scariest games I've played, next to F.E.A.R. and some others. Here's my short review:  If you love being scared, exploring and solving logical puzzles, then this game is for you. Most of the time, you will be spending your time avoiding monsters unless you have a handy pick-axe with you.  The overall atmosphere is very creepy, especially when those dogs are near. The music intensifies when enemies spot you which gives you a rush of adrenaline.  The physics are also cool; you can pick things up and move them around.  The story just immerses you with all the text you write in your notebook, the short passages during the loading of the next chapter, and the descriptions that you observe when looking at things around you.  Overall, it was atmospheric, and scary. It requires you to use your brain and create objects in order to advance. It also gave me chills continuously. Note: To me, you cannot finish this game in one sitting.  8.5/10
1620	By the creators of Amnesia. Scarier than Scary Godmother: Halloween Spooktacular.
1621	I Dont normally play horror games as I do not get scared by them often. However, Penumbra: Overture is Different. I thought I would pick this up, just to see what it was like (Also it was Â£1.25 in the Steam Sale). I had no Idea what I was getting myself into....  PROS/CONS  +A really Tense atmosphere: The atmosphere in the game is spot on. Instead of constant jumpscares the game shoves you into a dark enviroment that will have you jumping at shadows and curling up into a mewling ball in front of your computer.  +Sound Design: The sound is immersive and chilling and when you do encounter enemies (Spoiler-dogs) The Nerve-shattering growling will put your hair on end.  +Gameplay: You can physically interact with objects and you have to manually open doors by using the mouse button and dragging it around. The puzzles follow the traditional format of itemA+entitiyB=solutionC and will require you to think logically. You have to manage resources (e.g You have a Flashlight that needs two batteries every hour).  +Story: The story is immersive and clever twists and turns will leave you wanting more.  +Graphics: Good for a small indie team.   -Combat: Unfortunately, this game has a rather clunky combat system. You hold down R and Swing in the general direction of the target with a Pickaxe or Hammer equiped. This is rather annoying in dificult situation as you must stand perfectly still facing the target and if the target is a Mobile, Feral dog the you can expect death. Thankfully, combat is usually never the solution to anything.  -Scripted events: The scripted events are annoying as they reqiure you to do certian things in a certian order. For instance, the first spider cave has you crawl through tunnels , blocking off spiders with boulders. You have a limited amount of time to think and what you have to do is unclear without pausing for thought. The worst experience for me was being chased by a Giant Worm through a chemical storage area. You have to close doors with obsucre buttons, bunny hop across a river of Acid, Use the Awful combat system to destroy a fence and finally, knock stupidly placed physics props over to cross yet another Acid River. The cherry on top of this Tarte au â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ was placing a valve next to the exit door only to have it turn very slowly with the solution being unclear (Remeber what I said about time constraints and thinking time). Thankfully these events are Rare in the game.   To Conclude  If you want a very good game that will Scare you and has a great story with nice gameplay and you dont mind the occasional bit of Scripted BS then this is the game for you.
1622	Engaging style of gameplay that lets you interact with everything in the environment.   Lots of practical thinking and puzzle solving involved as you explore each level collecting useful objects and papers for your notebook that also tell a good story. (you will need a walkthrough for some parts)   Environments are very immersive and inhabited by predators that will have you on the edge of your seat as you consider each step.  Unique and cleverly designed game that runs smoothly.
1623	If you like Amnesia, this is the developer's first game and it lays the foundation for what came later. It shows in a lot of ways, but it is by no means a terrible game.  For starters, this is the only game Frictional Games has made that feature weapons and combat. This is a good thing, as Overture's combat is clunky and broken. Swinging requires you hold left click, pull to the left or right to prepare a swing, and then swing in the opposite direction to hit. The hit detection is very short-range and the swing area is small. However, the most commonly encountered enemies (dogs) are easy to kill as you can use boxes to stand out of reach of their attacks and simply stun-lock them with your weapon until they die.  The atmosphere is creepy, but all of the story is through notes and you never really encounter anybody else. Aside from some rare jump scares, there's nothing terribly scary because the combat AI is so laughably easy to manipulate. There are spiders in this game, which might make you freak out if you have arachnophobia.  Luckily, the game is puzzle-oriented and there are only a handful of areas full of enemies. Most of the puzzles are figuring out a process of doing something such as turning on a generator or determining a four-number door lock by translating it through Morse code. The Morse Code puzzle is probably the most difficult out of the bunch and merely requires a pen and paper (or notepad) to write down possible combinations; all other puzzles involve manipulating objects in your environment and following some written instructions.  The story ends on a cliffhanger in Overture, so it's recommended you ALSO play Black Plague, which plays much more like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and has much better story presentation. Requiem is technically the third game in the series but is only tangentially related to the other two.  So if you're looking for a horror game that involves atmosphere and puzzles rather than focusing on combat like Condemned or Resident Evil, this is a good place to start. It runs on just about anything at a respectable framerate.
1624	Journeying into an abandoned mine in the middle of nowhere as you seek answers for your past. It is abandoned, but not uninhabited.  One of the more frieghtening games released that plays with a lot of your emotions and fears. Penumbra truly feels terrifying when nothing is happening, and you'll have to overcome your fear of the dark.
1625	Played through both Amnesia games before noticing that the studio made a trilogy of earlier titles. This series is most definitively a psychological horror game that runs on its astounding ability to create a bone chilling atmosphere along with a force in the back of your head born out of pure horrific curiosity.  Definitely worth checking out if you liked Frictional Games other works.
1626	I'm not gonna joke around. This game is actually scarier than outlast and amnesia combined.
1627	 Penumbra: Oveture is the perfect game in terms of storyline.
1628	Super scary, I almoust get Heart attack D:
1629	The first time I ever played Penumbra Overture, it's a amazing survival horror game totally loved it even had a great storyline with it 10/10
1630	The game is very scary. Those who like Silent Hill type horror games, will like Penumbra also. The game in its entirety is fairy simple, the puzzles are simple, but general environment and athmosphere is scary and spooky indeed.
1631	Confirmed best enemy AI in the game industry.  On the serious note though, one of the most atmospheric horrors I've played. Deserves attention alongside with the second game in the trilogy, Black Plague.
1632	I didn't find this game quite as scary as Amnesia, but it is still a good game. The stealth was not done as well as Amnesia, either. Getting around the dogs was surprisingly a piece of cake, only being caught at least 3 times, but you can just hit them, and run away while they go for help, and you'll be all good. The one thing I really hate is the way you attack, having to hold down the mouse button and then move the mouse around. This makes it difficult to stay aiming in the direction you want. If all you had to do was click to swing your weapon, it would make aiming a lot easier. I died a few times because of this problem. I can only hope that Black Plague doesn't have the same thing.  And I really hated the part with the chemicals. The labeling of each chemical made no sense, there was nothing giving a hint as to which one was which. I though the order they were numbered on the paper was the same order as the letters on the vials. I looked through a couple note regarding explosives and chemicals, but they didn't help at all. I had to look up the combination. I tried to make sense of the labeling of the chemicals, but I just kept seeing people guessing. I still can't find out how it is supposed to make sense, with the numbered order being different than the letter order.  But besides that, I still think the game was cool.
1633	10/10  Would cry while incinerating my best freind again!
1634	As someone who has played this magnificent horror game on every difficulty, the title of this game should be changed to Dog-Slayer DX.
1635	Can kick dog without animal abuse accusations. 10/10
1636	If you enjoy adventure games and have a penchant for horror, especially from a first person perspective, I urge you to play this. Overture is a testament to Frictional Gamesâ understanding of horror and while it has a few flaws, itâs a spine-tingling experience unlike any other. Just make sure you play it alone with the volume up and the lights down.  For my full review visit:  http://tap-repeatedly.com/2010/01/review-penumbra-overture/ 
1637	Graphics are obviously a bit dated (not by much though) but that didn't stop it from being a very immersive and terrifying game. If you like Amnesia, you will love Penumbra for sure. Amnesia got a lot of its gameplay mechanics from Penumbra. Make sure that you buy the whole Penumbra collection though, not just Overture. Because Overture ends at a HUGE cliffhanger and it feels like an incomplete game without the 2 that come after it.
1638	Recommend to any one who likes a good scare!
1639	The first in this silent-hill-esque horror series has some interesting challenges although the enemies seem to be pretty unnecessary since you can just run past most of them (in fact running from them is part of several objectives). Puzzles are pretty straightforward 'find X to open Y and get Z' and the story is pretty interesting to boot.
1640	Pretty scary, i'm surprised i got through it, being the wimp that i am. I think it was the atmosphere that scared me, because there's only like 1 or 2 enemies in this game if i remember correctly. The enemies, just 1 furry a-hole in particular, that gave me a hard time, but other than that, the game was a breeze. It has an interesting little story that continues onto the next game, which you will learn more about what was going on through notes n stuff.  i played this on my mac, worked pretty well, didn't have problems.  This game is worth buying. I got it since it's from the creators of Amnesia(played Amnesia first), and it was on sale, lol. Definitely can see elements from this game in Amensia which is pretty great. I can't wait to play more from Frictional Games in the future!
1641	This recommendation applies to both the Overture and Black Plague episodes of Penumbra.  Both remind me a little of the survival-horror System Shock atmosphere, crossed with a classic puzzle-solving adventure game. There are also small homages to Half-Life in the story and gameplay.  If you like spooky atmosphere mixed with a bit of action and puzzle solving, you'll really like the first two Penumbra games.  Avoid Requiem, however. It's little more than a Portal-esque rip-off with some horror tidbits thrown in. The only possible reason to bother with the episode is to see the ending, which ties in to the first two and adds an extra layer to the story. But it's really not worth the price of admission, unless you can pick up Requiem super-cheap.
1642	Mhrm! Keep those scary games coming!
1643	So I'm about 8 hours into the game and must say I'm really enjoying it. It is a jump back into time as the game came out in 07, and the method to opening doors is to right click the mouse button while your cursor is over the door and then move your mouse like you were actually opening the door.   The story is interesting and I'm hoping it doesn't build up to a terrible ending. The combat system is weak and repetitive with most enemies I've encountered so far.   Each time you attack one of the dog's it will run away (maybe go howl) then come back and attempt to attack you if you're on the ground.   Tip usually I'll get on top of a box and when the dog jumps up swing at them with the hammer.   Overall this is a great game and I recommend anyone who was a fan of the Original Resident Evil Series (Before 3/4) or Silent Hill to give this game a shot. I'm wishing I played it sooner.
1644	One of the best survival horror games I've ever played. Compelling story, great puzzles, worth far more than $9.99.
1645	Probably one of the most immersive, scary and flavourful games I've ever played. Worth a look if you like the genre.
1646	While not as polished as later Penumbra games and the Amnesia games it is still a extremely terrifying and mystifying game.The story follows Phillip a physics teacher at a British university but like most horror game characters is an idiot who heads to the middle of nowhere in the ice of Greenland looking for his presumed dead father,unprepared so ends up falling down a old hatch into a old abandoned mine/bunker.He continues further inside the mine to a more modern part of the mine ends up contacting a insane trapped miner 'Red'.He slowly finds out what is really happening in the mine.   There is a sort of crude combat system but I think it shows what a normal scared person would do,swinging pickaxes around trying to hit that thing in the dark,the story,music and dull graphics build a horrible atmosphere which is great and you never want to find out what's behind that door.   The Puzzles are interesting,original but sometimes just really annoying.You use any tools you can find from crowbars to boltcutters.   This game is still a great horror game and will run on pretty much anything!
1647	This was an amazing game and on to the sequel I cannot wait, I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys thrills and a bit of the creeps. It wasnt terribly horrorifying but never the less a great game with a pretty compelling story.   I would give it a 8.4/10!
1648	Really good game, can be scary at times, and I rarely get scared, Theres a Dog............Demon Dog, Giant Spiders, and a lot of puzzles and you got to think a lot on what you have to do! so pretty solid game by Fritional Games.  Im also Making a Playthrough of this game! want to join with me on the journey of getting scared Sh#tless?

1649	I don't leave many reviews, usually because I'm too busy playing a game.  Like another reviewer mentioned, this game is neither good nor bad. It's interesting. It's not nearly as creepy as many other games (FEAR series, the first Bioshock, etc.) It's worth the price when less than $10.  However - considering you will eventually need to kill something (a rabid dog or one of those damn spiders) the combat functionality is just plain bad. It's worse than most games ported from a controller to a keyboard, and incredibly frustrating. This really needs to be fixed.  I'll recommend it, but be prepared to die multiple times in a row because you can't get the damn 'click - drag right - flick left' melee to work...grrrrr.
1650	Modern horror classic? Almost. This game is very scary but above all this game is a very good adventure game in a 3D first person environment, which is surprisingly unique. The puzzle design is great. The puzzles are always fair, although they never are particularly challenging either. The environmental interaction in combination with the art and sound design combine for a very immersive experience. The Penumbra games represent an impressive beginning for Frictional Games, a modestly-sized team filled with game designers who are all great and truly care about what they do.
1651	All this game taught me is that hitting animals while they are down is super okay. What a mysterious game.   However so far this game has great environments and isn't scary, but tense and kinda spooky.
1652	This game is great, I give it a good 7/10, In the very beginning the enemies struck fear into me, making me afraid to move forward, until I figured out they could be fought and tricked, making combat and enemies not really a high point but it was still exciting to deal with them. The puzzles were difficult and very well thought, they must have taken me forever. The story to me was very alluring, a lot may disagree, but Philip was an okay protagonist, but what I really liked was character Red. I won't reveal the rest of the story, but I think it's very good and can't wait to continue on with Black Plague.
1653	Even if it's old, this game is still worth buying and playing. It may not be the scariest game, but its atmosphere is really amazing, its story is really really good and the physics and puzzle mechanics make you want more and more as you go on solving.

1655	Penumbra: Overture, while originally a mere expansion of a tech demo by Frictional Games, does a decent job of standing as a full-fledged game. While not quite on par with Frictional's later and more famous effort, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Penumbra fires off a trilogy that's intriguing in its own right, and just as atmospheric.  Starting out in a cabin amidst a frozen waste, you're presented with little motivation beyond trying to uncover the fate of your presumably dead father. After stumbling your way through a howling blizzard, you clamber down a mysterious hatch and find yourself in an extensive cave system and facility that leaves a lot of questions to be answered. It's not long before you realize there may be someone, or something, down there with you that doesn't want you to find those answers.  As Frictional tends to do with their games, the horror in Penumbra: Overture takes the form more of a looming dread than anything particularly scary. Your powerlessness is repeatedly reinforced, as even something as small as one of the wild dogs somehow roaming the underground can end your day. Using your wits, stealth, and remnants left by those inhabiting the caves before your arrival, most of Penumbra relies on solving puzzles to progress. As you get further in, more and more notes and instructions left behind push you even deeper, eventually toward something no one should have known was below.  Visually, Penumbra definitely shows its age, but things look cave-y enough in the caves and lab-y enough in the occasional lab that you get the idea, and you're unlikely to get lost just because of how things look. Interaction with items feels a bit clumsy, as lifting things just makes them hover in front of you, but the ability to throw or use items and giving things weight appropriate to their apparent mass adds to the immersion of the game. Death, when it comes, is often swift and brutal, but the checkpoints are placed as to not make things too much of a hassle to retread. If you can, remember to manually save now and then, just to be safe.  Other than the awkward interactions and a couple of puzzles being a bit difficult to figure out, there's nothing I really found fault in when playing Penumbra: Overture. I highly recommend picking up the follow-ups, Black Plague and Requiem, if you like the first.
1656	I thought I was hot â¥â¥â¥â¥ when I learned how to throw bricks at dogs... then I got arrogant when a dog escaped my rock wielding rampage and I chased after it only to find that there were more sharp toothed zombie dogs around the corner.  bad day.  10/10
1657	Has dogs. Has a character named Phillip. Has weapons that remove the challenge of sneaking by enemies since you can just murder them. Interesting combat system with dynamite, brooms, and beef jerky. Cool story, dynamic characters, good dialogue and monologue, fun puzzles.
1658	I recently gave Amnesia a try, the game is very similar, but you are on Greenland exploring dark tunnels on some WWII base infested by zombie dogs? :D Creepy and atmospheric, I like it, this is my approx first hour into the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djccLnzSUAo 
1659	I love it, I love it, I love it! So immersive, enchanting, exciting, challenging and unique. Scared the hell out of me, too. What more could ya want?
1660	Penumbra is a really good indie horror game. just like Amnesia the dark descent. and of course amnesia is better. it is intense and frustating just like amnesia. i recommend this guy to those who like intense horror game and for those who like Amnesia the dark descent and amnesia a machine for pigs. Maybe the puzzle kinda hard for time.... but..... i like it.  8/10 for me
1661	Having played the first hour of this game I suddenly found myself trying to come up with reasons never to come back to to it again. I set it aside and about a week later I realized that the reasons I came up with were mere a cover to the underlying reality: I was too afraid to play it. Ashamed of my coward self I launched the game once again and let my manly self be engulfed by the darkness.The greatest compliment you can pay to a horror game is refusing to play it because you are too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scared to do it.
1662	Whoa, Frictional certainly like their abrupt endings, don't they? Heh. However, this one at least has a direct sequel which I'm about to launch into, so perhaps there'll be a satisfying finish to this one yet.    Having now played this in the wake of the also brilliant Amnesia, I have to say...not quite sure why this game's 'spiritual successor' got so much of the praise, when it's a virtual remake of this in a more 'medieval' setting? Sure, Amnesia is perhaps ever so slightly more refined, but it wouldn't exist without this blueprint/'test run' coming first. And any game which keeps me in constant suspense with just a handful of feral dogs, some carnivorous fist-sized spiders, and the occasional epic worm is clearly doing SOMETHING right!    In short, if you adored Amnesia you should at least get a kick out of this one, even if you might suffer a slight case of deja vu...and an absolute MUST-HAVE for anyone fascinated with just where the hell The Dark Descent came from. Underrated!!  Verdict: 8.5/10.
1663	Im more of a cat person!
1664	this gam scary until i kild the dog n then it not scary..
1665	Frictional Games has come a long way since this title, but this remains a superb example of what a horror video game should be, and is an excellent adventure game as well. This game single-handedly redefined my expectations of horror video games.
1666	Great story, great atmosphere and good scares from time to time. **WARNING** Do not purchase this game if you are an idiot, you'll never beat it.
1667	creepy.
1668	Solid horror experience. I definitely suggest this to anyone new to the horror corner of gaming, while it certainly has its share of scary moments, they aren't heart attack inducing like Outlast or Amnesia. It has quite a few gameplay faults, that when known, will greatly lessen the scare factor, so try to avoid let's plays before you've actually beaten the game. Another thing worth note is that this game DOES NOT hold your hand, at all. There are quite a few headache-inducing puzzles that will ruin your sanity until you've figured them out.  Definitely give this one a try, especially at such a cheap price.
1669	Prelude to Black Plague. Also good, but not quite as good as Black Plague. Still, might as well figure out how the protagonist wound up there, right?
1670	This is the first game to a series called: Penumbra.  It is my favorite out of the 3. The depth of the story was on a whole new scale. It made feel like you were acually there and not here. It does not make you really scream but it can make your heart shiver (It could, I screamed but yea. lol), and I acually cried due to a choice I was forced to make (No Spoiling). The puzzles do not make you feel like your hopeless, it just makes you feel the need to complete it. The graphics are not what you call games now a masterpiece, but it is indie-like and I love it. Controls are smooth and nice. You do not fight the monsters, but unlike Amnesia, you can kill them. If you choose to push your luck and kill them, then I wish you good luck. This is my favorite horror game just because of how well made it was. If you play it, you might find it boring, or you might find it to be amazing. I of course say go ahead and jump in. Tiny details like bloody paw prints, and the sound of foot steps, bring a darkness upon your mind known as dread, it breeds fear, and grasps whats left of your humane thoughts to whats looking for you. Complete and satisfying horror.
1671	Michael Vick Simulator 2014
1672	Takes about 4 - 5 hours to complete (Atleast for me.) Great horror game, maybe in the best I've played. It comes down to this and Amnesia, both made by Frictional Games. I'd recommend both.
1673	you run around a shape and then you pick up the thing and you say great that's great and then you go to the next shape and then you say fug xddd what do to an next and then you to an guide on the web and then to fug xddd I have forgotten something previous! Then to return then to do the thing and then it ends It has it's moments 
1674	The voice actor changed half-way through the series 10/10 would be confused again

1676	The voice actor changed half-way through the series 10/10 would be confused again
1677	Puzzles and- WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS THAT!? OH MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ OH GOD CHRIST â¥â¥â¥â¥!!
1678	In the late 90's I published a Call of Cthulhu RPG scenario on Cthonian that resides near a coal mine somewhere in Eastern Europe, so this game has been pretty much a deja vu for me.   Unfortunately, the game itself does not stand the test of time.  Graphics is crude. Plot is decent, but nothing more. It is full of Lovecraftian cliches. The characters (character) you meet being affected, implausible. The worst part of the game, however, is physics and controls. Interactions with environment tend to be clumsy, using equipment is very unhandy.  How big is the problem? Well, I tend to avoid all creatures not because I was afraid of them (as it should be in horror games), but because I struggle to omit any fight possible. To simply hit an opponent with a pickaxe was a challenge requiring very high skills with mouse and keyboard. At the same time the enemies are plain stupid (attacking until dead in a repetitive manner) and happen to die in weird positions - dogs drop dead 2 ft above ground, or partly in the wall or in the ground. Again, it's a glitch, not a horror element.  All in all, not recommended (says a Lovecraft fan). I had to force myself to finish the game.
1679	With a reduced price, a heavy atmosphere and original mechanisms game, even if not exploited, Penumbra: Overture has many arguments. Many people want to know more ... To be continued. ;)
1680	After 3 hours of laboured crouching in a cave the frozen north, Sam Fisher's massive quads finally caved in and he was consumed by a new species of previously unknown arachinids.
1681	would you like to â¥â¥â¥â¥ your pants of fear. Be my guest
1682	Amnesia before Amnesia.
1683	I recommend this because the next game in the series is very good. Overture really only seems to set the scene and has few good scares or puzzles (some are more annoying and solved through trail and error).. All said and done it was a decent game with a dark vibe and a strong story which gets better in the next game.
1684	Like Amnesia but you can actually kill stuff
1685	A great horror game! If you've played and loved Amnesia, then play the series made by the same makers!
1686	Scary little man and Dude in my head. Great game (7/10)
1687	I made it 36 minutes before I noped out the first time. This is a personal badge of pride when playing a Frictional Games horror title.   The sounds design is inspired. The atmosphere and game world are genuinely menacing. Thanks to its age it has that slightly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ edge to the graphics that make a good horror game better. Unlike other titles that get labeled as 'inspired by lovecraft' Frictional prove time and again that when applied to their games, that title is an honor TO Lovecraft.   Turn off the lights. Lock the doors. Draw the blinds. Max the volume. Get your brown pants. Buy it.   PS: if you get the white screen issue where you cant see the game, uncheck 'post effects' in the advanced grphics menu. instant fix.
1688	A reaaaaaly good little horor game .... Finished in 5 hours . Great puzzles and a great plot :) Recommend
1689	It's not Amnesia, but still gives the jump scares!
1690	Pros- Very interesting and compelling storyline very few bugs graphics are nice (for its time) good voice acting Cons- Scary as god knows what It will occasionally crash between loading screens, not enough to make you mad though if you dont pay attention to the game itself and the tutorials, youre screwed.
1691	very good just like amnesia i dont know yet only played a big but a lot like it so far hope it is as good of a little better :)
1692	I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys horror games or are fans of the Amnesia game(s). Penumbra will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through (Unless you get stuck on a puzzle area) other then that the game is very fun and for the price of ten dollars its a great deal and it even comes with the sequel. Penumbra: Black Plague which is also very fun!
1693	Not that scary once you get used to your enemies however the story is indeed rich and is filled with emotions. I recommend buying this and the other two parts in the game.  Very good horror/adventure game. 8/10 Oh and...â¥â¥â¥â¥ the spiders.
1694	Penumbra Overture is an excellent survival horror game with a unique physics-based system that isn't very common in the survival horror genre. Sometimes frustrating because of the occasionally confusing puzzles, but overall frightening because of the tension that stems from a combination of dark atmosphere and being pursued by creepy enemies (mostly animals in this game). Not quite as good as its sequel, Penumbra Black Plague, but still a great game on its own (and much better than the third game in the series, Penumbra Requiem).   Best when being played late at night, while using headphones or ear buds!
1695	An incredible experience. All three of the games are phenomenal, and I would recommend them to everyone. One of those games you shouldn't look anything up about, just throw yourself into the experience.
1696	Penumbra is one of the best horror games i've played, even though i hate puzzles (ughghghhgh), every penumbra game is awesome, but black plague is some sort of thing apart that is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ puzzles. This game is like #2 on my 'best horror games' list. 10/10
1697	This is a horror game made by the company Frictional Games (same ones who made anmesia). This game is scary at some parts and really makes you tense such as when theres a monster coming around a cornor and you have to hide quick. Its not the best horror game around but it's worth the look.  The graphics in this game arn't the best but are not bad though it quite an old game released in 2007 so it will not have the best graphics out, it dosn't run particualy well on low power machines, but runs fine on medium to high power machines I have a 650 and I can have it on max setting with around 50-60fps which is to be expected on more powerful machines.  The story is quite vague but does hold some element to it.  So I do reccomend this game if your looking for a horror title.
1698	I have not played this game, because it is scary, and scary things scare me, but I feel confident in writing a recommendation because I've checked out a couple screenshots and listened to Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overture' a couple times (this game has 'overture' in its name).  Basically this is a game about, you know, dark things in a place, and you do stuff, and I think monsters attack you? But it's also psychological horror, like, when you have just pooped and then you realize you might be out of toilet paper and it's the feeling you get before you turn to check if you do or do not have toilet paper. That kind of horror. Or the kind of horror that you get when you realize that you're going to be a parent. Or cancer.  Also this game has physics in it, which is important because physics is science and science is the future and children are the future. This is a good game for children. To teach them physics.  I give this game an 8 out of 10 Draculas (vampires are also scary).
1699	Fun little game with good atmosphere, and clever puzzles that require a little bit, but not too much, thinking. Although it's pretty straight forward most of the time, it's really fun while it lasts. Looking forward to play the next episode.
1700	I had a nightmare about that dog.......EPIC HORROR GAME!
1701	This game will make you crap your pants. It was made by Frictional Games which is the same company that later went on to make Amnesia. There's small, hard-to-hit spiders in the game and they will mess you UP. There's also dog/wolf things scattered throughout the whole game but once you figure out how to kill them, they'll be a breeze to run through. Although the game is scary, it's very well-made and has an environment-interaction that I don't think I've ever seen before
1702	this game is 2spooky4me
1703	It has an 'Amnesia' feel to it, except you get to attack enemies.
1704	  6.5/10 TJBs
1705	The atmosphere in Penumbra: Overture is great. It's dark, creepy, lonely, and cold. The physics engine is okay, with some flaws here and there, but nothing worth seriously complaining about. The moving of objects and melee actions can take getting used to, but once you're comfortable with the physics engine, it works okay, although far from perfectly. The game flows through the story smoothly without any frustration or senseless puzzles/problems to be solved. Everything is logical and upfront, requiring a realistic approach and a reasonable amount of thinking to proceed. The save system is unfriendly. It seems to save your progress when you update your personal notes, or when you interact with a certain object within the game world, which the player has little control over when this occurs. This means that you will often have to do certain portions of the game over and over until you get it right. The voice acting is superb. The accent and tone are outstanding and adds to the storyline greatly. All of the texts you will encounter in the game are well written, interesting, and adds plenty to the plot. The controls can be awkward at times in order to accomplish some actions the game requires. Penumbra: Overture is not a scary horror game. Most of its interesting emotional influences on the player comes from the theme of being almost completely solitary in an unknown place that is far from civilization and darkness. There are some instances in the game that requires the rapid change of items in conjunction to platforming and running, which I had to do many times to get it right. There is also a surprising amount of platforming as a whole for a primarily adventure game. Some parts of Penumbra: Overture are really cool, there is no denying that, but it does have a feel of an unpolished low budget title. With that said, this is probably one of the best adventure games I have ever played. It is logical and tense at all the right moments. I am not entirely sure for how long the main character is inside the mine, but the glow stick lasts for the entire duration of the game. You are not forced nor expected to use the flashlight nor the flares, which have finite longevity. I found melee fighting to be clunky and awkward, but this did not detract from the overall gaming experience. The ending is very creepy and will keep you glued to the plot, even though there is much left without explanations. The only major downside is the game's length. It is somewhat short and leaves you with a feeling of unfinished business with a cliffhanger.  Penumbra: Overture is good.
1706	Excellent game and worthy purchase 
1707	Sorry not played the game yet, I just wanted to be the 1.000 review! I'll come back and do a proper review once I've played it :)
1708	Dont wast your money,
1709	F*ck this. I'm out.  2spooky4me.
1710	hell ya i recmond click
1711	Amnesia is a lot better.
1712	Just finished it and I gotta say this is one good horror survival game. Though it's now more than 7 years old, it's not bad looking. Not pretty but good. The controls take a little time to get used to but they're not awkward. The atmosphere of the game is just awesome. The music though there's very little of it also helps to create the feeling of tension. The story is mostly told by notes you'll find but it keeps you interested.   The only bad points I could say are some annoying parts where you're chased and need to find your way before getting killed. They can become frustrating......damn spiders! Also sometime the cursor won't appear yet you need to click on an item to do something. It will work if you click but if someone waited for the Icon before clicking they could miss something. These are minor things that should not keep you away from this great experience.  My advice is to save often with the strange artifact (glowing orange lights on it) or you can rely on autosaves. Get the Collectors Pack which has this game, the second part (Black Plague) and it's expansion so when you finish one you can jump straight in the next part. Really worth every penny. 
1713	The game fell short at the end (figuratively and litterally; you can beat the game in 8 hours). You won't miss much if you just read a summary of the story on the internet. The game really sets a good scary atmosphere though, but it never gets as scary as I hoped it would be. The dogs and the spiders just â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off more than they scare me, especially when I realised you could kill them. I know black plague has creepy naked dudes so hopefully it will creep me out a little more.
1714	First boss, thecellar door thing you have to smash with a rock, is too hard. Please nerf.
1715	gr8 game maybe even better than the first part, dont buy the third part 'requiem' tho that has nothing to do with the first 2 games and it sux
1716	I really like this game. It's more atmospheric and suspenseful than Amnesia, and it's just like that game except you get to kill those bugs and zombie wolves with either your hammer or pickaxe (good lucking fighting them only with one broom). I am currently recording videos of my Penumbra: Overture gameplay series. You guys should see my Youtube channel. Here's my link:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUd3vueGsuJvviNig91YESg

1718	Meh. Thumbs up, but not that far up. Decent semi tense horror type game from the Amnesia folks. If you've already played Amnesia, you may want to just pass on this. If you're a huge horror game fan it might be worth your while.
1719	After playing a couple of hours I would say this is definitely a good game. It was my first time in a horror/thriller-puzzle based game and though the graphics and physics were sometimes buggy, I had a good fun. Sometimes the story get lost within itself, with a lot of uninteresting long texts and notes but it doesn't really matter afterall; because what matters is the atmosphere the game creates. Better played at night, in a air-conditioned darkened room, in a 32-40'' TV. Manage to buy the 'trilogy'.
1720	This game is great! Make sure to go right up to the dogs and give them hugs, this makes them fight for you against the far more terrifying enemies. I never knew that and it made the game way harder! Good luck!
1721	First off, I do recommend the next episode, and if you are buying that, this episode will likely come in a bundle with that. But regardless I found this episode to be kind of lackluster.  The game controls like a typical first person game, except the bulk of the gameplay is puzzle solving similar to that found in classic point and click adventure games. These puzzles are nothing special but managed not to bore me too much. There is however a fair amount of finding a locked door then finding a key, literal or figurative, in some random place. Fortunately the areas are small enough that they are not usually hard to find.   Where the episode fell flat for me was the supposed horror elements. In between the rooms with all the puzzles in them there are some kind of mutant dogs or wolves roaming the hallways. These to me were not scary and were just kind of annoying. The strategy for getting past them is generally just walking slowly and hiding slightly out of sight when one is in the way until it moves away. There are some other creatures you come across which you have to run away from and these sections are very trial and error. At least one of the creatures would be scary but when you've played the same part repeatedly because of the trial and error nature of the gameplay, it loses any scariness it once had.  There isn't a whole lot to the story. You're trying to enter an underground facility to find out what happened to your father who mysteriously dissappeared. There are various obstacles in your way and some crazy guy talks to you over a radio to guide you along. If you were to start with the second episode, you'd find yourself in the middle of the facility without knowing how you got there but there isn't really that much necessary background information needed to enjoy the second episode.
1722	Visually, this games lacks, but the game is older. The story, music, and atmosphere are pretty good ad the games certainly gives u the creeps. The problem I had was the game doesn't want to load in properly and would make my screen start twitching to the point where it was unplayable. And the save points were horrible. Several times the game would save right in a bad spot where it would load, and u would be dead 5 seconds later.  Maybe an older computer will have more luck, but not recommended by me.
1723	ible, Terrible, Terrible combat controls. âTryingâ (and I put these words in quotations) to swing my hammer to kill the dog, frustrated me to extreme anger. If you could swing the damn hammer and not feel like an epileptic trying to actually land a blow on the enemy, the game's combat would be fine! You have to push down the mouse button and then violently swing your mouse left or right. The direction achieved has to be random because either it does NOTHING or it spins you in a very non-useful direction. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible combat controls. 
1724	420/420 I have only one fear: Spiders... Dis gaim has a lot of them, â¥â¥â¥â¥ dis game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ dis game so hard. Dog beating simulator. Giant worm dating sim 2069 Beef Jerky of doom.  
1725	This game uses the same old mouse control the other game did making ti difficult to do anything in the game handicapping the controls so much their broken, opening a door, or a drawer is terribly annoying. The game seems glitchy skipping around or repeating old frames, not sure if that is intended or not. Better than this game is Cryostasis with a better story, better controls, and better graphics, this game is just old and tired looking. Maybe ten years ago this seems cool and innovative with the poo controls, but even then id just delete it for being annoying.   Rating: 0/0 Value: $0.00
1726	This is one of those survival horror games. I guess people are buying this stuff. It's not for me, though. I played it for about ten minutes, then something spooky happened, I almost wet my pants, turned the game off, and hid under my bed quietly sobbing. When I worked up the courage to turn the computer on again, I uninstalled the game.  Pwninator score: 2/10
1727	A fairly decent game. Lengthy story, confusing puzzles, a little bit of scarey thrown in. Not bad.
1728	I remember a long time ago, maybe 5/6 years i couldn't get past the first dog encounter with one of my friends, was such a sense of relief when i finally progressed further, something that only occured when i bought the game the other day. I was very surprised on how much scarier the game becomes as you get closer to the end. Very good game, great start to the series, and ultimately one of the best horror games i've played!   Up there with the best! :D
1729	Although it has taken me a little more than 5hrs to finish this game, it seemed like a very long time. From the moment I clicked 'New Game' I was detached from earthly boundaries. At first I was scared and jumpy, but after a while I thought 'enough', I got up and killed that damned zombie-dog, and it was so satisfying. I strongly recommend this game for anyone in need of some of that horror rush. Remember kids: Badly Administered Dopamine Clouds Frequently Everything.
1730	10/10
1731	Penumbra is an amazing psychological thriller title that has a truly enthralling plot, and an interesting control system.
1732	This is the best game of the series for sure. It features a very well developed narrative and constantly kept me wondering what the hell was going to happen next. The horror aspect was spot on and kept me on my toes. This title is well worth your time and money
1733	8/10 for a great story and boring gameplay
1734	Amazing horror game, a masterpiece of the genre. His physics engine and lighting effects are main responsibles for the great immersion and your inability for defend yourself make you feel a despair's sensation through the whole game. 10/10!  Also, I'm too sexy for you to disagree with me.
1735	Wonderful. Not up to par with Amnesia, but a great early effort by Frictional.
1736	just wow. this is something 10/10 i would play anyday and its not an easy game either its quite challenging for someone who has never known about penumbra before. Now onto the next one!
1737	I played Amnesia before Overture, so I was expecting a more flight or die kind of gameplay. It was shocking to me when I discovered I could kill the creatures in the game. I won't say what they are as to not spoil it for anybody. Anyways, right from the get go I was interested to find out where the story was going, more so than I was with Amnesia. Albeit the settings in Amnesia are better, I do find the story better in this, and I like how it is episodic.   I felt the combat to be clunky, but it got the job done. More of a thriller than a horror game. I just finished it, and now I am currently installing Black Plague, I most certainly want to see how this finishes. I won't state 'if you're a fan of...', but check it out if you're wanting a good story in a pretty atmospheric world.
1738	just had to buy it, BEST GAME SERIES EVER!!! 
1739	Interesting enough game to keep you hooked. My BIG complaint is the programming of the mellee weapon attack. It IS hideous, really. That...coupled with having to un-equip a mellee weapon before you can interact with objects or function buttons/activations really makes things very awkward. Even though these are 1 handed weapons you still can't press a button, grab a door?? It seems like the game wants you to use environmental mechanics to deal with deadly creatures...but that very odd equip...un-equip combo in the heat of battle gets very annoying &amp; makes things a ton more 'fingers &amp; thumbs' than they need to be.  Base generic enemies too. But, otherwise a goodish time... :-) Only recommended when on sale. I think I paid $2-$3 for all 3 games...so yeah good for that...any more...not sure... 
1740	For those of you who have played Amnesia, this is much like it- execpt you can actually fight, albeit with rather ineffective weapons such as a hammer. That's right. Though it isn't the 200 pound battlehammer that one might be expecting. For those of you who haven't, well, it's a horror game. Long story short, it's set in the early 2000s. There's this guy named Phillip, whose father goes missing around the time of his birth and whose mother dies some time after. Phillip grows up and, after 30-ish years, gets a letter from his father, who is supposedly dead. Anyway, he becomes obsessed and tries to find him. His biggest lead is an abandoned mine in Greenland. That's where the game begins. Phillip- the main character- wanders through the cold, desolate and hostile mine, searching for answers. Along the way, you can find letters and things like that explaining the backstory of what's going on.  The game is pretty creepy, although playing it with a walkthrough in an open tab, the lights on and having other people around makes it much less scary than it could be otherwise. I don't think it's as scary as some other games, especially the sequel, Penumbra: the Black Plague, but it certainly is a good game. My only problem is some parts, especially the puzzles, can be a little frustrating at times. It's okay to check a walkthrough for the hardest things, but don't use one as a crutch like I did.
1741	Captures the claustrophobic fear of being trapped and the madness that sets in during a gruesome struggle for survival. Fighting for your life feels clumsy and frantic at the same time: eventually I lost count of the number of zombie dogs I had wildly and desperately stabbed to death with a pickaxe. The sound design complements the atmosphere wonderfully and you will find your heart pounding in time with the ominous music before long.  Puzzles are intelligent and interesting, sometimes requiring you to use your noodle to decipher codes from written clues or learn how to do something from a field manual rather than simply 'use item A on object B'.  A little difficult and confusing at points but definitely worth a playthrough!
1742	A perfect combination of puzzles and scariness, not to mention a gripping storyline. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival-horror games.
1743	This game is amazing, and I would definitely recommend it... However, the game glitched and if I want to complete it, I have to restart about seven check points back! Agh! I can't deal with those spiders again!
1744	Penumbra overtureis a great game although its not really populular compaired to games like amnesia, or outlast.
1745	If you like making deposits in your pants while playing a game in the dark you should buy this. and by deposits i mean â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1746	A creepy and atmospheric horror adventure. The advanced physics engine makes the experience truly immersive. The highs definitely outweigh the lows and this game breathes new life into an old genre. Check it out if you liked Amnesia!
1747	Scary, and extremely fun as well. Definitely recommended.
1748	80 minutes in and i had nearly pooped myself 40 times! this game is great. a nice lovecraftian mystery and horror. oh the horror! the unfathomable HORRORRRRRRR!
1749	Absolutely fabulous horror game with a great Lovecraftian feel! Being made by the same people as the now more widely recognized game, Amnesia, it definitely delivers a equally entertaining gameplay experience.
1750	This was a lot of fun. Penumbra Oveture was a little bit easier than I expected and I seemed to natively understand all the 'puzzles' so it didn't challenge me much. I also seemed to go to the right place every time so I always had the appropriate items. Very atmospheric and plenty of frights. I was a little disappointed at the lack of variety with regards to the enemies especially when I realized how powerful the pickaxe was. Definitely worth your dosh.
1751	The spiritual precursor to Amnesia, and far better imo. The puzzles in this game actually feel like puzzles and not 'THROW â¥â¥â¥â¥ AT MACHINES UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS' which was prevalent in Amnesia.  This is the first game. Next, play Black Plague. Reqium is a bunch of random puzzles that have no connection to the over-arching story, you can skip it if you'd like.
1752	probably ranked in my top 10 favourite games i've ever played. even with mediocore graphics this game will scare the living daylights out of you! there's been more than one time when i've had to say 'NOPE', hit pause/rage quit and take a little/big break before trying to attempt playing again. 20/10
1753	interesting story some scary parts.... I HATE SPIDERS &gt;:O
1754	Ok, I got it to play on my Mac :) *cheers because owning a Mac can suck* Spooky, you can really see what influenced Amnesia: The Dark Decent. The controls, the dark setting, the story, they all reamind me of what is one of my favorite games. Penumbra is becoming a fast favorite too. Surival horror is a great genre!
1755	I think it is the best horror game for PC
1756	Spooky Scary.   7/10
1757	The original spook.
1758	About 30 minutes into the playthrough, I was being terrorized by a dog with glowing eyes that really thought I was made of bacon. I finally got to a door, and closed it behind me, thinking that the dog couldn't get through. I was wrong. The dog broke down the door and I nearly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself. In my panic, I picked up a rock and threw it at the dog; it fell down, got back up, and then wimpered away. 'huh,' I thought, 'I guess that was all I had to do?' the answer was no. The dog quickly changed its mind and came running towards me. I panicked and hit the dog once more with the rock. It just did the same thing again, and I was getting desperate. I hit it once more, and when it was down, began bashing it in the head over and over again with the rock (doing this by moving my mouse up and down quickly) and then... the dog died. I really did not expect that. 10/10 game lets me kill the scary bad guy with a rock.
1759	Awesome game. Loved to finally get to play this... since I have played Amnesia:TDD first. The same type of atmosphere, story and draw as in Amnesia. Puzzles seemed too easy at times, but good enough to make you read through everything and find everything you can to get through the game. This type of game atmosphere for a horror is very rarely matched in my opinion.  Only major difference(possibly con) is the ability to attack the dogs. It made them less of an issue unless you missed if you were throwing an item at them. I just chased them down and hit them with barrels or propane tanks. That sort of ruins that horror experience, though making it more realistic since a normal person could attack with anything around them.
1760	No jumpscares, creepy atmosphere, good music. Really nice game (but short)
1761	Let's get one thing out of the way first: I'd reccomended this game based solely on the experince and story alone and the cheap price ($10 for the bundle with it as well as it's sequels) only sweetens the deal. The graphics, atmosphere, sound design, and story are all top notch. This is also pretty much the game that started the exploration heavy and combat-light based gameplay-style for indie-horror that Amnesia later codified.   I DO have some complaints about the gameplay machanics that anyone thinking of buying this should now about, though:  *The combat is clunky and barely responsive. I can see that were going for for a immerisve and substansal feeling system with interaction beyond clicking a button to swing, but it was implemented horribly. It consists of holding the action button to ready yourself, and using the mouse to swing but it takes such broad movements that it's hard to hit anything and good luck lining up enemies when they can simply step out of your hitzone because you obiously can't move the camera while holding the action button.  *I won't post spoilers here, but some of the puzzles violate common sense or rely to much on really diffcult trial and error along with memorization. Some also do downright underhanded things like requiring you know morse-code with nothing but a code-sheet and no indication how to tell dashes from dots.  Normally I'd trash this game, but the story and art design made up for the short-comings in the gameplay and made worth powering through to the end.  
1762	Fun, scary, entertaining.
1763	Nice game. Not exactly the scariest horror game I've played, but there is this weird lovecraftian feeling when you don't know what's happening around you. The enemies are you joke, you can just run past them and enter the next door. However, the overall atmosphere is really nice and the puzzles are really innovative. The game even becomes emotional and if you like it, you'll probably want to install Black Plague right after finishing Overture.
1764	Postal 2 is an amazing game! It has a hilarious story line, a vast array of weapons, and a lot of gameplay. In my opinion, Running With Scissors did an amazing job at this game. I recommend it to everyone about 15 or older due to a lot of innapropriate content. I rate this game 10/10.
1765	I played this game through in one day.  Buy It!
1766	Very good mood and atmosphere.  Controls are a bit clunky at times, but overall a good game with an intriguing story and OK puzzles.
1767	If you liked Amnesia: The Dark Decent. you will love this. not only is this game scary its sequel Black Plaque is even more scary than Amnesia. A must buy for Horror Fans.
1768	The design flaws in Penumbra Overture may be off-putting at first, but they will serve to heighten your terror and helplessness. Desperately digging my way out of tunnels while unseen horrors assail my back elicits a familiar response of nightmares where one is unable to move fast enough to get away from what is chasing you. And then you die.
1769	Overture is a puzzle game that for some stupid reason thought that fighting mechanics are a good idea and so they made a bunch of stupidly long puzzles where you get chased while trying to brake a wooden barricade and failing because for some reason the main character decided it's a good idea to shank the wood with a pick.Would not recommend if you hate getting killed by dogs,buy Black Plague instead.
1770	woth ago 
1771	It's clear this game had an assortment of great modern features that were somewhat under-developed at the time of Overture's release, but would eventually - with experience and focus - be appeciated for their innovation when the second game in the series, Black Plague, was released.  I'm not massively into horror games - I lack the nerves of steel required to fully absorb them, but I do love exploring locations rich in atmosphere, with fresh storytelling and immersive sound design bolted on top. Combat aside, I enjoyed my time with this game. I was always interested in how the story would progress (the character of Red was great to listen to and very reminiscient of BioShock's Sander Cohen), and I think the environments, though sometimes lacking creativity, were enjoyable enough to move around in.  The combat however is clearly the biggest issue, which basically amounts to a Benny Hill-style run around a cramped location with you occasionally stopping to turn and smack a crazed zombie dog snapping at your heels in the face with the world's smallest hammer. Thankfully, Frictional Games chose to remove self-defense entirely from the sequel, Black Plague, so you just have to grit your teeth and take solace in the fact the next game will be a much less clunky experience. The story and exploration's still great though, it's definitely worth playing if you enjoyed Frictional's other games.
1772	Before Frictional Games hit the horror genre bullâs-eye with Amnesia, there was the Penumbra trilogy. While lacking the overall polish and well thought out-ness that Amnesia clearly possesses, Penumbra: Overture still delivers when it comes to creeps, tension, and story.
1773	Easy puzzles but good story and atmosphere.
1774	Dogs will never be the same again...
1775	Scariest series i have ever played! Better than Amnesia...
1776	Penumbra describes itself as a 'first person survival horror game'. Actually, Penumbra was the game that defined this genre.  There is no gore - the game completely relies on its incredible eerie, dark atmosphere instead of on blood and guts.  The puzzles are challenging, but not too hard for casual adventure players.  Nice graphics, incredible, dark, sounds and music.
1777	The Penumbra Collectors Pack is only $10, and it contains some of the best survival horror games ever made. It is practically a steal. If you are remotely intrested in survival horror games, you HAVE to buy it. Especially when its on sale. Great plot, characters, gameplay, and atmosphere all combine to make one of my favorite game series of all time.  Keep in mind, they are indie games from 2007 - 8, so they can be a bit clunky. It doesn't impact the experience much, though.
1778	The best game from this epic trilogy, in my opinion. Lots of scary moments, The game keeps you intense and tense, besides not having huge battles. Great game!
1779	6/10  Pros: +Original +Clever +Fun  Cons: -Main enemy are dogs, which I dont find scary  Overall: Pretty good game.
1780	Short, but good.
1781	Receommended for anyone! Decently scary but combat system was kind of awkward. Great story and excellent introduction to the Penumbra/Amnesia/Soma set.
1782	Giving this game a thumbs up because the interactive physics engine is spectacular and the first hour of gameplay feels fresh and great. The puzzles are fun to get through because you can pick stuff up and toss things around. It makes the Source engine feel primitive. The sound is also done well-- dissonant soundscapes that make your skin crawl just a little bit. And these shining points are why Penumbra Overture gets a solid 'MEH' instead of a dissentful 'GARBAGE'; read on.  After the first hour or so, the game gets quite mundane. The game begins in the typical 'abandoned mine' game trope, which is one of the worst settings there is, on par with 'the water level that's mostly swimming'. Nobody likes abandoned mine levels, we all just begrudgingly power through them hoping to get to the next area. Unfortunately there is no next area-- the whole game is in this mine. As a result the level design feels uninspired and boring.. because it is. And the one lake area that adds some dynamic to the world is a total non-sequitor.  As is standard for horror, combat is terrible. We are encouraged to sneak around enemies, which does have novelty for the first hour of gameplay. After that, it's just Outlast before there was Outlast.. I grappled with the poor fighting system until I found a reliable way to exploit it and kill the dogs (almost) every time. Running from enemies doesn't increase tension. It never increases tension. It only breaks momentum. The corridors are too long to backtrack through if one has to stop and wait out the dogs, so the dogs need to be taken out back and axed. Crouch down and time your hitstuns.  The spiders are poorly implemented. They can't be killed in any practical sense, and they can outrun you. It's a matter of trial and error, death and respawn, until you've brute-forced the maze to the point of memorizing the right path. There was an instance where I got check-pointed with spiders right on my tail, thus making the current objective impossible to complete. Player death was unavoidable because I hadn't previously been moving along fast enough for a sufficient head start. I had to reload an older save and use hindsight to briskly run through and make all of the correct turns.  Similarly, boss battles are all one-shot kills and require fast environment interactions to get past. Once again, they're impossible to beat the first go-around. But after enough trial and error you learn where to go and what to press. It takes all the tension out of the prospect of death. Good game design involves giving the player the opportunity to analyze and deconstruct the situation in the middle of the action, but Penumbra punishes the player for slowing to look around despite it being necessary to advance.  My guess is that this game was playtested only by the creators, and knowing the lay of each path, were able to breeze through with little difficulty. Uninitiated players, despite Penumbra Overture being a relatively easy game, will inevitably die at certain points in their playthrough, making death expected, accepted, and anticlimactic.  Nevertheless, I still recommend buying the Penumbra Collectors Pack this Winter Sale because it comes out to only 83 cents for each game. Although most of my review was negative, it's fortunate that the majority of the game is puzzle solving with that neat physics engine. This game is worth the 83 cents, and it was fun to see where Frictional came from before I play Amnesia for the first time.
1783	Sure I've only played an hour of this game, but I've already learned everything there is to know about it. It's lame! Your character doesn't have enough motivation for me to actually care about him. Plus his voice sounds really weird, so yeah. The creatures are just kind of there. I mean, a dog? Did they market this game to a community of mailmen? But seriously it's actually pretty alright.
1784	Fantastic horror game with a mysterious story and very intense environment. Good puzzles, making it more rewarding our way into the game and the unveiling of the story. Downside is the combat system, which is mediocre at best.
1785	If you like Amnesia, you'll probably like this. Good horror game.
1786	It's kinda like if Heavy Rain and Amnesia had a baby but that baby was trying to find his way out of an abandoned underground mining complex in Greenland
1787	The mouse is really buggy in the Mac client and renders the game unplayable. :(
1788	Penumbra is a horror game that resides in a special place in the genre of horror games, as it not only tries to scare you but rather makes you horribly miserable and lonely the more you progress. The atmosphere is really well done and while playing I felt more and more isolated, the deeper I went into the mine. If you pay attention to the details and let yourself into the mood, this game will reward you by kicking you in the balls and laughing at you while you whimper on the ground.   So much for the mood part.  The puzzle mechanics are a bit rough and unpolished, which is excusable as this is (one of?) the first games of this studio and you see quite some elements that are later refined in titles like Amnesia.  The combat system (which they thankfully removed in the second part) is pretty wonky and needs a lot of getting used to, the best option is to hide.  If you can forgive the mediocre mechanics and really need to feel down, this is the title for you.
1789	This is the first and, I'd say, best game in the Penumbra trilogy. It is appropriately mysterious, atmospheric and kept me interested till the very end. My only gripe with it is that the challenge of the enemies does not scale well with the experience of the player, so by the end of the game they are not scary at all, more of a nuisance if anything.
1790	I can't say Overture is the best game in the entire series. but it might be worth playing after you've completed all the other Penumbra games.  Tbh, the first time I played Overture I got a little bored. Well, more like frustrated. It was an entirely different style of gameplay than I was used to. I loved the atmosphere but couldn't get into the puzzles because they required me to THINK. It made me realize how differen this type of thinking was versus waht I was used to in most other games.  Rather than give up on the entire seires, I went ahead and started the sequel, Black Plague, instead. That one got me hooked. Then I realized the Necrologue mod was available, so I downloaded and played that, followed by Twilight of the Archaic.   Those three I found a lot more compelling than Overture. But it still deserves a thumbs up for being the first in a unique series of games.
1791	Fun game by Frictional Games
1792	Best dog killing simulator out there.
1793	games like amnesia/soma give me a heart attack figured i'd try what they made before personally found it scarier can kill enemies but too afraid to do it 10/10 would reccomend if you wanna get spooped into a coma
1794	Absolutely phenominal game.  I think an in depth review would take away from the experience of your first playthrough, as half of the fun is in not knowing what's coming.  A masterclass in the horror genre.
1795	This game is seriously awesome. Its very good at creating a tense atmosphere and can even make you jump without using cheap jumpscares. Definitely buy this if its on sale.
1796	Penumbra: Overture can be considered as an Adventure game until one point. And that point is the spider tunnel. Okay, at least for me that is the scariest part of the game (except the worm thing). But the main reason why it's not scary until that point is that you can fight back. You can fight with spiders too, but man they are hard to hit. That's when the game becomes 1000 times scarier. I still love the game since it has a great atmosphere and it's my favorite Penumbra game!
1797	Great atmosphere, some good puzzles, fairly interesting story, and no cheap jumpscares that I can recall. My only complaint is the lack of variety in the enemies, but it hardly distracts from the overall feel of the game.
1798	Survival horror perfection
1799	2spooky4me   I can hardly play it for more than a few minutes without feeling like I am going to have a stroke from pure stress.
1800	I absolutly love the Penumbra series, and this one is where it all began. I will miss Penumbra dearly. If anyone from Fristional Games sees this i hope you are going to spread the news that im sure many many people would want... to make one more Penumbra. Again thank you for making a brilliant game way before Amnesia.
1801	Awesome game! but you need some balls to play it!
1802	This was the first game that introduced me to the works of the great small company named Frictional Games. And as it often happens with 'first's - it's the most impressive horror game for me. When I play it now - I have a huge feeling of nostalgia.  The plot is great. Mystery of the father's letter, the idea of a small man trapped inside an unknown bunker in the middle of nowhere, the enormous size of that underground construction... this is all very intriguing! In this game a lot of experiences were concentrated together. At first, it was like reading a very interesting fantastic book. At second, it was very immersive experience of being trapped in this bunker where the only way out is to go deeper into the unknown. At third it was innovative system of the interaction with ingame objects, where your mouse (and so your hand) becomes your virtual hand. Forth - it was a real true horror game, where scary things are made not of sudden flashes or jump-out monsters, but horror of the atmosphere, vulnerability and loneliness. Fifth - a lot of physical objects that you need to interact with, made the game even more immersive, because you see less scripting and more like simulation of virtual world. There was also a great musical theme in menu that touched me when I first launched the game.  As a verdict I can say that this game is at the top of experience of all games I played. If I hadn't play this game I'd missed a lot in my life. Usually a lot of games for me is just a waste of time, and I wouldn't regret if I had never played them, but definitely not this one.
1803	I went into this game not expecting too much considering the pirice and my experience with similar games... Doing so probably made it all that much better. The puzzle aspects of the game were decent but it was definently rich in story. Make sure to follow the directions in the start of the game.
1804	One of the best horror game
1805	Penumbra Overture, which starts the Penumbra series, offers player some horrifying atmosphere and chilling moments. Works well with headphones in a dark room. Try to make it through without weapons. Good luck.
1806	Very excellent game. well done. great storyline. and outstanding graphics!
1807	Although this game may be a bit dated it's still definitely worth playing through. Created by the same developer as Amensia: The dark Descent.
1808	This game is great, as long as you know what you're getting into. If you're looking for a plethora of things to kill and ways to kill them, this is not the game for you. The few 'weapons' you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.  The atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not 'scary' in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease.   The puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.  Considering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.  Admittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, 'Black Plague', which I'm told is even better.
1809	scary
1810	The Penumbra series was Frictional Games first series. Overture is the first game in the penumbra series, it features Phillip who is investigating a letter written from his dead father and ends up trapped in an abandoned mine. The game revolves around surviving and hiding, there are no real fighting mechanisms in the game. You can throw rocks or objects to knock out enemies (Dogs, Spiders, Infected) but after a while they will get back up again and attack you. This is a very puzzle heavy survival game, reading and taking notes are important but also some sounds can lead to become very important clues for some places. If you enjoyed Penumbra and haven't checked out Frictional games second series Amnesia, I would highly recommend it.
1811	Penumbra is Amnesia's long lost brother that very few people know about and is by far the hardest game from frictional games. The atmostsphere is unsetteling and very creepy which is what is expected from frictional. Two thumbs way up 4 this game.
1812	Play this game on bathsalts for added fun!
1813	The greatest surivival/adventure game. Every game you do the same thing, fight many waves of enemies and level up, or just shoot as many enemies as possible, clear out the wave move on to the next area. Not since zelda or shenmue has there been an adventure game like this. Very addicting game, cool story.
1814	Penumbra is absolutely astounding. Being the predecessor of Amnesia it beats the living CRAP out of it in all ways; atmosphere (seriously, crawling on your hands and knees with no weapons, dogs howling around you while you're losing your sanity is intense), music (there is none, which I love, it brings a whole new level to insufferable solitary) and the plot. The monsters in the game aren't the typical 'le slender face' either, just dogs, spiders and demons, the simplicity makes it even more terrifying and certainly plays on your fear of the unknown.
1815	JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY, A GIANT WORM WITH TEETH IS TRYING TO EAT ME
1816	Made by the same developers as Amnesia. If you liked Amnesia don't forget to pick this one up aswell as its again a survival-horror game.
1817	Full of on the edge of your seat moments. Creepy and very scary atmosphere. This was like nothing I have ever played before. An instant horror classic if you ask me.
1818	The least scary in the series, but wonderful nontheless. It's a great introduction that leaves tons of unanswered questions juat waiting for the sequals to explain them in very creative ways.
1819	Very creepy game that's worth checking out!
1820	This game is scary as hell, just like Amnesia, it has some controls that have moved over, even though penumbra was made first Frictional Games did a great job. 9/10
1821	Forget what all the people who don't recommend it say about horror factor in this game, this game is actually not meant to be as horror filled as Amnesia was, where-as this game was meant to play on emotion, as well as the other title, Black Plague does as well. Penumbra Overture, while people may be saying 'Has nothing to do with the main character, just this 'Red' fellow.' it's untrue. Philip has a purpose to coming here in this frozen wasteland and pushing on, and the atmosphere is great if you have an open mind, it's dark, it's lonely, it's scary in the sense that you're trapped with nobody to help you, surrounded by death at every corner.  For emotions on the other hand, there are so many things in this series that play with your emotions, they get you to love characters, only to do something to twist around your thoughts and emotions. I felt so guilty playing both in the series with how strongly I got to know and like all these characters in the games. I'll leave it at that. Want to know what was so tear-jerking? Play the game. That's all I can tell you. While the only complaint I may have for this game is being able to fight the monsters, I love the puzzles, (And I'll admit, I actually do love fighting the dogs.), I just overall love this game so much. Again. Just play this game. It's amazing. (Play Black Plague too!)
1822	I think it's better to get straight to Black Plague. Because you can slay monsters in this game, much of the horror gets lost. There have been still quite a lot of scary scenes, but well. It's just a prologue to Black Plague. I liked it though. The graphics are a bit dated today.
1823	From the opening cutscene and the very first room of the game, you will be chilled to the bone.
1824	Scary as balls
1825	ok so it finally now works for me and I have got to say it's pretty creepy it littlerally is spot on and this game helped them vreate other games like Amnesia and me personally I love it but yet it creeps me out with its well designed atmosphere
1826	Very creepy. I also recommend the Amnesia games because they are also made by Frictional Games.
1827	I picked this up with the first Humble Indie Bundle. I already owned World of Goo from the bundle but hadnât heard of any of the others. This one sounded like it might be similar to the Thief series, and it didnât disappoint! Best played alone at night with the lights off, this game has you exploring a dark, dangerous old mine to find out what happened to your father. This game is highly likely to startle and eventually disturb you. If you already have it through the Bundle and havenât tried it you should absolutely check it out! I even recommend buying it â Steam has it for $9.99 and itâs well worth it.
1828	The game that came before Amnesia. Not like F.E.A.R. where you're armed to the teeth and can be all 'COME AT ME BRO', but you're a scientist with a pickaxe and bad aim, and everything is trying to kill you. In the dark.
1829	Your balls will be scared from their sack.
1830	It's an awesome horror adventure game. Don't get it without its sequel, though - the sequel is actually better but it feels like the latter half of this game. BUY IT NOW
1831	Excellent horror exploration/puzzle game, can actually be pretty scary and suspensful, had a couple events where I threw my arms in front of my face when I was attacked, now thats something. Buy the package where you get both games though, otherwise you'll end up with only the first half of the game like me x_x
1832	OVERTURE Y U SO SHORT AND NOT SCARY
1833	Short, sweet, and creepy. Frictional Games were really on to something with this first iteration of Penumbra.  The engine looks great, though the graphics are a bit simplistic. Very worthwhile.
1834	get scare 0/10 would play not tho becau se scarie
1835	You can definitely see it's age, but this game is terrifyingly wonderful. The story is interesting and keeps you playing to figure out more about it. The music is brilliant and adds to every aspect of the game. For anyone who likes the horror genre, or doesn't mind it and likes a unique plot and story, I would totally recommend it.
1836	Not a really scary game, but it has very suspensful moments and a creepy atmosphere.
1837	Slightly dated, but still very intense...
1838	The graphics feel dated, but your fear will be very current. I wasn't able to play past the first chapter - I'm such a softie :-)
1839	Not as scary as Amnesia, but still good in terms of puzzles, plot, and playability.
1840	Short(5hrs), but has great puzzles. Ending doesn't answer any questions though. Pick it up if under 5$
1841	Better than Amnesia as when an enemy comes at you, you have the option of clubbing it to death with a hammer.
1842	Penumbra: Overture - The start of Frictional's legacy at the forefront of the horror-adventure genre.
1843	Great Game. fun to figure out the puzzles. story is pretty good, great scares in this one. challenges to kill a few monsters. this is part 1 go grab it and turn out the lights. 8/10
1844	This is my review for the entire Penumbra series. (Overture, Black Plague, Reqium) they go in that order. I reccomend them all, however Black Plague is definitely the best of the 3. Interesting story and setting, older game but still fun and scary.
1845	If you're going to get Penumbra: Black Plague, I highly suggest you play this one first. The stories are directly linked, and this game itself is a lot of fun. Great horror games from this company, even if they do follow the same basic formula. It's a formula that works and works well. The Penumbra games are great horror games.
1846	Very atmopsheric and creepy. A few frustrating moments. The first time you're running away from a group of [spoilers] is tense, scary and inspires panic. The tenth time you've done so after dying each time is just frustrating :o/   The 'no looking at the monsters whilst hiding lest you panic' mechanic is very good but spoiled by the fact that it's not too hard to kill the monsters once you get the hand of using the pickaxe (a mechanic that's initially somewhat frustrating)  Overall, play Amnesia first. If you want more after that, play this.  Also, don't play if you're an arachnophobe :oP
1847	Disturbing, even jumpy at times. Very desolate-feeling. It's you against the natural environment (and its life-forms), old machinery, and a bizarre guide. Wonderful game engine, physics and light. Great sound too (scary).
1848	The first of the Penumbra series and developer Fritcional Games' first commercial foray into their unique brand of horror, Overture gets the mood and sense of isolation right from the start. Your quest to discover the fate of your father in a secret base under the Greenland wastes becomes a struggle to survive a living nightmare, and if this kind of horror is for you, you'll absolutely love it.  By far and away the biggest problem is the ease with which you can bludgeon most monsters to death, immediately rendering them unthreatening. Luckily, it's entirely possible (though much harder) to play the entire game without killing anything, and this need to remain hidden or face certain death infinitely ups the fear factor. The sequel, Black Plague, fixes this problem without needing to play in a particular way, but Overture can be just as terrifying with only a bit of conscious effort.  Highly recommended and the game that got me into horror.  From the developer of Amnesia!
1849	It's the year 2000. Going against the wishes of a letter appearing to have been written posthumously by the father you never knew, you venture to the far-off, icy reaches of Greenland to discover a terrible secret. In perfect isolation, you have no one but yourself and your own wits to rely on as you creep through the mazelike underground tunnels of a forgotten outpost, abandoned 30 years before... and as you bypass obstructions and make your way deeper and deeper into the dangerous warren, you discover that you may not be alone, and that there's no turning back.
1850	Very good horror adventure game, predecessor to their newest title Amnesia. I finished all 3 games in Penumbra series, and they are really thrilling and compelling. Best played at night in the dark, quite room!
1851	Amazing game, great story. Wish I could forget the story and play again.
1852	Best game of its genre to date. Except the Sequel, Black Plague is a little better - for you HAVE NO WEAPONS! Enjoy the intense sense of dread creeping in on you? Good - then buy this.
1853	Made by the same people who made Amnesia, the Penumbra series is first person horror. These games have a much bigger emphasis on puzzles than Amnesia, but I'll leave it up to you whether you want to take that as a pro or con. Overture wasn't THAT scary, but you'll want to play it to properly prepare yourself for Black Plague.  Black Plague as in... the next game, not like... y'know, the ACTUAL plague.
1854	freaky adventure/horror game. The puzzles weren't too difficult which made the game enjoyable without a walkthrough. Good graphics, good sound ambience, and a good job at freaky me out during certain parts. The story leaves you with more questions at the end though. Recommend playing it at night, lights off, and wearing headphones.
1855	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, don't buy this. Well... it runs on Linux fairly well?  only got this in the humble bundle so not a real loss.
1856	Penumbra: Overture is a wonderfully dark adventure game based under the frozen tundra of Greenland. If trekking through the deep, dank, and dreary unknown to find your supposedly long dead father and uncover what secrets he asked you burn all evidence of speaks to your inner adventurer, then you'll love this atmospheric adventure thriller from Frictional Games. Penumbra: Overture scares up a 3.9 out of 5.
1857	Frictional Games' first outing. A classic in my opinion and it made Frictional a dev I'll buy games from on release day(or earlier) and have no problem paying full price.  It's not your traditional FPS. There is some shooting but the idea is to keep confrontation to a minimum and just run the hell away from everything because it's so freaking scary that simply staring at the monsters for too long will drive you insane. There are some pretty unique action controls that you probably haven't seen in an FPS before. Some of it is awkward to get the hang of but it all ends up making sense just as SOMETHING IS BEHIND YOU FFS RUUUUUUN!  &lt;3 Frictional Games.
1858	The Penumbra series is one of the only horror series left in modern gaming - story driven, challenging, dark, and believe it or not, scary. People call Doom, F.E.A.R., Dead Space, and Resident Evil 4-5 horror games even though they're no more than just shooters. If you're looking for something more authentic and deep, then give Penumbra a try. Remember to play them at night.
1859	If you search an original yet good horror game, this is it. It can run on almost every machine, it's not a system hog.
1860	Certainly bound to give you chills down your spine, raise your heartbeat and force you to make some noise. Definitely a game worth getting if you enjoy horror and a good story.
1861	Penumbra: Overture is certainly one of the best, scariest, most immersive and claustrophobic games I've ever played. Excelent story and soundtrack.
1862	Absolutely loved this game - probably one of the best survival horror games out there right now. For fans of Penumbra I'd recommend the Condemned game series.
1863	It's an ok game. Its not amazing, or very scary but its a unique puzzle game that is very interesting. Not extremely hard, which is a good thing, the story is decent though the game isn't very long. Not a bad game but not worth more then a few bucks. Still, worth playing for a days worth of puzzle, adventure, entertainment.
1864	A great game that acts as the prequel to the amnesia style games. horror set on an island exclusively alone for some time at least.
1865	To start: I used to add a longer header describing my reviewing ethos, but it made some reviews too long to submit, so I've left it on my Backloggery page.  Gameplay: Odds are that if you're looking at this game, you've played the Amnesia games. They're pretty much one and the same, these series. In fact, there's such a high probability that you've played Amesia or at least seen Amnesia that I'm not going to bother going into too much depth as far as the gameplay goes. Instead, I'll just keep things shorter and compare and contrast the two. For starters, both games have an emphasis on hiding from enemies, since combat is kinda spotty at best. However, that's by design, so there's not much point whinging about that. Unlike Amnesia, you don't have to worry about sanity. The screen just goes all wibbly whenever you look at the enemy. All in all, there's three things you've gotta worry about: puppies, carnivorous spiders, and the worm. The puppies will patrol the area, but you can distract them with bits of beef jerky... sometimes. It doesn't work all the time, though; even if you've got a whole pile of jerky in front of the dog. The other two you just run away from.  Puzzles are, again, very akin to Amnesia. There were a few puzzles that were kinda annoying or suffered from 90's Adventure Syndrome, but they're generally pretty alright. You can brute force a few puzzles; a favorite solution to one where you have to knock down a ladder is to build a tower of barrels. Yes, that works. I'm still surprised that it works. There wasn't really anything that blew me away as far as clever puzzle design, though. It's just pretty run of the mill puzzle design.  As far as the atmosphere goes, Amesia wins by a LONG shot. There really weren't any gripping moments for me in this game. It's not bad, and to someone who's more susceptible to horror than I am, it might be quite a thrill. However, the game didn't grab me in the same way that Amnesia did. Then again, this is the first episode of the Penumbra series; maybe Black Plague can step it up a few notches. 6/10.  Story: It's a pretty typical supernatural-based story. I can tell a lot of the questions the game brought up (that I didn't find myself asking, actually; the game kinda shoved the questions down my throat) are gonna be answered in later installments, but for just the first game, I didn't find myself really caring all that much. Red should have been a lot creepier of a character, but he was more of an annoyance than anything else. At the end, I didn't feel pity; I just felt relief that I wouldn't have to hear his stereotypical rambling. Also, just because your game is episodic, that doesn't mean that you've gotta have a cliffhanger. It only works if you're really invested in the series. Otherwise, it just seems silly. Oh well; at least they got better at writing by Amnesia. 5/10.  Graphics: I'm quite impressed that they were able to do this much in only a ~300MB download. All of the textures look pretty good, the worlds are pretty well made, and everything just looks pretty good. Too bad that the mine environment didn't allow for much on the art style front. Enemies aren't really too interesting art design-wise, either. Certainly nothing as discomforting as Mr. No-Jaw-McGee. It does get kinda boring looking at mine section after mine section after mine section, but I guess that couldn't be helped. The game will run at 1080p easily, and I'd imagine that if you have any graphics card whatsoever, you should be able to run this game without any problems. For a fair bit of technical finesse from an indie team with an unfortunately lacking art direction, I'll give it a 3/5.  Sound: Frictional has always been pretty good at sound design. While this isn't their best example of sound design capabilities, it is still a good show. It does get a bit silly and overdone at times, but for the most part, it does a pretty good job at setting the atmosphere. As far as the voice actor (singular; Red is pretty much the only one), it wasn't bad. It's only bad that his dialogue made me get rather tired of him fast. As far as the music, there really isn't much. It does set the mood, though, so I guess there's that. 4/5.  Overall scores are: 6/5/3/4; cumulative score of 5.7/10. Overall a pretty middling surivival horror game. Hopefully Black Plague picks up the pace.
1866	cool game with a creepy atmosphere. its only downfall is that it's too short.
1867	Great game, brilliant story! I'd reccomend to play the game in Hard for a real immersive experience.
1868	Unique game unlike anything I have played. Will put fear back into you.
1869	When it comes to horor, i'm a little girl. This game scared the crap out of me, but if you like scary this may be the game for you.
1870	There oughta be a law against playing this game with the lights on. This is the first of a three-part series of games made by the guys who would then go on to make Amnesia, and the games are very similar (although completely unrelated, plot-wise). Definitely pick this up if you want a dark (literally and figuratively), claustrophobic, tense experience. Oh...and just because you technically get something you can use as a weapon...yeah, good luck using it that way, let me know how that works out for you. :)
1871	Horror and old-school adventure at its finest. Don't miss it! Play with the lights off and the sound up as loud as you dare.
1872	Puzzle horror games always beat with story line. This game MUST be played at night with low lighting to create better scary atmosphere. The game gets less scary as you understand how to kill the dogs and spiders. Its a game that kempt me on my wits with parts tobe slow and stelthy and some that require a good, 'arh,,, run!' One game i will not forget anytime soon.
1873	This is the scariest game I have ever played. Seriosly it does everything so well: the atmosphere (including background audio), the story (including the felling of absolute loneliness while still having very interesting NPC), the setting (sooo claustrophobic), the puzzles (often based on physics) and so on. The only gripe I've got is the terrible fighting mechanic; which they luckily abandoned in future installments.
1874	That was some damned creepy â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1875	I would give this game a 10/10.   Even Though it is not as scary as other games by frictional it still creeps you out because of the strange atmosphere  Also very suspensful
1876	I couldn't put this game down easily once I started it as bit by bit the Vast, enthralling story began to open itself to me through the long abandoned notes left behind within the games world. If you want a good, chilling story and abit of horror to accompany it, this is the game for you. Not so much a scary game (has some jumps occaisionally) as a sensible puzzle game through an abandoned arctic mining complex. PLAY IT.
1877	Turn left, there is a dog. Turn around, there is a dog. Turn right, another fu**ing dog. Get away from the dogs, only to be greeted by fu**ing thousandsa of spiders.  10/10 would throw more rocks at dogs.
1878	I got scared of the dogs as a kid. Now I can kill them.
1879	This game is worth the money it costs. The way it immerses you into the game is amazing. It was so shocking and/or scary at times that I nearly pooped myself.
1880	This is most definently worth playing just so you can understand the second one.
1881	This game got really confusing at times, so far that I had to use the internet sometimes to get through a puzzle. However, awesome game, really immersive. I'm sad that it's over!
1882	Casually playing game without problems while killing dogs with pick axe  Comes to a railway cart that in order to use you must have metal cuters   checks inventory   no metal cutters   looks up online how to get them   turns out they are near the begining of them game   uninstall
1883	now THIS is a true horror game. I love everything about it, the atmosphere and story really immerse you. The creatures/monsters are horrifying intense moments that can really make you panic puzzles and other stuff.  If you love great horror games this is a must-have! 9.2/10
1884	I'm gonna be honest here. This was one of the first games I ever bought on Steam back in 2011. Being an idiot, I never really got past it. Well, I decided to sit down this weekend and try and actually finish it. Wasn't hard. I did it.   Penumbra: Overture is a good game. As a horror game, eh...  For someone who hasn't really played horror games all that much, this was a pretty ok start.   Penumbra follows the adventures of a young man as he travels to Greenland upon his dead father's request. When he gets there, a storm hits and he is forced to take shelter in an old mine. Bad idea, as the mine has it's own little messed up histrory.   Pros: -Interesting story -Decent graphics -Very atmospheric -Pretty ok puzzles (especially for people not good at them)  Cons: -Not very scary when you can just kill the enemies...  Really thats it. The enemies can be killed pretty easily and early on. It really kills the mood and prevents it from being a great horror game  Rating: 8/10 
1885	&gt; be me, professor pimienta &gt; pimienta open hatch &gt; creepyatmosphere.jpeg &gt; pimienta do puzzles &gt; pimienta see dog, pimienta hate dog, bad XPerience &gt; lots of dogs, little pepper &gt; shivers &gt; pimienta hate this &gt; great professor pimienta suffers through dog horror &gt; against all odds pimienta complete game &gt; creepy ending fails to impress because no dogs &gt; pimienta still scared tho  11.5/10 sliced jalapenos. would never play again.
1886	The story itself is well organised and logic. The beginning may give an impression that it's quite a complicated game and may scare you the most. The idea of sets of corridors connecting different places is interesting when it comes to live but unless you want to keep dogs alive it becomes quite boring and may discourage players. Then comes the end which I was really impressed with. Parts where it's needed to think quickly make the game even more awesome, really. Overall it's a good experiance also for former Amnesia players looking for a similar game.
1887	very much recommend this to anyone who likes horror/puzzle type games..imho overture is the 2nd best out of the penumbra seris
1888	creepy atmosphere and good mechanics make this game a fun play! great start to the trilogy, fun trying to figure out where to go and what to do next, 6/10
1889	havent goten far into it yet but so far its thrilling and gets the mind working!
1890	Enjoyed the game, but personally do not think it was scary, more of a psychological thriller in my opinion. With that said, the story and gameplay is well done and wanted to play black plague right after.
1891	I highly recommend this game. It's the forerunner to Amnesia, and I think the more interesting game. I like the plot better, the location is also more interesting. Make sure you get all three acts, because it's not until the end that the developers really figure out how to do everything right, and it's fun to see their progression as you get more and more terrified. Great plot, horrifying gameplay, nice puzzles.
1892	A predecessor to the (in)famous Amnesia, Penumbra is a diamond in the rough that incites fear through storytelling and some fine voice acting rather than the overuse of jump-scares and B-movie cliches. What results from this great narrative is a short but truly discomorting game where the fear comes from the pervading sense of dread as you delve deeper venture the mine and uncover more of its backstory.   Though this game is dated in appearance, anyone who found Amnesia to be entertaining will likely feel at home with this game, with the physics based puzzles and Frictional's unique take on horror first established here. After nearly 8 years it still stands strong.
1893	Awsome Horror, scary game with lots of puzzels
1894	Made me appreciate the versatility of rocks and string 10/10
1895	'The Penumbra Series' was created by Frictional Games. As many know, they are the creaters of the none-stop famous 'Amnesia Series'. I first started off with 'Amnesia The Dark Decent', then 'Amnesia A Machine For Pigs'before ever playing Penumbra. I haven't seen any play throughs on Penumbra (nore Amnesia at the time) because I love to be suprised, and love to figure things out myself. With Penumbra, it take almost if not EXACTLY the same game mechanics as Amnesia! Just slightly different in very VERY small ways. And with that being said, that's not a bad thing! I know I may be a tad bit late to review this game since it's been out for quite sometime. I haven't even beaten the game just yet, but I am pretty far, and already I love it! I am thankful that Frictional games takes a good notice at their Mac users (cause i'm a Mac user) and gaming on my Macbook Pro isn't that bad at all. The game runs fairly smooth, and doesn't lag at all. I am impressed with the Story Line as well (which I think most people don't care about in these Phsychological Horror Games.) The story is one thing that makes these games what they are! Very mystical, quite a few jump scares here and there, and it's even better when all lights are off. I have yet to play the other ones (which I did purchase) and am so anxious! I would recomend this game to any Horror Game fan, or someone who just flat out wants a good scare here and there, with a few mid to hard puzzles to solve. I would give this game a 10/10.
1896	A little clunky and tedious at times but captures the madness expertly.
1897	A indie horror game by the creators of Amnesia. I suggest this to anyone who likes Amnesia
1898	This was a great experience.. there were a couple of spots that made me want to hit my head against the wall, but they were well worth putting up with (and probably only added to the experience even more so, in the long-run.)
1899	Be sure to download 'Necrologue' (amnesia mod) if you like this, it is a new episode of Penumbra.
1900	Aside from some bugs this and the following conclusive chapter Black Plague are solid games, sure they might feel a bit low budget but there aren't many games that can quite match this game in creating an suspenseful atmoshphere, and making you want to progress deeper so you can see what the game has in store for you next.
1901	it's cool and all :PPPP
1902	Great game exept for the dogs â¥â¥â¥â¥ thise â¥â¥â¥â¥ers
1903	Great fun, not as good as Amnesia though.
1904	Maybe it's because I've been so spoiled playing Amnesia Dark Descent and Outlast... but this game only spooked me a little bit. The puzzles and figuring out things was fun... but the creatures among the puzzles were just annoying after a while. A couple things did take me by surprise, but over all... I was kind of disappointed.  Story line? 'oh where is everyone? oh what happened to my dad? oh what are these weird lanterns? oh how do i get out'  I finished this game in under 6 hours.  Bug report: early on in the game I had my grab/interact mouse disappear on me. Had to restart.  Controlling was very easy for the most part. Keyboard and mouse. The ONE thing that bothered me the most was having to shake my mouse like an idiot just to swing a hammer or a pick-axe. -.-  Motionsickness? Yes, unfortunately. I think the repetative tight corridors and looking around for clues is what did me in.  Would I recommend this? Well... maybe. I don't know. Personally, if you want a game not as scary as Amnesia DD, then sure... but if you are really looking for loads of OH GOD MY HEART! then... I'd actually say skip it. o_o  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. it just wasn't great.  I think maybe I will recommend if you're kind of looking for a horror game to quickly pass the time OR if you scare really easily. Just maybe get it on sale.  Here is hoping Penumbra Black Plague will be scarier.
1905	Great horror game, awesome scares, amazing atmosphere, overall a great game like the other penumbra games.
1906	Its a pretty fun game i didnt have any real issues playing through it the only issues i have with it is the fact that the settings dont save so i have to redo my settings every time i got on but thats not much trouble and the game is pretty short i beat it the same day i got it but still the story is a bit confusing but i love the ending it is completely unexpected
1907	Penumbra: Overture is an interesting journey ripe with atmosphere. Though I wouldn't call it 'scary,' there are some redeeming factors that I believe make it worth one playthrough.  To see a more detailed review, please visit:  http://breakingcanon.com/games/penumbra-overture/ 
1908	Penumbra is a great and very athmospheric adventure serious. A must play.
1909	Sheer terror in this most thrilling of ways :P Amaaaazing! &lt;3 10/10
1910	the most classic horor indie game... the dog aint scary, the ending guys scareed the shyite out of me!!
1911	I've tried playing but there's a bug in the game! I can't seem to move the shelves ! Can someone help me please ?
1912	Old and dated graphics aside, the environment is extremely immersive, very well paced and very worthwhile challenge. Its a true series, each game picks up where the last game ends. We need more games like this.   Simply put, the Penumbra series is awesome. Play all 3 games, you wont be disappointed.me.
1913	Clunky combat, but really that almost adds to the game. Everything else is pretty cool.
1914	One of the scariest games I've ever played
1915	I've played this game before, at least I think I have. I don't know if there's a glitch or it's me but I cannot get the contol panel in the Refinery to work. I get no hand icon. Would I recommend it, yep if I can figure out what I'm going wrong.
1916	Creepy little crawler. Story keeps you intrigued, but the ending is a let down. 3/5 slugs.
1917	Never thought I would be this scared. Also have equal amount of frustration. First time playing a Frictional game, spent 40 minutes, still can't get the hang of any of the controls, and not a single enemy has spawned yet. I literally died twice because i couldn't turn the damn wheel. #noobof2015  Thinking of I should even continue, my brain legit hurts after playing this 1 time.  Horror fans or picking a horror game for the first time? Try this it's worth the shock. Should I even try Amnesia, I have zero idea, some say this is still the scariest production out of all Frictional Games.
1918	Not the greatest game by itself, but the series is very good. The story in Ouverture is good and the bad combat is worth dealing with to play the series as a whole.
1919	I swear to god, this is the scariest series ever, the only reason it didnt scare me as much as black plague (Which is less scary), is because i got stuck on many of the puzzles, also it's not as creepy in the beginning, it gets scarier and scarier... and then you tense up so hard you become constipated for a week. [true story]
1920	another great spooks
1921	Penumbra: Overture is the first release from Frictional Games, which went on to make some of the best horror games in history: Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA. Itâs always interesting to go back and see where famous and talented developers got their start, and Penumbra is no exception. Now, I will admit that Iâm not a big fan of horror, or being scared in general, but I played through this game and I can appreciate it for what it is. Penumbra was originally planned to be a trilogy, but after the release of the second chapter, titled Black Plague, the planned third chapter was instead turned into an expansion. I havenât played Black Plague, but Overture stands well on its own.  The game starts with you receiving a letter from the main character, Philip. He urges you not to follow him and ends with an ominous thought, âIf we are lucky, then by the time you receive this, I will be dead. If fate frowns, we all perish.â You play the game through Philipâs eyes, as he himself receives a letter from his supposedly-dead father, and follows its directions to an abandoned WWII mine in northern Greenland. Follow Philip as he delves deeper and deeper into the mine, where almost as soon as he arrives, he realises something is very wrong. What he thought was just an abandoned outpost is instead a twisting maze of tunnels, each section full of weirder and more disturbing revelations than the last.  This is a game that relies not on jump scares and combat, though those do exist. Penumbra is full of what makes Frictionalâs games so truly terrifying: existential horror, and it makes you really uncomfortable in your own skin. Youâll get good insight into Philipâs mind through text overlays on screen of his reaction to events. Cheap but effective. An interesting feature that supports the immersive atmosphere is the physics engine. To open a drawer, you donât just click on it like in other games. You actually click-and-drag the handle. To swing a hammer in self-defense, or to break down a barricade, you donât click or hit a keyboard button. You drag your mouse across the whole screen in the direction you want to swing. This design gives a very heavy, tactile feel to the world youâre in, making you feel much more engaged and connected to the story. Which is critical for horror games. In a brilliant design choice, Philip isnât a soldier, and he doesnât act like it. Combat is difficult, unwieldy, and largely ineffective. Catch sight of a mangy dog, for example, will cause Philipâs breathing to become heavy, and heâll start to panic. You can feel his terror as he prays for the dog to not turn this way, please no, IT SAW ME, RUN! The past few years have seen many games with this conceit, that youâre just an ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances, but Penumbra was one of the first.  Frictional Games are very well aware that less is more in the horror genre. Youâll read a note about giant spiders, and instead of getting chased down a corridor, fighting your way out, your only path is to crawl into a hole in the floor, hearing scratches and scrapes just out of sight. But you wonât interact with a single spider, not yet anyway. Run across a dog, and as you desperately hide behind a crate, youâll hear its breathing as it sniffs for you. The sound effects are top notch, really deepening the sense of danger. Doors creak as they open, Philipâs breathing and footsteps are loud enough to wake the dead, or at least youâd think so when youâre trying to hide from some unseen flesh-devouring beast. The graphics are a little dated by todayâs standards, but theyâre not too shabby for an indie game from 2007. The game only consists of a 334MB download, so it is understandable that there are only a few textures in the game: wood, stone, metal, and rock, with some slight variations. The lighting is where atmosphere is really made, though. It is almost impossible to see without using either your flashlight (which constantly drains battery) or your glowstick, which covers everything in an unearthly green. Many games would have flickering lights spread all throughout this abandoned mine, but Frictional is smarter than that. Why would there be working lights down here, when no oneâs been here in 30 years?  As you explore deeper and deeper, youâll begin receiving messages from someone calling themselves Red. Your only companion is this odd voice that guides you through the tunnels, the one piece of normalcy in this cave of monsters. You can see similarities to Bioshock in this regard. A minor nitpick I have with the game is something most horror games struggle with. Failure (i.e. death) resets you to your last checkpoint, at which youâll realize you know whatâs coming. So whatever set piece they had intended to terrify you instantly loses its impact. After a while, youâll start playing it like a game, trying to run past the stupid dog and finish your objective, not worrying about dying anymore. The instant death loses meaning, is the instant the gameâs atmosphere gives out.  Without spoiling the ending, let me tell you that the choices you have to make at the end of the game are both horrifying and inevitable. The cliffhanger that the game ends on sets up the sequel, but I do not think it is necessary to play. Itâs scarier if you donât know what happens next.  So Penumbra: Overture is an engaging, immersive game. Even as a wussy non-fan of horror, my curiosity got the better of me and I overcame my fears to explore this mineâs deadly secrets. It was enjoyable, if unnerving. Satisfying, but unsettling. And I suppose thatâs what a horror game should be. Great work, Frictional Games.
1922	At first I thought it was going to be a first-person point-and-click so I got excited. But I soon learned the horrifying truth... that this would be a horror game! Environmental hazards, item puzzles, confusion, darkness and fear of the unknown... I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.
1923	Perhaps not as scary as Amnesia, but still contains a creepy atmosphere and the music is sick. Worth playing for fun in a dark room ;)
1924	I'm not into horror games that much, but damnit this game is so good. Really interesting story, cool puzzles, pretty spooky. Combat sucks though, good thing the sequel got rid of that. Amnesia is a spiritual successor to this series and I honestly think that game is the best horror game I've played, but the Penumbra series is still pretty damn good. Get this and Black Plague (skip on Requiem if you're not into puzzles and no horror) and play them.
1925	Its a amazing game when you get chased by dogs and your able to kill them.
1926	Another wondeful gaming experience. (TL DR VERSION BELOW!)  Penumbra: Overture is not properly a game as we are used to play, is more like an immersion into deep abyss of horror and mistery.  This is to say you are not buying this game for his gameplay, his longevity or his action. If you played Amnesia, Soma or the other Penumbra you know what I'm meaning. If you don't, well think twice before buying it even if the price is low. Those kind of game are not much appreciated by the average gamer who looks for a couple or more hour of FUN. When you buy Penumbra you want to live a different experience, a journey into mistery and creepy stuff. It's quite short, graphic are still ok in my opinion if you don't mind too much (you don't really have to if you are wishing to play this graphic are the least thing to mind)   When you finish it you feel that feeling of satisfaction as you survived a 7hrs trip into this game. It's something games like Fallout,Skyrim or whatever call of duty or battlefield could never give to you. Even if they might be good games, they are nothing in terms of deepness and peculiarity.   TL DR:  PROS -Atmosphere, deepness, peculiarity, horror. You really are yourself as a normal human being would, trying to escape from a mine, you don't fight unless if really you have to (and you will die trying), you don't have superpower. Only your mind and your notes. That's it.  CONS -Only English language, it's not a problem if you are reading this but there is a lot of stuff to read if you want to understand more the story, and even some dialogue with the only human (?) you 'meet' are quite hard to follow because it's not a simple english. I really had some problems too as is not my mother tongue.
1927	Overture and Black Plague are two halves of the same game. Overture is part 1, Black Plague is part 2. The second part is a direct continuation and has the same game mechanics/gameplay (except a few minor differences) so this review is for both games.   First of all I rate this 9/10. Part 1 has terrible combat and that's the only reason it's not a 10/10. Luckily the devs seemed to realize how bad the combat was and completely axed it in part 2, so like Amnesia you must run from or outwit monsters instead of engaging them.  Overture is primarily a puzzle solver. It's not too scary, but it does have a creepy atmosphere. What I love about Frictional Games is that their puzzles are very sensible, although there were a few here that had me really confused. Part of the problem is that you have to destroy your environment sometimes, but there's no indication which objects are destructble and which aren't- and sometimes you have monsters on your heels, so it's hard to look around and search the environment to figure out what to do before you die.  Black Plague is where the game starts to get really interesting. It has an AMAZING story, and in addition to good puzzles (less environment destroying in this one) the setting is truly horrific. Amnesia didn't scare me, but this game did. It doesn't even use cheap pop-ups, (well a few) instead relying on music/sounds and unsettling atmosphere. Psychological horror at its finest.  The story is intensely engaging. You will care about the friends/family the protagonist (Phillip) encounters in his journey. There are many sad moments. But the true meat of the plot lies in an ancient mystery you will slowly unravel as you discover the many notes, books, and strange artifacts strewn throughout the mining/research facility. The ending is satisfying in that it gives you the answers you seek and doesn't leave you hanging, although I was somewhat disapointed that you appear to be presented with a choice, yet your character can only make one in the end.
1928	Great game with a pretty amazing plot. Can be quite â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrifying at times, really embodies a good survival horror game.
1929	I really enjoyed all 3 games, although sometimes the direction is vague it's a classic worth a playthrough. It's not Amnesia but a good series none the less.
1930	Warning: don't play it on hard as I did. The game just scales enemy's heath and decrease yours to a 'glass state' (two hits kill). Play it on normal, and you will have a balanced chalenge.  This is a slow pace, first person thriller game. There are some readings, but nothing like a RPG.  The interactivity with objects is nicely done and, despite the limitation of the game's engine, the physics is realistic to the point of believability. For example, you lift, drag, pull objects with movements of your mouse.  The atmosphere transports you to a depressed world, somewhat like the first Silent Hill.  Runs great in Ultrawide (2560 x 1080), Windows 10 (64bit).   A must play to all hardcore single players fans of terror or suspense.
1931	Really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good horror/puzzle game, like Amnesia's son.  But you will probally end up Googling some â¥â¥â¥â¥ up to be completely honest; or i'm probally just â¥â¥â¥â¥ at puzzle games.
1932	This is going to be a hard review. I wish I could be neutral about it, but due to Steams review mechanics I will have to reach a verdict at the end. Oh boy. Please read carefully, especially my conclusion!  Lets talk about the atmospheric, story-driven experience you are going to get out of this first. Though graphically not top-notch given the year the game was released it sets up a great, intimidating and believable atmosphere with a mysterious touch to it. Great sound assest, brilliant light effects and decent level design regarding maze-like interiors. Aesthetically everything falls into place when you consider the fact that you are   an explorer   going   down into a mine   to find secrets   your father   left behind. The story, while a little bit predictable, is told very well and involves the player in it.  Mechanics. It is Frictional Games' first game which set a milestone in story telling gaming, which is wonderful. Not so wonderful is the fighting system, which is forced upon you   when encountering enemies, like dogs or spiders  . It is not like in Games like Half-Life where you bash your enemies' heads in with your crowbar while still being able to evade their attacks - no! You have to swing your melee weapons with your mouse and you control it directionally, meaning that you can swing either side: left, right, or direct push. Problem is, that your screen locks when you try to swing, so you are unable to move. This is obviously not a good idea and you might think, that it encourages sneaking. And yes, at first that is the case - but soon you are not able to avoid encounters and you will have to brawl your way through, which is frustrating in a great way. This is a big negative, since it is practically forced upon the player and you have almost no way of avoiding it or finding a way around fighting - and you will come across those situations regularly.  Other mechanics work quite well. Puzzle solving is a bit tricky at times given the dated graphics, especially texture quality. For example: You find a key and don't know where to put it? It might be that pixely black mess of a texture on a control panel! This makes it quite complicated and it could use some sort of indicator, but well, it works somehow. Certainly, patience is required.   Conclusion  IF, only if you can withstand a large amount of depressing forced and flawed combat (I guarantee you that you will shut your game off multiple times!) and live for excellent atmosphere in every aspect, I can recommend this game. This game shows you why Amnesia was/is such a big success as THE atmospherically overwhelming and best written game up to this day (haven't played SOMA yet). Play Penumbra and - if you played later games of FG like Amnesia - you will experience an immersive adventure putting you through a relentless environment.  Recommendation? I shouldn't, because it forces those combat sequences on you like crazy. But I have to considering the artistic part of the game, which takes a greater part than combat. If you really have doubts about the ever returning bad combat system, just read up on the plot and continue with the second game without playing this one. That's basically the workaround.
1933	This is one of the finest games of the survivial horror genere. I was first introduced to this game by a youtuber named Helloween4545. I fell in love with the game when I watched him play it and the love grew stronger when I experienced the evil demon dogs and nasty spiders for myself. This is a game that doesn't hold your hand, but in a good way. I give the game a soilid 8/10. It would get the prestigious 10 if it wasn't for the length and combat. In my opinion the game was a tad short, and the combat is terrible. *hint*, when foghting the dogs just stand on a box or barrel and hit them, you'll be too high to be hit.
1934	The good old survival horror. 7/10  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1co4uDC7i7I 
1935	Penumbra Overture is a great little horror game. It is plain to see that it is a predecessor of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. There are many similarities within the imagery, gameplay and storytelling. For Amnesia fans seeking more content, this series is definitely worth playing.   The setting, an underground mine, allows for a certain amount of isolation and otherworldliness. I am not claustrophobic at all and didn't find the envrionments particularly scary, but I can appreciate that it is an eerie setting. I enjoyed the feeling of being deep within the ground.  At times the game reminded me of John Carpenter's The Thing, one of my favorite films.  The game would have benefited from far fewer enemies. They can be easily killed but the controls make it time consuming and frustrating. Killing enemies became repetitive and felt like a chore, but it was a necessary evil... it didn't make any sense to waste time sneaking back and forth repeatedly in the hub environments when the enemies are so easily killed.  The storytelling was very well done. Most information is gathered through found writings. The writings were extremely effective at building the world and adding tension to the game. Generally I was excited to find a new note to read, with a morbid curiosity of what information I would discover.  The controls are somewhat clunky and finicky. For the most part it doesn't affect gameplay because you can explore at your leisure. Perhaps it adds to the fear when you are fumbling around in a hurry.  There are scripted sequences where it becomes a problem. This is because a certain amount of precision is required and the clumsy controls don't allow for that easily. Add to that a healthy dose of guesswork. I was disappointed when I had to replay scripted sequences 4-5 times trial-and-error style. That type of frustration is the fastest way to break immersion and remove all fear from the situation.  There is no manual save and the auto-saves are far apart considering how easy it is to die. I have been spoiled by newer games, but it was really annoying the few times I died and lost a bunch of progress. Minor gripe!  I came to the Penumbra series as a fan of The Dark Descent, looking for a similar horror experience. Overture is obviously not as polished as The Dark Descent but it is well worth playing. I am glad I was able to do a blind playthrough and have another great experience courtesy of Frictional Games.  Replay value is not really there for me. This is only due to the controls and the repetitive enemy encounters. The game itself isn't something I will soon forget. Great ending! I'm looking forward to the next game, Black Plague. From what I hear it's even better than Overture.
1936	Really short, somewhat clumsy controls and not as polished as Amnesia, but still I liked this a lot. Very absorbing, exciting and functioning game considering it being the first game of Frictional Games. If you liked Amnesia, you most probably will like Penumbras too. I'm SO going to buy Black Plague too in the near future.
1937	Descent game considering how old it is. Got the collectors pack for $2...well worth it!
1938	I've seen a lot of criticism directed towards this game due to the combat systen. This is a survival horror, it should be difficult to fight back against enemies, and it should make you feel like avoiding them is the best option. This game does that perfectly. The physics in this game are fantastic, the puzzle solving feels very intuitive, and the narrative is gripping. The game doesn't rely on traditional jump scares, instead it utilizes it's environment, the exposition of the story, and the constant fear of what may be following you. This game is honeslty more than worth it's price, and it's a concise game. Well worth playing for any horror fans.
1939	Too spooky for me
1940	I am in love with Penumbra: Overture, mainly for it's foreboding atmosphere and ambience. I'd say that some of the puzzles, however, were tricky to figure out on my first run. But the one thing I'd say was just bad about this game is the combat mechanics. Simply put, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was horrible and clunky as hell, so I ended up trying to avoid the enemies, instead of putting up a fight.  I mean, other than that, I'd recommend this game.
1941	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I played Amnesia, read that this was the predecessor, but Amnesia is a few order of magnitude above this crap.   The start is enought to make you shake your head - you start by leaving a boat, you go somewhere into the snowy wastelands, you're minutes from freezing to death, but you randomly find a hatch into the relevant mine. Noone was there for years, but the hatch is accessible and you manage to get in...  After exploring a bit inside, you get into a room and you character tells you to bar the door, in case the demon dog thingy prowling there cpmes in behind you. So you drag a huge barrel to the door, place a heavy stone or two on top and the dog simply smashes all of it to pieces. And here's when I stopped. You see, in Amnesia, you have no possibility to kill the monsters, you can only hide. But the point is, hiding works, unlike this â¥â¥â¥â¥. You have a hammer in your inventory with which you can, in theory, kill the dog. But swining the hammer is so awful, you can barely smash a crate. As a combat mechanic, is completely and utterly useless. If you can't hide from the dog and you can't fight the dog, the only thing you can di is uninstall.
1942	Really good game, the story is interesting and it gets deeper as you progress. Making you feel like theres something to be done. The horror is also good, has some suspense too.
1943	This game is a very errie and spooky. It's music and the events that happen and just the enviroment really make this game great. I enjoyed it a lot and proabably be playing the next one
1944	Are you currently experiencing constipation? Well, you might have just found the solution to your problem! Playing this game in a pitch dark room with your speaker volume cranked up will make your digestive system work like a steam engine once again. (An overdose of the product in question may lead to involuntary discharge of various body fluids)  Use at your own risk!
1945	Dog fighting simulator. Only one annoying part, it is that it takes 10 hits with the pickaxe to kill them.
1946	i already beat this game, then this game almost stripped my insanity.  i embrace old scary spooky creepy horror games. especially this kind of survival horror and this game really top of my list for one old scary good graphic game. for a demon like me, this game really have capability to creep me the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. so its a good horror games.
1947	This series was not something that I though I would like playing but once I got started I was hooked. Found it really scary and addictive
1948	For some reason getting bitten by giant spiders doesn't make you Spiderman.  Rating: Pizza time
1949	D: The monsters are scary.
1950	Absolutely amazing, though not very scary Still has a very fascinating storyline, you should play it
1951	Immersive, great atmosphere, puzzle solving, deep mystery and spooky enemies to avoid. I played Amnesia the dark descent before this game and loved it so much always wanting more thus constantly downloading new mods. A few years later thought I'd try its predecessor and I was not dissapointed. In fact I think the thought process behind puzzle solving is deeper in this game. Now onto Black Plague!
1952	From the makers of Amnesia â The Dark Descent. There, now buy it. Oh okay, I guess Iâll say a little more. Iâm not going to ruin anything about the story, firstly because Iâm not a total jerk and secondly because I donât remember a whole lot about it. What I will say is the developer, Frictional Games, does a phenomenal job in creating a creepy atmosphere, hair-raising moments, and clever puzzles for you to solve all the while.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrY82FZKiDU   For $20, you get three Penumbra titles: Overture, Black Plague, and Requiem, which is apparently an expansion to Black Plagueâ¦so Iâm not entirely certain how thatâs supposed to work, but whatever. Iâve only played Overture (first in the series), but I was impressed enough with that, so I can definitely vouch for the others. If youâve been on the fence about Amnesia, definitely check these out so you can get an idea of what youâre in for.
1953	In terms of atmosphere this game was fantastic and really set the tone and story for the rest of the series, though I felt that it was overshadowed by the following game (Black Plague) which was incredible.   Nevertheless, this was still so much better than most other games. The fact that such a small studio produced such an excellently crafted game continues to astound me.
1954	Q: Is this a good game? A: No. This game is not good.  Q: Is this game worth playing? A: Yes.  In Inquisitor, you play as an inquistor (duh..) who were send to investigate a case of a murder in a small town. You can choose to play from 3 character, either as a paladin of the brotherhood (knight), a noble (thief) or a priest (sorcerer).  The game takes investigation and detective works seriously and does not hold your hand like modern games - there is no quest marker, only logs of quests and hints. Hints are gathered from talking to NPCs, asking them questions. Now, there is no real brain involved in gathering hints - you just talk to ALL the NPCs and eventually some clue will be uncovered. After the all the detective work, it all end to one thing: is the suspect really a heretic or just an innocent? You decide.  Convicting people under the charge of heresy need proof. Proof can be a spoken testimony from witnesses or a physical thing like a broken dagger. This detective work will involve lots of wall of texts, so be prepared to do some reading.  Inquisitor really puts you into the atmosphere and setting. You're involved in the age where heresy are on a rampant. Everyone accuses someone as a heretic. People are very suspicious to each other.  Now to the major flaw of the game. Inquisitor tries to be an RPG which is heavy on the 'talking and reading' part - immersive story and atmosphere like Planescape Torment (I never really like this game though), and tries at the same time to be an action oriented RPG with fluent combat like the Diablo series. Inquisitor fails terribly on the latter part.  Combat in Inquisitor feels like a chore. You'll be chugging potions all the time. Your equipment will be broken in the middle of a battle most of the time (if you choose difficulty other than easy). Your melee attack misses all the time and when you actually landed an attack on the enemy, you're already run out of stamina. The combat need serious rebalancing in reworked, but it is very unlikely that this game will be updated in the near future since the developers already left the game. The whole development of Inquisitor takes around 10 years.   The game is divided into 3 acts. Only the first act really impressed me since it really emphasize on the inquisition stuff and investigations. Further into the game, the game lost its momentum and instead of uncovering heretics and doing inquisition stuff, you'll need to clear several dungeons that are filled with crazy debuff inflicting monsters that are totally not enjoyable.  I think I was 80% to finishing this game until I decided that I cannot tolerate the combat anymore. Even with the major flaw Inquisitor is a game that you might not want to miss if you like old school RPG.
1955	Reporting a successful completion. It took me mind-boggling 141 hour, longer than any game so far. The ride has been excruciating at times, but mostly fun and oh-so-exciting! I thoroughly enjoyed the dark and gritty atmosphere, uncompromising and flagrant with its blood-chilling displays of human decadence. I love how rough the game is, with no immersion-breaking silliness like quest compass and highlighted levers, common to many modern 'streamlined' titles. Instead, this game targets the no-nonsense old-school player that does not expect to be spoon-fed. And it is glorious. The general sense of paranoia and imminent doom permeate at all times, and feel rather genuine. This is something few titles can be proud of. The writing is top-notch, the look and feel befitting, the difficulty finally done right. The setting and system are original, so you'll see no fireball spells, Dwarfs, Elves and other utterly overused and abused tropes.  On the other hand, numerous problems exist, spearheaded by the occasionally unpleasant amount of filler-content. Additionally, there is a visible lack of progression in rewards - items you get in the first Act are the best in the game. It doesn't help that items are randomly spec'd making them feel ultimately unimaginative and underwhelming. There is also a visible lack of low-level crowd-control spells and tactics, which is a serious hindrance in a game constantly exposing the player to fights against hordes of enemies. This makes kiting the only applicable tactic sometimes rendering the fights slow and boring.  ** IMPORTANT ** It is relevant to know that playing a priest makes the experience better as priests require the least amount of stamina and are not as dependent on weapons, so backtracking to towns and stockpiling potions are not as big issues as with other classes. If you (loosely) follow this guide, your character is guaranteed to be a powerhouse:  https://www.gog.com/forum/inquisitor/how_to_build_a_priest_in_hard_mode   Still, when all is settled, the game was a very solid experience for me that I wholeheartedly recommend. It is obviously a labor of love and deserves your attention.
1956	 Positives   + Complex and engaging storyline. Well constructed plot with lots of twists and turns. + A stiff challenge, without being impossible. There is always eventually a way to progress from even the toughest situation. + Somewhat addictive. Despite the awkward controls and combat, I couldn't help but keep coming back to the game. + The negative effects system on the player character was a nice touch. For example, suffering from blindness would make the mouse cursor disappear, or confusion would reverse the mouse controls. + Very much enjoyed the trial system of collecting evidence in order to put a suspect on trial. The torture system is also very creative and interesting (as well as being sadistically realistic!)   Negatives   - Bugged beyond belief! So many irritating bugs, some of which will crash to desktop or require and emergency exit. Save regularly. - Numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes. Some sections have not translated into Englsih well at all. - Awkward combat system. Some of the combat skills don't appear to work (or have so little effect as to make them not worthwhile investing in), item damage is somewhat inconsistent and unrealistic and many encounters felt like just a health and stamina potion loading exercise to survive. - Was not keen on the randomised stat attributes on weapons and armour, which can result in the player spending hours cycling through merchant stocks until they chance upon their desired item. There is no levelling to this process, so as soon as you are able to wield/wear the item, you could effectively receive the most powerful of its type which would last you through to the end of the game. The randomisation can make powerful , unique items that you receive as late game quest rewards significantly less useful than an item you picked up in the first act.   Overall   Despite all my gripes, I have to recommend the game, as I have enjoyed playing it very much. It hooked me in and the storyline was particularly engrossing. However, I constantly find myself thinking up ways in which the game could have been done better - there are so many things that werenât quite taken advantage of. I'm hoping that a sequel is on the cards, as with a little polishing and ironing out of some issues, there is potential for a real quality game here.
1957	Inquisitor is an old school RPG with a long story about persecution of heretics, torture of people both innocent and guilty, decent amount of curse words, poverty and death, possibility to help or diss people, pub minigames and that all in a world and history based on our own.    Pros
1958	Inquisitor tries to emphasize your role as an inquisitional investigator over the role of the average hack-and-slash adventurer. When it succeeds at doing so, the game is good, great even. My fondest moments with Inquisitor involve happening upon a random person in an unexpected place, as I was always eager to begin questioning in hopes of learning a tidbit of information that could point to a heretic (and the entirety of the townsfolk were already squeezed dry of new leads). This didn't always pan out of course, many questions just result in a dead end, but that's exactly what made the experience so enjoyable. Without the cut and dried certainty that any NPC or line of dialogue important enough to be coded in would be important enough to move the plot forward, full scrutiny must be applied to everything. Complete exploration was thus also worthwhile, especially with the risk of torturing or burning an innocent at stake. The game goes wrong, however, when it turns away from text-based investigation and throws itself headlong into dungeon crawling. The combat is both obtuse and tedious. Enemies give no indication of how much life they may have or how close you may have been to defeating them which means that there's no way of telling if you were on the verge of success or if you need to completely reevaluate your approach. Weapons and armor break at alarming rates and with dungeons that may go on for anywhere from three to nine full floors; even devoting a quarter of your inventory to replacements will see you making a couple of trips to the surface for repairs. Status effects have a similar feeling to them, like they may have been designed for causing pain over fun. Poison lasts for nearly four full minutes and drains both health and stamina, the latter being the resource needed to fight effectively. Some status aliments skip the character and affect the player directly by changing the cursor's behavior. Blindness, disorientation and confusion cause the cursor to disappear, invert, or wiggle around. These ideas themselves are interesting and could be used to make for a more tense experience, but any charm or fear they might have inflicted is killed by their frequency; there is simply no avoiding them. The lesson the game seems to teach, then, is not to bother out-thinking or overpowering your enemies, but just to accept more losses. Expect to use more potions, have more equipment break, and see more companions die in order to finish each successive encounter. Which, oddly enough, suits the dirty, violent, depressing aesthetic of the setting. Inquisitor pulls no punches with its set pieces. There will be mass graves, disemboweled corpses, and tortured screams, all in full detail. The background music and the item descriptions buttress this effect, making for a truly unsettling experience. If you can see your way past the slog that is combat, past the typos, past the irritation of getting stuck in a wall for the tenth time, there is the skeleton of a fantastic game here. And one well worth trying.
1959	Inquisitor is a great idea. Poorly executed. Don't get me wrong, I'm playing the game, I'm almost a dozen hours in and it's somewhat challenging, however the mechanics are poorly designed. Here's an example: you don't need the identify skill because you can cast a spell that identifies everything in your inventory. You must swap out spells from your quickslots(of which there just aren't enough) mid battle, which can be pretty annoying and can get you killed quite easily. For a game the devs spent 7+ years on(they say 2 or 3 of translations I think) they really didn't do very well. This game deserves its metascore, but you really can't go wrong for 10 USD, it's still fairly fun. It's just very gimmicky and like I said, the mechanics suck at higher levels.
1960	Awesome game, unless you donÂ´t like to read, letÂ´s make it clear from the start.  ItÂ´s a game for you if you really like RPGs, and by that I mean, playing a role in an amazing story, with complex characters, motive, and storyline in general.  Dialog takes time, thereÂ´s a lot to ask, and all NPCs have distinct personalities, opinions, and clues (except for those labeled with generic names, like soldier), and it really sets the dark mood of the inquisition times. Everyone is afraid of ending up a suspect of heresy, and they are all more then willing to spread rumors about their neighbours.   ItÂ´s set in the middle ages, and you play as a menber of the holy inquisition (at least playing as a priest, there are 3 classes, priest, paladin and thief, so I assume they have different backgrounds), but in the game thereÂ´s magic and monsters.  There are 6 different scholls of magic to choose from, and many skills. All of wich you can upgrade as you level up, along with your attributes. One of my favorite parts in an RPG is the character creation, and this game does a good job at that, you can see thereÂ´s replayability in a game when you go through it wondering how it would be like playing a different class, and that sure happens here. For instance, everyone calls me father, and I get to paternalize everyone, or even offer to hear confessions, stuff like that. I wonder how is it like as a thief, itÂ´s bound to be very different, the dialogs at least, and thatÂ´s the real core of the game, dialog. Imagine an awesome book, where you get to play as the main char, this is not actually labeled as a visual novel, but from a certain point of view it could be. combat and graphics are simple, but thatÂ´s not what matters in this game, would you judge a book by itÂ´s graphics?   ItÂ´s a masterpiece.   One complain though, theres a nice soundtrack but itÂ´s sporadic, sometimes IÂ´m reading a dialog for 15 minutes and thereÂ´s no background music playing at all, then it starts for a while, then stops again. whatÂ´s up with that?
1961	This game isn't for the casual player. It's a hardcore RPG that you have to put time into in order to get into it, as I have found out. It's similar to Morrowind in the fact that it gives you next to no direction, so you have to find stuff out for yourself. I personally think it's awesome, it's got an in depth story that reeks adventure and the chatacters are all well developed too. At first you may think the graphics are utter crap, but they really do fit in with the feel of the game. As I said, the casual player beware, as this game isn't for the feint hearted.
1962	Dark days have beset us men and its up to us to fight for the light of justice and right with the pious instruments of interogation and erradication of the dark ones amidst us... either we cleanse their souls or we char their forsaken flesh.   Let's get to work and break out the bonbons =D!
1963	Just completed the game and I'm not sure if I would ever play it again. Inquisitor really shines with its '90s CRPG nostalgia goodness, but delivers a frustrating experience in certain key areas. For TLDR, skip to section below for Final Judgement.    The Blessings
1964	Expertly written with classic, challenging isometric gameplay (which, admittedly, suffers from the limitations of its stylistic predecessors), Inquisitor is an excellent roleplaying experience. And, when I say challenging, I mean, very challenging (maybe I missed some essential way to make combat easy), but very rewarding.
1965	Best of cRPG game in decade. One of best games I have ever played. This game has a soul. I recomend any RPG fan who like good plot ,setting , music and very dynamical combat system . I hope that will be sequel soon.
1966	The lore of this game is immense. I wish I could brag about being a big, bad hardcore RPG'er who savored every bit of it, but it overwhelmed me and I wound up zooming through it, hoping that it contained no vital information. Every inhabitant of the doomed little village you start out in has loads to tell you. Loads! If you try the game, please do the developer justice and listen to it, so that I can rest my guilt over this. I'm an ungrateful â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, because the creators of this game have really put in an effort here.  The graphics have a dated feel and I could live with that. My biggest gripe is that the character moves very slowly across the screen. He's a snail. And the battles are way too hard in the beginning, which makes it frustrating to get to know the game. It should not affect how I judge this game, but I'm a pitiful gamer who prefers having an illusion of challenge and feel good about myself when I steamroll over it. Please shoot me.
1967	Polarizing? Absolutely. Its a game with a 90 degree learning curve, antiquated systems, and a glacial game speed. Though, I find myself absolutely drawn to it. Before I bought the collectors edition on release date, I heard nothing but bad news about this game. Unplayable, they said. Arcane, it said... yet I still bit the bullet and bought it.  It isn't streamlined, minor tasks are difficult, and you will find yourself save scumming. It took me forever to get through the inital quest, but something kept me playing. I realized it was the story. An interesting world, fascinating systems, and a dark grim world that is a joy to explore. Add in detective elements as you play the titular inquisitor, and you have yourself something not quite polished, but unique and fascinating. If you can brave the lackluster gameplay, you'll find yourself drawn to the dark world surrounding it.  That being said, 10 dollars is a lot to ask, wait for a discount.
1968	A little difficult to get used to the combat and how you interact with the game but the storyline is so detailed it makes up for any minor technical issue. Someone very creative designed this plot and put mountains of effort into lore. The world created for this game feels very real.
1969	I cant help thinking how much effort developers put into this game, you can write a full book with that much diaologue. Artwork is amazing especially in churches. You can feel the despair of dark times and end of the world theme. The combat is decent. Besides good amount of spells, overall combat system is not the best. The story is very well written, characters are unique and interesting. Unique and well written music that makes you feel the game atmosphre   Overall 7/10
1970	Inquisitor is a detailed RPG with a riveting storyline based in the medieval period following the infamous black plague. It uses a mix of real world events and common fantasy elements to recreate the era. Fantasy elements include magic, enchanted weaponry, and useful alchemical potions (real world alchemy was actually an endless pursuit to try and create gold by mixing various elements).   One of my favorite historical elements is a mention of the flagellants, a group of christian extremists who repeatedly whipped themselves and inflicted other bodily harm in an attempt to recreate the suffering of Jesus. Of course, the most apparent historical element is the inquisition itself, referring to the persecution of all those who weren't inline with the beliefs of the church. This game is of course not nearly as extreme and vulgar as what actually took place, but I won't go too far in detail, as I don't want to bore you with a history lesson.  So, what's good?  -Leveling system with XP, attributes, skill points -Large variety of spells and skills (all explained by detailed tooltips) -Lots of equipment (character can equip weapon, shield, helm, armor, boots, gloves, belt, two rings, and an amulet) -Challenging combat -Choices with consequences -Good replay value (to try different choices with different consequences) -Immersive world -Non-linear gameplay -Intriguing storyline  What can be annoying?  -Bosses are extremely difficult, to the point where you may have to clear several areas without fighting the bosses, and then go back and try again, and again, clear some other areas, and then try again. Although, it kind of makes sense from a realistic point of view, as most of these are all fabled in the lore to be as such. It's still annoying. -Old school RPG with archaic graphics -No tutorial, which can make it frustrating to figure out how to play, especially if you are not familiar with how these types of games work. -All text, no voice dialogue  What can be viewed either way?  -No flashing marker on your map telling you where to go next, forcing you to actually pay attention to dialogue if you want to complete quests (time to drag out the old notepad). -Character growth in spells and skills is limited by your class choice, forcing you to specialize. While this adds some to the replay value, it doesn't allow one to create that god-like character that can do anything.  In conclusion, this game can be great but is not for everyone.  If your one of those who doesn't like reading, this game may not be for you. If you like games to be easy, this game is likely not for you, as you will have to do some thinking. If you are one of those who can't stand to look at a game if it doesn't have modern graphics, then this game is DEFINITELY not for you.  That said, I think this game is absolutely amazing. I'm sure that if you are an avid RPG gamer like myself who can tolerate the old school style and difficult bosses, you will love it as much as I do. At U.S. $9.99, Inquisitor is a steal.
1971	The depth and its double-standards of justice kept me going back for more as I pushed further into its curious story to find out who was behind a simple act of malice. I had no idea how 'OK' I was about torturing someone into accepting the conjectured blame the order had cooked up. Even if there wasn't anything left to confess, I wanted to see them scream in pain. If you enjoy stories in your games more than you do gameplay; you should give this game a shot. If you enjoy stories that start of as a bundle of petty missions that eventually turn into more than reality could handle, then give this game 100 hours of your time. And if you happen to be one of those who watched The Borgias with Jeremy Irons, then you should play this game to experience what it's like to be a self-righteousness Inquisitor.
1972	This game is for the hardcore only. If you enjoyed diablo, you MIGHT like this. This game is MUCH more story driven, with a much more in-depth combat and class system. You choose from 3 classes, Priest,Templar,Thief. All of which are HARD. Play the game on EASY, because even easy is HARD. I highly reccomend it. Only 9 hours in, and i barely scratched the surface.
1973	Having mixed feelings towards this game. It's not that it's a bad one. Just not well-made. From the creators of the dark, atmospheric, story-driven albeit a bit clumsy adventure Daemonica comes a dark, atmospheric, story-driven Inquisitorâ¦ but the RPG part and the duration made the whole clumsiness part exaggerated. Delve deep into the tedium of 1. pixelhunting! 2. stacking on bottles like a hobo junkie 3. collecting scalps 4. lengthy monotonous conversations 5. reeeeally slow walking 6. unskippable âI have to let you goâ dialogue whenever you accidentally click on your dog 7. spiders that poison you for 5 minutes with about the only remedy of going to the city and healâ¦ and did I mention slow walking? 8. broken balance with easy difficulty being worse off than hard (according to forums)  If you tell me now âbut it's a hardcore dialogue-rich RPG, what did you expect?â, please don't be like those people who mistake bad game design for a difficulty level. User-friendliness is not something for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's a norm these days, and this game lacks a lot in this department.  Story-wise it's an interesting concept, being an inquisitor, collecting gossip and proof, uncovering crimes against faith â and these heretical rituals are kind of grim and do make you uneasy. I guess I'm about halfway through now, and decided to just use the cheat codes to get through the dungeons without madly running/crawling to the town and back.
1974	The combat is a slog of just abusing potions against hilariously low RNG odds and the adventuring consists wandering around until obscure quest triggers that aren't logical conclusions from the clues you're given activate to let you progress and hearing PAGES of dialogue that are all the same thing about topics of no importance.  I get the fun of dialogue, I get reading. I don't get peasants having Galt length speeches about every. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. thing.

1976	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7d1kBznlSo&amp;feature=youtu.be   Inquisitor: Inquisitor is an old styled RPG from an isometric point of view. You take on the role of an inquisitor of one of three classes, the paladin, thief or priest. You are set upon the world of Ultherst to save it from damnation by rooting out the witch and heretic and banishing evil from the hearts of the innocent. Inquisitor is a fairly simple game with an amazing premise; it really ends up playing out like a detective game of crime solving. You will go and get testimonyâs, witnesses, evidence and find the truth behind the conspiracy's and paranoia of the down trodden people of Ultherst and in doing so, discover a dangerous and incredibly evil plot against humanity. The story and setting in Inquisitor is incredible and very unique, Iâve never seen a game quite like this, and itâs got a heavy dark setting with a very gothic overtone and style, beautifully created environments and music that really makes you feel like you are doing god's work. As far as storytelling, the game is stellar, the game truly falters in its execution of its combat, you will constantly need to carry bags full of potions and drink from them constantly just to stay alive, and the combat itself is very monotonous, couple that with the strange design choice of including stamina which you use for any combat action and once depleted you can do nothing and it really takes out the intensity of combat and really becomes more of chore than something you want to do. This is made into an even bigger problem further since the game will have you go through huge dungeons with multiple floors and quickly respawning enemies. You will end up fighting through throngs of enemies just to get to the next Act or finish a side quest and without any satisfaction it gets very challenging to push yourself through to enjoy more of the story. Challenge is also something that bogs the game down, this game is difficult even on easy, enemies will take an insane amount of damage before dropping while you can easily be killed, you'll be saving and loading often in this game and it isn't necessarily because the monsters pose a challenge, but rather that they have a lot of health and you don't. My recommendation for the combat system is to build a range character and use hit and run tactics, and ONLY play on easy. This isn't the kind of challenge that feels good to overcome. Itâs really a shame since Inquisitor is a game I would like to see a sequel for; its setting is truly a dark fantasy, complete with torture, paranoia, violent crimes and true evil. I would love to see more of this world or game of a similar setting, Inquisitor really suffers from a very bad combat system that is unfortunately forced upon you as you are expected to do a lot of fighting. It's only $9.99 USD and I rarely see it on sale, if you do, I'd pick it up and check out the story and see how you like the crime solving, otherwise, unless you can get past the combat system, it'll be very hard to justify the price, even if the story is great.   TL/DR; Inquisitor is a very hard (not in a good way) RPG where you play a holy man (out of three available choices) who is asked to find the answers behind the evil plaguing Ultherst and save the souls of the innocent. The premise is dark, grim and gothic, with beautiful music and crafted settings, the game really suffers from a horrible combat system that the game seems to think you'll enjoy because it gives you gigantic dungeons with many floors to go through before you can even think of advancing to the next act. It doesn't help the game is so difficult even on the easiest difficulty, for really no reason. I enjoyed the story, but, itâs tough to recommend. I rarely see it go on sale too, if you do see it pick it up, otherwise spending $9.99 is a tough price for a game you might not play past the first few hours. Oh and be prepared to read, a lot.   -Middle of the Road from Royial
1977	Great game. 120+ hours of play time. I don't know the last time I got this many hours out of a single player game. Maybe never.  It was a bit rough at the start playing as a priest with hardly any spells and low chance to cast them successfully, but it gets much better. Use plenty of magic seal items at the start (instant magic spell items with 100% success) until your own magic abilities get better. When you get AoE spells much later in the game you will be unstoppable.  The story is very unique compared to other games I've played, and the gameplay is too. It combines investigation with regular RPG elements very well.
1978	If you like old school style RPGs like Fallout, Arcanum etc, it's maust have for you guys. Powerfull storyline interesting quests etc. 
1979	I love this game It's not dumbed-down like most modern CRPGs and is a welcome challenge that has the deep atmosphere of games like Divine Divinity and Baldur's Gate. Thank you for this classically gorgeous game with intriguing lore and gameplay :') I highly recommend this game for any gamers such as myself who love classic CRPGs, a challenge, and craves depth.
1980	Great game. Very old school RPG. No hand holding... anywhere, your going to need to know your RPG, and be expected to... think. Prepare to read, read, and read, hack, hack, shoot, and use potions, and sell old armor, to use new. Save, die, and reload. Just like the old days, its about the story... and while their is a journal, you really need to 'stay' with it, or you will forget the many intriguing and subliminal turns it takes you on. Stop playing at your own risk.
1981	Totally sick. Underestimated masterpiece
1982	I played the closed beta to release (so you dont see many game hours on Steam here)... But I loved this game. I never finished it because I was doing a lot of play testing which is slow. This game is like all the greats - Planescape Torment, Baldurs Gate, etc, but with a very unique world and perspective. It is a difficult game, no doubt. Save often. But get it, and enjoy a real RPG like they used to make them. 9/10
1983	Ok while I do recommend it I do so only for specific types of gamers. If you are OLD SCHOOL this is for you; If you love an intensive reading assignment, lots of things to sift through and the likelyhood you are going to die a lot and the save now save often rule comes to mind, then this is for you. If you are used to ressurecting and trying again, multiple chances, and lots of help guides, then look elsewhere. Enjoy :)
1984	Great game. Developers please make make udate fo windows 10, game doesnt working on that OS.
1985	The atmosphere of the game is great but, I feel the rest wasn't executed very well. The writing definitely captured some of the justice, heretic, interrogation theme but, ultimately wasn't very engaging to me.  The gameplay gets a bit repetitive, especially if you have to make multiple trips in certain areas due to equipment breaking or running out of potions. It seems a bit overkill if you have to bring 3 sets of weapons and 2 full pages of inventory filled with potions into one dungeon and you still have to make a 5 minute trip back out to resupply.  Those things said, I only played as a paladin and restarted twice to make stat adjustments. I never made it past the first act as well. I was about to write the review a while ago but, I decided to try to give it some more time. After a few more hours I still didn't make it out of act 1 and it was not worth it to push myself through this game.  All in all it's good for a few hours of mediocre entertainment at ~$2.00 but, I don't think it's worth your time.  
1986	Torture heretics, burn them on the stake, carry the decomposing bodies of three young girls each in different stages of decomposition, yell at priests, find secrets everywhere, get mad dosh and burn some more heretics just for the sake of it.
1987	This game was excellent, I will admit the combat was lacklustre and repetive and even dated to be brutally honest. But the story was top notch, And investigating crimes and seeking out heresy, finding leads and the dialogue was 100%. I became thoroughly immersed in this game and I would gladly buy a sequel if they ever made one.
1988	Great RPG that follows the vein of old games like Baldur's Gate or Fallout, mostly for good and a little for ill. The story and dialog are top notch and even 30 hours in there's more and more to discover all the while getting engrossed in the setting of a medieval but fantasical Europe. Orcs and lizard-men roam the countryside while satanic plots threaten to destroy humanity but a familiar Christian dogma attempts to keep everything in check. The music is also very well done and quite fitting with an amazing variety where you're sure to keep hearing new tracks when coming across new dungeons.  If you have yet to be baptised to the faith of older top down RPGs you may find the combat and skill system a little out of date and you'd be right to think so. Still, once you get your first party member and learn the nuances of the skills and spells you'll be able to completely focus yourself on the games strong points. For just 10 dollars (or less, sale depending) you're more than likely to get your monies worth.
1989	I enjoyed playing this game.   Setting  The setting of a fantasy inquisitorial christian kingdom felt refreshing. The tone of the game is fairly dark and grim.   Gameplay  Gameplay isn't too complex but takes some figuring out at the start. The game can become a potion chugging fest the further you get into the game. I enjoyed playing the priest class, the focus on spells felt great in my opinion. The user inteface could have been better.   Story  The game has a lot of text, so you'll have to read. What kept me playing was the story. In my opinion it has a bit of a detective-ish feel when you try to find heretics.
1990	Inquisitor is an unpolished diamond. When playing a game of its genre, I expect it to have a compelling story and an immersive atmosphere. Gameplay always comes second. It certainly has hack&amp;slash elements and it could very well be categorized as such. However, it feels like a true old school rpg to me since its emphasis lies on lore, storyline and mood. You almost feel like you were tossed in this world and have to choose, heavy hearted, for the lesser evil. The devil you know. Or not...
1991	Fun game, tons tons and i mean TONS of reading. This game is more of a crime investagation than any. But with fighting, decision making that affect all the characters of the game, and good itemization. I would have played it more and still probably will... but all the reading... it's like i am reading a chapter of a book every NPC haha.
1992	  It's a game that feels and plays like a 90s RPG. Emphasises story, characters and dialog over combat, making the former very good and the latter mediocre.  
1993	So I must admit this game is pretty hardcore. I also must admit I had to cheat in order to stay alive as a thief.  But!  I love Inquisitor's atmosphere, with it's foggy lands and superstitions. All this writing work really keeps me going! It has quite a unique lore, and for some reason I don't get, the old fashioned design really fits it. I also like some of the musics. This game inspires me!  I don't know if I'll ever be able to finish it, but I'll try my best. It's not every day you get to be a badass inquisitor.
1994	Cheat the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it, and you will probably enjoy it. Try to play it without cheating and it is an exercise in frustration because you need approximately A BILLION â¥â¥â¥â¥ING STAMINA POTIONS.   Great setting, I like the dialog, and the way the world works. But god damn if it is not hard to like.
1995	You know, the game style is dated, similar to Diablo 2, but it's charming. The choices you make can carry great weight, depending on your playstyle. The game doesn't babysit you and stop you from going places where you might die quite easily either, which I appreciate. It shows the dev team has faith that we're not complete morons and we'll learn from our mistakes, rather than point us away every time. There's some typos in the text, but it really isn't anything game breaking or too distracting. Items can be a little tough to come by, but it makes it that much more awarding. 4 out of 5, really enjoyed it.
1996	This game was 10 years in development for translation into English so it could be released in North America. It reminds me of the old school RPG gaming and I miss that in today's games.  There is no voice acting in Inquisitor so I hope you like lots of reading because there is allot of it to do.  I didn't play it for a lengthy time as I was getting board reading and reading and reading. However its a very in depth story and they gave every NPC in the game there own personality.  Your character creation screen is limited as to your portrait and you select one of the five or six pre-remade pictures, not that it matters really.  Graphically the game is very pretty and the story is very good but I had a hard time wanting to continue to play as there was to much reading and I tend to drift off when there is that much to do.  Picking up the game for $4.99 or less is a good deal, if your really into this type of gaming and can spend the hours and hours of reading then for $9.99 its worth the price.
1997	Oh my god It's so good. It took me like three hours to get working and it still isn't displaying correctly but it doesn't even matter.   I've played close to maybe an hour of it so far and I can say it's everything I wanted it to be. The dialogues are ripe with exposition for paragraphs on end, the tone of which is lavishly crafted to be equal parts melodramatic and faustian at once. You're introduced as a detective of sorts, sent to help the church find, accuse and try heretics. The 'bishop' type you are sent to meet tells you about the process of doing so, which I'm sure will be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gloriously complicated mechanic that will provide hours of harsh entertainment.   The aesthetic of it is so pleasingly dark, not deppressingly or overwhelmingly so, but very dull green, light brown; beautiful in a dreary sort of way. It's got the feel that Diablo 2 had for me back in the day. In fact that's not a bad comparison. It's like a literary Diablo 2, taking more cues from historical events (like, say, the Inquisition) than high fantasy.   One criticism I might level at it is that tooltips could be more prevalant. I like complicated systems in my games, but I also like to know how to use them. A developer shouldnt play the game for you, but they should at least throw you an instruction manual. But that's it. Even the display issues are given a pass by me, because it's so damn cool.  I might feel compelled to change my opinion once I've played further, but as of now, I've got a thorough erection for this game.
1998	Inquistor is done in the classic isometric style of great 90's rpg's like Baulders Gate or Plainscape: Torment. With a main questline that allows the player to acutully gather evendence, accuse, prosecute and eventually execute heritic's, witches, satanists and other threaths to the church, Inquistor offers something unique and in some ways twistiedly fun. The lack of a tutorial can make the learning curve a bit steep at the start but if you have played the games I mentioned above then it shouldnt take too long to get used to the sometimes clunky UI and figure out how leveling works ect. The storyline is enguaging and adds to the great enviornemnts and atmospheres that are present within allowing for a decent level of immersion that kept me coming back.   One of the issues I had with the game was its lack of direction given in some of the main and side quests. This might just be due to a bad translation as the game was produced and written in Poland and then later translated to English but it seems to happen often. This can sometimes also be seen in the dialoge with converstiaons sounding odd but beyond that having no real other effects I had noticed. Another feature that could be tweeked is the quest tracking and journal system. It would be nice if you cold add your own notes or in the whole converstiaon with people was recoded if it had rellevence to a specific quest. Due to this I sometimes found it hard to leave the game for a few days and pick it back up where I left off. But if you are willing to put in a bit of effort this game will be well worth the time of fans of the classic isometric style of RPGs.
1999	I have not played this through, but what i did play, it was genuinely interesting, what the creators were trying to do and did have an element of charm to it.. though this Game is more time consuming than Baldur's Gate, it must be said. I have played this for about 10 hours so far ( and will play more eventually).  Some people will look to this game because it looks like Diablo. Some because of perhaps Baldurs' Gate, in honesty, it is quite disssimilar to diablo, being quite a slow paced game but does share quite a bit in common with Baldurs' Gate, including the intricate detail and the more strategy based combat system; Diablo being a 'hack and slash' allows the character to attack when you click, this does not, and 'commands' the character to attack, making this less of an action game.  Maybe I approached it with too much intertest in the story; and there is Tonnes there, so many people to talk to... some say same thing, like many NPCs in RPGs, but the thing with Baldurs gate with the allignment and need to do things right is here and appears to be quite deep in the chatting system (which again is like Baldurs Gate).  My conclusion for now is this has the makings of being a great game, you,. there are hours(and hours) of material and feels like a decent attempt at a story lead game. Though I think the game could have better done with a more action side too, like diablo and perhaps either the layout been more linear or the world smaller as complication can seem to alienate people, inlcuding me when I have to work; In saying that it is truely great to see something that is different and someone actually trying, and succeding in making something good and diffferent.
2000	One of the best RPGs of last 10y.  Bringing back the Fallout feel.  It really takes you to a fantastic setting, borderline realistic. and immersion is simply astounding. This product is a clear statement that games are art.  of course it has its downs. it doesn't branch, doesn't offer enough consequences, but the budget to cover that would be huge. I have worked with their staff in testing it, and they provide great support.
2001	Good story line, but I haven't finished it yet. You get your money's worth in the amount of content there is. The character customization adds replayability to fool around with different builds. Worth getting when it's on sale.
2002	Had to wait a while for the English translation and some patches to polish the game play but once i took the plunge and started playing i just can't stop playing it - Just have to see where this games richly detailed world takes me. Game play wise it is strictly hard core, old school and tougher than an trolls bum! Not one for the impatient or for those who skip dialogue though: the game contains a novels worth of text.
2003	This game is not easy at all and thats the beauty of have a page full of potions at all times. Old gritty rpg where you may or may not burn people at the stake. 10/10 would burn people again.
2004	Love this game, all the nice hard scaling difficulties, you can spend hours in the turtorial trying get it done, absolutely a joy to play, if old school Rpgs are your thing
2005	If you are a true RPG fan you will like this
2006	Plays like a cross between Planescape torment and Divine Divinity. Not as good as either. Story is quite mature and lots of reading involved, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you like your games. A lot of time and dedication went into the making of this game, and it is clearly a work of love by the creators. Buy it. 80 out of a 100 in my opinion.
2007	Oh, My, Gosh. A Must Buy, for ANY RPG Fan.
2008	8/10 would burn the heretics again
2009	Very funny game and different atmosphere.Some things are wrong: 1)THE POINT DISTRIBUTION IS WRONG I NEED TO RETAIN THE PONTS TILL LEVEL 15 TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN MAGIC... 2) ITAIAN TRANSLATION NEEDED
2010	Very funny game and different atmosphere.Some things are wrong: 1)THE POINT DISTRIBUTION IS WRONG I NEED TO RETAIN THE PONTS TILL LEVEL 15 TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN MAGIC... 2) ITAIAN TRANSLATION NEEDED
2011	:wizard: I love how 'Diablo 2' the game is &amp; the games depth but man this game will put me to sleep~
2012	This isn't Diablo. This isn't Diablo II, This isn't Baulder's Gate. This is Inquisitor. One of the best isometric RPG's of its genre. If you don't like reading and RP'ing experiences then go play something else. Its a classic oRPG with elements found in other like games.
2013	Drinking potions simulator :)...really the game needs a serious rebalance; but its very addictive, story and setting are very intriguing, and the gameplay has some nice features like arresting and torturing humans muahaaha
2014	I would have to say this game delivers in Storyline and that classic RPG, Baldurs Gate kind of feel. However, suffers from a very challenging combat system and lack of active pause feature. These do not detract from this game at all, but the experience would be much more enjoyable if Inquisitor had these features.
2015	I'm really not sure why this game has such a low Metacritic score. It's an unashamedly 'Baldur's Gate' type old-school RPG with an interesting quest/plot line. Okay the graphics aren't exactly going to make you squirt in your pants but a decent RPG doesn't necessarilly need 'AAA' standard graphics. It's a slow-burner though with instant death to be visited upon the foolhardy wanderer at every turn. I suspect the low score is in part down to people who have rushed to score it after dying at the hands of the first hostile NPC you are likely to meet in the starting villiage. But if you can avoid running into him, and add the two available NPC's in that town to your party before you get to grips with him then you are off and running. There are slight errors in grammar and translation in some of the text but really nothing that will detract from the well laid out depth of storytelling. And the combat CAN seem pretty bland at first. However, it's a perfectly good retro-esque RPG -72%. [get it cheap in the reboot 4.0 bundle on BundleStars]
2016	I read about a comic books worth of text within the first minute. Then I burned someone.  Game doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ around.
2017	==========  + Arts + Story + Setting + Gameplay + Soundtrack  ==========  - non-user-friendly  ==========  9 \ 10
2018	Inquisitor is a very old-school take on the diablo 1 / 'Hard RP' RPG type game.  It's got loads of text, tons or reading to do to understand what the heck's going on, but it immerses you right in the world.  You are (theoretically) the arm of god, pardoned for a crime, and sent to a small village to look into some strange occurances. You have a wide latitude of juristiction, and are expected to gather evidence, point fingers, and (again, theoretically), figure out what's truly happening in the world, and do something about it.  ... That said, you could just as easily (probably more easily) abuse your position, blame the wrong people, and sentence them to imprisonment, torture, or death.  You will also be required to kill a veritable bucketload of monsters that plague the countryside, delve into dungeons, gather supplies and armourments, and (likely) gather a group of like minded people to help you on your quest (for good or evil, as the case may be).  If you like diablo 1, but found the story &amp; world-space way too simple, Or you liked arcanum, and found the world too hopeful &amp; bright, You might just like this game.  The world is full of that 'old-school' religious oppression, the combat systems unforgiving, and the story heavy and dark.  I rate is 8/10.
2019	Very old school, very fun. Hits you right in the nostalgia.
2020	Havent played an old scholl RPG for a long time. This one was reason i start playing and realy worths the try.
2021	Cool game if u like rpg's like diablo and baldurs gate its worth a try thumbs up!
2022	This is a game that you really want to like, but at the same time hate it with the power of 300 foremans grill. It is a diffcult mistress as she punish you for every misstep you make but she rewards you when you make good. What I'm trying to say, is that this game is HAAARRD. It will make you want to slam your keyboard against the deck. I like this game and I hate it at the same time. Bottomline is, that you if have no patince (like me) be prepare for game over. A lot. It is a good game here but you will get mad at it.
2023	Like it so far, but I think i've turned casaul. Is it normally this hard?
2024	Combat is kind of odd. Pace is fairly slow. If you want a quiet version of Diablo with more Roleplay this might be your thing.
2025	Inquisitor is a old-school RPG.There is lots of text to read, maps to search and npc's to talk.But it is have a different then other RPG games, there is no clue for missions.You must find own your own your way.Kind a good game but most of people dont like it because this game so hard.
2026	A good game that does not let you down along the way. It is a steady ride all to the end.  Although, there should be more impacts on what you do and whom you talk to in the game... with all the big warnings at the beginning of the game, I think the designers should have focused more on that than hack'n'slashing.  The game genre is situated between a role-playing (like Arcanum) and an action-adventure like diablo. It is decent enough to try at least once for fans of both genre.  I recommand that you buy this game if you are a fan of role-playing games like Arcanum or action-adventure games like diablo/Dungeon Siege, especially at the low low price on Steam.
2027	Meh. There are some fun things about this game, but the combat system and difficulty curve are just awful.
2028	.
2029	If wordy detail doesn't put you off, or perhaps even entices you then you've come to the right place.  Amazing value and depth for the modest price tag, clearly a labour of love.  Sometimes frustrating trying to work out what to do next, but not so bad that one would abandon all hope of being able to finish it (plus there's always Google!).  I'm 16 hours in and enjoying it, though it's fairly deep it isn't difficult to play once you get an hour or two into it.  Recommended for old school players and those wanting more Dante than Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
2030	While there is nothing wrong, in and of itself, with the concepts behind this game, to say that they have been poorly executed is frankly apparent.   Inqusitor, when I started, gave me high hopes, but the hiccups began apparent within a few hours of play.  My first quest was to slay some giant bats to please teh guards, who would then let me inside.  That took me nearly forty minutes to complete a quest that should've taken ten. And if the first quest is long, boring, and requires you to walk around in empty space, hunting down every last enemy, then you have done something wrong.  While the concept of actually being inquisitive, performing basic detective work to hunt down the evil in towns was a brilliant idea, I was unable to get very far into it, having only played about an hour. The reason I stopped will be explained later.  So while I was out and about killing bats, I discovered treasure. 'Aha!' I thought, 'Basic gear that any first rank guy can wear! How wonderful, perhaps this game is salvageable!' And then after closer examination, I found that the gear in question could not be worn by anyone below level seven. This is beyond stupid. All treasure and gear must be levveld to the expectations of the level of progression that the player should be at by the time he or she gets there.  Giving level seven gear to a level one player, when you do not expect the player to be anywhere near that level, is a horrible design, regardless of where you find it. So, lacking any storage for this treasure, I prompty got rid of it by selling it. Now the market system is pretty good, with coin flowing freely and not feling too overwhelmed by ridiulous prices.  But there was another problem. Care to guess?  Over leveled equipment sold at the start of the game. You cannot use anything that is sold to you unless you are level 7. Proper design is to have the inventory of the blacksmith update as progress is made. This flaw proved to be extremely frustrating later.  So after some basic examination into murders, and some questioning of townspeople, I was told by a villager that he had been paid good gold to kill me, and so he pulled out a weapon to do just that. Which is where the second flaw became apparent.  Unbalanced enemies. In any good game the challange must scale to the player. Not so hard that the player can't win, but not so easy they become bored. Were in not for the timely intervention of the local guard, I would have been slain.  During the fight, I ran into yet another problem. Breaking weapons. Now this is NOT problematic. Provided of course that the weapon displays a stat that SAYS IF IT IS GOING TO BREAK. The weapon did not, and when it did break, I was left completely defenseless.   So without a weapon, and the bandit having a knife I was too low level to use, I set off to buy a weapon.  Only, again, to discover I was too weak to use ANY WEAPON SOLD IN STORES, LEAVING ME COMPLETELY USELESS.  At thsi point, I quit. Poor level design and balancing has completely ruined this game, which is a pity because it showed so much promise from the mechanics alone.  Do not buy this game.
2031	Extremely poor balancing early game. I'm not asking to start out like a dragonborn badass, but this is ridiculous.  I chose a paladin knight as my character on medium difficulty. I try to kill the starter bat creatures on the first quest and can only kill one before im out of stamina and half dead. The fact that they paralyze you every other hit also adds insult to injury. I wonder if they even playtested it, the most frustrating 4 dollars I have ever spent.  It has a very interesting universe and a very nostalgic isometric view of things,but the stat design of this game is currently broken to the point were it is not even playable.
2032	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUMkcBctE7c   Inquisitor has organ music.
2033	In this game I found I'm not that good in english stills a pretty solid game for all old school rpg lovers  8/10
2034	I would have trouble playing this game even if it used D&amp;D lore...Slow pace a lot of walking. While the depth of story appears to be there I couldn't hang on long anough to find out.  But for $1.99 you might have a different oppion.
2035	Honestly I am sorry, but this game was absolutely terrible for many reasons but I will try to hard boil it to 5. (Don't want to read them all? I made a summary at the bottom :3)  1. The Gameplay: Four words: Crappy Version Of Diablo  2. The Story: Honestly the theme of this story is very well founded, It would seem like a great idea for a book or a movie. But VIDEO GAME?... eh maybe not.  3. Lack of Playable Character Diversity: This game's selection of characters was, as best as I can say it, incomplete. Ok you got a warrior, a priest, and a thief... Then the author just dropped it there. Seriously!? How about including something like a witch (or warlock) or maybe an unarmed fighter like a monk (or something similar). The roster looked like the author made it to the thief and just said 'screw it that's fine'.  4. Vocal: Or should I say lack thereof. This game was like a silent movie the whole way through. I don't mind reading but I do like to hear a voice behind the text. Plus some of the times you talk to people the text is like 10 or 15 lines long so some vocals would help there.  5. Difficulty: Immensely difficult. Too much for an RPG. I don;t mind and even LIKE a little difficulty. But this game pretty much just throws your butt into the middle of the road and just says 'Ok you're here, you're on your own; have fun'. You have no idea where you 're supposed to go after the first place you start in. Plus the monsters are so difficult that even on easy I couldnt make it past the Necromancer in the Crypt (Can't recall his bloody name right now). And with no autosave, you die and forgot to save for like 2 hours you're screwed.  To Make this short, Its Diablo 2 with the story, gameplay, PC (PC=playable character) roster, and vocals cranked down to zero and blown up with a Holy Hand Grenade, and the difficulty cranked up to bloody 11. I got it on a special and It wasn't even worth the minuscule amount I paid.
2036	This game starts off really cool, the atmosphere and the whole middle-ages religious conspiracies are very intriguing (think The Name of the Rose). Alas, the plot goes downhill (basically off the cliff) fast, with extremely repetitive plotlines and quests, boring 'investigations/trials' (which are usually nothing more than fetch quests or pixel hunts then a multiple choice quiz at the end), obvious twists and the ending is just the worst.   Then there's the combat, which while when you are at the right level is ok, it is the grindiest grindfest ever. You will spend painful hours grinding just to get to be able to walk around the next area without getting one hit killed. And not to mention the horrendous stamina mechanic.  That being said, the music is amazing. Shame it's wasted on such a letdown of a game. 
2037	Admittedly it is a very long game, I have played for an hour and have barely progressed, such is the like with RPG's, but it is very much worth it, brings back memories of Diablo II :)
2038	I hate this game. I didn't expect much out of the graphics but somehow they managed to look worse than the screen shots and the animations are just plain ugly. I really like the idea of this game but the presentation is so bad that I just can't get into it. Oh and for a game with this much reading they should have made the font less annoying to look at. I'm more mad that they wasted the idea rather than that I wasted my 5 bucks. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this ugly â¥â¥â¥ game.
2039	Good game with bad writing. Get it on sale and it is worth it.
2040	Beautifull artwork, enjoyable storyline, poorly thought-out combat design. Particularly irritating side-quest design. Example: You've talked to every named NPC in town except one. That last NPC offers a side-quest. Now you have to talk to all of the named NPC's once again to glean information about the quest. Imagine having to do this for every single quest; Compounding irritation as you walk across town over and over and over again. This is required for every side-quest I had encountered in the first town.   Combat mechanics are just as irritating. The stamina stat exists solely to enforce spamming of both stamina and mana potions. Spell casting requires stamina and mana. Being struck by enemies consumes stamina. Attacking enemies consumes stamina. Stamina only regenerates out of combat, if you are not moving. You need to stand still and essentially not play the game for several minutes after each combat if you wish to regenerate stamina without potions. You can't walk back to town, or pick up loot, you can only do nothing.   Potions are relatively cheap, which is good. However, you can not bulk puchase potions. Each sizeable combat scenario, or dungeon, will have you consuming tens of potions. These are purchased from the abundant vendors by dragging and dropping items across inventory screens one item at a time. Enjoyable gameplay mechanic, right? BTW, your companions will need a plethora of health potions too. Fun!   TL:DR. I like the idea of this game, the art is pretty, but the core mechanics are far too irritating for me to recommend it.
2041	No customizable keyboard, no way to pause the game with my laptop... sorry, but why do you put so much effort in such a game if it's to forget the gamer who paid for it? I really, really wanted to love it though.
2042	I normally don't write these little blurbs for games I've barely scratched the surface on, but this game is an exception. While I'm sure the game is incredibly rich and deep, there is a limit I have for presentation in the modern age. When the controls and flow are as good as they are on the classic standard-setters Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, there is no excuse for a game that plays as sloppy as this now. My apologies to the dev, but I uninstalled after one hour.
2043	Spawned Went to the church to preach about â¥â¥â¥â¥ and how god is accepting of it Taxed the townfolk Went to the place of execution Talked to some people along the way Didn't read the dialog  Massive jerk to everyone   10/10 Would Preach Again
2044	Only masochist need apply...
2045	Please don't get this game. I don't care how cheap it is. If you're like me, you will be pulled in by the 'old-school' nature, the art, and the story. Sadly, that's all the game has going for it. The story and setting are great, including the art. However, if that's all I wanted then I would read a book or watch a movie. A game is ALSO about gameplay and this game has terrible and infuriating gameplay.   The investigation is the best part of gameplay, but you never have any clues other than just talk to everyone. Plus, sometimes you feel you have enough evidence to convict someone, but the game doesn't. So you have to continue just randomly wandering around and talking to people until you finally hear what you need to hear to be able to accuse the person.   Combat is the WORST. It can't make up it's mind if it wants to do Diablo-style gameplay or Baldur's Gate so it ends up combining the worst of both and ending up worse than almost any game I've played. You will die - A LOT. Not because you're not using a good strategy, but because the game is exremely unbalanced. Combat is terrible, yet there are so many dungeons in the game that you must wade through that it becomes so tedious that I finally just had to stop. There is NOTHING good about combat.  Towards the middle of Act II, I did something that I've rarely done in my 25+ years of gaming - I cheated. Not since using the Game Genie on Battletoads or the infamous Konami code on Contra have I had to do this. Sadly, there are no good cheats so I just gave myself lots of EXP and maxed out attributes and hoped that would be enough for me to just breeze through the tedious dungeons so I could just finish the game. Well, I got as far as Act III and then there were the number of dungeons in Act I and II times 10! I got so close to the end, but I just couldn't do it any longer. I quit - I watched the ending on Youtube and will uninstall it and hope to never look at it again.  Pros:  -Story -Setting -Art -Parts of the investigation gameplay  Cons: -Unclear goals/lack of direction -Combat - which could be overlooked if there wasn't so much that was required -Dungeon design - beautiful, but huge and since combat is terrible, they're just tedious. I got lost in several of them because I just didn't know what to click randomly to open the way. -Did I mention the terrible click, wait, and die combat? -Unbalanced enemies -Combat, Combat, Combat, COMBAT
2046	The atmosphere and story are enjoyable, but the combat is just terrible. It's very slow and mostly involves you chugging potions like you are addicted to them. I've played Diablo, where you have to chug potions fairly often as well, and this is worse than that. Much. Much Worse. If you do get this, I suggest playing it on easy so that you can get the fighting out the way faster and get to the parts of the game that are okay.
2047	I want 15 minutes of my life back. This game was, while somewhat hilarious to watch in action, absolutely terrible. If you can sit through horrible everything, it may get better farther in, but it sets a terrible first impression with terrible voice-acting, animations, story, and worst of all horrible gameplay. While it was a Diablo-Like, it felt more tedious than any other I've played. If you're a masochist, I recommend this game, otherwise please stay away.
2048	What it lacks in smooth gameplay it more than makes up for in pointless conversations
2049	Game seemed decent until I got to the first dungeon. Lots of grinding on the way, finally get in there and it's LOOOOONG. The difficulty levels in this game change without warning. You'll be having an ok time one second and then out of nowhere 3-4 goblin shamans will start spamming wall of flame and take out your whole party within literally one second. You can't control your party members. They run blindly into combat and chase fleeing enemies right into enemy lines.  If you get poisoned you pretty much have to leave the dungeon and walk all the way back to town for a healer. This will happen every time you see a spider.  Finally I decided to just use console commands to make my dude OP so i could at least enjoy the story.  Nope. Still the same problem. You get one second killed even when you're double the normal level for the dungeon you're in. I'm sorry, I tried to like this game, but I'm out.
2050	Good story. Horrible gameplay.
2051	I agree with you Cyn0sure.
2052	I can't wait to loose my job and spend some time with this game it seems that good...
2053	So you may have noticed that this game boasts a one-hundred hour playtime and I've only played this for about an hour before reviewing it. It might not make me qualified to give it a full review, but then again first impressions count for something, so kiss my â¥â¥â¥.  Here's the first hour of Inquisitor:  WELCOME TO 12TH CENTURY PROTO-ENGLAND. DEMONS ARE EVERYWHERE AND THE APOCALYPSE IS COMING. YOU'RE GONNA BE AN INVESTIGATOR, KID, SO GET YOUR â¥â¥â¥ TO HILLBRANDT. Me: â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ROCK. This is gonna be AWESOME. Hey, wait a minute - aren't there supposed to be more skills for, you know, investigating things? All I see are a bunch of proto-Baldur's Gate skills. GUARDS: HALT, INQUISITOR. WE'D LOVE TO LET YOU INTO HILLBRANDT SO YOU CAN GET TO ALL THE COOL DEMON SUMMONING STUFF. Me: Why do I shuffle like I've had The Pear permanently shoved up my â¥â¥â¥? GUARDS: NOT OUR FAULT. WE NEED YOU TO KILL TEN BATS BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER. Me: ...what. GUARDS: YOU WANT IN OR NOT? Me: ...fine. (SHUFFLES OFF TO KILL BATS)  (TWENTY MINUTES LATER)  Me: You â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! You lied to me! This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier Diab -  GUARDS: You missed one. Me: ...â¥â¥â¥â¥. Back in a moment.  (TEN MINUTES LATER) Me: You â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! You lied to me! This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier Diablo! GUARDS: YOU HAVE COMPLETED THY QUEST, AND CAN ENTER HILLBRANDT. Me: â¥â¥â¥â¥ you! CITIZENS OF HILLBRANDT: (LOUD WALL OF MUMBLING) Me: What? I can't hear you. All of your dialogue is being funneled through a small box in the center of my screen. CITIZENS OF HILLBRANDT: (MUMBLING INTENSIFIES) Me: Jesus God, someone actually took the time to write and translate all this. How do I get out of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ user interface? I don't care if the game started development in 1999, I need more real estate for all this dialogue! CITIZENS OF HILLBRANDT: (MUMBLING NOT UNLIKE A LOUD 185 DECIBEL ROAR) Me: â¥â¥â¥â¥ HELP I'M DROWNING SAVE ME GUARDS: WE NEED YOU TO KILL SOME MORE BATS  So if you want me to review the other 99 hours of this game, please feel free to contact me in order to set up a payment plan. Because cash dollars are the only reason I would ever consider booting up this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game again. That or if I run out of sleeping pills.
2054	If you can endure the terrible ui (oh my eyes), if you can accept tons of bugs, if you can quit then enter the game again and again just becasue the memory leak, if you just want to read a detective novel, you can chooes this game.
2055	This could be one of the worst action RPG's I have ever seen. Let me start by saying the movement in the game feels like im playing something from the 90's. The combat is clunky at best. I'm just glad I got it cheap because this was a complete waste of about 20 minutes of my time.   Uninstall, and off to look for something a little more enjoyable!
2056	Amazingly well written!
2057	A hate letter from 1998 filled with inexplicable design choices, such as removing control of your mouse cursor for 60 seconds when relatively common enemies cast spells on you. Overall, this game is aggressively annoying.
2058	This is a great game. If you liked Diablo, Baldurs Gate type rpg's then you'll love this. Very well made in-depth game that has that olde' rpg feel.
2059	The game where everyone forgets to introduce themselves... lol  Many people already sayd that this game is not good, but it's also good. Bad graphics, stiff and a little broken. Also annoying that maps has not a faint idea of waypoints.  BUT, thereÂ´s something really good in this game that I can't quite put the finger on. Something in the dirty air reminds me of The Whitcher (best rpg), and the inquisition context plus the ramifications offered by the chose class has some appeal too. Mechanics are accetable, fun to loot and sensible powers... makes me imagine what it could be with more artworking. Hope this isn't dead.
2060	This is one of the most rewarding RPG games of the past years. The writing is great and will keep you on your toes. This game does not hold you by the hand wich makes exploring fun and rewarding. The difficulty is very high and this game requires a lot of patience. but if you are a true RPG lover that doesnt mind older graphics this is a must
2061	Compared to other posters, I haven't gotten that far. But in the little bit of time I've played I've arrested heretics, tortured them, and condemned them to death. Granted this could've possibly messed up the game, but oh well, I'm a cleric on a mission for the Mother Church, and they confessed after many hours of torture.  Be prepared for a difficult campaign. This game is intense, and is very HARD....especially compared to those triple-A titles passing for RPGs today. Those games are a cakewalk. This...this is a nightmare. :shudders:  There is a lot of reading involved, so if you don't like to read, sorry. Also, if you don't read everything you come across, you'll find that you missed important information and now you're stumbling along blind without a clue as to what to do next. (I did this...and the quest objectives are of no help at all)....  Also, if you don't grind just right, and level your skills just right...well, apparently the Mother Church was wrong in sending you out. You obviously â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off God somewhere...because you'll be dead in a ditch somewhere, and the people won't even have the common courtesy to come along and give you a decent burial. How about that for a bunch of heretics??  10/10 would find everyone a heretic.
2062	I really am enjoying the story of the game but at alot of points in the game it is basically a really boing walking simulator so I do not recommend this game.   Accidently Reviewed
2063	Terrible graphics Terrible port Terrible script Terrible voice acting Terrible gameplay  One of the best video games ever made
2064	I wish there was a one thumb up, one thumb down rating; or a shoulder shrug or something for somewhere in-between a 'Yes' or 'No' Recommendation for these Steam-game Ratings.  RECOMMENDED - for the actual game experience: fantastic. NOT RECOMMENDED - for the awful PC technical port: horrible.  Before I actually even get into what an outstanding actual gem of a game itself, let's start right up front with this:  *****WARNING!************  *****BUYER BEWARE!*****  While Deadly Premonition is a unique + outstanding game, it is such a crime that this game is riddled with technical disaster after technical disaster here on the PC. In terms of technical disasters on the PC, this is right down there with the likes of Bully PC version + Dark Souls PTD PC. While Dark Souls: PTD was at least very functional before even modding, Deadly Premonition is absolutely NOT. This is a very basic PC port, lacking of many of the typical PC features we're accustomed to. First off: the game is locked in 720p, so nevermind any sort of 1080p support. Don't expect any sort of fancy graphics bells + whistles officially, either. Durante's DPFix Mod is going to be a must for PC gamers here, if they have any sort of higher-end monitors + graphics cards; especially if they want to bump the resolution past 720p + even make this aging game look a bit more modern.   Also, the game has crazy-issues with crashing to the desktop (CTD) frequently. You might want to even run a LAA (Large Address Awareness) program to make the game force using 4GB of RAM (since it runs even more horribly, without it), since this game has performance issues where it'll begin at 60 FPS (frames per second) when you start, eventually winding up - slowly, but surely - to a crawl. And if the game hasn't hit a crawl yet and crashed, give it time - it likely will. Saving constantly for most gamers anytime you get a chance will likely be a must.  While I did not try using KB-mouse, the game was a console-game: so, it was built around a gamepad. While you can change the controls configuration in the game's sart-up config/splash-screen for the gamepad, you're better off not doing so - b/c some keys might not even function properly, if moved elsewhere.   ****END OF BUYER BEWARE SECTION***  Now, onto the actual game itself...  What do you get when you cross an open-world game, a surreal David Lynch movie/TV show, survival-horror games (Resident Evil + Silent Hill series), and numerous brutal detective movies involving ritualistic murders (i.e. the movie Seven)? You get Deadly Premonition, one of the strangest, odded, weirdest, unique + most interesting games of this era. If any game has 'cult classic' written all over it in this era, this game would certainly easily fit the bill. Also, this game is a flawed-gem + an absolute diamond in the rough in numerous ways, if I've ever seen one.  The story + plot goes like this: Francis 'York' Morgan (who the player is, BTW) is a FBI Agent that comes to the small town of Greenvale, in an attempt to try to solve a bunch a murders occurring from what looks to be a serial killer. I don't want to spoil too much more + go off into the deep end here, as this is just the tip of the iceberg with this game's story, plot + characters; since this stuff should be experienced by the player, first-hand.  And boy, are there characters in this game! Most of the characters in this game do have something that make them stick-out in their own way, as either unique, bizarre, different, hilarious, ridiculous, or God knows what. The colorful cast of characters is always interesting + intriguing: for example, the lead 'York' talks to himself a lot, and refers to someone named 'Zach'; and there is a character that's filthy rich, wearing a gas mask and having his assistant speak in rhyme and poetically. Characters don't get often as unique, interesting, eccentric, hilarious (whether intentional, not intentional, or who knows on some occassions) than often what Deadly Premonition has on display here.   The story + plot are also no stranger from this type of insanity, madness and colorful-ness, as well. While the plot starts off with a typical detectives are out to 'catch the serial killer theme,' it doesn't take long to eventually graduates into something much more weird, interesting, strange, unique, bizarre - and then eventually go way off into the deep end, by the time the game finally finishes. Gamers will no doubt be replaynig the game; looking at an analysis online (or two, or three, or more); and having debates with their friends about things they couldn't figure out + things that are purposely left hanging ambiguously.  The controls and gameplay feels like it's right out of other classic survival-horror games. Think of the control-pad approach for Resident Evil 4 (especially since you can't move when you aim) - and you have the right idea. Combat always feels like it should with a controller: it feels solid. Areas often have their own 'Nightmare' version of an area, which feels like it's plucked right out of a Silent Hill game. There are even QTE (Quick-Time Events) in this game here and there, though this game doesn't really hammer you over the head with them, unlike some other games (i.e. Fahrenheit AKA Indigo Prophecy).  Players, by performing main-quests and side-quests, can make money - all so that they can buy more guns, melee weapons, ammo, med-kits, and other things to keep them on their journey Some quests, they can only be taken during a certain time of day - so, you might miss quests if you don't do them where they're placed in a game's Chapter or during a certain time of day. This could cause fans to replay the game, to see and experience more on an actual replay of the game. Quests varying from racing to get someone or something to another area; playing darts on a board; to just talking to NPC's and trying to get information out of them. That just doesn't tip the iceberg here, of what this game has on offer - as the game is constantly keeping the player immersed into the game, the world, the story, and especially the characters.  The game certianly lacks a lot of polish, in many areas. Sometimes, the game's sound effect doesn't sound strong, when hitting an enemy with a weapon. Sometimes, the dialogue isn't that juicy or great; while other times, it's fantastic. The quality of the graphics are nothing to write home about here, as it looks like a game that maybe should've been released on the PC years ago and/or this new version should've been updated with modern resolution support (1080p and above) + graphical features. Worst of all - as I've already stated, this game is an absolute technical mess, in terms of how this PC port was handled.  Deadly Premonition is a flawed-gem + a cult-classic, unfortunately riddled with having of the worst PC ports that I've ever seen - but it's an absolutely unforgettable experience, once you can everything in working order...hopefully, for the time being. It's a great gaming experience, when it's working. An experience that, per playthrough, likely will take the player 15-20 hours or so - if we're not counting all the crashes, frustrations, and other technical blunders that might cause the spike in the time-played. According to Steam, I had around 32 hours with this, if you count all of that madness; while the game itself had me clocked in around almost 20 hours. Unfortunately, this great game is brought down quite a bit because it's unfortunately riddled with an abysmal F-grade of a technical PC port - to the point that even mods can't even close to fix most of this game's technical mess. Even the absymal PC port couldn't stop me from trying to finish this fantastic game.  Game Experience = A PC Port = F. FINAL Overall Grade = C.
2065	Its core greatness cannot be stopped,  No matter how much the rate of frames dropped. Though not abundant, extras are nice,  I'd say it is worth the asking price.  So says Mr. Stewart!
2066	This is the type of game that will only excite people who get into the characters and story. In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but I feel it's only fair to recommend it with some caveats.  It's a murder mystery with quirky characters. They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.  Basically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story. If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games). You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.  The combat is familiar to anyone who has played Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses. I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough. there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear 'noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!' about over 9000 times.  Though Deadly Premonition still contains a fair amount of jank, it only adds to the wealth of charm within. The end result is a ridiculously original masterpiece that hearkens back to an era where the gaming landscape had more room for wildly imaginative budget games, a far cry from the abundance of focus tested blockbusters that are prevalent today.   I love whistling this theme!         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition (Whistle Theme)&nbsp;
2067	One of the oddest videogames I've ever played. Despite having virtually no production-value and the lack of polished gameplay, it manages to stand on the strength of its gripping murder-mystery story, its weird and wonderful freakshow of characters and how aware of its own campiness it is. It's an experience like no other that I can recommend solely for that reason.  Only true downside is the PC port. Itâs awful. Downloading fan-made fixes and messing with .exe properties isn't much fun. A patch that Rising Star Games promises is on the way may fix this, but for now, just take note.  Overall, even with the shoddy PC job, its one of the most memorable games in recent memory. Highly recommended if you're into games that are a little out-there.
2068	If I ever wrote a book with a video game topic the title would be '1 Video Game You Must Play Before You Die' and Deadly Premonition would be the subject. In it you would find countless of analysis of the many citizens of Greenvale, a complete study of the main characters quirks and flaws, how to make your own Sinner's Sandwich and why you always should keep your suit pressed and clean.  Hell, I would probably end up writing a sequel. There is just so much going on in this game that one book simply couldn't content everything that needs to be said about Deadly Premonition.   There are lot of great games out there, but in my view there is only about 3 games that have ever gone far and beyond and pushed what a game really is capable of being. A game that changes the way you will look at games. A game that makes you realize what a fantastic medium games can be, if it's utilized for more than simply being another entertainment form to ultimately make you pass time. A game that ruins gaming.  Deadly Premonition is all that. It's impossible to describe exactly what it is that makes it such a fantastic game. Most people will only shake their heads and it's like trying to describe a miracle to people who never witnessed one.
2069	The squirrels have public domain monkey sounds. I repeat. The squirrels have public domain monkey sounds.
2070	There is three types of games: - The good ones - The bad ones - Deadly Premonition
2071	Well, if you are one those people who can enjoy this masterpiece probably you already own this game, I was waiting for this for a long time I have no consoles so I couldn't play it before, I pretty excited when they announced it for steam, I preordered it without much thought, and when game was released it was pretty much unplayable for me, I can say it was worst port I have ever played, well I don't really care about resolution but when console port has no controller support that's just terrible, not to mention it crashed every 5 minutes or so, so I decided to wait, not long after Durante of NeoGAF famous for his dark souls fix has released resolution fix for this game and after that some dedicated users made custom icons for controller and somewhat support of for pads via third party softs. Then there was word that devs were planning to release patch to fix all this mess, and they really did after some time. So it's been a month already after the games release till I could play this game but it was really worth the wait, I was already hyped for this game for a long time but it turned out to exceed my expectations like 10 times, and after this patches game was fully playable with no crashes, controller support and thanks to durante with desirable custom resolutions. I played many games this generation but there were only two games that brought me that sense of excitement and joy of gaming that I had only as a child, first game was Dark Souls, and I thought I wouldn't enjoy anything else like that until second DS game was released, well now as I write this I have completed this game 100% and can safely say that it's definitely is in my top 10 games of all time if not in top 5, it just makes me sad that this masterpiece in not very successful saleswise compared to mainstream 5-7 hour meaningless soulless shooters, but I do hope that as gaming attracts more and more mature audience and is slowly becoming as mainstream as movies, there will be time that developres can take the risks and make games such this one without any fear of failing.
2072	A superb game for people who enjoy Twin Peaks, murder mysteries and unique game design, not to mention charm, ambition, complexity and creativity that most modern games simply lack.   The PC port has some issues, but generally runs well for me and the issues it does have can be fixed with a few forum/google searches.  It's a unique game, one that any player who enjoys great games should experience.
2073	Every generation of video games has a set of titles that completely flies under most gamersâ radar. Games such as Killer 7 and Snatcher are among those that fall into the elusive, Cult Classic category. See, a Cult Classic game is one that hasnât really been met with commercial success but has garnered a dedicated fanbase despite that fact. Now, as a lowly gamer I canât do much about these games and I wish more people actually played them, but Iâll be damned if I donât do my part to at least spread awareness about games that I think deserve much more attention than they are currently getting. One of these games is Deadly Premonition: The Directorâs Cut. Deadly Premonition: The Directorâs Cut is an HD remake of the same game released in 2010 on Xbox 360 and PS3(Japan Only). The new game sports updated visuals, move support and some new DLC, scenarios and an extended ending. It would be hard to categorize this game into one specific genre; if I had to try I would say that Deadly Premonition is an open world thirdâperson murder-mystery survival horror adventure game.To play Deadly Premonition, you need to approach it with an open mind. This is not your typical run-of-the-mill video game. No, instead this game has some of the worst visuals and controls youâll ever encounter, not to mention the new HD remake has some framerate issues as well. But do not let this deter you from the game as absolutely none of that matters when youâre playing it. Deadly Premonition follows Agent Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent investigating the murder of a young woman in the quaint little town called Greenvale. York (As he likes to be called) takes the case due to the mysterious and intriguing M.O of the killer â red seeds are always found near the body of the victims. York has to work together with the denizens of Greenvale to help bring in the bad guy and restore order to the once peaceful town. Sounds like your average detective plot right? Well, it couldnât be further from that. Without getting into too many spoilers, the plot takes numerous twists and turns that send you on a journey of self-discovery and has you second guessing what the truth is.The real hook of Deadly Premonition comes from the charm its characters and environments exude. Everything and everyone is bursting with personality. Agent York for example has a special friend named Zach; what makes Zach so special is that no one else can see him or knows about him besides York, even if he talks to Zach in front of another character. York constantly talks to him in his head throughout the game, and youâre always wondering if Zach is real or just some imaginary friend. York also seems to be very knowledgeable about movies. When driving around in your car York will often talk about various movies with Zach such as the classics Tremors and Goonies. Another example would be the Deputy Sheriff, Emily Wyatt, who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Naomi Watts, for no apparent reason. The town of Greenvale feels very homey and you often feel like youâre in an episode of Everwood. I think Access Games really nailed the look and feel of Greenvale.As mentioned before, Deadly Premonition is an open world game of sorts. The game has a timer for each day and main objectives have to be completed within a certain time frame. The main objectives push the story forward and this is usually where the survival horror aspect comes into play. These sections have you exploring linear levels gunning down hordes of creepy enemies in classic Resident Evil 4 over the shoulder style. While these sections do little to scare you, they are entertaining enough to keep things moving forward. York can use a multitude of weapons ranging from his handgun to breakable melee weapons such as a pipe or spade.You can partake in numerous activities and interact with various NPCs in the game. You could, for example, spy on one of the officers while theyâre having supper in their apartment. I kid you not, you can literally look into their window and stalk them and watch them do completely mundane things like eat or sit on a couch. But that is where the real beauty of Deadly Premonition comes in. It is then up to you to explore and find these gaming gems, and trust me some of them will have you in stitches from laughing so much. There are also numerous side missions that are given to you by certain NPCs; they are not easy to find as some NPCs are only active during certain times of the day â you have to be sure to talk to them at that time or you might miss out. The fact that those NPCs go about their daily lives independent of you, the player, really makes the game feel alive.The game has some catchy tunes and the voice acting is particularly good at capturing each characterâs unique personality. The same canât be said about the sound effects, though. The graphics are really bad. This game looks like it was made in the PS 2 era, even with the updated graphics, but the bad graphics give the game a certain extra charm. If you are open-minded enough I promise you will have a one-of-a-kind experience that you will not soon forget. The PC release though, has its fair share of problems, including poor performance, and a resolution locked at 720p. Itâs a bit of a bad console port, to be honest â though one wonders if this adds to the charm. Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâs good. Overall 7/10.
2074	Is the voice acting bad?  Yes. Is the gameplay bad? Yes (for the pc port). Are the graphics bad? Equal to a 2006 game. Does it have replay value? Yes. Is the story great? Yes. Will this leave lasting memories? Yes. Is this one of my favorite games? Definitely.   Verdict:  Best crime/survivor/horror ever/10  (Plays like the old Resident Evils or Silent Hills)
2075	let's get started...  Good thigs about this video game: 1. Main story is a masterpiece full of mystery and weird things. (Greenvale town is a strange place) 2. The characters are so spectacular you can find crazy guys, tough guys even a horny Woman who try to seduce you. 3. Side quest mission are so funny.  Bad things about this video game: 1. The graphics looks like 128-bit era.  2. Bad really bad pc port sometimes crash over and over again and you need to restart your computer.  3. Only 720p is this a joke ?? but don't worry you can solve it with DPfix.  So if you like video games like resident evil or similars (survival horror games) I can tell you this you will enjoy this one just like me off course you must have a lot of patience because you know the glitches about this game can be a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ so I hope this little review may help you
2076	Ohh my fahcking GAWD, I did it, I actually did it, I FINISHED THE GAME. Somehow someway after NUMEROUS crashes, freezes, and playing 99.99% of the game with what I didn't know was bugged out aiming, I fahcking did it! I think this game is mesmerizing but first a few questions to determine if Deadly Premonition is right for you!  Do you enjoy quirky games? Do you like the TV show 'Twin Peaks'? Do you enjoy games that are rough around the edges?  I'd say, if you answered yes to 2 of those questions you should definitely find a way to play this game. It has a great storyline, funny albeit intriguing dialouge, decent gameplay and an absolutely fantastic OST. However be warned this game can be a FAHCKING nuisance due to the terrible programing/coding that was implemented especially for the PC version.   Keep in mind that this game has a BOATLOAD of problems but it is also a better experience than most 'AAA' or 'Indie' games out there!  ****TIPS FOR RUNNING DEADLY PREMONITION**** I am using Windows 8 btw.  If the game crashes at start up----&gt;look for redist folder and find the PhysX_Syssoftware installer and run Repair on it If the game constantly crashes WHILE playing----&gt; Try rebooting your system after exiting or disabling Steam overlay for the game or Run in Windows 98 Compatibility mode If the aiming is extremely limited (ie. Only can aim within a small rectangle on the screen like i did for 99.99% of the game, lol)---&gt; Run in windows 98 compatibility mode  ALSO sometimes deleting the game and reinstalling helps but it is not as reliable as just running in Windows 98 mode.   Hope these tips help and happy gaming !
2077	I recommend Deadly Premonition to everyone who likes kind of weird characters, good storytelling (that takes it's time) with multiple perspectives from different points on the timeline. You should be stress resistant, because the game will probably crash just before your next save, so you will do some things twice. That should not bother you. It is a kick, because the game itself is not much of a challenge. If you can live with the flaws and see it as an Indie game you got for less than 3 bucks, it is an immersing adventure.  Since the beginning I like the habit of the main character 'York' to talk to 'Zack'. It feels like he is talking to you, the player. It is fun to see other people being puzzled by the actions of the protagonist (as talking to Zack, a person no one can see) and not asking a question. That's what you as the player do: make a list in your mind of things you want to find out and hope that you will get your answers to the right time. Or at the end, at least. Because of the way the story is told you may guess some things and resolve some mysteries for yourself, but I assume that you will still be surprised sometimes. You won't find an answer to everything in the game, like with most scary stories, but that's fine. You will get all important answers to what is important in the game's universe.  Some insights of my journey with the game: I was well aware of bugs because I read other reviews. I installed DPfix. I can highly recommend that. By doing so, crashes did not occur too often and because I saved a lot I managed to play the game without becoming depressed. ;) I can only complain about spending too much time on loading screens. Moving the game from my HDD to my SSD did not seem to boost the time on loading screens. Too bad. In chapter 7 I started to explore the vast world. I should have done that sooner (chapter 2) to have advantages in the game early on. In the first chapters you have time limits, but the game is nearly in real time, so you can do side quests. No worries. Do them! I got my radio, which allows me to drive to different locations in no time without really doing it] after chapter 21. I could have saved a lot of time, not driving myself through the world. You find information about the side quests in the game and also through the descriptions of the achievements. After you finished a chapter, you can replay it. During a replay you cannot save. A replay is nice if you want to do side quests that may be easier in that level or not doable in another. Everything you gain will be available in any other replay and also in your current game progress. A replay only changes at the end (if you save after finishing the chapter) your inventory, trading cards and the quests you finished. So if you keep dying in your current level, do a replay to get food and medipacks in your inventory. Nice cheat. :) I used the replays after I was stuck in chapter 22. I was too lazy to open the archive and therefore I did not find an important key. The game is in general, amazingly straightforward, because it shows in red where you need to go to or interact with to proceed. That is nice, as you always know what to do. (But you still have to solve the puzzles by yourself, the game only indicates where the important puzzle is.) You are never lost.  I like the chilling atmosphere of the game, the horror story itself and especially how it is told. One last hint: Don't miss to have lunch with your colleagues. Eat with them in every chapter possible. It's fun! I am happy that the reviews I read convinced me to play this (indie?) gem.
2078	Thanks to this game, every time I pour some coffee,  I look with interest. 
2079	Will you think the graphics on PC are trash? -Yes. Will you mod this game to fix the graphics? -Yes. Will you rage when the game spontaneously crashes once in a while? -Yes. Will you for some inexplainable reason love this game despite all of its flaws? -YES!  In all seriousness, DP is worth a try. If you're willing to do a little modding, and you grab this game on sale, you can't go wrong. That's what I did, and I don't regret it. I've enjoyed the game so far, and would recommend it.   York- 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.'
2080	You know what I love about this game? Everything.  I show this game off all the time and most people think I'm joking. I first played this back in 2012. This is genuinely my favorite game of all time.  The story is like if you took Twin Peaks, translated it into Japanese, had a dude translate it back into English and then had another guy try to read back the lines in Japanese having only seen a couple of English sitcoms. Basically what I'm saying is it's amazing, it has so many twists and major plot points that left me stunned. One of the most satisfying boss fights of all time against a gay cross dressing man. Characters that were likeable and kooky in their own way and made me wish some of their fates turned out different. Some of the most memorable and funny lines in the world 'FK in the coffee' and 'The answer is [onion]' The graphics while lackluster contribute to the off-kilter world of Greenvale.  The only downside is this version crashes all the time and the PS3/Xbox version is slow as hell.  This game is pretty swell.
2081	 My Personal Score: 0.5/5
2082	The game is absolutely amazing! The plot is fantastic, while the gameplay is quite obvious and buggy, but the latter doesn't change the emotions you get following the investigation. I recommend the game for all who are interested in creepy detective stories. If you want to enjoy the game truly, please don't pay attention on bugs and some annoying things like following the suspect for about five real minutes - the game is not about that.  I am thankful for all those who were involved into the Deadly Premonition's process.
2083	This game gets both a 0/10 and a 10/10.  I've thought about this game for months-- Not because of its plot, its gameplay, or its presentation. No. I've wondered if SWERY had planned for the plot to make no sense with terrible dialogue, if he had planned the gameplay to be stiff and hilariously broken. If he planned for this 'serious survival-horror game' to turn around and moon us all along.  It's either a trainwreck or a complete miracle that this game exists.  It could be both for all I know.  Please buy this game. You're witnessing the birth of the first B-Game.  The squirrels make monkey noises. THE SQUIRRELS MAKE MONKEY NOISES.
2084	Man, I wish that I could simultaneously 'Thumbs up'  and  'Thumbs down' this game. As it is I can't recommend this game but I can't recommend it  enough  either.  The game is  badly  developed on the PC. It basically won't run without using  Durante's dpfix  [blog.metaclassofnil.com]  and even then, with the latest version of that, it has issues like HDR style bloom occasionally flickering and blowing out the screen, an aimbox that doesn't let you aim outside of a  tiny  fraction of the screen, a screeching sound loop when you're in a car and crashes ever 25 minutes on the dot. Still, it's a really,  really  great story with really solid gameplay. On the one hand, if you have a 360 or PS3 then just pick it up used for one of those systems but, as of the time of this writing, it's on sale on Steam for $2.99 with the soundtrack and the OST  alone  is worth that money (listening to it right now). The game's not unplayably broken (with dpfix and compatibility mode for XP SP3/98 set) but it does have enough issues to make it a conditional recommendation even on sale.  Gameplay wise it's an open-world game set in a small town that feels realish. There are two major 'centers' to the town (downtown and a smaller business/residential area) and a bunch of places off in various parts of the countryside all connected with roads that feel planned rather than designed for sandboxing/gameplay. In many ways Greenvale feels more like a town than any other open-world location that I've played because of that.   A day-night cycle is present, as you'd expect, but unlike most open-world games it's not just a perfunctory addition that has no gameplay impact. Rather, NPCs have a routine and are available at certain places at certain times and not at all at others. This impacts when you can start sidequests and when missions can be taken. On top of that NPCs actually drive around Greenvale to get to their various locations. The first time I saw this in action I was standing outside a particular main character's house waiting to be able to start a side mission and I saw her drive up, get out of her car, walk into the house via the garage door (and then the mission still wasn't available so I 'peeked' inside the window and she was in there puttering around).  The story is one of the best told murder mysteries that I've played through. It's got elements of cosmic horror as well as 'good' old-fashioned depravity. As you progress through the missions you're going to be picking up clues that allow you to 'Profile' what occurred (basically a cutscene that starts out unclear but clears up as you gather clues) that will eventually lead you to the killer and uncover what the craziness that goes on in the dark, dark hours of the night is all about.   The shooty gameplay isn't particularly good but, thankfully, it's also not particularly necessary. A standard wrench (that you can get with infinite durability from an early sidequest) will do you well for most of the enemies through most of the game. Shooty wise it harkens back to the Resident Evil style aim and stand mechanics but you'll only hit an enemy if your sight actually crosses them and turns into a reticle. It's not great but it gets the job done and, aside from the three bosses in the late game, it's not really required. Just make sure you do the quests to get a .34 with unlimited ammo before you get to them.  All in all the game is flawed, critically so on the PC, but it's still such a satisfying game with an  excellent  story and a soundtrack that is silly, cheerful, haunting, beautiful and sad all at the same time. Definitely give it a shot in some fashion. Whether that be on one of the last-gen consoles, a PC with dealing with the issues that crop up or even  a no commentary 'Let's Play' 
2085	Despite all the glitches, this game has one of the most engrossing stories in video games.  The characters are wacky, the story is funny and sad at times. It's a game you won't forget about in a hurry.  Get it in a sale, follow the guide on gamingwiki on how to get it running, and enjoy.
2086	Deadly Premonition is one of the most unusual and strangest games I've played for a long time. That is true, not only because of its progressively more mystic story and the many weird citizens of Greenvale but also because of the peculiar mix of gameplay and technical elements. Many parts of the game are great, others are so bad they're good again, some are truely (ragequit inducingly) bad. Deadly Premonition is a very rough gem; it's seriously flawed but the game has real character. While I had a lot of fun with the game, playing it was quite frustrating sometimes. After the ending credits rolled I was left unsure whether I should be sad it ended, or glad that I won't have to experience any more of it. All in all the positives outweigh the negatives for me but I only recommend the game to people with patience in combination with high tolerance for bugs and broken gameplay.  For a little bit more detailed impression of some aspects I start with the technical side as this is where the most frustrating flaws of the game lie: The PC version of Deadly Premonition is a terrible console port. From what I read on various websites the game was already quite buggy on consoles; on PC most if not all of these bugs are still there but others were introduced on top of that as well.  For starters I experienced a half a minute up to 5 minutes long blackscreen before any cutscene would play. Because an intro cutscene would play before the start screen everytime the game starts and another one - summarising what had happened in the game before - everytime a game is loaded, this issue already made just starting the game an annoyance. Now add periodic crashes into the mix and the annoyance level is upped to eleven. The game crashed about two dozen times in the course of the game, mostly in the worst situations possible ('Oh, you just beat a sidequest in which you have to refight stronger versions of all bosses in a row without being able to save inbetween and you're just two steps away from a savepoint? Why don't you do it again? TROLOLOLO!'). Deadly Premonitions allows you to replay already finished chapters in order to pick up missed collectables or do sidequests, however during such replays saving is disabled until the chapter is finished, making crashes even worse than in the regular playthrough where often enough a savepoint is closeby.  Usually the crashes appeared somewhat randomly but then the game crashed everytime on the transition from chapter 8 to 9. Setting the compability mode to Windows 98 eventually got me through that part, though.  Additionally to long loading times and crashes there are some bugs with quests: After replaying earlier chapters quest items (especially temporary ones like keys for locked doors) are sometimes deleted from the inventory and can not be retrieved in normal ways. This happened to me once with an item needed for a side quest before I could finish said quest; in the end I had to change my savefile with an hex editor to get it back. Before playing I got the recommendation to play the game with a gamepad because, like many console games, it's supposed to play better that way. Turns out my gamepad (an old BigBen pad) isn't supported and because of the way gamepad integration is done in this port programs like x360ce or xpadder don't work with it rendering it impossible to use my gamepad. Still I found that keyboard + mouse controls worked well enough most of the time, only the handling of additional cars that can be bought later in the game is horrible.  Gameplay: Deadly Premonition's gameplay comes pretty close to what I wished Alan Wake, another game inspired by Twin Peaks, would be like: Almost at any time the player can choose to ignore the mainquest for a while and freely roam around the town of Greenvale, learning more about its citizen by questioning people, starting sidequests and searching for collectables.  At some points the game throws a puzzle at the player. The puzzles are few and they're really easy but it's still more than Alan Wake had to offer, which was mostly composed of cutscenes and filler combat. Speaking of which, a flaw Deadly Premonition shares with AW is boring, repetitive and clunky combat. Reducing the amount of combat or even removing it completely would have been an improvement in my opinion. In order to make up for less/no combat I would have loved to see the 'Profiling' feature expanded. Profiling, for me, is the #1 area where the game left a lot of unused potential. From the role profiling plays in the story one could assume it's a core part of the game but in the end it's pretty dull: At a crime scene the player sees a couple of noisy pictures showing the circumstances of the crime recreated by Agent Francis York Morgan, the game's protagonist, and now has to search for clues. Each found clue makes some of the pictures now appear clearly visible. And that's all. Turning these profiling sessions into puzzles, maybe even letting the players make their own deductions, leading to a branched-out (to some degree at least) storyline, would have vastly improved the whole game and further increased the incentive to replay finished chapters. So I didn't really like combat and the lackluster profiling that much but still both is 'okay' and far from gamebreaking. The one thing I hated about the gameplay are Quick Time Events. I hate QTEs in general but Deadly Premonition has some of the worst QTEs I've ever seen. An especially annoying QTE in the game makes you press buttons, apparently randomly chosen from four possibilities, in rather short time; be too slow or press a wrong button first and it's instant 'gameover, try again!' (including going through several black screens). Fortunately QTEs aren't that abundant but they were closer to making me quit the game for good than any of the technical issues. Deadly Premonition plays a bit like a Japanes horror shooter (think Resident Evil or Silent Hill) combined with an adventure game and a little bit of open-world.  Story/characters/music: The thing I enjoyed the most about the game are the wonderfully eccentric characters. It's full of well written, funny dialogues that are made even funnier by the often completely inappropriate background music. Or rather 'foreground' music, sometimes and seemingly random the music gets louder than the speech (like in a couple of other cases, the overall oddness of the game makes me unsure whether this is a bug or if it was than on purpose). Deadly Premonition can be very surreal sometimes. Still there are many scenes with a more serious tone (it's all about a murder case after all) and those work very well, too. Setting, characters and story are heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, therefore the aforementioned absurd dialogues are not surprising. Twin Peaks is among my favourite TV shows, so I highly enjoyed Deadly Premonition's setting. However from time to time the game draws a bit too heavily from its inspiration: some details about characters' backstories that get revealed through side quests are no big surprise if you've seen Twin Peaks. The main story line is, several parallels aside, mostly original, though. For the most parts it's well written and interesting but, especially towards the end, it gets cheesy and loses some of its charme. Biggest problem I had with the story was that, without need, the game gives an extremely obvious clue regarding the solution of the case very early on and no character, not even the alleged super-profiler Agent York, considers it during the investigation. Of course, from a meta perspective the game can't just end before it even really started but why bring a thing like that up at all then? Again I can't rule out that it wasn't done on purpose, though; maybe in order to lampshade B-movies from the 80s which are a recurring theme throughout the game and plotholes like that are not exactly a rare occurence in those movies.  Tl;dr in comment section
2087	If you love weird games and cult B-movies, then this is a must play. The graphics and shooting is nothing special, but the story, characters and dark humor makes this game very memorable. It is also super cheap when it's on sale ($2.79 CDN right now) and there are a lot of interesting side quests to do. This port is half-broken on PC so just Google Durante patch and read the installign instruction.
2088	Excellent story and characters, though not without its flaws. Most people think this game's main appeal is that it's 'so bad it's good,' but honestly it's the fact that its really easy to get emotionally invested in the weird cast of characters. That's not to say that hilariously bad elements are completely absent, but they're absolutely not the reason people like this game.
2089	I was going to say something bad about this game since the PC version of Deadly Premonition has one of the worse ports I have ever encountered (It's really bad on the PC &amp; the devs won't even bother fixing the PC version so Durante had to do their work for them) but I played the Xbox version of Deadly Premonition so I have something different to say (I know the xbox version doesn't include the Director's Cut but I had to play this game to see why it was in the cult section of videogames).  Deadly Premonition Review:  I usually have an average experience on most modern horror games like Outlast for example (I'm a very picky person on what I think is a good horror game) but this game gave me the best experience in the psychological, mystery horror genre &amp; I'm going to try to explain why.  Well for starters this game has one of the most interesting main characters in the world of horror. His name is Francis Morgan a.k.a York who has a split personality named Zach who helps him in his cases, every time he takes a sip of coffee he gets a random fortune or a message from it (I wish my coffee could do that) &amp; he has a unique talent of collecting clues then automatically getting his 'Profiling' skills running in his brain (The way he already knows what's going on is amazing, Sherlock Holmes would be proud). The game's strengths are the story, characters, the open world of Greenvale, the amount of side missions you can do (There are also trading cards that you can collect) &amp; the strong plot twists but there are downsides to this game like the combat for example but I'm not going to mention them because the game forgives it's flaws by having cheesy charm (It's hard to explain).  One of my friends gave a perfect word for this game which is 'Bat â¥â¥â¥â¥ crazy' (I played a lot of disturbing games to the point of being desensitized) &amp; I have to agree because the game has one of the weirdest characters in gaming history like Sigourney for example who is obsessed with warming her pot (Not the drug you idiot) &amp; I can't forget the transformation that Thomas had with a red dress later on in the game (Thomas get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off drugs). The story to this game is your typical who murdered this person scenario but the way the game feeds you the character's backstories &amp; the amount of thinking is brilliant, this game forces you to not trust everyone but it slowly weeds out your guesses (Me, my friend &amp; my family were having fun trying to guess the murderer &amp; we were all talking about theories on who the murderer is). The fact that the game is a combination of Resident Evil's combat (Resident Evil 4 mostly) &amp; the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto is a nice combination from the game director SWERY a.k.a Hidetaka Suehiro so I hope future game devs use an open world sandbox in future horror games.  Overall this game is a good example on how to make a good horror game without overusing cheap scares like jumpscares when the main thing you should be afraid of is the unknown &amp; to be aware of who you trust (If I missed anything then be sure to leave feedback so I can edit my review &amp; I forgot that shaving your beard gives you money).
2090	Deadly premonition tries to mix elements of an open world action game with a survival horror game and it achieves this goal to an extent. It is a poor pc port (although this is somehow mitigated by DPfix) and the production values are subpar but for those who are willing to dig deeper there is a valuable treasure to be found. The direction of the script is exceptional, the characters are well fleshed out and memorable (at least, most of them) and the overall mood is a perfect blend of comedy relief moments and serious thriller sequences. Also, the soundtrack is among the finest I've heard in any game the last 6-7 years. So, give it a try and see for yourself if you can appreciate a one-of-a- kind flawed gem
2091	After spending about 4 hours dicking around trying to understand why it was crashing so hard, i figured out it had to be started in windows 98 mode. Its playing like a lamb now, For the rest of the game the animations and emotes for their faces are laughable. I've been in the game for about 19 hours now and seems like i hardly made a dent, its so long but I am planning to beat the game. 6/10..it seems a little rough around the edges, but i mean it has its parts.  Edit: I've beaten the game and i can safetly say its a 9/10 :D.. once you get over the problems and glitches its a really interesting story, it actually made me tear up at the end Q_Q.
2092	Just one of the best games i've ever played. 11/10
2093	This is the hardest review I've ever had to write.  Having played through maybe half the game, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVE it. It does so many things right and the way it continues to surprise me at every turn is something I've never experienced before.  However, like when your awesome, kind, with-a-heart-of-gold-sweet-and-nice, but drunken uncle - who's usually the very best to hang out with, has the best stories, and showers you with genuine life wisdom at every opportunity - one day feeds your face a blank stare while he feels you up, it hurts like a m0therÂ£ucker.  It feels so disgusting and wrong that you feel your bones ache, no matter his 'good' intentions. And you know without a doubt, and with an indescribable sadness, that if it hadn't been for that specific unmentionable perk of his, he would have been THE greatest person ever, in all of history.  If Deadly Premonition would have gotten a decent PC-port IT would have been the greatest game ever. Instead, like your uncle's dark, ugly advances at you, it makes you suffer CTDs every hour or so, if you want to continue reaping the amazing benefits you get by playing.  And God help me, there's a REASON why I can't put it away despite that suffering; there's a reason I'm prostituting myself by still playing it. And I can't fathom or even remember any other title I would have done this for, thus my having to save at the towns phone booths every chance I get.  Because: Just like your drunk uncle - who feels you up every now and then, which feels so god damn wrong and unpleasant - the same guy has also recently provided the cure for every known sickness on earth, has the solution for world peace at hand, and is in the process of providing every common man with space travel to the new planets (yes, plural) he's discovered.  Just like that, it is a fact that the pesky, murky river of epic coding failure in Deadly Premonition also contains, not gold nuggets, but straight up gold BARS, of proportions previously unheard of.  And if you had that knowledge, could you, or not, look beyond your uncle Deadly Premonition's one recurring fault? Could you grind your teeth and hold on, just until the unpleasantness went away, just a couple of minutes with restarts every now and then, so he could deliver - to you and the world, yet another great moment? A moment you're not even sure what would entail this time around, but you knew it would blow you and the rest of the world away, and contribute to the ascension of man, soon rivaling the almighty himself?  I'll let you think about that for a minute while I leave you with this: This game has some of the best parts of Twin Peaks in it, combined with certain awesome moments taken straight out of the Seven movie, and lots and lots of the greatest kind of quirkiness - which always feels entertaining and amusing rather than annoying.  Even with the horribly easy and janky combat present; if they would only have done a decent port of this game, I would have given it top credit, just because of the big balls they had to make something so extraordinary.  In the land of generic FPSs, a dime a dozen Early Access $h1t3, and copied to boredom 4x games, Deadly Premonition is the undisputed king, emperor, and penultimate ruler when it comes to creativity and fun storytelling. As of now, it is unfortunately a title you will have to suffer quite a bit of CTDs to play through, but to me that suffering have paid off in abundance.  I am really not sure I can put it away, and I'm considering just taking small breaks every CTD and just naturally continue playing from my latest save point. There is no other great title, big bag of money, or warm and tight hole that would have me spinning 'round its little finger like this.  I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm probably letting uncle Deadly Premonition get away with it. Maybe you should too.
2094	Pro - Eccentric, creative storytelling with one of the most compelling and complex protagonists in recent years - budget-priced and enhanced from the original. Con - Game instability, stiff controls, limited soundtrack, repetitive sound samples, poor textures. Also gives me severe cravings for coffee.
2095	This game is one of the worst I've ever played, and I love every single second of it. From the begining, it is clear that a lot of love went into it, if only that love and care were equaled by skill and budget. The port is perhaps one of the worst ever made, lacking any graphical options whatsoever and being unplayable without a controller, to get any kind of control at all you need to install a fanmade patch or two. This isn't even getting into the myriad of glitches, poor audio mixing, and graphics that would make a dreamcast look down in shame, but there is way more too this game than all the technical problems.  You see, here is where the love comes in. From the begining, every character in the game is memorable, each has there own personality, traits, and even a unique schedule. The plot is fantastic and engaging, and at times even heartfelt and moving. It has a fantastic sense of offbeat humour that will remind enlightened players of Twin Peaks. Actually, the entire game will remind people of Twin Peaks, because from the setting to the characters to the music this game is a love letter to all things David Lynch. It should be no surprise that its flaws are just part of the charm, and together they make the game seem more complete for it.  Seriously, buy this game if you haven't already, you won't regret it.
2096	The graphics look like a ps2 game and the combat is kind of clunky, but this game makes up for it with pure charm.  Amazing story and great characters.    Download DPfix to improve the game   http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix 
2097	twin peaks the game.
2098	Great mystery story paired with quite poor combat parts and alot of issues with crashing in certain areas but 100% worth it to play all the way.   I highly recommend it!
2099	Picked this up for Â£2 during a sale, didn't expect much. Had to patch it and apply several weird fixes before it would run, and it kept crashing randomly. Even with a controller, the movement was a bit clunky, and the graphics are straight from 2005.  Despite all of that, Deadly Premonition is probably my favourite game of 2016. After sticking with it for a bit, the story becomes incredibly immersive, the characters you meet are funny and eccentric, and you can't help but fall in love with the game. The story is genuinely intriguing, and all the weird quirks (getting paid to peep into people's houses, stuffing your face with an endless supply of lollipops, main character's oddball rants) make the game even better.   Protips: - Only pick this up if you care about story in games. It's Deadly Premonition's strongest suit ... but also pretty much the only one. If you like story-rich RPGs, you will love this. - Don't take this game too seriously at the beginning.  - Play with a controller, it makes everything much more manageable. - Patch the game before you start!
2100	Got paid for shaving my face, and a giant, demonic dog fell from the sky and totaled my car.  10/10
2101	Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.  Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.  Technical addition: If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version. See this forum post on how to get it working right:  http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/forum/showthread.php?31550-Making-Xbox-One-Controller-Work-with-Windows-10-Please-Sticky 
2102	The Citizen Kane of video games.
2103	Honestly, I was surprised at how much I liked this game. I knew people had mixed views on it before playing, but I was not expecting the amazingly original storyline and surprise ending. If you think you're going to like this game even a little bit, it will probably surpass your expectations. Once you get it working, the awful port becomes just another quirk of this oddly satisfying game.
2104	this game is part tv murder mystery and part resident evil.   The game is long and could be boring if you can't get into it but has a enjoyable story. this game has alot of charm and if you can get past its short comings you'll really enjoy yourself.
2105	Whatâs that, Zach â youâre at your witâs end?  Honestly, I donât know where to start. DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game itâs not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadnât discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this Iâm glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So whatâs good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and itâs easy to see why itâs gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. Thereâs no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. Thereâs a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.
2106	Yes, absolutely. There are technical problems, and crashes, but those can mostly be overcome, and if you persevere it's one of the best game story experiences I've had.
2107	You can grow a beard 10/10
2108	This game took me a while to get into, honestly. The PC port is not fantastic, and it would crash on me frequently, until I found a fix that would make it crash every few hours instead of every hour. So, y'know, still frequent crashes. Also, the gameplay isn't great, with the driving being especially terrible and the combat kind of feeling superfluous. However, the story itself is pretty great, with twists and turns that you don't quite expect. It's campy and great. I can't heartily actually recommend everyone play it, but if it sounds cool to you, give it a shot.
2109	In Deadly premonition you play the role of FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, but you can call him York, everybody calls him that, sent to a town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While the premise sounds generic and cliche, Deadly Premonition is anything but that and is by far one of the most unique games I've ever played. Deadly Premonition features dated visuals, mediocre gameplay and more bugs than in your backyard yet it's still an extremely memorable and unique experience that shines most brightly on it's plot and narrative.   While I'm first and for most gameplay over everything when it comes to gaming, Deadly Premonition is one of the only, if not the only game I'd recommend based on it's setting, plot and characters. The game is a mixture of Thriller, Horror and Dark Comedy blended together in a extremely unique manner.  While you may be put off by the dated, crude presentation and bugs this game possesses, it's still an experience that I couldn't recommend enough if you can overlook it's faults. It's so bad that it's a masterpiece, think of the film Troll 2 which is widely regarded as the 'best worst film' of all time and is an absolutely hilarious masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. The gameplay itself is somewhat reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 but has some awkward controls, thankfully this does little to affect the game as the focus is on it's incredibly strong writing.  The story is absolutely brilliant thanks to the writers eccentric and quirky style, there really is nothing out there like this. Again I do recommend caution when buying this game, you'll need to tweak a few things in order to even get the game to run and there are a few mods which enhance the visuals and allow the game to be played 1080p but that aside this is an experience that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of crime stories and unique writing.
2110	This is the best worst game Ive ever played. Charming Japanese take on American Horrow. Wierd , bad graphics but also somehow as addictive as mainling a pound of heroin. Very light hearted yet very dark at the same time. WHY DO I LOVE THIS GAME?
2111	I mean, the game is objectively bad in many ways. I'm not going to tell you differently. But the ways in which it are bad are honestly what make it so amazing.  The absolute silliness of the plot, yet still manages to be surprising at points. The characters in the town itself whch give you ridiculous â¥â¥â¥ quests that make no sense. The ridiculously realistic driving simulator that makes the drive between missions actually be like 5 minutes of driving with no other action. It's so good and yet... well.  it's one of those games you have to play through at least once, probably twice, to really appreciate. It's just uhh... play it. It's easily one of my favourite games ever, and I honestly have no idea why.
2112	'Do u fell it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' DP is one of the strangest video games of all time. 10/10
2113	The best bad-good game money can buy.
2114	'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it. Yesterday morning the milk I poured in my coffee made a sign. It said, âTomorrow youâll arrive in a place that will change your fate.ââ  2 out of 2 peaks.
2115	 This game is truly one-of-a-kind and one of the few games I would encourage everyone to play.   I will get this out of the way first - this game is a horrible PC port. It can require a lot of messing around to even get it to run, and if you want it to run higher than 720p then you will have to install mods to achieve that. I would personally experience drops in frame-rate followed by the game crashing approximately every 2 hours on my setup but your problems may vary! (The directorâs cut does have some pro's compared to the original even though it is a bad port - the controls are improved and the combat is easier - in a good way)  It's a testament to the compelling nature and uniqueness of this game that I would gladly put up with such an experience.  You play as FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called to a remote town called Greenvale to investigate a murder of a young woman - and it doesn't take long to become clear that there is something very strange indeed going on. The game has been compared a lot to the TV Show 'Twin Peaks' and it is a clear influence - for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it combines mystery with quirky characters and absurd happenings and this game is no different.  It is full of weird, clichÃ© (in comedic fashion) and intriguing people - everyone has their own odd quips and interactions that make the game interesting and fun. It can be confusing at first as you try to decide if the game you are playing and the dialogue you are hearing is serious or not - but soon you will lose yourself in the combination of mystery and absurdity and want to experience all that Greenvale has to offer.  The game is all about the experience and storyline - you will drive around town and engage in combat throughout much of the game - neither of them are anything special. They are both very archaic and along with the graphics are not what you would expect in a relatively modern game. For my experience though I never had any particular  problem  with either of them, they are just not what make the game enjoyable. However, although the driving itself isn't great, there is something very pleasureable about travelling around the town and engaging in your day to day tasks like going to lunch with your police colleagues or going to a bar in the evenings to play darts and talk with the townsfolk.  It is the mad characters, the crazy music, the twists, the absurd and even genuinely touching moments that shine in this game and keep you coming back. I have never really ever experienced a game quite like it and (although I would love one) I will perhaps not play another like it again.  A very unique game - one with plenty of flaws but also so much to love. I would recommend all people with an interest in story-driven games to try it out.
2116	This game is great Zach
2117	N.B. There are some computers that the game just will not display properly on. It's fine on my AMD PC, but my Nvidia laptop can't display any text without severe distortion (both run 64-bit Windows 7, and have the same issue with Amnesia the Dark Descent). I don't know why, but if you can get a demo from somewhere to test whether it works, or check the forums, it might help. Also, this game is available on Xbox 360 and PS3, if you find the PC version isn't for you, although the PS3 version is the same as the Steam version (The Director's Cut).  This is one of the few buggy games I would recommend to people, and there are very good reasons why. For starters, it's horrifying and unique. The story sticks in my mind the way that Walking Dead has, and may I say, even more so.  Did you like Twin Peaks? Do strange events picque your curiosity? Then this game could be for you. You play the role of a FBI agent with a split personality. The twist here is that you, the player, are treated like the secondary personality. York needs your help to solve a cross-country murder spree, which brings him to the town the game is set in.  Mr Francis York Morgan is thust into a stunningly creepy town that appears norma on the surface, but harbours secrets in almost every home. Help York to stop the Raincoat Killer, and oh so much more. Scratch away the surface and look deeper, take your time and explore the world, talk to people each day, and you'll experience the best this story can offer you.  Please, if you feel you can handle a few bugs, give this game a go if only for the plot. Save often lest it crashes (but I've had to do that with Saints Row 4 about the same number of times). This game isn't about combat - it's about everything else. Solve the puzzles, find rare items for townsfolk to help you in your mission, remember the past and recount the present.   If you fancy something strange, and you don't mind rough edges, *please* try this game. Wait for a sale if you're unsure, but don't let it pass by without trying it. Even a year after playing it, the 36 hours I spent in this world are still etched in my mind. Thumbs up all the way.
2118	Do you like David Lynch? Do you like comfy white America? Do you like Neo-Noir? Do you like Twin Peaks?  Then get it.
2119	'Mr. Francis York Morgan, you are the protagonist of the generation. So says Mr. Stewart'  To summarize Deadly Premonition, the graphics suck balls. The driving sucks balls. The combat sucks balls. The animations suck balls. In fact the entire control scheme sucks monkey balls. But underneath all this ball sucking lies an absolute gem of a game.   The plot is great and the script is actually extremely well-written. I dare say these two factors were probably the only driving force behind my decision to see this game to the end. A higher budget and better production values might've done wonders with the game.  This game is one huge package of silliness. A lot of the time it will make you laugh but mostly you will be laughing at the game itself. Deadly Premonition is a game where you see your fortune in the morning cup of coffee. And there's an hour-long level where you're running after a dog. Did I mention that dog had its own rap theme song?   And just when you think this game couldn't get any stranger, the final two chapters take â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ness to a whole new level. Lovely!  Deadly Premonition is not a game you recommend to anybody. But it most definitely is a game that should be played at least once.
2120	A very flawed masterpiece. Frequent crashing and inability to play full-screen almost put me off playing through but I'm glad I did. It takes a while to get going but this is a brilliant game worthy of your time, with memorable characters, great music and a storyline straight out of Twin Peaks.
2121	To get it out of the way first, the PC port is pretty damn bad, even with DPFix. Unlike the Dark Souls port which was good (no new bugs, old bugs fixed, solid FPS, it runs, etc.), this port is falling apart at the seams. There's old bugs, new bugs, plenty of crashes, and what have you.  However, the core of the game's story, ie: the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. There's just something to the overall charm of these things that makes it easy to overlook the issues. In fact, some of the issues feel like they add to the game. The janky animations, the poorly balanced voice clips, the comically bad car handling, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game.  Even with all it's issues, this is a great game!
2122	 WARNING : This game is buggy as hell, and requires a lot of patience and/or workarounds to play.   Deadly Premonition  -- which may as well be called  Twin Peaks: The Game  -- is a great game idea poorly executed and even more poorly ported to the PC from consoles. Game-breaking bugs (such as disappearing keys) and random crashes (only avoided by playing problematic sections in Windows 98 compatibility mode) will bite you if you're not expecting them, so consulting a guide or walkthrough ahead of each section is practically compulsory.  So... why am I recommending it? Despite its faults,  Deadly Premonition  is so delightfully weird that I can't  not  recommend it. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the murdery mystery is compelling, and the comic relief is hilariously bizarre.  Pick it up on sale (it's often about $2.50) and you'll definitely get your money's worth.
2123	BE WARNED! there is a crazy amount of glitches in the PC version. I only give this a good rating because the story is so great. It's Twin Peaks if it were to have been made in Japan.
2124	I would call this game the 'best worst game ever.' It's basically â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, a plot taken directly from Twin Peaks, and I love it. It's hard to describe what makes this game so good, without just playing it for yourself. So, pick it up while it's cheap, and play it, and it'll change your life.  Also, the squirrels make monkey sounds, and it's the best.
2125	I don't really know words of how to describe how fricking werid this game is. It feels like a game that was locked in a time capsule that was only unearthed three years ago(2010) if you like twin peaks or games that are just bizarre then this could be your cup of coffee  
2126	It's such a good game, unfortunatley a lazy effort on the developers part. At launch there was no controller support, however that has now been patched, but the game itself can still be borderline unplayable unless patched with DPfix (the same person who fixed the Dark Souls port). Even with that patch however the game still suffers from a range of glitches, bugs, crashes and audio/visual problems, still it's hard to not recommend this game. After all it's problems have been sorted out, this is easily one of the best games on Steam, with a good sense of humor and some nice references to certain things in pop culture (such as Twin Peaks), you might want to hold of purchasing it until ALL of the problems have been fixed.
2127	It's really hard to rate Deadly Premonition. In one hand it's utterly broken, buggy and sometimes even outdated, but it's also very clever, atmospheric and unique. Basically DP is an open-world investigating taking place in a little town, just like Twin Peaks. But this description just doesn't cut it. It's also extremely bizarre, weird and often creepy. The 'side quests' are also very different from what you're used to, they mostly revolve around getting to know the people of Greenvale, and actually this is how I spent around 3/4 of my almost 40 hour playthrough... just getting to know this town and the people living in it. York (and Zach) the 2 in 1 detective, George the king of the town, Harry the weird millionaire who always wears a mask for some reason... and even though you get to know the characters very well, they still managed to keep the thing that are important well hidden, lurking in the background, just so they can surprise you with it later. The story and the narrative are just perfect. Same could be said for the soundtrack and the voice actors, all top-notch. All in all Deadly Premonition is a terribly broken, ugly (and despite these) amazing game, which I'd wholeheartedly recommend to all my friends :) This is probably as close as we'll ever gonna get to a Twin Peaks game folks!
2128	This is probably the most broken release I've ever purchased on Steam, and I do not regret it at all.  Fantastic game with some low-budget development that constantly shows, but has an amazing plot. The characters and plot alone justify this purchase despite that you  will  have to use DPfix to get the most of this experience.  That is all.  Buy it, you casual scum.
2129	Don't play without  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/  Look for DPfix The game crashes regularly. Save FREQUENTLY.  That being said, it's an amazing game and nothing else like it exists. It will leave an impression on you for as long as you live, especially if you like B movies. You like the strange and the bizarre, don't you, Zach?
2130	Nice shot. Amazing. Bullseye. Nice sho- Nice shot. Amazing.
2131	 1. The Port,  Let's get this out of the way. The port is bad. No graphics options, 720p only. This can be fixed by using the DPfix by Durante, and downloading HD fonts, HUD and icons. The game likes to crash for many reasons and in many different ways. Most of them can be prevented by smoking cigarettes (in the game, but I can assure you it also helps IRL), editing the exe file with CFF Explorer, running the game with compatibility mode set to Win98, running the game in window mode and/or changing default controls to a gamepad. There's apparently a bug that corrupts your save file, but I luckily haven't encountered that one.  During my 29 hours of gameplay at least 5 of them I had to replay because of the crashes. Googling, setting and fixing stuff to be able to even play the game took me around another 3 hours.  It was worth it.   2. The Gameplay.  Deadly Premonition is an open-world survival horror detective action adventure game. You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee). During the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights. The combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.  The attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.  Let's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.   3. The Story.  FBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game. The cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.   4. The Characters.  This has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms. The whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.   5. The Summary.  Don't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned   (and those that I did not)   - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.  Objectively 9.5/10.
2132	Looks like blend of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. Worth trying.
2133	Many people say the port is terrible but in my opinion the game runs fine! Deadly premonition has a nice concept. The game doesnt have the best acting, graphics, and animations but the gameplay wise is really fun. Found it interesting that you can drive around town, you gotta eat food, and etc.   Game isnt worth 24.99 but its def worth the price when it goes on sale!
2134	York is the greatest video game protagonist of all time and Deadly Premonition's story, characters, humor, atmosphere, soundtrack and sheer personality are way above what you will find in most critically acclaimed titles. It's not without its flaws, like a subpar combat system and bad graphics (even for the time), but it's totally unique and isn't afraid to experiment, something sorely lacking in other games.  If you own a Xbox 360, play the regular version there instead of this one. The little improvements of the Director's Cut aren't worth it, since this port suffers from common crashing issues and some bugs.  However, a bad port is still better than not playing Deadly Premonition, so if this is your only option of experiencing the game, go for it. Just be aware of the following:  - Check  the PC Gaming Wiki  [pcgamingwiki.com]  and its tutorial on installing DP Fix, SweetFX, better textures and solutions for crashing;  - Always run the game directly through DP.exe instead of Steam or other methods;  - In order to get an item that will make navigating through the game much easier and more pleasant, do Side Missions No. 004 &amp; 005 (George's sidequests) as soon as possible;  - Do not read the description of the Trading Cards before finishing the game, since some of them contain spoilers.   F... K... In the coffee! It never fails. 
2135	the game is good on console  the true mystery is how to get this port working
2136	Looks like blend of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. Worth trying.
2137	One of the most emotional games I've ever played. It was amazing, right Zach?
2138	I finished the game but the final cutscenes were so unwatchable due to the fact they were each seperate pieces which took more than an hour to load. I had to just close the game and watch the ending on youtube. Wont bother with all the extra stuff because it's such a pain going through any loading screen. I am aware this is the main complaint for the PC version of this game but I didn't expect it to be as troublesome as it was...Yolo
2139	I can't think of a harder game to score, so I am glad I stopped giving them this year. The best way I can describe this is L.A. Noire meets Silent Hill, and that is some pretty hefty praise coming from me. The action could definitely be annoying, not unlike Silent Hill, but the story and all of the little touches elevated the game well above the sum of its parts. Looking back, I wonder how many of the deadly sins the 'big bad' committed throughout the game. I could think of a few right away once I realized his persona. My only regret is that I didn't start chasing the side quests early enough to get them all done, and I really can't recommend the experience enough.
2140	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâs amazing. 10/10
2141	PLAY THIS GAME FOR THE BEST EXPERIANCE EVER
2142	Go to where Steam is installed -&gt; SteamApps -&gt; common -&gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut -&gt; redist. Scroll all the way down until you find 'PhysX_SystemSoftware' right click it -&gt; Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch! ______  Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.  Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!  Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit. At least that's what I saw in my coffee..
2143	It's a weird game that had me wondering how to back up the fact that it entertained me, but I'm pretty sure it will entertain you as well if you give this glitchy PC release a chance.  7/8  No refunds.  Actually, you can get a refund now. What I meant was that you wouldn't be getting it from me personally. Yeah.
2144	Such a strange game. Recommended if you like games that quickly change the tone from horrifying, to hilarious in just a few moments.  Top soundtrack, easily one of the more memorable ones:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition OST- Life is Beautiful&nbsp;
2145	Aside from the crashes, and visual DEFECTS this game has gone through it's up there in my top 5 games. It's optimal to play this with a controller, and there's mods to fix a lot of this game up.
2146	I spent a few hours trying to get the game to work. It's crashed dozens of times. The graphics are awful. The port is basically a mess.  But despite it all this is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.   If you like a good story and enjoy well written characters then you won't want to put this cult classic down for a second. Don't forget to use DPFix!
2147	Twin Peaks - The video game, if your a fan of the 1989-1992 TV series Twin Peaks, u will LOVE THIS GAME the story, the characters, the fact that u can wait around town and catch unsuspecting citizens doing strange things, also therte is no other open world survival horror games like this, it truely is one of a kind...  NOW, the problem.... getting this thing to run, the devs really left the work to us, u MUST download a mod to get the game up to 1080p, but once u get this game running smooth, it really is the best way to experience the game, the 360 and ps3 versions each have their strengths and faults, but neither are a good experience, finally being able to ewnjoy this game at 1080p 60fps, and it is really a one-of-a-kind experience  PC:specs: mayber this will help anyone with a similar rig Intel i7 3770K (overclocked to 4.5ghz) 16 gb RAM GPU : R9 280x (overclocked to 1100mhz) [also known as Radeon HD 7900 series] SSD: Samsung 500gb EVO Operating system : Windows 8.1  Game options: DPfix (1080P run in a window) compatability options : DEFAULT!!!! the game will not run through the launcher, however the launcher itself runs to change input/controller settings. run the game by clicking the dp.exe directly  EVERY system is different to get this game to run perfectly, but i hope this helps.
2148	I played the GoG version of this game first. (So, don't be fooled by the time Steam is displaying :D)  tl;dr at the bottom  Let me say that this is one of the best games I  ever  played.  It is hard to compare this game to any other title... it has some sort of open world, a bit of RPG, a whole lot of an adventure....   It starts very strange and you don't have any clue what awaits you. But if you aren't afraid of that, you'll find yourself in a great adventure-thriller-detective-horror.... thingy.... o.O It's really hard to describe,  what  this game actually is.   The game has all sorts of moments. It is sometimes very creepy, sometimes ridiculus, exciting, surprising....  I really enjoied it and played the whole game within some days.   tl;dr
2149	This game is great if you're okay with doing some H E A V Y modding before playing
2150	God awful port of a great game.
2151	Twin Peaks teeters on the very edge of exquisite absurdity. Its genius is that it plays both on the level of subtly ludicrous melodrama and on the level of a baffling whodunit, as most lines of dialogue appear to contain a hidden meaning, most faces a dark secret.
2152	Played a few hours on it. Fantasic atmosphere, comedy, character and it seems to have a lot of depth. Really fun. PLaying it on windows 7 x64, it does have a bug but theres plenty of explainations how to fix it and its just 1 simple fix. No fps problems or glitches, plays well.
2153	Such a strange game. Recommended if you like games that quickly change the tone from horrifying, to hilarious in just a few moments.  Top soundtrack, easily one of the more memorable ones:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition OST- Life is Beautiful&nbsp;
2154	'The balance of milk and butter you've achieved here... oh my...'
2155	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

2156	best unplayable game Ive never played
2157	When I run the game for the first time (it was on XBOX360 back then) and saw the graphics, I was one step to ditching the best and most emotionally capturing games I've ever played! Nothing to say more. Get it and play it! But don't listen to other people, saying you have to play on hardest difficulty right from the start to get all the fun. Just don't, you'll hate the game. Finish the game on normal or easy and only then switch on Hard mode. Fun guaranteed!
2158	I don't think I've spent more time on the starting menu on any other game than this.  This is not a game, this is an art.
2159	Very good and price on super sale it kind reminds me of resident evil type games. exellent. recommended.
2160	Best imaginary friend award Also it's a hilarious game so you should definitely check it out lol :D
2161	This is my first ever Steam review and unfortunately itâs going to be more of a fix suggestion than a review (my review was very long initially but Steam wouldnât allow me to submit it so I had to chop it considerably). I was able to fix this game (so that it ran) fairly quickly. Here's how I did it:  1. Go to where the game is installed on your PC. For me it's at C &gt; Program Files (x86) &gt; Steam &gt; steamapps &gt; common &gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut 2. Open the redist file and double-click the application called PhysX_SystemSoftware (.msi) 3. Select the Repair option and let it run through completely.  4. When that's finished, launch the game again.  NOTE: I should point out that I AM running the game in compatibility mode (Windows XP SP3). For me, this fix worked immediately. I DID NOT download the 4GB patch that's been suggested! I hope this helps some of the people who were having trouble.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! I can't recommend it enough. In fact, it's one of my favorite games of all-time (I played the 360 version previously). However, if you are expecting not to have to caress this game softly in order to make it purr â it is probably not for you!  If you are willing to put in a little effort though - I think you will be pleasantly surprised at everything you get out of this game.

2164	F. K. in coffee! As clear as a spring morning! But the port falters.
2165	The definition of so bad it's good. What the game lacks in control and gameplay it makes up for in solid story, quality voice acting, memorable characters, and a genuinely interesting series of plot twists.   The game frequently goes on sale for $2.49 so theres no reason you shouldn't own this masterpiece.  Isn't that right Zach?  (This is my favorite game. I have a 360 copy factory sealed in box which has already tripled in value since release.)
2166	 Genre: Horror/Third-person shooter
2167	- Horrible port - Constant crashes - Wonky and buggy driving physics - Poor graphics - Terrible map and navigation system - The open world is almost completely empty - Some awful voice acting - Nonsensical dialogue and writing - Ridiculous characters and situations - Combat so derivative and crappy I can see them going 'Hmm, yeah, this didn't turn out so great... Let's just add a bunch of easily obtainable cheat weapons as standard otherwise no one's going to bother slogging through this.'  And despite (and a bit because) all of the above the game still manages to be utterly charming in that very peculiar Japanese way, it's a bit like Twin Peaks presented in the style of House of the Dead 2, and I sunk nearly 50 hours 100%-ing the game (including many, many restarts trying to work around bugs and problems or replaying sections due to crashes.) Common sense dictates the list above should really have precluded that, but somehow the essence of the game just made me embrace it all.  I don't quite know either.
2168	Original story and gameplay. Fantastic soundtrack.
2169	Solve crimes.  Fight zombies.  Talk to your imaginary friend.  Shave your beard.  Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ is that a giant zombie dog behind my car?  That is a giant zombie dog behind my car.  Don't read the achievements' descriptions.  FUN.
2170	Horey shet, this game is great.  First things first though, while 'directors cut' is slightly different from the original on the consoles, its a horrible PC port. Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.  I absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.  All in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues. Its an amazing, crazy, weird, funny and extremely interesting.  I'd r8 it an 8/8 m8, no h8.
2171	So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.  Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic 'who dun it', story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.   The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,  bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.   I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.  Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed. In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  
2172	This game is quirky, unpolished and unfortunately very crash prone - but nonetheless a hidden gem in my opinion. Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.
2173	Deadly Preminition is a bizzare game. On paper, it's not that impressive. Dated graphics, awkward gameplay, stiff animations, lack of creature design, various audio and visual bugs to boot. But still there's some charm reminiscent of the David Lynch series Twin Peaks, including a protaganist that feels very influenced by the series itself. I can't really say much more without spoiling some of wackyness and weirdness that goes on within the game itself however.   The Japanese historically haven't had a good time with PC ports (As consoles are the dominant market in Japan) and this game is no different. With repeated reports of not opening (Simple fix, go into your DP files and delete the one for PhysX) and audio and visuals not matching up, but Durante has released some fixes for the game. Which help it a lot with visual resolutions and some of the massively gamebreaking bugs.  It has tons of charm, a great soundtrack and a few moments of 'What the â¥â¥â¥â¥' Worth playing for curiosity alone but I'd wait for a sale on it.
2174	Do you like weird games? Let me rephrase that. Do you like Resident Evil, Shenmue, Persona and Silent Hill? Do you want to play them at all once?  Deadly premonitions looks bad, controls bad and would overall be a bad game if it were not for the brilliant absudity it offers. Moments of tension and mystery are intersped between hilariously bad writing and super cheesy dilogue. Deadly Premonitions is the rare example of a horror-comedy in video games and is an absoloute must play for anyone. The PC port offers a better control scheme than the PS3 version, but it also comes with it's own limitations. Rising Star gave us one of the worst ports of all time. For some reason the game is locked into 720p and though it touts controller compatability it is entire incompatable with XInput controllers, meaning your 360 or logitech controllers will not work without third party programs. There are a coouple fixes from a clever modder to fix the display issues, but otherwise get the PS3 version instead.
2175	Well this is the best experience i have ever got from a video game, mixed with some really annoying designer choices. It is absolutely not a game for everyone, but if you can look past the problem on the surface you will find a very interesting and touching story with great characters. Personally, i am not going to forget this game ever.
2176	plays like Shenmue, If Shenmue were an extremely weird Noir parody/Third Person Shooter/RE4.  one of a kind game with story and world that is well worth putting up with the dated controls, this ain't yo daddy's open world adventure!
2177	I came in to this game with a lot of doubts, following the comments around the web concerning poor graphics and gameplay mechanics and random crashes. I learned about it when I saw an article about Durante (The guy who fixed Dark Souls on the PC), so when I learned that he was working to fix things, I bought the game right out.  After 20 + hours in game, I can say this is one of the best games I ever played. Sure it has problems, but the excellent script and crazy story, overcome those limitations.  You can make it better in the graphics departement by installing DPfix and SweetFX.  It finally comes down to taste. You will either love this game or hate it. I just love it. :)
2178	Original story and gameplay. Fantastic soundtrack.
2179	plays like Shenmue, If Shenmue were an extremely weird Noir parody/Third Person Shooter/RE4.  one of a kind game with story and world that is well worth putting up with the dated controls, this ain't yo daddy's open world adventure!
2180	I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.  The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an â¥â¥â¥ losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, 'Are you there, Zach?'
2181	This game is just amazing! What else can I say? Yes, a bit strange. I mean... I first heard about it from a guy, who played prologue and all the the time said something like 'How glitchy it is' and 'He speaks with coffee??? What a psycho!'. He didn't play after this, but after this 'little conversation' I wanted to play this so much. So I without second thinking bougth this ASAP. And I have never regretted about it.  PS. I didn't have any glitches, so, I think, my friend just had problems with his computer.
2182	This game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing art masterpiece!  So many feelings - it just puts you in right away with all the characters and atmosphere. Lots of laughter, drama, many wtf moments, challenging gameplay, beautiful cinematics and a decent dosage of a cry... One of a kind game, it will go down in the history as one of the most â¥â¥â¥â¥'d up, dramatistic, humoristic and unique games of all time...  A great example that you don't need perfect graphics or gameplay to make a great game, it's all about the originality and creativity, all the bugs n â¥â¥â¥â¥ made this game to what it is!  And yeah, animations &amp; dialogues are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing golden, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ should be nominated for an Oscar! Zach &amp; Francis York Morgan, Max Payne and Alan Wake - perfect combination! :D
2183	A misunderstood masterpiece about an FBI agent who solves spooky murders with his trusty imaginary friend Zach and his amazing psychic coffe that gives him hints for future events. The game has it all, fishing,driving,shooting,survival horror,eating,sleeping,exploring,racing,puzzle solving,an open world,comedy and drama. It's a game you just have to experience, be warned thought the PC version comes with lots and lots of crashes which will often ruin your amazing adventures with FBI agent York but push on my friend, don't let a bunch of bbbbb----- *error* DP.exe has stopped responding  999999 / 10 This game makes me happy to be alive
2184	Getting pass a few bugs here and there with the game sometimes crashing after a 'cutscene', the game runs fine.  Graphics aren't the greatest but the story line is where this game really shines. Did not expect the game to last over 10 hours as I did do a few sidequests. The gameplay is pretty generic with a bit of quick time action buttons and inventory management of sorts resident evil style. For achievement hunters, most of the achievements will be from doing the side quests or looking for items scattered around the map so expect to spend over 30 or more hours if you plan on getting 100% in the game. There will be a lot of driving around and there is no GPS guidance other than a huge arrow pointing main quest location, so you will need to use the map occassionally to find yourself around to the next point.  Got the game for free during a bundle promotion, but I would say the game is worth it at a discounted price of atleast 50%. Rating the game 7.1/10 mainly due to the story line being so good, but driving to each point is a hassel.
2185	It's like Stephen King wrote script and David Lynch directed... (sic!) a videogame! A videogame that didn't suck! Highly recommended!
2186	This game is quirky, unpolished and unfortunately very crash prone - but nonetheless a hidden gem in my opinion. Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.
2187	This game is just amazing! What else can I say? Yes, a bit strange. I mean... I first heard about it from a guy, who played prologue and all the the time said something like 'How glitchy it is' and 'He speaks with coffee??? What a psycho!'.

I didn't have any glitches, so, I think, my friend just had problems with his computer.
2188	I love this game. I've waited a long time to play, and had my prejudices, but I was quickly drawn into the story, it kept me interested all the way to the end. The graphics are sub-par, but that can be partially amended with a tool called dpfix. Acting and writing are hilarious at some points, I have to admit this game isn't really scary - but it delivers a few scares in the combat sections.   Overall, I had a very pleasant experience, I played the game with a walkthrough as I didn't want to miss useful items (or get them too late in the game). Maybe due to that the game hasn't been too difficult, but I don't see that as an issue - it was a very pleasant ride. Side quests are optional, and they do add a bit of game time, but, as mentioned, some yield quite useful items.
2189	This game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing art masterpiece!  So many feelings - it just puts you in right away with all the characters and atmosphere.

2190	Twin Peaks ripoff: The game Now with more zombies and stupid crap that doesnt make sense, LOVE IT!
2191	Played the PS3 version. One of the most memorable gaming experience...in so many ways.
2192	Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made.  That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.  The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.  So pretty much it is Twin Peeks.   Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.  Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.  He is Smug and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as 'Zach' But I will not spoil how that ends. York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.  Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.   The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.  You probably will learn your way around the town.  Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.  While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.   In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! 'The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary.'  The enemyâs you fight 'all 1 of them' are called Mysterious Shadows.  They look like zombies with clown make up on.  And they make stupid noises when they die.  The shooting works but it wonât blow your mind or anything but it works. Melee weapons work decently.   The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.  It's baffling when it happens.  The game in general is 'unintentionally' funny.  The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.  There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.  He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time.  There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.   Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10 Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!
2193	I read about Deadly Premonition before and always wanted to play it, so when i saw it on steam, i immediately bought it, but unfortunately wasn't able to play very far with it's awful keyboard controls. So left it untouched until i got myself a good controller. DP's port is awful, honestly - no proper screen options and locked resolution, so it looked a bit weird on my monitor. A lot of bugs and glitches here and there, and it crashed on me every couple of hours or so, luckily nothing fatal enough to prevent me from beating it. But it did turn the rest of the game into 'from checkpont to checkpoint' and sometimes made me worry about losing my progress more, than about what's actually going on in there. But, aside from all technical troubles, Deadly Premonition is a pure gem. It's weird, it's strange, it's silly and charming, with not that good voice acting, hilarious face animation, great humor, old graphics, memorable characters, amazing soundtrack and interesting story, that will actually hit you in the face with a huge hammer in the last chapters - assuming you didn't give up earlier because of everything above. TL;DR an absolute must-have for everybody, who loves really good stories and can show some patience for clumsy gameplay and technical issues in order to see it all.
2194	murder in the uncanny valley.
2195	The most unique game ever made. Mindblowing plot, good humour and awesome atmosphere. Hope i'll see another games like this some day. As for PC port quality, beating all bugs and technical issues totally worth it.
2196	I cant aim up and I cant re4 shoot a nest 11/10 the coffee didnt warned me about this â¥â¥â¥â¥
2197	This is one of the most memorable and unique videogames I've played in my life...and believe me, I've played A LOT!  It's really hard to describe what makes this experience work but it does. Is it the atmosphere? Is it the narrative? Is it the characters?  This game is a hit or miss. You either like it or not. As for me, well, I became obsessed with this game while I played it and while I didn't...so much that I went for the 100% completion.
2198	Despite having no right to be, this is one of my favourite games. It's utterly bizarre but I love it to bits. Please play it. It's a weird gem with some utterly horrible gameplay but it is somehow special.
2199	I cant aim up and I cant re4 shoot a nest 11/10 the coffee didnt warned me about this â¥â¥â¥â¥
2200	Now that is a good biscuit. I've never tasted a biscuit this delicious.
2201	'FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan. Please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.'
2202	Heyyo, 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P  I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, 'But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.' Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.  The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think thatâs the biggest strength in this game. Itâs interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.  The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, itâs quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and donât flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5. The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as youâd expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.  Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1âs and those budget games youâd find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.  So yeahâ¦ vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I donât know the development cycle and I donât know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didnât focus inâ¦ but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you donât saveâ¦ so itâs up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).  There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods   Hope this helpsâ¦ so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)
2203	Twin Peaks the game.  Damn fine coffee/10
2204	-Worth Playing- -I bought it in a Steambundle!-
2205	This is my 2nd favorite game. My first game is Zombies Ate My Neighbors for thr SNES.   Im hard to impress with any game past the early 2000's so that says something.   Yea, I'm basically a retro hipster â¥â¥â¥ or whatever they're called.  Edit: I do recommend this game and I ask that people please upvote this so others can see what issues there are. I don't care about uprates on steam or whatever it's called. I don't even understand why people say +rep. I just don't want someone to buy this and then have the same issues I'm having as well as the rest of the players who own this. You can see all the issues just by visiting the community hub and seeing all of the people who have this and other issues. Also the issue I'm about to explain has never happened to me until a week or so ago and I've owned the game since October of 2014 I believe. Seriously view the community hub or read whats below this long boring explanation so you can see what you'll be getting yourself into if you decide to buy this game.  P.S. I bought it on sale for $4.99 so I don't feel like an idiot for buying a game that's buggy as fk compared to paying $24.99 for it which it isn't worth IMO because of all the issues.  I cannot get this game to run whatsoever anymore. Whenever I click play it immediately says 'dp.exe has stopped working' and 1 second or less after that is switches from trying to find the solution to 'close/cancel'.   I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified the integrity of the game cache, I have even watched several youtube videos watching people fix it by clicking on properties - local files - browse local files and then only to see that for some reason no matter how many times I reinstall the game I am missing 3 files inside the local files where you can find the .exe to launch the game aka the binaries folder basically. I ended up downloading dpfix 0.9.5 but that didn't help at all. After downloading the dpfix 0.9.5 I have all the files and tried to start the game. Crashed same as before. I followed the video showing me what to do with the files that I now have. Crashed again the same as before. I've been told that downgrading my nvidia drivers or graphics or whatever it is by 5 updates or so might help but I haven't tried that yet because I just don't feel like doing that atm. I've done several other things but they've slipped my mind atm. If I remember them I will come back and add them.  Link to one of the youtube videos I watched -         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition Directors Cut Crash Fix&nbsp;
2206	You play as FBI agent Fancis York Morgan, a delusional man that gets crime clues from his coffee, and talks to his 'imaginary' friend Zach, more than he talks to real people, in front of real people. He's sent to Twin Peaks (can't remember the name of the town, and its twin peaks anyways) to investigate a murder case that seems relate to a killer he's been investigating for some time.  The game is a collision of genres and elements that tries to be so many things at the same times, but really doesnt have the budget or technical prowess to truly be the game it could be...That being said, I enjoyed this game a lot, from its strange characters, that by the end make York look like a normal guy, to the sandbox exploration elements in a nearly lifeless massive town that brings to the table, for no good reason, like everything else in this game, and still works.   This game is a...Sandbox Survival Horror Simulator Adventure Third Person Shooter Fishing Exploration Game with day and night cycles where all characters have their daily routine...What the hell did I just say? And the game totally half asses most of those genres.  A technical disaster that manages to be one of the most unique, funny, weird and all around insane games, Isn't that right, Zach?  I Love it
2207	I honestly had my feelings about this game constantly change the moment I heard about it. I originally ignored it thinking it wasn't for me, then thinking it wasn't that great. Once the PC version was announced my interest in the game was sparked again, and I looked into it. Eventually got it as a gift on steam cause it was cheap and me and my cousin get each other games for our birthdays, and I am so glad I played it. Now, the thing about this game is the gameplay is not the best part. In fact it's a little weak, fun, but not too strong. It's obvious that they were indeed forced to include the RE4 style combat by the publisher, and I bet the game would've been better if more focus on the breath holding mechanic was your main way of dealing with enemies. Another thing some people might consider weak is the voice acting, and while it is 'bad', a lot of people have such a charm to them that I actually like the voice acting. The games music is also wonderful, especially the classic whistle tune you hear throughout most of the game. The graphics while looking dated, don't look dated in a bad way to me. They give a cozy feeling.  Now outside of things like music, graphics and gameplay, the PC version does have some notable issues. One is the lack of graphics and resolution options, which doesn't bother me but just cause I don't care doesn't mean it isn't an issue. The game also tends to crash, and for a while I had no way of continuing without using another save file ahead of me to avoid a crash, which fixed itself for me but not everyone. I'm not aware of any other issues, but if you find yourself discovering more issues before purchasing the game then look into getting the original release of the game on the Xbox 360, because while it has it's own issues the Director's Cut doesn't have, there are more game crashing, lag and other issues present in the Director's Cut versions of Deadly Premonition than there is in the original version.  In the end, besides that one crash I got which fixed itself I would highly recommend this game, on any platform, just that if you have any issues or don't want to take a chance get the 360 version of the game. If you need strictly good gameplay, which is what I usually need to enjoy a game, then you might want to pass on this game. I normally prefer the gameplay of my game be good, rather than my story or anything else (but music or story being better than gameplay so long as the gameplay is still really really solid works for me as well) but Deadly Premonition is just a case where even with gameplay that's only maybe a 5/10, the rest meshes so well together in a way that I just enjoy spending my time playing this game. I would probably say this is one of my top favorite games of the previous generation. Please do yourself a favor and give this game a try or play it.
2208	i liked this game a lot and there's coffee and there's trading cards and
2209	the worst game of the year. buy it right away
2210	This game is like if Twin Peaks got roundhouse kicked in the face by Shinji Mikami and Suda51.   Weird.....but oh my how amusing.   Get this game     8 out of 10 axe murderers
2211	Zach needs COFFEE! 8/10 3$ game. Totally worth 3$! If you like horror games then you might enjoy this. Oh and you can shave your face.  People say this is a bad port and it crashes. I haven't had one crash yet. Maybe a sugar crash but thats about it.  Beware this game has alot of cut scenes!    
2212	This game is too bad to not play.   That said, BUY THIS DAMN GAME.
2213	This a good â¥â¥â¥ game!
2214	This is, in my personal opinion, the best worst game ever. I highly reccomend it... Just make sure you reboot your computer when you first install it
2215	Worth it just for the ending.
2216	this game has a great horror story with good gameplay i love the voice acting  this game has its creepy moments and it has its LOL moments  if you want a good horror / crime needs to be solved type of good then look no farther this game is amazing. 85 / 100
2217	On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.  This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.  Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this 'Director's Cut' had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.
2218	This was... perhaps the best game i ever played so far in my 20 years of age. I might be overreacting but the ending was climatic enough that i liked it quite alot I recomand it either on full retail price or at rebate.
2219	I have purchased Deadly Premonition on every platform it has been released. The game's director Swery is the perfect kind of crazy, and he's a really sweet guy, and you should all support his work. His games aren't perfect, but they're beautiful windows into his soul. This world we live in does not deserve Swery, and he is a gift. Buy this game and D4, please.
2220	Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Hideo Kojima of all people. Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird. It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice. I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer. Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with. It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.
2221	Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.  TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.   With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game 'good' or 'bad.' It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.  There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.
2222	I would keep it short.  PC port is terrible, interface is a bit annoying at times, incredibly odd and strange driving, constant crashes and FPS drops.  But it still one of the best games I've played. Intriguing story, charismatic characters and dence atmosphere is what makes the game this great.  About technical part of the game. The following quotes says it all: 'I would drag my balls through 10 miles of broken glass just to play another 20 mins of this game's story. ' Steam user jerry.   If you are willing to fight the glitches and crashes, you would experience everything that makes this game so great.
2223	This a good â¥â¥â¥ game!
2224	This is, in my personal opinion, the best worst game ever. I highly reccomend it... Just make sure you reboot your computer when you first install it
2225	I dunno what to say about this game ecxept... Stiff controls, stiff yesteryears animations and stiff voice acting. But it the atmosphere really reeks of an old classic serie called 'Twin Peaks.' I f*cken' it more than putting my d*ck in a cardboard box full of jelly with strawberry taste.  So if you can put your d*ck in it, 'survive' the controls and all the other crap but really love 'old' thriller games with Twin Peaks homage, then you f*ckin' do it.
2226	Deadly premonition's port to PC is A real hot mess, even with the DPfix for 1080p and controller support is not enough. You still experience massive fps drops do to compatibility issues that can only be resolved by uninstalling most of your media players or changing the codex!  Well... Aside from all that it's really a great game, but only consider buying it on sale. Truly a flawed gem...
2227	The game works fine for me following these instructions from the forums:  1 - Go to your DP game directory: right click on the game in your Steam Library - properties - Local Files - Browse local files 2 - Launch the 'PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi' file in the 'redist' directory and execute the Uninstall process 3 - Re-launch the 'PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi' to install it. 4 - Now launch the 'PDLauncher.exe' as Administrator.  As for the game itself, the gameplay seems smooth though not entirely intuitive. I tried playing with both the controller and the keyboard/mouse, and definitely recommend the keyboard/mouse. The story seems fleshed out so far, but I will review all this later after I get more hours into the game. I just wanted to put the game fix into a review fairly quickly since the game is available for a sizeable discount right now: $2.49
2228	The best PS2 game released this gen...just be sure to get the fan-made patch, DPFix.
2229	Really weird, but ultimately really good. Once you get over the quirks, it turns out to be a really solid game.
2230	A game where your salary is based on how many monsters you kill, nice story, the best combat system since resident evil 3, totally underrated. Running smoothly on intel hd graphics without using any fixes while the pc masterracef@gs keep whining about crashes/bugs/stuttering.  10/10 would drink their tears. 
2231	Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.  That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldnât miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.  In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and itâs up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the townâs biggest case yet.  Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.  The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where âan ingenious law school student â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ over 800 victimsâ to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think youâve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.  Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, itâs also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however itâs worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.  Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.  When youâre not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, youâll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesnât get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While youâre shooting enemies you may encounter the âRaincoat Killerâ who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesnât find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.  I think I should also mention the graphics; they wonât impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.  Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole âso bad itâs goodâ tactic perfectly.  Itâs nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.  The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, itâs like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.  After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.  However I think itâs now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you donât have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.  If youâre curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: âDeadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. Itâs perverse, itâs wrong, and yet itâs so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing funny.â  There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.  The game is not only so bad itâs good; itâs so bad its borderline perfection!
2232	What the hell am I playing, and why am I enjoying it so much? I don't even mind the crashes or the fact it needs a third party mod to even get it to load.
2233	Deadly premonition derives from those loveable 60's B-movie tropes. While not great at a technical standard, Deadly Premonition has some of the most memorable moments in gaming history. A great story, an open sandbox world, interesting characters and a huge variety of other in game tasks to complete besides the main story.  One of the most interesting things about DP (not deep pen) is the atmosphere. Tasked with trying to bring a killer to justice, you and a motley crew of under staffed local law enforces team up to tackle the rain coat killer. A mysterious individual who is going around town killing innocent women. The setting in the game is just amazing. As I said before, it's not a great technical achievement, but it doesn't have to be. Gameplay over graphics is always a motto I have said and stuck by. Set in an idyllic town set in the mountains you generally feel alone and constantly fighting to find out where to take your mystery solving crew next.   One scene has you hiding from the rain coat kliller as he chops down the door with an axe. Do you run? Do you hide? It's frantic and engaging and people will love the humour in this game. It's a light touch that is needed at certain points throughout the game.  This game is an utter joy to play and you will easily get 40+ hours form it. 
2234	It's a little gift from far away times when gaming was big and grass was green. Firstly I have a really misunderstanding about what hell happend here, but step by step I started to see beyond ugly graphics and awful sound. So you might try to seen what I saw.
2235	How do I describe this game in one sentence? 'It's so bad it's good.'  Deadly Premonition is a game I have only played for five hours, but am completely in love with. And by all rights, I shouldn't be. The graphics are PS2-era, the combat is mostly a Resident Evil 4-esque 'stand still and aim with a relatively poor laser sight' system against enemies, the voice acting is often laughable, the music is repetitive (I'm pretty sure there are only about five or so tracks) and often plays at the most random and unfitting of moments... It's a recipe for an absolutely terrible game.  In fact, I quit during the first half an hour, regretting my buy. But something... Strange.. Urged me to go back to it. Perhaps it was my desire for a survival horror game that I've never played before, or just that I was bored out of my skull and decided to give it another chance, I don't know... But I'm so glad I did.  The first 20 or so minutes is a really bland, boring, linear shooting section with minamilistic horror at best, but once I got past that, the game, and indeed the world, opened up.   That was my first surprise: the game is open world. It's quite large, too, filled with interesting characters, side-quests and locations to visit. And facial animations, oh lord, those facial animations. The main character sometimes smiles a smile so horrifyingly terrible that I'm almost convinced it's actually a genius ploy by the developers to show how Detective York might actually have some sort of severe autism and is incapable of natural emotion. He sure seems like it, sometimes.  Detective York is the strongest point of the game. An antisocial FBI lone-wolf detective/criminal profiler. York's character ranges from amusing, to awkward, to being an absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. He's completely foreign to socializing in the 'normal' way and doesn't care to hurt feelings if it furthers his case. He also has a (perhaps unhealthy) interest in the murders of young women, knows everything there is to know about terrible 80's movies and... Oh yeah, did I mention he also talks to himself? The mysterious Zach (who I'm certain is actually supposed to represent the player, but there might be a big twist that I don't yet know about) seems to be some kind of imaginary friend, or split personality, that York often converses with, though you never hear Zach converse back.   York is also an absolute genius, as proven at multiple points throughout the game. He solves riddles, rolls his eyes at stupidity and sees those miniscule details that solves cases that no-one else seems to see. He's also good at reading people, too. This leads on to the second strongest point: the plot. I won't spoil anything, and I haven't gotten too far yet, but so far I'm absolutely enthralled by this game's story. The characters are all memorable (if unintentionally awful and hilarious) and the crime, concerning that of the ritualistic slaying of the town beauty Anna, is brilliantly thought out and genuinely interesting to experience and solve - which is the main storyline of the game.   Gameplay-wise, Deadly Premonition has so far been split into two sections: the 'open-world' section, during which one is free to travel (except for certain missions) around a clearly polygonal and badly textured landscape that is somehow full of character. York can interact with people, go to stores, complete side-missions, solve puzzles and look for clues pertaining to the case. He must also keep tabs on sleep and hunger, which both decrease over time and give debuffs to his stats.   The second section is the combat section, which is almost a dungeon crawl. Here, York encounters supernatural enemies and phenomenom, and has his run-ins with the games primary antagonist, The Raincoat Killer. As explained earlier, this section mostly involves shooting or battering down enemies (with melee weapons that break over time), solving puzzles and finding clues. A friend has told me it also grows to include chase-sequences and hiding-sequences in the future. York also has limited stealth capacity, in which he can hold his breath to become invisible to enemies. This has limited use, but is a good addition non-the-less. Shooting involves standing still and aiming the weapon, though guns have a rather difficult to see laser sight which makes aiming at distance hard. Enemies are zombie-like, but can have sudden bursts of unnatural (and creepy) speed and groan out things like 'don't want to die' when you kill them. The two primary stats in combat are health and heart-rate/stamina. Health is self explanatory, while stamina is interesting in that it contributes to your tiredness, but also decides how long you can sprint and hold your breath. Your stamina recovers quickly when idle, so it's not a big problem.   One of the most interesting things about these supernatural sequences is York's reaction.. Or lack thereof. He doesn't actually seem to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ that all these completely insane and clearly supernatural-in-origin things are going on. He never reacts negatively, nor does he ever tell anyone or even so much as ask 'did you see that?!'. It's part of his charm, and makes sense in that it adds to the possibility York might actually be a fearless, no-â¥â¥â¥â¥-giving psychopath, or at least a cold-hearted â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I HIGHLY recommend this game to EVERYONE. This is one of the few games that gets a perfect score from me... An absolute 10/10, despite the poor graphics and PS2-era gameplay.
2236	I'm only recommending this game is the story behind this game. It it solid mystery, and I will finish the game at some point. What I really don't like are the controls, interface, and gameplay as they are quite lacking (on PC that is.....)  6/10, only because of a good backstory.
2237	York, I love you man!  There's so much I could say, right Zach?  But mainly...I love York! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
2238	I hate almost every mechanic you will find here.  Quick Time Events - Terrible in general and horribly executed here Open World - With Mostly Empty Space is what I automatically read after I see this description and it absolutely appies here Survival Horror - Resource managment that amounts to making sure you have enough food to last the day, the timeless and endless searching for keys to open doors, and being forced to hide from an assailiant in a locker despite the fact that you have 160 rounds in your submachine gun ready to be unloaded.  The combat is TERRIBLE and I was not suprised at all to find out it was tacked on at the last minute to try and appeal to 'western gamers' at the publishers request.  To top it all the optimization is exceptionally poor and will likely require you to download some quickfixes via mods (check forums) to run.  Yet I love this game. It's strange beyond reason and the completely broken parts of the game (almost everything) somehow manage to accentuate the one thing that works with this game. The off-center, campy, almost familiar, touching, and beyond words oddball yet enchancting atmosphere.  Agent York is stranger still than the atmosphere and he's one of the most memorable characters in video games.   This might not be for you but on discount you really need to find out if it might be.  9/10 if it is....
2239	Any video game that gives you money for shaving and changing clothes is an immediate buy.
2240	Zach told me too say how good this game is and how it never crashes and all other reviews are lies. But really yes it crashes but there are work arounds from it. Besides that the story is pretty fun and serious at the same time. The gameplay can get alittle repeative at times but most games are like that these days.
2241	Crashed twice in the first 10 minutes. I got exactly what I wanted from this game.
2242	The Room of video games
2243	It's a masterpiece! It's one of those gems you don't notice straight away but one that you will as soon as you start the game, if not, then near the end of thep prologue achievement. If I were to make a list with the top three best games I've played in my life so far, this would be in third place.
2244	Deadly Premonition is a unique experience that every videogame enthusiast should play.   The game obviously looks a bit rough around the edges and surely doesn't have the tightest controls, but once you get used to it, it will suck you in and never let go until you get to the end.  Its setting is heavily inspired by David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which may be a plus (it is for me), however as the story progresses you realize that it stands on its own and it's actually pretty interesting.  Every character you'll meet has some peculiarity that makes him or her different from the others, and you will likely get attached to York, the protagonist, one of the best playable characters of the last gen, IMHO.  Things I didn't like are basically related to the bad PC port: long loading times even on an SSD, crashes and some problems with getting my gamepad to work.   It was worth the trouble anyway.  Buy this game, you won't get to play anything like this for some time.
2245	the worst game of the year. buy it right away
2246	The Twin Peaks vision David Lynch was never able to truly realize
2247	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
2248	On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.  This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.  Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this 'Director's Cut' had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.
2249	For a game that has problems with its pc port, it's a fun pc port, especially for certain things such as the diner conversation or when York holds his own conversation about films. If you want to make sure it plays smoothly and with a different resolution, you will have to modify the game. Here's a guide for anyone interested:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut   In terms of gameplay, combat is rather ordinary, playing like Resident Evil 4 with the over-the-shoulder aiming. Driving is a bit wonky, especially if you drive the car from using the flare (Compared to the police car, the speed is rather fast as though York decided to floor it.). QTE's exist and they require some quick input. Outside of combat, the game does give players side activities to do.  Also, the coffee says 'F.K.'
2250	0/10, 10/10.
2251	Never played it on the XBOX so I have no say on the port. It is pretty bad though. THAT BEING SAID. This game is perfect in every way, right Zach?
2252	Will forever change the way you drink coffee.
2253	Now I'm not going to lie to you, the gameplay in this game is trash. Serious trash. You are cemented to the floor while shooting, there are only 2/3 different types of enemy in the game, sound effects are awful, the driving is hilariously bad as you fly around at 80mph spinning in circles and it crashes so much that you'll want to cry after the 10th time.  BUT, it's still a damn awesome game. How the heck does it manage that you ask? With some of the most hilarious dialogue I've heard in a video game and some of the most interesting and fleshed out characters which feel like they could actually exist in the real world, which doesn't really happen too often in video games.  If you can look past the gameplay issues and immerse yourself in the stories and the characters, you'll definitely have an amazing time.
2254	From the very start of the game (albeit after fixing the crash issues) I was hooked. A survival horror game with elements of comedy, with an open world environment and a charismatic protagonist makes it a cult favorite. The games story (for a brief summary you are an Special FBI Agent investigation an interesting murder case) gives you a lot of clues and expansive knowledge for the player to deduce and question who did it with so many suspects you'll be sure to doubt your prime suspects, but do not fret as the pieces will fall in place nicely and pave a wonderful intense and dramatic story.   This game deserves a 10/10, however due to the pc port issues, bugs, and numerous crashes it recieves a 8/10.
2255	You have windshield wipers, you can control them yourself. THEY HAVE TWO SETTINGS 27/10
2256	Worst game i've played in my life. Best game of all time.  0/10 10/10  You will suffer it like a torture. You will enjoy it like an org*sm.  You will NEVER forget it.  Don't ask. Just play it.
2257	You can drink coffee and catch criminals  10/10 would drink again
2258	Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing Great Fantastic Nice Shot Good Amazing
2259	its a masterpiece  ignore the people who say the game is unfinishable btw, the port is far from a masterpiece but apart from the memory leak it runs with few problems, seriously, people are just too lazy to do any fixes and just say avoid. also back up your save at chapter 9
2260	Litterally the best game ever.
2261	I dunno what to say about this game ecxept... Stiff controls, stiff yesteryears animations and stiff voice acting. But it the atmosphere really reeks of an old classic serie called 'Twin Peaks.' I f*cken' it more than putting my d*ck in a cardboard box full of jelly with strawberry taste.  So if you can put your d*ck in it, 'survive' the controls and all the other crap but really love 'old' thriller games with Twin Peaks homage, then you f*ckin' do it.
2262	Clunky combat, weird out of place humor, goofy main character, and self aware side characters. Mix this up with fairly bad performance, terrible terrible driving physics, hard crashes, and what do you get?  A game that ends up being good despite the flaws. Pick it up today!
2263	Do you like Twin Peaks? Do you like charmingly weird stories and characters? Are you prepared to take the strangest yet most investing story you've ever seen? If you answered yes to any of these questions, pick this game up immediately.
2264	One of the most enjoyable games i've every played. A little clunkly, but the whole thing is written with a lot of heart which is something you don't see enough of. Technically a horror game i guess, but overall has a really nice laid-back atmosphere which isn't something you might expect from this sorta game. Comparisons to Twin Peaks and Resident Evil are inevitable, but it has a real unique flavor of its own which is where the game really shines.  (plus this game seems to go on sale often for just a few dollars so it's a great cheap buy if want to wait)
2265	Basically Twin Peaks fan fiction, and I mean that as a good thing.
2266	Plays like crap, looks like crap... Probably would smell like crap.  Awesome game though.
2267	Worst game i've played in my life. Best game of all time.  0/10 10/10  You will suffer it like a torture. You will enjoy it like an org*sm.  You will NEVER forget it.  Don't ask. Just play it.
2268	You can drink coffee and catch criminals  10/10 would drink again
2269	This game is, sure, weird. But nice. It's nicely weird. And weirdly nice. As the console port it has a lot of bugs and glitches, it has it's undeniable flaws and till the very end it's impossible to decide if it's serious game or is it some kind of a parody. It's also impossible to stop playing, to stop enjoying the characters and the story that is weird... but nice. That is why I love japanese games so much - they can be weird, but they would leave nice aftertaste. For sure.
2270	Gets paid to shave, still bothers to investigate.  10/10  Would shave again.
2271	great game when it works, unforgettable story 10/10
2272	Definitely one of my fave games so far. It really reminds me of Resident Evil 4 and Twin Peaks. The controls may be awkward, but it'll take getting used to. The soundtrack is fire, fam. Also, download DPFix, it works wonders and actually gets the game to run at 1080p. Performance is meh on my GTX 970.
2273	Legendary game.  Twin Peaks, if interpreted by an unrestricted Japanese developer. Itâs a mystery-adventure game, not exactly a horror title. I'd say it shares more with Shenmue than Silent Hill. The cast of the game and their interactions provide for some of the most memorable game moments. Unfortunately gameplay, in terms of combat, lacks polish and will be considered abysmal by some.  If you want something different, a game that provides something far from Ubisoft's triple-a game dispenser products, give this one a shot. (The definitive version is the Xbox 360 version)  My favorite game of all time. My comfy game.

2275	Possibly the only game where I feel the need to watch every movie mentioned by a single character.  
2276	I give it a solid 420 out of 10.
2277	Its A Good Game.. Rminds Me Of The First Silent Hill The  Way The Game Play Is An Old School.. Resident Evil On How Slow The Doors Open.. An Your Character Zach He Always Has To In Second Person It Gets Old... But It Is A Game To Own Not To DIE For!!!!!!!!
2278	Best Crashing Simulator Ever
2279	THIS GAME AIN'T WORK FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥
2280	What I thought was the worst game ever turned out to be the best game ever. I love it and will rub the physical copy on my body every night.
2281	I play this game on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ laptop, have no crashes and stable FPS, guess you have to tune in with the mood of the game even IRL.   Game itself is weird, but interesting so far. Controls could be better, just don't play on keyboard.  All around 8/10 so far, guess in the end will be 11/coffee 
2282	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâs good.
2283	Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.  But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.
2284	Simply a masterpiece! The story keeps you playing this game, no matter how bad the controls and graphics are.
2285	B U Y in THE COFFEE. Zach? I should I buy this game? YES!
2286	I made this short because people should know about this game. The story is amazing... it is probably one of the best game I have ever played. The only problem is that the port is terrible but if you ok to deal with it. You will not regret it at all... the story will make you play all the way to the end.
2287	Now before I say that this game is fantastic here's a fair warning and a bit of advice. This game is filled with a ton of issues similar to Dark Souls, it may not have GFWL but instead you must run it on Windows 98 if you don't want it crashing on you all the time. There is a Dark Souls patch as well from the same guy for this game. Now even with all of its issues this is the definitive version to play due to the poor framerates the PS3 version of Director's Cut receives.  Imagine that old David Lynch classic Twin Peaks was made in to a game, sure there's Alan Wake with all of its homages but what if it was a full blown video game. This is exactly what that game would be, it may be from a Japanese perspective but it's all there. The mysteries, the drama, the characters, the large open world in a small countryside town. What it lacks in graphics and gameplay it makes up for with charm. All the characters have their quirks and the world feels alive. You can spend plenty of time in the world without participating in the crime. This is a game made for fans of Twin Peaks. It's still possible to enjoy without watching the show but you might not be able to fully appreciate this beauty and it may be very difficult to get in to. I would recommend this to any fan who just want to relax in this fantastic simulator.
2288	Look at this weirdo, Zach. He doesn't own Deadly Premonition.
2289	B U Y in THE COFFEE. Zach? I should I buy this game? YES!
2290	Simply a masterpiece! The story keeps you playing this game, no matter how bad the controls and graphics are.
2291	It's one hell of a cup of coffee.
2292	This game looks like crap, plays like crap, craps out a lot, lots of crappy glitches, and yet is one of the best pieces of crap I've ever played. Just expect a lot of weirdness in this crap. I recommend only for its story.
2293	This is a great game with a good mixture of gore,horror,and comedy but is able to crash so badly and it's lags so bad 
2294	Deadly Premonition oscillates between brilliant and tedious. In terms of quality this game is hard to recommend, but if you give it a shot the game will surprise you with intriguing story, of wich you might fall in love with this game.
2295	*whistles Super Mario World theme*
2296	This is a pretty neat game.
2297	Evah emos eeffoc Kroy. Siht si a eurt egamoh ot esoht no Niwt Skaep! Ahahahahahah! There are too many flaws to this game than I can count but I guess thats the charm of it. The show its based on had numerous flaws too but thats exactly why I like it so much. Both were about failure in the face of evil although you do eventually succeed in this game. Both have well crafted characters. Grab if you are a fan of the strange. You will not be disappointed.
2298	I seem to be one of the lucky few who has not experienced a crash or problem of any kind while playing this wonderfully strange game. The game itself is amazing in its unique way if you can get it to run. I highly recommend it as it's a game that exists in a class all its own. The characters are odd, different from one another, genuine, and full of quirk and personality. The story is intriguing and the music helps heighten the drama and mystery. It's like a really great, really strange TV show that you get to play through. Even the bad parts like the driving mechanics are enjoyable. It really feels like you're in a small town living the life of an eccentric FBI investigator. So, as long as you can get it to run properly, you're in for the weirdest treat available in gaming that I know of. Enjoy!
2299	Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.
2300	downloaded the game &amp; it wont work, im installing it again to see if that helps &amp; it says it requires 6.6gig but when i go to manage download its telling me the game's 5.5.... help
2301	This game was stupid. I loved it.
2302	You play as an autistic detective in this game.
2303	The PC controls are massively clunky; it's hard to get through a lot of the scenes with the way it was structured and definitely feels as if it requires a controller. Even playing around with the settings makes it agitating.  The game experience is enjoyable if you can manage to get through the awkwardness of it.
2304	Just got this title free with 10$ indiegala purchase and decided to install it. got constant crashes with the EXE. I managed to get it working by going into the games redist folder and running the PhysX_SystemSoftware exe in it and ran the vcredist_x86 exe. seems to work good so far. If this is helpful feel free to send me some game gifts? lol worth a shot. 
2305	Struggled to get it working initially, but this game is inexplicably terribly made and a great experience.
2306	Probably the best game ever made.
2307	Gloriously terrible, I had a great deal of fun with this game due to the campy and strange humor that is thrown about in the game. I got hooked on it very early into the game but felt a little let down by the ending, this isn't a game for everyone and it's replay value is very minimal.
2308	Though for some reason I get terrible frames in this game (not optimized still?), I can't not recommend this game to fans of old Sega Dreamcast openworld adventure/mystery games (Shenmue, Blue Stinger, etc.). The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10
2309	Definitely one of the most unique games: Deadly is a game that despite its many flaws, is worth playing. As many other people have said, it's so bad, it's good. The plot is bizarre, with odd twists and turns, though it does borrow heavily from Twin Peaks. However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years. The gameplay reminds me of Majora's Mask, with the variety of side-quests that depend on the time of day.  Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it. Also, there are a number of technical difficulties (I've died a few times by falling through the floor). However, if you can get past those annoyances, it's a game that is worth your time.
2310	Spooky, funny, baffling... sometimes all at the same time. This game is fun to explore.
2311	Why is this game so good? I have no â¥â¥â¥â¥in' clue, it just IS!
2312	Deadly Premonition is a beautiful train wreck. At first you donât want to look at it but playing on, you canât look away. The murder mystery plot is bonkers but when the story comes full circle has a almost stunning degree of cohesion to it. The gameplay is clunky and the visuals feel sub PlayStation 2 era but it doesnât matter because all these elements bizarrely work.  
2313	absolutely fantastic.  Everything about this game walks a fine line of self awareness. Things don't always make sense at first, but it pays off by the end.  I recommend playing it with a controller, it makes combat much much easier. This game has a reputation as a so bad it's good game. Strangely, by the end it became a just good game. York is a magnificently engaging character, and all the supporting cast is various levels of endearing. It's wonderful.  Be sure to do all the side missions! Just doing the quest is okay but there's a lot of payoff by helping the towns people.
2314	A great game with extra staff . you should buy it .
2315	dude its great so â¥â¥â¥â¥ alan wake
2316	this game is bat squeak crazy and for some reason i can't stop playing
2317	Funny and quirky all of the way through. 
2318	This is the greatest achievement mankind has ever made. The pyramids of giza, the Collossus of Rhodes, the Empire State Building, and the whoopie pie combined cannot even begin to match the absolute perfection and impressiveness of this game. 10/10 would play with my dog.
2319	Very bug ridden game with terrible gameplay mechanics, shooting straight outta RE4, dressing system that does nothing. And the game looks like a PS2 era release. That being said it's one of my most favorite games ever released, horrible PC port though and that makes me sad, the games quirks all come together to make a very compelling story, finding out who did the murders was a thrill ride up until the very end. I'd say, if you can don't buy for PC but if it's your only option look for bugfixes, it's honestly a solid bar of gold under all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on top of it. Rarely will you find a game as great as this one.
2320	Just the best.
2321	I cried 20 minutes at the end. 10/10
2322	If you love Twin Peaks, then you'd love this! This is basically Twin Peaks the game. Am I right, Zach?
2323	This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XD  The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.  The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.  The controls are not that great.  And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.  So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).  A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)
2324	This game can be summed up pretty easily: Twin Peaks plus zombies. 
2325	When I finished this game I didn't know whether to â¥â¥â¥â¥ or wind my watch but i loved every bit of it.
2326	Deadly Premonition is one of the strangest games I have played. It has terrible graphics, a story largely ripped straight from Twin Peaks, combat that is so easy it feels tacked on, bad driving controls, and terrible sound design among other things. In the end though I enjoyed it enough to finish the game with all the side missions completed and I even got the 65th trading card. It isn't by any means a good game, but something about it just makes it fun. This is very much a video game equivalent of a cult film. Anyone who enjoys the sound of that should give the game a try.
2327	Before I begin, I owned this on Xbox and recently started playing through the PC version.  I'm not sure I can say Deadly Premonition is good, but at the same time it is. I've used 'disgustingly average' to describe it before. Yet, I can't recommend it enough. Its basically Twin Peaks the game, in a sense.   If you like horror, or action, or story, this is a game for you. The game has many flaws. The driving sucks, the combat could be a little better, the squirrels make MONKEY noises. But, those make Deadly Premonition what it is.   This game is basically the definition of 'So bad it's good'
2328	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.
2329	I'm a weird individual and this is a weird game. So the two of us got on like a house on fire. Due to the low budget, the gameplay mechanics, graphic and sound aren't all that refined. Despite all that this game has charm and a lot of it. Its twin peak setting is pretty unique and there is lots to do in this open world survival horror. In fact this is the first true open world survival horror game I can think of (Silent Hill doesn't count). Despite the simple gameplay mechanics it does play like resident evil 4 with its over the shoulder gunplay. While the controls really need sorting out, the game is still fun to play. However while the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have a few glitches, this PC port has lots. There is nothing game breaking but you will find a lot of missing textures, frame rate problem and sometimes mechanical problems like the controller not being responsive. This is best played with mouse and keyboard because the controller controls are clunky and are pretty much broken for the most part.   Despite all its flaws I had a hell of a time playing this. There is a reason why I have bought this on every platform and that reason is because of its originality. Swery65 is basically suda 51 and Hideo kojima as one. He has a vision that only Suda 51 can understand and he has the ambition of Hideo Kojima. He is pretty much the perfect developer and D4 looks like it will kick the walking dead's â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I hope the will be a sequel or a prequel so that I can witness this experience again.
2330	Probably the best game ever made.
2331	Probably the best game i have ever played in my life, or TOP 3 material. This game is something superb, i fell tottaly in love with it. It did have great music, story, characters...WOW. On the other hand, the technical aspect of the game is really TERRIBLE, and i am not talking about minor problems, it is really badly done, really. I was lauhing at it first, but my friend really pushed me to play it, and now, after finishing it, i can say, that that was one of the best things i ever played, if not the best. (and i played Fallout, Planescape torment and almost all legends made). This game just was really special.
2332	Mr. Francis York Morgan  Deadly Premonition is GOTY for sure If you're tired of boredom then here is the cure If you don't believe me just buy it and see Now you can play it on your PC  So says Mr Stewart.
2333	I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.  A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:  I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.  Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.  There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer.   I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.
2334	You'll have the best worst time of your life trying to follow this game &lt;3 10/10 Best Game Of The Ever
2335	WHAT THE HELL IS MY LIFE  This game is incredibly stupid  Seriously, in retrospect it's horrible  It begins with lots of laughs but the last three or so hours are insane  Yeah go play it or something
2336	Highly underated on release. This game is unlike any other. Quirky small town Amrerica meets Resident Evil. True, the graphics are basic and the controls can feel a little clunky but if you like narrative and dark plot this game is a must. Ignore official reviews, enjoy this experience
2337	The production values are last gen, the dialouge is goofy and awkward, the voice acting flip flops between lazy and hammy as hell, and yet...well, somewhere around the second hour this game transformed from a seemingly 'me too!' survival horror game to one of the most engrossing open world titles I've ever played. It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.
2338	This game is one of my personal favorites from the (360,PS3) generation. It might not look like much, but if you go beyond it's low end graphics and controls, there is a special thing about it and that special thing is what made it a cult hit.
2339	dude its great so â¥â¥â¥â¥ alan wake
2340	This game... It's just weird, in a good way. Kind of like Twin Peaks. If your into horror games and want to try a game that's out there. Pick this one up, it will not disappoint.
2341	Just the best.
2342	I cried 20 minutes at the end. 10/10
2343	Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece.   Supports Window Mode. Has controller compatibility. Changeable Graphic resolution.
2344	'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.'
2345	F... K... IN the coffee?!?  Looking past the clunky graphics, gameplay and execution this is a passionate game made with the best intentions with the least cynicism I've seen in a game in years.  Obviously Twin Peaks inspired, it won't appeal to everyone but to those it does I can guarantee you'll become a Swery fan.
2346	I went open minded to this and i must say...I freaking love it so much! I rarely judge a game based on its bugs or crashes, I mostly care about the gameplay and the story, the gameplay is alright, reminds me of a mix between Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill, and the story so far is amazing! The humor is awesome, the characters are original and really know how to make you love them, specially the main character...Ahhh York! &lt;3 The soundtrack altough repetitive is pretty cool sometimes, specially the whistling one, i whistled along everytime!  In general, if you ignore the sometimes annoying random crashes and the bugs, and you love a good mistery/horror/open world game, this game is perfect for you!  8.5/10 so far! :)
2347	Brilliant writing. Excellent atmosphere. Gameplay is far from unbearable, though not perfect.  The story and its execution are what make this game, it's relatively long, but you'll get so hooked you won't even notice.  9/10 - Jerky controls, but amazing story and greatly explorational.
2348	Positives: Fantastically weird characters, and dialog. Very Twin Peaks inspired setting. Some decently creepy moments. Absolutely deranged music.  Negatives: Dated visuals. Slightly clunky controls. Absolutely deranged music (sometimes it can be annoying!)
2349	When I finished this game I didn't know whether to â¥â¥â¥â¥ or wind my watch but i loved every bit of it.
2350	I thought I was getting a horror game. I got a driving game, a typing game, a fishing game, a dressup game, a shaving simulator, and Twin Peaks with the serial numbers ever so lightly filed off. 10/10
2351	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
2352	Well Zach, this could have gone better, couldn't it have? The good news is that the game runs pretty smoothly now, and there is a patch that lets you crank up the resolution. However, this game never had good looking assets. If that matters to you, then wait a few months to play this because I'm sure someone will make better textures. But this game isn't about the graphics, it never was. I got this for 5 bucks from indiegala, but at $15 or less I'd call this a buy.
2353	You may think when you see this game is just a crappy game. But if you dig deeper and play the game you will find out that the game has an amazing story. If you ignore the combat and the driving and graphics you will find an amazing game.
2354	A rich, story driven action-horror game with decent, pseudo-RE4 controls and great commidic relief, Deadly Premonition is a MUST HAVE for ALL gamers.  10/10 would buy again.
2355	Do you want to play a game that feels, plays and tells a story like David Lynch's Twin Peaks? This is it.  But like Lynch's cinematography this game will leave you alone confused after it crashes (which it will - several times), so replay that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ part again and listen to York's babbling - again. So in simple words: this game is poorly made gameplay or mechanics wise, as well as graphics, sound mixing, just everything. The thing is: it tells you a story with rich but utterly strange characters like in Twin Peaks (or in videogames like Alan Wake's Latern Lady), which keeps you interested and motivates you to get through this nightmare of game. Whatever it throws at you, you will still appreciate this game and its charme. For me it's an classic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ arthouse-trash game. I love it. Isn't that right, Zach?
2356	May not work right out the box kind of game. DPFix was a pretty big help when it first came out on steam and continues to fix things so I would recommend getting that. The game itself finally comes with controller support and patched a few bugs which really hindered the game. Interestingly enough this game was tested with windows 98 and if you have serious problems you may want to put it in compatibility for win 98.   Probably the weirdest game I have played in a long time. It is a budget game and has its moments of being cheesy and surprisingly good. Mixed on the gameplay aiming is like resident evil 4, hilariously bad driving and annoying qtes. Nothing challenging about the game except maybe getting it work especially when it first came to PC. I enjoyed the game enough where I would probably play it again.
2357	Twin Peaks gone Silent Hill, as realized by a Japanese dev team on LSD. There are plenty of flaws, even discounting the terrible porting job, but underneath it all is an awkwardly endearing and clearly ambitious hodgepodge of a game. The writing is occasionally quite clever and humorous, the characters grow on you and are surprisingly multidimensional. The story, while full of plot holes, is still interesting enough that it kept me going. And while it's usually easy to guess what happens next in the grand scheme of things, the details are usually completely unexpected. Especially when it comes to dialogue.  It's easy to see why everyone won't give this one a chance though. Production quality varies heavily. Many environments are incredibly detailed, characters are mostly well modeled, and voice acting is at least bearable and often genuinely decent. On the other hand character animations are often awful and level design is mostly uninspired and occasionally very annoying. This goes double for the corridors you end up traversing when the game switches to otherworld mode. There are occasional environmental puzzles that have no particular reason to be there. They're always easy but also almost always annoying.   Combat is trivial, at least when played with a mouse, so the Silent Hilly otherworld bits where you shoot your way through endless mobs turn into routine that you have to turn your brain off for to get to the story bit on the other side. It's not actively terrible but you get the feeling the otherworld fighting stuff was meant for some other game entirely. But then, that goes for many things in the game. There are also useless combat-related QTEs which range from irritating to really bloody annoying, depending on whether you see them coming and whether you remember which buttons you need to press in which order to avoid being instakilled by one of the baddies that haunt your persistently through the game.  The freeroam stuff, while novel, also doesn't work too well as there isn't much of interest to actually do. The things you can do are also usually pointless from a gameplay perspective. Unless you really like increasing your Agent Honor by driving over medals in forest corridors, that is. Driving in general is something you will spend a lot of time doing, and you will not enjoy it.  Thankfully the devs realized driving around is boring (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse, then it's a constant life and death struggle to just stay on the road) and recorded tons of monologues where the main character reminisces about pop culture with his invisible friend. These give the driving segments a lighter tone and also help deepen the player character. Unfortunately the devs didn't consider how aggravating it is to listen to one single repetitively terrible cop show theme whenever your character doesn't happen to be talking about 80s B-movie rentals. A car radio would have been an amazing addition, even just so you could turn it off.  The music in general deserves a few comments. The number of tracks is way too low and many scenes have incredibly ill fitting tunes. Some of it is probably intentional humor, but it's impossible to tell. However some of the tracks are genuinely very good. Everything gets repetitive real quick though. You always know what sort of scene is about to start when you hear the music start to play. Well, except for that one experimental jazzy tune which is used completely randomly.  Basically, if you can enjoy diamond-in-the-rough style games, and find amusement in weird things both intentional and unintentional, and enjoyed the general atmosphere of Twin Peaks, this may be a game for you. Or not. The divisive reputation is certainly well deserved as even though I've spent quite a number of hours in it, it's still hard to recommend the game to anyone that isn't me.
2358	If you love Twin Peaks, then you'd love this! This is basically Twin Peaks the game. Am I right, Zach?
2359	My coffe made me play this game. And I don't regret a single moment spent playing it. The graphics are awful, the gameplay is horrible and sometimes frustrating, but the story makes you forget about the game's flaws. Twin Peaks like characters and setting, crazy dialogues, surprisingly good score. Go play it. Now.
2360	I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.   Here's a list as to why it sucks: Crashes often Plot is barely explained Plot holes Graphics are terrible Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme] Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently) Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?) Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often) Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use) AI is weird Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...) Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways) There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))  And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.   Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!  
2361	Deadly Premonition is one of the strangest games I have played. It has terrible graphics, a story largely ripped straight from Twin Peaks, combat that is so easy it feels tacked on, bad driving controls, and terrible sound design among other things. In the end though I enjoyed it enough to finish the game with all the side missions completed and I even got the 65th trading card. It isn't by any means a good game, but something about it just makes it fun. This is very much a video game equivalent of a cult film. Anyone who enjoys the sound of that should give the game a try.
2362	Before I begin, I owned this on Xbox and recently started playing through the PC version.  I'm not sure I can say Deadly Premonition is good, but at the same time it is. I've used 'disgustingly average' to describe it before. Yet, I can't recommend it enough. Its basically Twin Peaks the game, in a sense.   If you like horror, or action, or story, this is a game for you. The game has many flaws. The driving sucks, the combat could be a little better, the squirrels make MONKEY noises. But, those make Deadly Premonition what it is.   This game is basically the definition of 'So bad it's good'
2363	Weird but very enjoyable story.
2364	If you can get past the PS2 graphics/gameplay there is a great story line with amazing characters. One of the best games I've played in a while.
2365	8/10 Played this first on the Xbox. A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game with a fantastic story. If you can suffer through the horrible driving an medieval graphics for a truly rewarding mystery this game is for you.
2366	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
2367	This game is amazing. One of the funniest games I've ever played, and one of the only few games to capture that B-grade movie feeling of low budget, roughness and unnintentional humour. If you can overlook bugs and technical flaws you are out for quite an experience.  Can't recommend it highly enough!
2368	What this game lacks in visuals Alan Wake has them, what Alan Wake lacks in ambition this game has it. This game is a problem, but a good one.
2369	'The Room' of video games. Close competition with Alan Wake for also being the 'Twin Peaks' of video games.
2370	This game. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's just like one of my mystery Chinese visual novels, except in America.  i cant click the yes button enough
2371	This game is amazing. One of the funniest games I've ever played, and one of the only few games to capture that B-grade movie feeling of low budget, roughness and unnintentional humour. If you can overlook bugs and technical flaws you are out for quite an experience.  Can't recommend it highly enough!
2372	Gloriously terrible, I had a great deal of fun with this game due to the campy and strange humor that is thrown about in the game. I got hooked on it very early into the game but felt a little let down by the ending, this isn't a game for everyone and it's replay value is very minimal.
2373	is it a game or a film? stop talking about gameplay and enjoy the atmosphere.
2374	You play as an autistic detective in this game.
2375	Just got this title free with 10$ indiegala purchase and decided to install it. got constant crashes with the EXE. I managed to get it working by going into the games redist folder and running the PhysX_SystemSoftware exe in it and ran the vcredist_x86 exe. seems to work good so far. If this is helpful feel free to send me some game gifts? lol worth a shot. 
2376	What a port. Theres a german saying 'Verschlimmbessert' which unfortunately cant be translated. Disimprove?  Gave this another try since i finally got me an xbox controller for my pc (keyboard+mouse controls like â¥â¥â¥) and they switched the controls around and actually made em worse. Great.  Then the 'HD' treatment. Some assets (mainly UI) got retouched (looking worse but thats a matter of personal taste i guess) and slapped together with old stuff making for nice eye biting contrast. Some of the 3D Models for the inventory items got a shiny slime filter or something tossed onto them. The resolution is higher but the textures are the same resulting in highres blurryness. Amazing. The original wasnt a graphical marvel but at least consistent.   Additionally the game seems a litte too fast which actually managed to make me a little nauseous. Last game that did that was Starfox on SNES. Audio is still messed up. Nice shot.  The Thumbs up is for Deadly Premonition and that people who never ever plan on buying a Xbox360 ever ever (its cheap now and theres alot of other pretty good games...) have a chance of experiencing it - even in the warped form of this suboptimal port.
2377	it's something else...
2378	The coffee says: 'bring a raincoat'
2379	Nothing better than this, right Zach?
2380	This is a pretty neat game.
2381	Zach, have you heard of the 2010 video game Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro? It's about an FBI agent investigating a mysterious murder in a seemingly peaceful small town. On the surface it looks to be based on the 1990 television show Twin Peaks, but it really takes the idea in a new direction. It's a very unique experience!  I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song 'Life is Beautiful' holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable.   Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story. Thankfully there are fans that love the game so much that they created their own patches to fix some of the problems! I highly recommend you look into them, Zach.  What's that Zach? Coffee? What a fantastic idea!
2382	Without spoiling the game and giving away what makes this so special, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition is one of the most underrated and brilliant video games ever created. Full applause and credit to the one and only Swery65 for making a game that despite it's major shortcomings (controls, graphics, PC optimization) is the most engrossing and intelligent games out there. And again without spoiling anything, has the best twist in a story that proves just how important the video game medium is.  If you're even remotely interested in this game, just pick it up. Especially at such a cheap price ($2.49 as of this review), you'll be getting a game that you can sink hours into playing and days upon days discussing with your friends. Just be sure to look up some of the user made patches like DPFix to get the most out of the game.
2383	Amazing! Isnt it Zach?
2384	QTE's broke my controller, story broke my mind. 10/10
2385	Birds with chimp sound effects, magic seeds, helghast handicapps, turkey jam cereal sandwiches. 10/10!   One of my favourite games ever,just buy it if you can put up with the controls and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc port (try get the director's cut on PS3 if you can)    Zach agrees!   (Ignore the hours of game time, I've spent over 80+ hours on PS3.. I bought it again on PC and just wanted to share my opinion with my fellow steamens.)
2386	thid is a awesome game great graphics great controls great dl models great animations best game ever
2387	QTE's broke my controller, story broke my mind. 10/10
2388	THANK YOU BASED DURANTE  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/ 
2389	Let's get the biggest negatives out of the way. Buggy. Gameplay reminiscent of old resident evil games - may be good or bad depending on your perspective. Locked resolution (there's a mod), dated graphics (dem textures). If you don't enjoy hours of exploration, you will essentially need a guide to help you locate sidequests. Sidequests are repetitive.  The story is great and I personally think the main character in particular is excellent. There are a handful of sidequests that provide genuinely useful items for the effort you put in (wrench, radio, weather doll) and the rest are forgettable. Combat is decent. Aiming with the mouse is stiff, but aiming compensation makes it very easy to achieve headshots.  Over all, for the price I bought it at ($10 I think) I would recommend it, provided quite an entertaining experience. For $25, there are better things to spend money on.  
2390	Bad game: the game. A good game.
2391	Get ready for a blast from the past! Run this game in WIndows 98 compatability mode for the ultimate old school experience!!!
2392	Deadly Premonition achieved what many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games can't do. To keep you seated no matter how abysmal it looks and plays. An absolute purchase to anyone with a guilty pleasure for weird games.
2393	This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game.   Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.  But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.
2394	Fantastic. Buy it.
2395	Bad game: the game. A good game.
2396	Great interesting game, makes you want coffee an smokes
2397	One of my favorite games of all time. Terrible graphics, audio mixing and game play, but awesome characters, story and music.
2398	If youâre going to measure Deadly Premonition using traditional gaming yardsticks like graphical fidelity, gameplay challenge, and overall polish, then this Directorâs Cut still comes up short of modern standards even with the fixes. Yet despite any obvious technical shortcomings, it succeeds on the strength of its story, its characters, and its countless WTF moments. It doesnât feature enough new content to interest existing fans, but if you want to find out which side of the love-it-or-hate-it divide you're on, nowâs the perfect time to play one of the most memorable and utterly insane survival-horror games ever made in its most accessible form.
2399	Deadly Premonition is an amazing experience! I encourage you to stop what it is you are doing and play this game.
2400	One of my favorite games of all time. Terrible graphics, audio mixing and game play, but awesome characters, story and music.

2402	Words cannot describe how good this game is zach.
2403	This game is a cult classic. Not sure how I never got into this game when it originally came out.
2404	Zach, I don't really see what most people are complaining about. It's a very surreal game with an interesting story and memorable characters. Wouldn't you agree? Gameplay mechanics are a bit clumsy, but that's our charm, Zach. I saw in the coffee that our Director's Cut would be significantly more enjoyable than the original, so, I guess all's well that ends well.
2405	Shot jim in the face  game crashed  11/10    SO I RECENTLY PLAYED THE 360 EDITION.  Loved the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it serious 10/10.
2406	Zach, this game... it's amazing.
2407	time is a flat circle
2408	this game is biblical
2409	This game is almost broken on steam so if you decide to get it you will have to patch the hell out of it. To get this game to work you have to make it run in compatability mode for windows 98.  When you get this game to work though it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and plays like garbage. But this is the best awful game you will ever play. While the graphics and the gameplay are terrible the dialog and the story is great. The game has a large variety of weird and interesting characters which makes this game so unique. But I won't lie its tideous baring with the gameplay parts inbetween the dialog and other goodness. The driving is absolutely crazy but you have so many buttons for a bunch of functions on your car.  This has to be my favorite awful game and one of my favorite games.
2410	did you see that zach? clear as a crisp spring morning!  GOTYAY! IN the coffee!
2411	Best 14 min of my life.
2412	Don't buy this until they (if or when) fix being able to use a controller. Otherwise you're screwed, Zach.
2413	Playable?
2414	in my mind this game is a masterpiece, its like a drawing done by a 5 year old though, the execution is horrid but the idea behind it is amazing. firstly i dont know why it does it for me, this has ONLY happened to me, not even the dev knows why, but my cutscenes are really messed up and i will put a link so you can see.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wdfh902guxatyg/2014-04-07_00002.jpg?dl=0  - that is supposed to be the intro  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugttu4sqy8ro2uv/2014-04-07_00003.jpg?dl=0  - thats supposed to be the main menu  now onto the pros: the game has a very interesting story. there is a lot to do has the classic intentional bad dialogue some rather strange humor a horror aspect in an open world  now the cons: this game is astonishingly buggy there are constant issues no matter what its controls are a bit wonky by default but can be changed no graphical options.  all in all if i myself could fix the cutscene issue this would be one of my favorite games even with its issues.
2415	Pros: Amazing game filled with comedic moments, fun driving mechanics, huge plot and a great mystery covering the entire game.   Cons: Controls are kinda clunky, no gamepad support (despite being a console game before ported), and resolution is locked at 720p. Graphical options are minimal if anything, and there appear to be a few more loading texture problems than in the PS3/XBOX360 version of this game.  All in all, despite the numerous technically problems, this game is well worth buying to enjoy the characters, story, and all around funny dialogue. Playing Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut on the PS3 or XBOX360 is a better option, though. The only benefit of playing on PC is the return of Francis York Morgan's kill quotes, which were sadly missing from the console versions of Director's Cut.  9/10
2416	I am thinking that this game is pretty good.
2417	Good game, port needs some love if you want to play it.
2418	Not the best port, but it's absolutely one of the best games ever made. Feels like a long-lost Dreamcast game with absolutely incredible characters, story, and world-building. Worth playing on whatever platform you can.
2419	I've never had so much fun looking for squirrel keychains
2420	CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.  Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.  That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.
2421	A fun but insanly buggy title. I needed a guide to avoid all the game crashing bugs just to get through it. An odd personality and story drives this game. not for everyone, i recommed doing alittle research to see if it is your kind of game becuase you will need to put alot of effert in to avoid all the game crashing bugs.there might be some fan made patches and fixes out there but it is a bad port of a good game
2422	One of the most underrated games of history
2423	Most of my gameplay time is from redoing missions after I crash during cut scenes. It's almost as if the developers don't want me to play this game, Zach.
2424	It's buggy, and the zombies never make sense. The bad parts are... really bad. But the good parts are excellent. This is definitely one you want to pick up on sale. I'd recommend it at full price if the developers fixed the crashing, but let's face it, that's never going to happen.
2425	This game crashed on me multiple times and might as well wasted almost 10 hours of my gameplay time yet it was one of the most surreal and undescribable deep experience I ever had. To be honest, how broken it is just add it to its charm. Everytime my car went bonkers, I chuckle, restart and play through it all over again with a heartfelt 'oh, SWERY' moment.
2426	This game is a masterpiece. Honestly, in my book it wins best game of all time. The plot is just really awesome with twists and turns everywhere. The main character is hilarious. FK..in the coffee. I lost my â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you want a really good storytelling single player experince, this game does the best job on it. However, it dwindles in the graphics aspect as the characters' audio isn't usually in sync with the character's lip when they are talking. But that's only a small minor problem. 
2427	Technical mess, story and characters pure genius.
2428	Good game I guess.
2429	You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else. I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.  Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness, The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was 'I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.' The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird.  The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.  Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game. This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.  Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.
2430	Introduce Simulator 'FBI Special Agent: Francis York Morgan. Please, just call me York. It's what everyone calls me.' 10/10 would introduce myself again.
2431	Zach, could you recommend this?
2432	I got The Pickles. Rating: 10/10 - Would shoot Japanese ghost acrobats again
2433	I mean, to say this is basically  Twin Peaks: The Video Game  would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like  Twin Peaks , the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about  Deadly Premonition  is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.   Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should. The gameplay works sort of like  L.A. Noire . The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The 'game' operates much more like an interactive film or television show ('Previously in the investigation' or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)  I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale.  Deadly Premonition  is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.
2434	I don't even know where to begin to describe this. This is probably the worst PC port in the history of ports (even worse than Dark Souls). It crashes constantly and has little glitches here and there. That's not even touching upon the absolutely horrendous combat and driving mechanics. But hell if this wasn't one of the most unique games I've ever played. And the story is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game, and for that alone I'd recommend this game over a hell of a lot of other titles. If it's on sale and you think you can stomach the little fixes and mods you'll need to actually run it, you might just love it. Otherwise, pick up the more stable PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.
2435	This is a good game and I want to finish it, but it crashes non-stop and I have no idea if it's ever going to be fixed or if it can be fixed. It's not the best game in the world, but I like it for it's story and unconventional gamplay.
2436	Introduce Simulator 'FBI Special Agent: Francis York Morgan. Please, just call me York. It's what everyone calls me.' 10/10 would introduce myself again.
2437	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
2438	Zach, could you recommend this?
2439	You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else.

Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.
2440	It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.  If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.  Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.  That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.   So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.
2441	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.

2443	wow.....this game is the sh!t.
2444	Twin Peaks the game 10/10 pretty good. Port is garbage though; so are the quick time events.
2445	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
2446	Not the best port, but it's absolutely one of the best games ever made. Feels like a long-lost Dreamcast game with absolutely incredible characters, story, and world-building. Worth playing on whatever platform you can.

2448	wow.....this game is the sh!t.
2449	Deadly Premonition is a difficult thing to describe. Not at its core, but where it counts. Deadly Premonition is essentially Twin Peaks: the Video Game. So much so to the point where in its setting, characters, and major plot points are ripped almost directly from Twin Peaks. You are FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, tasked with finding the culprit behind the murder of a young woman in the small town of Greenvale that has some odd relation to a string of murders happening all across the country.   To preface this, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition: Directors Cut is one of the sloppiest, messy, and badly done PC ports for a game that is just not good. It has ransom crashes and even though people talk about CTD's (Crash To Desktop), the majority of crashes didn't even allow me to do that. The controls are clunky and the horror bits aren't as scary as they could be. Yet everything is done in such a way that it is just so absolutely amazing in every way. At its core, Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games to play and is definitely one of my top ten games of all time. The weirdly written character dialogue backed up by one of the maybe 15 audio tracks that the game has to offer (but it's probably going to be Life Is Beautiful, who am I kidding) creates this setting that you just can't put down because you're so invested in the world it paints and the characters that accompany you on your investigation. Also it's just f****** weird in a great way.  TL;DR Even while the game is flawed in so many ways, all of its flaws contribute to an experience that every horror lover/movie lover/lover of David Lynch/person on this planet should partake in. The game is an absolutely amazing work of art that is only $2.50 during sales and totally worth the cash and the crashes.
2450	So far so good. I love the controls and Twin Peaksy feeling. Maybe filling the gas tank is not necessary.
2451	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.
2452	OK, this game surely has its problem. It's a bad port, it needs some twisting around from keeping it from crashing, the driving mechanics are objectively bad, and the graphics is surely not top notch. But this game is a breath of fresh air from all the 'this game mechanics work, let's copy-paste it' games, it's extremely original and has a great late 90's early 2000 japanese vibe. It has one of the best horror plot ever seen in video game history, the character development is incredible and i was surely not expecting anything even close to this level. The english production is great, the voice acting is magnificent. The game is an open world investigation horror with paranormal elements, and it's unique in its genre. It's surely a game to try out, sadly the first 15 minutes of tutorial are not representative of the rest of the game and can turn a lot of people off before they get to the real beginning of the game. I really feel like recomending this to anyone who wants to try something different from the gaming standards we are accustomed today
2453	A solid game with some of the best characters in any game i've ever played and an amazing, gripping, hilarious, and interesting story that will suck you in and wash away the PS2-tier mistakes the game has.  It's one of my favourite games of all time, get it on xbox360 or ps3 though, the PC Port is quite terrible and will test your patience.   It's like a really good, cheesy movie in the shell of a mediocre game. It's hard to explain, you really need to play it. Do not pay full price for it on PC though.
2454	Imagine if Twin Peaks was made by a semi-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Japanese man named Swery and that's essentially what Deadly Premonition is.  I love it and you should too.

2456	The version of this classic is HORRIBLE on Steam. However, Over at Good Old Games it retains its charm and delight. Buy it there and not here!
2457	The port is really bad, but the story is actualy pretty good. There's a few mods that slightly fix the game and make it more playable, but expect crashes every 15-30mins.   I would recommend this game purely for the strange and interesting story.
2458	The best worst game ever
2459	Best plot ever. (Bugs too)
2460	I have a dream: to see Deadly Premonition remastered.
2461	If you love Twin Peaks and Resident Evil 4, give it a try. Its a unique experience you won't get anywhere else.  Fair warning, install the unofficial patches and be prepared for some bugs, the game is far from technically perfect.
2462	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
2463	Zach, the coffee told me to nominate this game for the 2016 Steam Awards 'Game Within A Game' Award  Sinner's Sandwich/10 would premonition again hurhurhur
2464	un as administrator, Alongside windows 98 compatibility mode and restarting pc fixes all bugs. and yea its a good game only bad part is the lumbar mill at the start you get past that your golden.
2465	A technical mess of a game but if you just let it simply 'be' this is a game unlike most others out there. The game has a David Lynch inspired cooky story that goes in some surprising directions, the cast of characters are diverse and are fun to interact with.  A great game but also a terrible one. It's like a great B-Movie in that I can't recommend it to everyone but if you think you'll enjoy it you probably will... just give it a couple hours to sink in and come to the terms with the fact that the minute to minute gameplay is nothing to write home about!  8/10
2466	This game legitimately manages to be both the best and the worst experience I've had playing a game.  By default it's locked at 30 FPS and 720p, while crashing constantly. Installing a fix for this doesn't actually fix the framerate issue causing it to change periodically AND change the game speed with it, as well as cause it to crash MORE. It's a knock off of Twin Peaks despite SWERY claiming to have never heard of it It's never getting an actual sequel due to the fact that SWERY has stopped making games to be a buddhist monk (Look it up I'm not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tting you) The gameplay itself is unbearably boring  That said the wack-â¥â¥â¥ story and crazy characters/writing have elevated it to being one of the most memorable and fun experience I've had in a long time.  It's like $2.50 on sale the fact that only 2 people I know have it (One of which I gave it to) is a shame on all of you.
2467	twin peaks: the videogame
2468	Just love it. Sure itÂ´s 'terrible' as a game, but I canÂ´t but say that itÂ´s pure gold for anyone who loves Twin Peaks or something deeper than gameplay and visuals.
2469	I love this game but GOD DAMIT JUST KEEPS CRASHING D8
2470	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2471	What a weird game.. Terrible PC port; keeps crashing, freezing, lagging with a GTX 1060. Also the gameplay, please, this is so BAD.. Probably the worst driving experience since a while. But.. BUT. This game is AMAZING, there is something so unique to it. A GTAxSilent HillxTwin Peaks cross over. How could it not be great ? Despite all its weaknesses, I spent an amazing moment with the inspector Morgan and I would definetely recommend it to anyone. You need to play it and to go through the first terrible crashes and weird 2-3 hours of gameplay adaptation.  Really really great story taking a twist on what seems a Twin Peaks copycat, but it's absolutely not. There is also a very interesting ending, and a truly beautiful analysis not so hard to understand on the player's take.
2472	Good game I guess.
2473	Man I Love Twin Peaks. DONT LOOK AT THE ACHIVMENTS HUGE SPOILERS FOR THE WHOLE GAME
2474	Yes, the art is meh. The controls are bad, but not unbearable. Yet the story is incredible.  The story alone makes the game worth it to play.
2475	A mix of horror, mystery, mind confusing, awkward humor, topped off with an entertaining plot/story. Perfect always, yes.
2476	If you can think critically a simple google search and 1 easy. step can have this game working normally, I had another malfunction halfway through and i simply did the step again and I finsihed the game the next day because the story is engaging, hilarious, and surprisingly dramatic. the shooting is alright its not the best. I reccmoned using a controller. I really enjoyed this game when it wasnt making me go from point A to point B. BUT THE POINT IS to have fun and be a detective there is 100 things you can do besides just follow the main story. I loved this game and I plan to replay.
2477	I love this game. The gameplay is clunky and not very intuitive and there's glitches galore but the story is so weird as is the character. I'm basically playing myself. So, yeah, I'm biased.
2478	One of my all time favorite games. You have to play it to believe it. It'll bring you tears and it'll make you laugh. It's truly a game worth playing.
2479	Bad PC port. Be prepared to waste an hour figuring out how to install fixes to get it to work at all. Almost unplayable in its normal state.   Once I got it running it had a really trippy japanese horror movie thing going on, but I didn't get very far cause I think it crashed.   
2480	An obscure game known for being the most polarizing horror game ever, Deadly Premonition delivers a memorable experience. Despite bargain bin graphics and gameplay, the cast of bizzare characters make up for it, alongside the strange story. The PC port is unfortunately terrible, providing no graphics options, locked 720p resolution, locked 30fps, (According to Framerate Police) potential degrade in performance over time, failing to start on Windows 8, and frequent crashing. A mod called dpfix by the same dude that made the beautiful dsfix for Dark Souls' infamous PC port fixes issues and gives graphics options to the player. Now play this and make a Sinners' Sandwich.
2481	Buying this game is a catch-22. If you buy it, SWERY is able to eat and make more awesome games, but you're also supporting the malpractice of horribly broken PC ports. If you don't buy it (or don't play it), the devs won't want to port to PC in the first place.  Then again, a few sales earned or lost 3 years after the original release isn't going to have much effect on the developers.  Mods can fix it, but they don't prevent the crashes that set you back 30 minutes
2482	Atrocious port for an unique and fantastic game. Worth it only if you buy it on sale.
2483	My name is Zach in real life....
2484	PC Port is pretty bad, but if you tweak it a bit by going to your Deadly Premonition files located in your Steam folder, right click DP.exe, properties, change the Compaitablity to 98/ME, then go to DPLauncher.exe, and change that to Run as Admin, then launch it through the DPLauncher, it should be fully functioning, aside from the lack of options. Great game. prone to crashes and occasional graphics â¥â¥â¥â¥ ups
2485	Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games of all time. That being said this game really isn't for everyone. Watch some gameplay or a review and you'll pretty much know if this game is for you. Twin Peaks style, Humorous, B-movie, clunky survival horror game. If any of those points intrigue you I highly recommend you check DP out.   I'm aware the PC version has glaring issues, but I highly suggest you get this masterpiece on sale and do some tweaking with DP fix. You can also tweak the colors to your liking if the blue tint of the Director's Cut doesn't fit your personal taste. The PC also comes with all the DLC that was available when the DC originally launched on PS3. All in all, when it comes down to it, you either LOVE DP or HATE it. I urge anyone to give it a try as it is a unique and wonderful experience.  Perhaps look into your coffee next time and see if you find your answer?
2486	It's a weird game. Play it only if you have the patience to absorb the bugs and a bad port. Aiming weapons is really limited. Driving is atrocious. I have an issue with side quests available during a particular weather. That doesn't make sense. But availability of side quests at certain timings in a day is realistic. But the game has a good story, keeps you guessing on who the killer is. All the characters are well written and there are many of them. Huge attention to detail.
2487	It's a pretty good game despite all the crashes. I'd say 8/10.
2488	twin peaks: the videogame
2489	âââââ Wonderfully great game, once you get past the graphics and driving you will find yourself enjoying a totally different type of game than what is available out there, I didn't go into the game thinking i'd like it much , but damn i was proven wrong, as the game progresses it just gets better, so if your a fan of thriller/action/sandbox/murder-investigation you'll love this game, if not you could very possibly still be pleasantly surprised by this games story and gameplay style, so give it a try!
2490	Deadly Premonition is one of the weirdest games ever. To give you a good analogy. Imagine if David Lynch wrote a brilliant script and gave it to Tommy Wiseau or Ed Wood to direct, then you would have a movie that would resemble this game. If this sounds like the most awesome movie ever, then you will probably enjoy Deadly Premonition. Ed Wood movies may be terrible, but their entertaining as ****.   Deadly Premonition is the brainchild of Hidetaka 'SWERY' Suehiro. I've read some interviews featuring SWERY and decided that he is completely bat**** insane and yet a genius at the same. This game went through development hell for 6 years and was almost cancelled 4 times. It seems like nobody on the team really knew how to program well, and the game was perhaps too ambitious for it's own good. When the game came out it was a broken mess. The graphics would have been good on the Dreamcast, the controls are so bad it feels like it has to be intentional(seriously, the car controls are so bad you'll have to play it to believe it), the voice acting is usally passible but can be cringe-worthy at times, the animations on the characters are laugable, the repetive yet catchy musical scores come on at the worst possible times, and despite the terrible graphics the game has horrendous performance issues. Apparently SWERY was actually shocked when critics proceeded to rip the game apart.  Despite all the games shortcomings, there were some people who loved it. Some thought the technical issues only added 'so bad it's good' charm of the game. And of course, the plot and writing of this game is brilliant, if not completely insane. It was obviously heavily influenced by the David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Many of the characters, including the main one, are completely bonkers. The main character Francis York Morgan always introduces himself by saying 'I'm Francis York Morgan, but just call me York, that's what everyone always calls me.' He constantly talks to his imaginary friend Zach. He says not to ask him about Zach, that's a 'private matter.' He literally tells his fortune by looking at the milk swirls in his coffee. To give you an idea of how crazy the writing in this game is *tiny spoiler ahead*, there's one part where a guy in a wheelchair with a skull mask and a gask mask on, who talks by whispering rhyming sentences to a translator, orders a bizzare sandwich in a restaurant. This sandwhich happens to be white bread and turkey, with strawberry jam and cereal(which appears to be corn flakes) smeared on top. York comments that this is a sinner's sandwhich, a sandwhich ones makes to punish themselves for their sins. The guy in the wheelchair challenges York to try this sandwich. After York tries it he jumps out of his chair in surprise, saying it's delicious and orders one. The expression on the two women's faces next to him is one of the moments that makes this game a masterpiece. BTW, you need to actually try the sinner's sandwich. I used Publix Italian Bread, Smucker's strawberry jam, deli turkey meat, and cornflakes. Putting the jam and corn flakes on top is ludicrous, so I just flipped the bread over. Surprisingly, it's delicous. I even made a second one after finishing the first one. SWERY says one of his starving college student friends actually made this, because he didn't have any money and those were the only ingredients he had. Too be honest, Americans put cranberry sauce and potato chips on sandwiches, so it's not too much of a stretch.  Slowly, but surely, just like the game NiER, Deadly Premonition gained gained a cult following. It did so for it's amazing writing and 'so bad it's good' gameplay. If you get this game, be aware that it may not even run properly and you might have to finish it by watching a let's play on youTube. SWERY actually apologized for this horrible port. However, there are a ton of fan patches out there to fix the problems. SWERY was flattered that the game had so much support that people would go to these lengths to make it playable. He said he wished he could hire some of the people who fixed his game. It might remind people of another cult game that was broken on release and had to be fixed by fan patches, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. That also featured terrible gameplay, but a brilliant plot.  Definitely give this game a chance if you're a fan of cult classics. At least watch a let's play on youTube to experience the plot and bizarre characters. SWERY has also created a new game, D4, which is a lot less broken and features characters that are even more insane. Sadly, SWERY's games have failed to make any money(he released D4 on the Xbone and not the PS4 I mean, come on, the only thing Xboners play is Call of Duty), and he has taken some time off to recover from an illness but insists he'll be back. We can only hope. This guy is up there with Eric Wolpaw(Portal, Psychonauts, and Old Man Murray) as one of the industry's best writers, and it would be a shame to lose him.
2491	I am thinking that this game is pretty good.
2492	I temporarily stopped playing this game to watch the movies York was talking about. Thanks, Zach!
2493	It's alright.
2494	Here's what I recommend:  1. Buy the game; support the developer 2. Don't play it 3. Watch all the cutscenes on Youtube  While there's approximately 6 hours of cutscenes, you'll find this to be much more enjoyable. The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next.   Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).  This gentleman/woman took the time to piece together everything. Youtube link:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut - The Movie / All Cutscenes in 1080p [1/3]&nbsp;
2495	I don't even know where to begin to describe this. This is probably the worst PC port in the history of ports (even worse than Dark Souls). It crashes constantly and has little glitches here and there. That's not even touching upon the absolutely horrendous combat and driving mechanics. But hell if this wasn't one of the most unique games I've ever played. And the story is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game, and for that alone I'd recommend this game over a hell of a lot of other titles. If it's on sale and you think you can stomach the little fixes and mods you'll need to actually run it, you might just love it. Otherwise, pick up the more stable PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.
2496	I usually don't do this, but play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.  On a console.  The PC port is almost unplayable, but pick it up if you don't have a console.
2497	The game is a pretty good game. Its flawed but a lot of fun. Its especially more fun when you're a fan of Twin Peaks and you can see the inspiration from it. It just added to the game for me. But anyways yeah, the game is pretty fun. Too bad the PC port is garbage 8(
2498	If you can you should just go ahead and play the original or the PS3 version of this excellent terrible game, otherwise prepare to soldier through a lot of freezes and crashes, I did, but it took all my determination and autism to do it.   I'm proud of myself.
2499	The best worst game ever
2500	Drug Addict Developers Award. Now. To this game. It deserves it.
2501	This game is just so terrable its amazing!   It has a uniq story line and good characters! AND YOU CAN GET TOMS BISCUTS!
2502	When I first played this game I was blown away, not by it's graphics or it's gameplay but how strange everything was. All of the characters are memorable and 90% of the dialogue will have you saying 'what the â¥â¥â¥â¥?' but it's got tons of charm. I can't recommend this game to just anyone though because it takes effort to look past it's shortcomings and really appreciate what it offers.  Did that sum it up pretty well Zach?
2503	Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.
2504	A technical clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ hiding probably the most unusual and entertaining Twin Peaks fan game i've ever played.
2505	This game is just so terrable its amazing!   It has a uniq story line and good characters! AND YOU CAN GET TOMS BISCUTS!
2506	It's pretty much Twin Peaks: the game. Need I say more?
2507	F K in the coffee.
2508	If you're like me, you'll walk into this game blind. You'll have to fight with technical issues and endure some unpolished gameplay. If you're like me, you'll find yourself loving the characters so much that whatever issues the game has takes a back seat to the experience and you'll want to know what happens next.
2509	I do love this game, the story is very engaging. I love the characters and they are also engaging to the point I actually remember even the not very important ones. Gameplay is more old school horror kinda like RE, It is rare that I love horror games to where u always have a time limit. But I also understand why and they do give u enough time to do things. For it's time even the graphics were pretty I was amazed. Now for some of the Negitives was... I kept playing with my controller,And some times during QTE like running my controller wouldn't work at all. I tried to get the patch but the site didn't seem like it was there any more. And some glitches in the game were terrible like whe I had to follow someone, And she disappered off the screen and I failed the mission cause of it. Or I would go in a room and it would be completely black and I would fail the mission cause I fell through the world. Quite a few times I had to completely restart a mission cause of it. Or I would have to close the game because my game slowed to a crawl and if I didn't then I couldn't shoot anything fast enough or the QTE would be terrible. O ther than that I do recommend giving this a game a try especially if u are big on old school horror.
2510	An obscure game known for being the most polarizing horror game ever, Deadly Premonition delivers a memorable experience.

2512	Just love it. Sure itÂ´s 'terrible' as a game, but I canÂ´t but say that itÂ´s pure gold for anyone who loves Twin Peaks or something deeper than gameplay and visuals.
2513	One of my all time favorite games. You have to play it to believe it. It'll bring you tears and it'll make you laugh. It's truly a game worth playing.
2514	I can't recommend this game enough! This is above all my favorite story ever. It's the cheezyest most hilarious best worst thing ever made!
2515	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥!

2518	Best worst game.  Like a Twin Peaks video game made by the characters of Twin Peaks.
2519	the best game ever created
2520	This game is the embodiment of so bad its good gaming. the game play, the characters, the visuals, and the controls are a train wreck in the most beautiful way. (insert meaningless number score here).
2521	Zach, the coffee told me to nominate this game for the 2016 Steam Awards 'Game Within A Game' Award  Sinner's Sandwich/10 would premonition again hurhurhur
2522	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
2523	One of the best games ever made. It will give you the feels.
2524	Still the best game ever.
2525	The best worst game.
2526	F K in the coffee.
2527	Deadly Premonition is one of those games that defies description. I could write pages and pages and it would still not capture the experience that is playing this game. Just playing this game is a labor of love. There will be times when you hate yourself for deciding to play it (usually after it crashes and you realize you haven't saved in forever). There will be times when the wonky game mechanics will frustrate you to no end. Even before you play the game you will likely already regret buying it when you can't get it to work properly and have to comb through forums to find the fix to your specific problem. However, if you can push through the many absurd flaws that this game has you will be rewarded with a truly unique experience. It is certainly not something that everyone will enjoy, but I think that it is worth giving it a shot.  Likes: Unique experience, funny and fairly decent story and dialogue, good soundtrack, very ambitious in scope  Dislikes: This game has so many issues I couldn't even list them all, game mechanics are often executed poorly, fairly dated visuals, Can be repetetive if you only do main story  Feeling a strong 8 to a light 9
2528	the best game ever created
2529	Best worst game.  Like a Twin Peaks video game made by the characters of Twin Peaks.
2530	â Poor graphics â Poor sounds â Poor optimisation  â The best game I've ever played â
2531	Game is clunky and poorly balanced, it looks like a late PS2 game, and it's it's as scary as moldy bread, but it's got a quirky sense of humor, characters that are well written and easy to get attached to, and a fun plot. It's also got a lot of collectible content and events you may need multiple playthroughs to obtain. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to how much you love the game.
2532	An ugly, clunky mess of a game and a charming, witty, compelling adventure full of character. Deadly Premonition is weird and brilliant, sometimes buggy and tedious, yet inexplicably fun and unique. You can grab it for a very low price during sales, and it's my advice that you do because this is one of those experiences everyone has to go through.
2533	10/10 when you get it (sort of) working!
2534	There is so much to love here, the technical performance is not one of them (crashy) but hell it's worth it just for the whackiness, it's all the things you love about Japanese games turned up to 11. Cannot recommend it enough. bit of a tip, this game seemed to work better streamed than native, lol. And I challenge anyone who plays this to not whistle the them tune at least once a month.

9921	Wow, well I had ok hopes for this when I downloaded it. Real let down, holy crap do the controls suck. Its also extremely hard to figure out where you are being attacked from and where the enemies are, as whenever you are under threat deafening battle music starts playing, that and there doesn't seem to be directional sound effects from the bad guys.  I gave it an hour, waste of $17 sadly. cool ambience, they tried.

9923	The majority of the weapons tend to be posititioned incorrectly for a first person perspective, if this issue is fixed and a basic waypointing mechanism is implimented(?), then I can possibly recommend this game. As it is, it is a mess of a game and not worth playing.  These issues aside, I think it is a very interesting concept and very much worth expanding on.  But, because of these issues, I cannot reccomend this game at this current time.
9924	This game has good ideas that are poorly executed. The guns iron sights are inaccurate at best, but the worst thing about this game currently is the difficulty. Its not so much the amount of damage the enemies do but they move so fast they are hard to hit, and there hit boxes are weird, The worst part is the insect like enemies dive towards you, This gives you knock back, then they turn instantly and do the same to your back. This knocks you everywhere, which is frustrating and if there are more then 3, you are basically stun locked, and the enemies have even gotten stuck in my character model and repeatedly do damage. This would not be a problem, but it's happened a large number of times, not to mention the other bad bugs like, The mouse in inventory is hyper sensitive, and the camera has pop out of the character model a number of times. This is early access so I hope the Dev does a large number of updates to address these issues because this game needs a lot of work. As it stands right now, avoid this game like a rat during the black plague.  Small update to this review. The game has slighty improved, the inventory now works and the enemy animations are better, however the game is still not worth it in my opinion, it still consists of saving and reloading because of small enemys bouncing you everywhere. It's a dam shame, I want to like it, but I just can't it's just too awful.
9925	INITIAL REVIEW:  Disappointing. I got this with its sequel bundled. The opening was very indie, which is fine, but then once I got out of the ship and into the hangar, my controls started to spin. I checked calibration on my controllers (which I had no intention of using) and my joystick and throttle and none of them were sending the input needed to cause this, nor were they in non-neutral positions. After doing some enabling and disabling of devices, I found that if any controller that wasn't a GamePad was plugged in, the game would look to the left and up, and spin.   Wasted money, I'm not uninstalling my HOTAS setup just to play a budget game.  FOLLOWUP REVIEW:  Alright, I unplugged my controllers in order to be able to ensure the game got a proper review from me, as a matter of fairness.   This game is the labor of love of one person. Just one, and with that considered, it's pretty impressive as an endeavor. Unfortunately, it is the labor of love of one person. Just one, and with that considered, it's understandable why this game is essentially stuck with its sequel in the cheap-games bin. It's an admirable attempt, and better than other one-man shows (please observe Derek Smart's 3000AD games for details), but falls short of being a good game.   First, lets address the issue tied to the review above; controls. The controls in this game are just wonky. Any control pad detected will be enabled, and cannot be disabled. For those with more than a basic controller setup, this requires dismantling your rig a little in order to be able to play the game. The official response from the developer (via the forums) to the problem is to unplug the USB devices that are controllers you don't want to use. That's a Windows XP era problem that we shouldn't have now.  On the thread of controls, the controls in this game are a little odd. You can't customize them mid-game; you must quit the game to its menu to change control assignments. This is annoying, as it also deprives the player of quick reference keys for the controls. Movement is slow, which makes sense (walking carefully with magnetized boots), but aim is weird. The gun is held in a way that suggests you're holding it at face level, which makes aiming quite difficult against small targets.   The hitboxes make little sense. Zombie crewmen die if you shoot anywhere near their head, but you can put 20 rounds into a small alien and still miss it. There are a lot of 'why is it not dead yet!!!' moments.   The last thing I want to address is the plot. I was excited about this at first; a damaged hangar, then a couple of zombie crew in the hallway that looked more like mutations than proper zombies. Just about anything could cause that. This was like System Shock 1 when you wake up wondering why the medical equipment just tried to kill you, or Dead Space when you get chased down a hallway by the first bad guy. Then there were eggs everywhere that looked like the egg pods from System Shock 2. I dont' know what they do. Then there were the aliens. They're fast, small, and fragile, but the weapons provide enough difficulty aiming to make it possible to get hurt. Easy stuff honestly, but at this point, I realized...I knew the plot. The whole ship was infected with an alien bogeyman illness and it made zombies, and the aliens were there because enemy variety. I finished the second mission, go talk to the AI in Operations, and sure enough, that's what she said. Mystery solved. From here on out, the game is DOOM Ultralite. Fetch quest, unlock thingy, kill from point A to point B, unlock special prize lockers with passwords.   That's the real disappointment here. The game comes off in advertising like a mystery needs solving, but the AI spoonfeeds it to you. If you're looking for a game version of Event Horizon, where the plot is slowly revealed through discovery, this game isn't it. Even System Shock, which dumps the 'SHODAN IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' plot on you in the first few rooms, leaves minor stories throughout that cover how that happened and the final moments of crew members. Instead, the game favors an RNG for enemy spawns, which gives up control of a lot of plot elements.   Unfortunately, this game is a reminder that an open world game with nothing but discoverables isn't really open-world; its a game where the developer didn't add a directional marker. I saw no real motivation to move throughout the ship, and I found myself really bothered by the plot for a reason I couldn't put my finger on. Then I realized it: the AI said that the player is the only uninfected person aboard the ship. A Military ship, containing the 'greatest threat' the in-game military had ever faced. Which, according to the AI, is in a 'decaying orbit' (a sci-fi BS term that means that the ship is brushing the atmosphere of a planet and is slowing down, which will cause it to fall. FYI, that's not orbiting, that's crashing). With a perfectly functional heavy fighter in the hangar. A real military officer wouldn't be trying to solve a damn thing...they'd get in the fighter, get to a stable orbit, and watch the plague ship and all that it is carrying burn up in the atmosphere as a matter of containment. The very things they would not do are disable the lockdown on the ship, try to get it back online, and then try to fly it to Earth. Guess what you do?  Bravo to the developer for all the work they did on their own, but the gaping plot hole, control difficulties, and some minor quality issues tied to being indie, I can't bring myself to recommend the game. DOOM3 BFG Edition does it better, and is a AAA game that is not very expensive.
9926	This is a very amateurish title. Bad graphics. Bad animations. Bad sound effects. Bad gameplay where you mostly shoot bugs which have taken over an entire ship. I must admit I am only playing this game for 2 hours and I really do not feel like seeing more of it. Lighting is bad. The flashlight is mounted on certain weapons only so if you want to light a dark area you have to equip the weapon with the flashlight. How stupid is that? Animations are bad. Those bugs that are attacking seem to have maybe 2 frames of animation. When you right click to aim there is no smooth animation. The player's hands just pop up in the middle of screen and back. Very bad.   Everything would be forgiven but there is also no storytelling. Well maybe later in the game but my eyes hurt already from the blinking lights. I mean. you put one blinking light in a corridor and you create atmosphere. You put blinking lights everywhere and you feel it is absolutely necessary for an electrician to fix the lights before doing anything for the aliens.  Bad game, but nice try if this is a first game. Maybe the second title will be better.
9927	There are no animations for going into the ironsights or out, the ironsights on one of the guns differs from first aiming down them and shooting, the enemies aren't creative or fun, and the game felt overpriced in the end.  In a way, I would call this an unimpressive Doom 3 clone. If you want a Doom game, get Doom 4 in a couple months from when I write this review.  However, I do see that work went into it, and the voice actress did well for what was required from her, so good job on that. Good luck in the future, developers.
9928	Although the game idea is great, the ai for some of the enemies is horrible. Its a frequent thing to see monsters get stuck runing into walls, and not turning around to fight you, even when you walk up behind them. AI need to be optimized before this game can be recomended
9929	Good game worth a couple of bucks DO NOT pay full price. There's better games for less money.  It's a neat idea. Would love a AAA version of this game. (neat idea being the rogueliek aspects)  This game is a poor mans Doom 3. Poorly optimized and not very pretty, but it is indie.  1st thing it is NOT realistic. Whoever wrote that in reviews needs to play better games.  2nd thing it is kind edgy. You do get tense. I lasted maybe 15 minutes in my first run (i played it like any fps horror game conserve ammo and use the thing with recharging ammo.)  3rd the enemies are a pain cause they are twitchy in a weird way (not a good way) and its hard to hit them. But not for good reasons (i.e. they are sneaky or fast.) they are ahard to hit cause the gun fires wildly the sights are useless. kneeling and aiming is useless. the blasts randomly go places and the enemies randomly bounce.   Player Nakor has the best review of this game i will copy a couple of his points:  Shooting  Shooting can be painful.  Guns that do not reload but recharge instead are nice, but there is no clear indication of this which can definitely be a problem in battle. Hitting what you shoot at is often difficult because the enemy hit boxes are too small or oddly shaped, and the guns are horribly inaccurate. The UI is not well designed (yet?) and does not indicate well your reserves of ammo.  Enemies  Having a few enemies be annoying is fine, but when the majority of your enemies are based around being annoying you have a problem. Tiny enemies with tiny hit boxes moving around fast with inaccurate weapons = This is dumb, I'll play another game.
9930	1. cant aim very well 2. small enemies tiny hit boxes moving really fast 3.i seemed to get launched down hallways when being attacked 4. where am i being attacked from?
9931	I like the concept. It's gonna be an excellent game when it gets some much needed polish.  Gripes: The weapon placement on screen.  Some of them literally take up half the screen. It's sad canuse it takes away from being able to see the otherwise excellent looking game. Yeah, it's tough to hit enemies. Do I suck at games or are the hit boxes too small?  Other things are minor things that can be fixed with spit and polish. A slightly clunky menu system / game nav. But nothing that would drive me away for good. I sincerely HOPE the dev sees these reviews, and comes back to this, instead of moving onto other projects.   This game has excellent potential, and is being spoiled by minor things.
9932	Another really bad game. So mant things that make this unplayable.  Graphics, controls, Weapons that seem ineffective. I could go on, but would rather just say, don't buy this. I'm removing this from my drive. I have so much better to play.
9933	Ok. So, I'm not sure whether to reccommend this game, so I'll give you my experience and you decide.   Startup game, go straight to options to adjust it to my computer. Find that there is NO options aside for master volume for audio. Resign myself to this fact. Start game. Long opening (skippable), explaining the situation prior to the game. I presume this game takes place after the previous CDF game, of which I have not played. I then start the game, on my first playthrough I selected regular difficulty, and allowed game tips. Big mistake there, they throttle you like the gas pedal on a speed demons car. I then pick up the pistol as the ai commanded. Then I left the room. This took about half a minute...Then I got a minute of loading. Then on my first playthough I grabbed the weapon on the floor, as commanded the ai, killed some enemies, and explored. The second playthrough I did the same, minus the exploring, and went straight to the stairwell to proceed. This took about another minute to do. Then I was greeted by a loading screen. Load screen done, I entered the next area, killed some enemies with maximum difficulty because I COULDN'T SEE THEM! Not because it was too dark, but because as soon as they got line of sight, they decided to make sweet sweet love with my butthold, using their tentacles. After a firefight that lasted 10 times the length it should have. In the first playthough I explored the area, which took ten minutes, because I mistook a doorway blocked with boxes for a wall. The second one I went straight there. In the first playthrough I soon realized when I reached this area that the game uses MONO audio, or something equivical to it. This thoroughly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off, because I couldn't tell where the EXTREMELY LOUD enemies were coming from, and it's not like a spent nearly $300.00 on a 7.1 surround headset to listen to audio that's quality lead to it's discontinuation in the 70's. I completed the objective, and proceeded back to the stairs, where I was greeted by another loading screen. On my second playthough this was 3 minutes after the most recent load screen. I then went down a floor, and was greeted by another loading screen half a minute later...I hadn't seen this many loading screens since half life. My first playthough didn't make it this far, as I'd lost patience by that point, so the rest is second playthough. The fourth loadscreen in 10 minutes of gameplay that I'd had by then out of the way, I proceeded to stand in a room listening to an ai tell me that I have to kill 3 people. I proceeded to find the first in the armoury on the same floor, and was greeted by him shooting me, and quoting the game over scene from the alien series. I then peeked from cover and shot at this man, who didn't move, nor APPEAR to return fire. I say appear because I was then instant killed despite no sign of shots fired.   To put it plainly, I am not mad...I'm just disappointed. I feel insulted by the quality of the game, which I can only assume was put out in one drunk lazy weekend. I feel plainly gouged by the price I paid for this game. I compare this to a game that I'd been playing along side it, Space Beast Terror Fright, which is a few dollars less, and a bit lighter on content, but in early access, and I feel it's a more complete game than this shambles of a mistake. I think I would like to take back what I said earlier about whether I reccommend this game. I don't. If it were free I'd say try it, but it's not, and it's overpriced for what it is. It's a steamy dump in a discarded paper cup that claims its coffee, and asks for $18.99. Don't buy it, it isn't good, and presumably will never be good.
9934	This game is unbalanced, dark and 'no clue what to do' one. I choosed most easy difficulty and turned game tips on. Anyway i am die too often in searching where i need to go. There is no actual map or journal and you will roam endless corridors trying to find that damn Cargo Hold! Why in that future that hero don't have any DataPad or personal PC or else to look at whole Ship's map to find out main locations? This is so unrealistic! Monsters will run at you in a huge masses and you will spend all you ammo on them without killing all of them (because they are made from very solid concrete - even small bugs and worms:). Even on most easy skill, even in almost very beginning of the game - YOU WILL DIE! Why in hell this game is so difficult? Why we can choose Easy skill? I think it is for whom who do not want to be in permanent dying from the beginning... Where is IMMERSION? Just imagine that you spent all of you ammo (and you collected a lot of new weapons and ammo before) but they are still alive and new ones are coming and coming in masses! But you don't have a melee weapons at all and you endless rifle recharges toooo slow. With what i must kill them? With bites and spits?:) You even can't do a kick/punch. Also you can't escape them because they are much faster than you and will corner you and eat you for 100500% Cool, yeah? Die most stupid way simulator ever made with most stupid but very quick and most tought monsters ever! Can it be more absurd? Also you can't see any game options without complete exiting to the main menu. Resuming game will reload you last checkpoin instead of you last manual quicksave - very stupid, who will play the same parts if he already saved his further progress? Digital mastrubation? No crosshair at all in that complete darkness. Ok, maybe on higher skills and not in Easy too? And so and so... Nice concept, spooky atmosphere, cool graphics... But that ugly unbalanced gameplay kills all wishes to play further. If i will want some challenge - i will play System Schock 2 again, for example. That game is fair.  Not recommend until complete rebalance will be made. Author killed his game himself. It should be very immersive atmospheric game. But when they begin to scream, run like flies around you and bites you to dead - no, it become deadly hillarious. Make 'Easy' really easy for noobs/lazy ones like me. That will be fair. Do not spawn hordes of monsters in the very beginning - that ruin all immersion. Lower HP of some monsters which are looks like small bugs but can't be killed by whole clip. Make DataPad or make Journal/Tips little useful - at least on Easy again. Why you want me to be killed so fast and so ugly way? I feel myself cheated and injured... 3 from 10.   P.S. Found solution to bring balance to this peace of code:  *\SteamApps\common\CDFGhostship\Engine\Config\BaseInput.ini [Engine.Console] ConsoleKey=Tilde in game press Tilde type God press Enter But this didn't helped to bring back interest to the game. I am on high speed train to 'Uninstall' station...
9935	 Early Access Review
9936	This is a really poor FPS trading off the amazing reputation earned by the Alien and Dead Space franchises. The atmospherics are a very third rate, and one feels no fear at all within the supposed ghost ship. It is like Quake or Doom in sophistication but with low lights and smoke. And the first aliens one encounters start with...err...rather large fleas which nibble at you. Dont buy this disappointing game it might put you off the scifi space horror genre - go for Dead Space or Alien: Isolation. The latter is the current state of the art in 2015 and it is mind-bogglingly good. FoR
9937	terrible. graphics. gameplay. etc. sorry i bought it.
9938	This game is absolutely awful.  Don't waste your hard earned cash.
9939	Wass refunded instantly. Thanks!
9940	Can i get my money back!?
9941	 Early Access Review
9942	CDF Ghostship....*sigh* Is it worth your hard earned money, is it worth the energy clicking the purchase button, is it worth thinking about purchasing it....*sigh* I haven't played alot of this...pile of bottom wiping material. I was too affraid guys, I was so affraid about how F*****G AWFUL my play through would end up to be. This game has got 500 awards from me, they are WORST GAME OF THE CENTURY AWARDS, that's right...THIS...IS...THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! I have COMPLETELY WASTED 15 minutes of my life on this pile of elephant s**t. I went through a mental breakdown at the end of my 15 minute play through. If you are still reading this review, maybe I haven't convinced you how F*****G AWFUL this game really is. You want convincing? I'LL GIVE YOU CONVINCING!!!, This ''game'' is f*****g NZ$19.99, not nine dollars...IT'S F*****G NINE F*****G TEEN NINTY F*****G NINE GUYS!!!! GUYS LISTEN TO ME! $19.99!!!!!! FOR THIS UTTER GARBAGE!!!!!  I'm sorry guys, I haven't controlled myself for this review, CDF Ghostship is not worth a buy, thank you
9943	Totally disappointing. Refunding now.
9944	I love the concept of the game and I love the graphics. This game had it all to be pure gold, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this at the present time. The amount and severity of bugs make the game not enjoyable at all. Invisible dirt spots, objects getting stuck in corners or under the floor, movement glitches, janitor's box glitching in several and disastrous ways, fireplace not destroying some items no matter how long they're kept in (had to re-insert them to make it work), items going trough the buckets and disposable bins, itens flying violently all over the place when a laid down bin is put in the right position... I could also list some refinements that make gameplay better, but these glitches and bugs are way more important, and they're not being addressed so a list of improvements is unnecessary. Conclusion: Do not buy it no matter how cheap you find it.
9945	Itâs very hard to recommend this game, while it starts out as being fun it quickly turns into a chore to play. You may make it to the end and give yourself a well-earned pat on the back however when the time comes to clock out you might find that all the hours you just spent cleaning has been a big waste of time.  Items such as buckets fall under the map making it impossible to finish the game, I found sometimes when tnt came out of the wash-o-matic I was unable to pick it up straight away leading to more frustration.  Even though I was averaging 90fps I found the game extremely nauseous inducing even with the settings turned right down, this was only made worse with more blood, buckets and waste bins that were introduced into the game.  Now that I have finished the game I donât think I will ever play it again, kind of a one time play type of game only made worse by not being able to save progress.  5/10

9947	this is the type of game that you really need to think about for you buy it because it depend on what type of game that you like it has a cool and funny idea behind it but its just about cleaning up dismembered elves woo soo fun as you can imagine this game gets very boring very fast in the sence that you do the same prosses of cleaning for every elf grab the elf burn him clean the blood thats it nothing too it but what can you expect a game to be for so cheap but that does not make up for the lack of content that is provided
9948	This game was interesting to me after seeing Jack and Daithi play it. However, the game runs horribly for me.
9949	This game was made from a good idea.. However cleaning a room is fun for one hour. After that, it is more boring than funny and the only reason that I have finish this game is Achievements. So I don't recommand this game.
9950	I was thinking of buying the full Viscera Cleanup Detail game but after playing this I'm glad I didn't. There are no tutorials so if you don't understand anything, tough. It seems they went down the road of making a har har physics game rather than something with actual gameplay. Often, you end up making more of a mess than you're cleaning due to unavoidable clumsiness that the game seems to think is part of the fun.
9951	Its pretty boring to do. You play it once or twice thinking that its pretty fun but then youll leave it to gather dust forever. Pun intended
9952	I don't have the main game and there is no tutorial so after initial confusion it quickly becomes clear to me that a game about cleaning up is about as exciting as it sounds...  Viscera Cleanup Detail Santa's Rampage - First Impression recorded at 60fps   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsU8ZPNNhCM  11:27 Fun with dynamite :p 13:52 Zzzzz I hate cleaning. 16:44 Letters to Santa Claws. 24:16 I'm fed up with this 'game'. Just watch it burn. 
9953	This review is basically in the middle of yes and no. The game is pretty fun but there is not much to do and it becomes boring super fast. The graphics are good the controls are also good but unless your the type of person that goes achievement hunting in a game there is no way you will play more then a hour of this game. The problem I have with this game is that there are 3 different Viscera cleanup games. This one, a space station one, and some sort of dlc i believe. If all 3 of the games I just listed were different levels in one the game would be more enjoyable. If your going to get this game make sure it's on sale
9954	I blew myself up 5 times with TNT and then cleaned up my own body parts. 10/10.  But on a serious note, this game gets extremely repetative and boring very quickly, and is really only worth $1 at most.
9955	Took my friend's head and mad an ornament in the tree.  7/10   Lacks of heads.
9956	This game is fun for one time play only. So if you plan on buying agame that you want to get addicted to... than don't buy this game =)  For the people who are interested in this game, It has some minor glitches which keep you from completing the 'Completion achievements' and the game might be quiet laggy.
9957	The now update makes it to where it wont load
9958	Fun for about an hour, I'd advise you skip this one.
9959	Great game with friends but multiplayer dont work. After 1 hour trying connect my friend server . Its makes me mad :/
9960	It runs and works like garbage. I would be walking like normal and then suddenly I would be blasted across the map and my hard work would be ruined. I had a molotav randomly explode when I picked it up- and half the stuff was glitched. Everything is just too hyper sensitive- I tried putting things in the waste basket to make things easier and I knocked it over and it flew across the room by putting a knife in it.  It's not bad game! It's just got wayy too many bugs right now for me. I'll change my review if it gets an update.

9962	if you windows 10 or anything thats not windows 7 you cant play this. you will have to wait for them to make it winows 10 compatible
9963	Want to spend an hour cleaning up a house only to clock out of your shift and find that it's still not spotless? No thanks. Nonetheless, a pile of elfs and a stick of dynamite might cheer you up.
9964	This is by far the worst in the Viscera Cleanup Detail series. Design of the level is not suited for the gameplay mechanics on this one. There are numerious objects that you must pickup and spots that you must clean in places far above you reach.   Stacking boxes to reach them doesn't work since trying to put more than 5 boxes on top of each other is virtually impossible. The engine is not designed to do such a thing.  Containment boxes are largely useless because present boxes do not fit in them.   Dynamite can literally make it impossible to complete the level by sending some dirt to the ceiling, where you cannot ever reach.  Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior although shorter is infinitely better designed. Get you free copy of that game with Shadow Warrior instead of paying money for this.
9965	The map is too small and it get boring if you play too long.
9966	Too lazy to clean up in real life, too lazy to clean up in game. There's no diffrence. it's boring and a waste of time. it takes way too long to actually clean up and it is repetetive
9967	i dont want this game anymore because i dont want it to screw up my pc ;(
9968	This game was not up to standards. It is very laggy and slow. I do not reccommend for anyone.
9969	I would have more fun with cutting off my â¥â¥â¥â¥ and testicles with a rusty spoon then playing this completely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash of a 'Video Game'.
9970	Game doesnt work for me, unplayable frame rate.
9971	It's funny to see the gags in this game once, but to buy it and play it is not fun. It's just a large chore to finish. Would not recommend.
9972	Visceral Cleanup is a interesting (and insane) concept with poor development qualities.  Gameplay 4/10   The game tasks you as the cleanup crew after Santa goes off the deep end. (Santa is tired of increasing taxes, children wanting one of everything, and the tedium of being a jolly ole soul for over a millienia). What ensues is a bloody and eggnog fueled rampage from said jolly ole soul. The game has you cleaning up dead elves, reindeer, bottles of booze/eggnog, letters from a unfaithful Mrs. Claus and other bits of ridicliousness. Kudos goes to the game dev. for a orginial game and funny concept. Where the game falls flat is in the actual development .I can't be to hard on this because of two things,first this is a indie game that is still in development and second the price tag is only 2.50. For the amount of gameplay/achievements that you get the price tag isnt bad at all. But when the game will not let you complete said achievements because of under development it can be problematic.   Graphics 8/10  The graphics do a good job of dropping you into the jolly legends workshop. The happy, cheery enviroment is a stark contrast to the blood and gore in the game. It is a very detailed (right down to tracking bloddy footprints behind you when you step in viscera). The graphics arent the best in the world but they do get the job done.  Sound 8/10  The sound is much the same as the graphics they are very detailed. All of the sounds that you would expect to hear are present and accounted for, If you pick up a eviscerated elf you will hear the jingle of the bells attached to his shoes. This is just one example of the sound design. As a side note there is a radio that plays terrible Christmas music that...if you are anything like me...you will quickly destroy the radio.  Final Note  I can't recommend this game in its current state. The graphics,sound and gameplay all make for a interesting game. I can recommend someone to keep a eye on this game because with more time this could be a fun game.. Also the game is fun and very funny I enjoyed myself with it I just wish the gameplay was there a bit more,
9973	lots of problems with this game just to play i wasted 2 dollars on this worthless game
9974	I don't understand the appeal of this game at all. I kept playing through it expecting the fun part to actually start, and it never did. This entire game is a tease to the eyes, with all this interesting props and design. It shows care and work was put into it but you don't get to do anything actually fun.  I'm glad I didn't pay anything for this.
9975	Every flipping time I get on, my keyboard freaking shuts off, causing me to be unable to play the game. I have to reset my computer after it crashes, which takes forever. I usually have 3 seconds until the board shuts itself down, which makes me stay still... I dislike this game with a burning passion. So long to my money. I will miss it.
9976	this game had so much potential but sadly it does not deliver even for a game this cheap its not work it. This game is one level and doesnt have a list of multiplater servers. this game would be more fun with multiplayer. This is just a cleaning simulator thats fun for 5 minutes then you get bored and frustrated.

9980	No save-reload? It might be considered rougelike but it's too d*mn stupid!
9981	Viscera is a game were you play a space janitor...thats all I have too say.You can play it alone but it can get boring.It gets you in with its co-op mode,for a bit there can be some connection issues wich lead to frustation.It also gives you one level.Just one little level. 4/10-Basalbigfoot19

9987	A funny idea but some poor programming and bugs that look like they will never be fixed can make the game unplayable for some people and unwinable without cheats because of tasks being outside the map.  Needs more polish before I can recommend it.
9988	Im annoyed paid for this game and error Built with udk not working error !!  Tried every fix on forum and read reviews till i cant read anymore !! Waste of time and energy  GET IT SORTED !!
9989	Good game. nice graphics and very funny.... although its not very entertaining anymore after you finish it the first time as there are no new objectives or levels to unlock, the game is very buggy as well because if you miss the tiniest speck of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dirt you cannot complete it....i found myself in the UDK console running dev commands to be able to actually complete the game i recommend this game if all you wanna do is â¥â¥â¥â¥ around and do nothing but throw mutilated elves and reindeer all over the place for hours on end other than that its a thumbs down 3/10
9990	First I tought this game will be interesting, but it became boring really fast. Basically you pick up things and put it in the fire. Then clean the bloodstains with a weird mop. That's all, the only challenge is to fight with the annyoing phisycs and bugs. I played it when my brain had no capacity to play anything else. Luckily I won this in a giveaway, I wouldn't spend a dime on it.  There are so many good and cheap indie games out there, this is not one of them. Spend your money on something else.
9991	As the title suggests, play the role of a janitor sent to clean up the aftermath of Santa's rampage through his workshop. When you first enter you'll be surprised to find just how bad the rampage was. Gameplay is pretty basic, clean up the workshop and dispose of Santa's victims to clear the game. The mop cleans up blood and soot, the tracker locates messes or objects, and your hands grab/throw things. The mop has two uses first is to clean and the other kind of acts as a mean to strike/hit objects. The tracker's blue scanner tracks nearby messes while the green tracks potential objects you need to dispose of to clear the stage in a 'hot-and-cold' style. Low slow beeps when nothing is near to high rapid ones the closer you get. With your hands you can pick up just about any object or activate machines to dispense tools to help you clean.  One machine will dispense water buckets used to clean your mop when it's absorbed too much filth. Another machine will produce special bins you can carry trash, items, and objects in to dispose of. Oddly enough the only way to dispose of dirty water, objects, and bins themselves is to drop it into the fireplace. Sometimes however the bucket dispenser will drop out TNT bundles or body parts which can make your task even more frustrating. It's recommended you keep a water bucket at hand to drop the TNT into as quickly as it appears to prevent it from exploding. Unfortunately this isn't information they tell you and I lost count how many times I had to flee from the room to prevent getting blown up. Adding insult to injury you then have to clean up the mess left behind.  The bins can be equally frustrating. Meant to make your task easier they can also make it tedious. Objects are easily knocked around and if you bump into the bin from the wrong angle expect it to tip over. They do give you the ability to rotate things back to a standing position via grabbing and using the activation button. However if you have anything in that bin expect it to go flying all over the room. I must have knocked over the same bin at least a dozen times or had to clean it up again because the objects went flying. For the most part if you fill it right and properly grab the bin it remains fairly sturdy when moving it around. So they do have some use.  Now the biggest annoyance has to be the messes themselves. Even after playing for a few hours, scouring every spot I could find there were still hidden spots I couldn't and choosing to 'Clock-Out' would deem an automatic failure. A tiny invisible splotch of blood you can't see, a smudge from an explosion. The tiny bulbs that hang on the tree and garland count as messes too if they leave a colored paint splatter upon breaking. Sometimes this can be on the ceiling out of reach because a stick of TNT went off. Only way to reach them requires cheating. Due to bugs the mess you need to mop up might be hidden under the floor preventing you from finding it too. The tracker is little help since it doesn't specifically show what you missed. So again in this case you may need to resort to using the 'KillNearbyMess' command to clear it. Currently the game is still in a beta-like stage so hopefully this will be fixed in later patches.  Overall the game is a novelty and can be fun if you only want to cause mayhem, especially for the price. But after you've beaten it (There's only the workshop.) then that's it, after all that you won't likely play it again. Tossing dead elves around or blowing things up with the TNT can only entertain for so long. If you have a friend who's already bought the game, try it out for yourself before you buy. In the long run there's other games that can offer more replayability than this. Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage for the price is pretty good, but frustrations and having to resort to cheating just to clear it prevents me from giving a recommendation for now.
9992	i recommend this game if you have an hour to kill and need something to do, after that it gets very boring. as its the same thing over and over again, it gets very repetitive and very boring quickly. graphics are good and its funny picking up dismembered elf heads
9993	Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage Review  I first found out about this game from my friend. He really enjoys the game and I think has put at least 50 hours into it. I write a review after 10 hours of playtime unless I can't stand it. I've wanted Santa's Rampage for a long time and I finally got it.   The controls work most of the time, random times when carrying buckets and elf body parts fall for no reason is really fustrating. The graphics are fantastic. A full on 10 for that. It may not be a FarCry landscape but they are not bad graphics. Being a janitor in a game... what the hell? Who wants to play that? It's first-person. You mop up stuff, YOU MOP UP SANTA'S WORKSHOP. The fire-place is your main place to go, that's where you put the Elf parts that cause blood and all the extra items you want out of the area. You use the mop the most, cleaning up blood, booze, weird ornament ooze? You also have your bare hands where you can pick up elf parts and buckets and cans and all this stuff. The next thing is this weird radar that still to this day, I don't know what it does so to me, it's useless. Now to actually start my review.  You basically have 5 rooms, each time you play the game with a new job to clean, it's randomly generated blood and gore. It's just you. The easter eggs are a great part of this game and without giving too much away, finding the floor boards and rudolf's nose. Cleaning with the mop is very easy and very fun to do, you will have to dip it into the bucket multiple times which gets dirty and then you need to get a new bucket. This is actually a pretty fun concept until it's greatly overused. There's an achievement for cleaning the whole workshop and I put 4 hours into it trying to do it, ending up at the end not getting it because an ornament was stuck behind a plant. That's pretty fustrating. The greatest sense of accomplisment at ALL in this game is cleaning each room and completely finishing it. What I find pretty cool is at the beginning you can get a BRAND-NEW generated character, find out the age and backstory... BUT IT HAS NO MEANING WHAT-SO-EVER. I don't expect Viscera Cleanup Detail to have a story-line but it's the same game but in Santa's Workshop. There is one way you can die and that's blowing yourself up with TNT which half the time isn't throwable so you can't choose to die... you do it anyway. You can find Santa's shotgun and pistols but nope, you can't shoot them. I'm not expecting them to be able to shoot but it would have been a cool easteregg. This game is $2.49 and that's a pretty good deal but not entirely for this game, I'm sorry. You don't have much workspace and it's close-corredored. You are a guy but it doesn't matter who you are because it has no meaning. Most of the achievements and controls don't work and the stupid radar thing isn't useful. There's no tutorial so you have to find out how to do stuff, throws you right into it.  Multiplayer is a joke and I hate saying it. My friend and I played it once using IP addresses. You have to download this stupid program to get your stupid IP address to play, how would you know that? Besides, even with a PING on both sides of 20, it's super laggy and with your resolution down. Also, did I mention the game is not full-screen unless you set it to be full? The only time when it's not laggy is when you're using your mop or hands and not moving around. There is a jump function, what do you need it for? There's one game mode, there's not even a game mode... you clean. &lt; That I don't complain about because it's fun for an hour and that's about it.   Let me say what I like about it (unfortuantely, it's not a lot) the graphics are really cartoony and cool. It's something fresh that a 60 dollar game doesn't really have. The backstory and name's and ages of characters before play is cool even if there's no follow-up to it. Clocking out is feeling legit even if it's a 2-second thing. Using the mop is a blast for a bit, it's something new. Making it first-person is super cool. Finding the easter eggs is pretty sweet. Making a bigger mess and clocking off like a terrible guy at his job makes getting the achievement for it so much sweeter.  Unfortauntely, this is my first game that uh... I like and don't like. Even for $2.49 which may seem good, the game is not worth the money. It's about an hour's worth of gameplay if you weren't going for achievements and easter eggs. Otherwise, you get about 10 hours of playtime like me. Multiplayer sucks, fix it and don't use IP addresses. Give us a tutorial, if it weren't for my friend... I don't think that I would've gotten very far into the game without getting fustrated. Controls are 50/50, mop works the best out of everything. Easter-eggs don't do anything (shotgun and pistols) and same with character development. You know what I would've wanted to see maybe at one point like when YOU COMPLETELY CLEAN THE PLACE and about to clock-off... Santa comes. If the game was about a dollar or maybe even free-to-play it would be worth it, but in my opinion and I love the original Viscera Cleanup Detail and hope to see more, Santa's Rampage isn't worth it and it may get a couple laughs out of you but you won't last more than an hour unless you find a way to.   Check the floorboards upstairs and remove them, you get a surprise inside. -Detroit0127
9994	It's kinda funny game, but i got bored in a day, have not played after that. Trying to cleanup that place is really frustrating when you accidentally tip over a bucket full of blood, then you try to get a new bucket but you accidentaly step on blood and then your footsteps are bloody too.
9995	Personal Rating: 3/10  I never knew cleaning could be this bloody monotonous. I mean, the idea is good in context, but it's delivered in such a boring way. It's entertaining for the first five minutes. That's it. All the enjoyment you will get out of it. It's a very, themed game. Christmas. But you'd think there would be some resounding factor about it.   You CLEAN. That is it. It's down there with Woodcutter Simulator and Airport Simulator 2013. Well, a little bit above it. The music is annoying, but at least the map is, small? It's very hard to find a resounding factor about a cleaning simulator.
9996	this game even for 2 dollers is just time wasting and annoying for achievment hunters and genral gamers. this game is the worst thing i have found on steam (that i own) i wish i hadnt bought it

9998	This game for me was impossible to finish with things keep clipping through the floor.
9999	As a  standalone  I would not recommend this game. The map is really small and I highly doubt there will be many more fixes or add-ons to this game. If you buy this along with the original Viscera Cleanup Detail then I think it is a welcome addition.
10000	Boring and empty
10001	i will like it IF IT WAS FOR MAC MAKE IT for MAC I KNOW IT WHOULD NOT TAKE THAT LONG ITS 4 ROOMS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD sooooo make it for mac.
10002	As the title suggests, you play the role of a janitor sent to clean up the aftermath of Santa's rampage through his workshop. This is the interesting part, however whatever you do, you will make a mess, you will fail cleaning, because everytime you clean the floor using a mop, you will get your mop directly full of blood and if you continue cleaning with this dirty mop, you'll spread the blood everywhere across the floor and you'll make the floor even more dirty,...
10003	I personally don't find it that interesting to play.
10004	The map is so small i cant recommend this game.
10005	NO NO NO!!! I got this game to play with my friend. It says it is multi-play but is it? well in my case it is not. We could not find out how to make a server and play together. I wish that steam let you return games when I got this becuase I never play it. Don't waste your money... JUST DON'T.
10006	It feels like I should be getting paid for this.
10007	Do you dream of waisting hours of your life cleaning up blood? I didn't think so.... I enjoy this when I have NOTHING BETTER TO DO. But regretfully for this game I have a thousand choices of games I would rather play then this. In the end I got it as a gift and now I just keep it for stats and crap.   Oh no did you spill the bucket?! Better get a new one!!! *entrails and body parts spew out of the bucket machine*... The â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this â¥â¥â¥â¥?!   R.I.P bad computers. You want to start it up with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ computater? Congrats your computer might as well be mush until you can barely make it the graphic settings,  HOHOHO KIDS! I THINK PEOPLE WITH WEAK MINDS SHOULD CLEAN UP THE BODY PARTS OF YOUNG AND HAPPY LITTLE ELVES!!! But seriously if you are really empathic for anything then I pity you for playing this game.  I am not saying it's a bad game. But it isn't my cup of tea, you know what I am saying?   4/20 would fling blood everywhere again.
10008	Its only after 2 hours of gameplay that you realise, wtf am i doing with my life 11/10 would hate myself again
10009	Well that was fun, bought this before I was going to buy the actual game to see if I like it. I bought it with a friend and we couldn't join each other. Found out you had to open ports and stuff, well that didn't work so you had to use Haramachi or some weird shday program do join each other? Screw that. Refunded. I was really looking foward to this game. Looks like it'll give a good laugh.
10010	i think its hard to clean the room 100% but i think theres only one map so a bit boring
10011	I WANT A REFUND ITS TOO LAGGY
10012	Got boring after first playthrough 1/10
10013	it dosent work 4 me, it says something stopped working, my friend thinks its my pc space, is this right? please help me, i really wanna play this game!
10014	Not sure what I expected but this wasn't all that fun
10015	If you find this game so fuuuuuntastic fu-cking fun you are free to come home cleaning my apartment.
10016	it will not let me play!
10017	Absolutely terrible game, don't buy!!!!
10018	DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY IT IS STUPID AND FOR NO-LIFE WIERDOS IF YOU WANT TO SAVE 2 BUCKS DO NOT GET THIS GAME
10019	Meh, not really worth the money. It's fun for the first five minutes and then you just get bored and start thinking of the many things you could've bought with $2.50 instead of this.
10020	My friend found dead elves in the floor boards. 11/10 would play again.
10021	Boring! Bad! Don't buy this!
10022	Got boring after first playthrough 1/10
10023	it dosent work 4 me, it says something stopped working, my friend thinks its my pc space, is this right? please help me, i really wanna play this game!
10024	It feels like I should be getting paid for this.
10025	Cleaning my own house is more fun than this. 2/5
10026	I want my 98 cents back! both the x32 and x64 doesn't work work. says it canr load the D3D9
10027	this game is not for kids plus this is boring so dont waist 2.49 dollars
10028	Low quality all round
10029	um its not working it showed but nothing hapind
10030	Should have been more to it
10031	not for children under the age of 16! i found it very disturbing! please take caution when buying a game! 
10032	Meh. Annoying game. Fun to play when bored...  2/5
10033	if it weren't so damn laggy...... :/
10034	I would have more fun ripping off my left testicle than playing this game.
10035	This game is very... VERY shitly optimized it is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible running game and I have a decent PC
10036	um its not working it showed but nothing hapind
10037	If you like getting fustrated over a big mess, this is the game for you.  It's laggy and annoying. I kept having to clean the same room because the game decided to give me exploding TNT instead of buckets.  There's a line between fun and hardwork, and games are usualy to escape from that last one. This game could be fun, but the fact that it's too messy, hard to clean and also that there's not even a save button makes it boring. I don't like to have to play a game all at once, specialy when it's so fustrating that makes me want to rage quit.  If I wanted to clean houses and do hard work i'd be cleaning my house instead of procastinating, like what i'm doing right now.  other than all of that, i did like the enviromnent of the game and the theme itself.
10038	it sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥
10039	boring
10040	Im sorry but as fun/funny the game seems it is incredibly borrring it should be left for people with O.C.D and the worst part is the more you play it the more borring it is and excuse me but â¥â¥â¥â¥. So it is most certanly NOT WORTH Â£5.59 PER COPPY!!!  So if you actualy want to play a fun DONT play or buy this game get some thing like Counter strike, goat simulator, total war, dota or any other good game that has sold over 1m coppys not this.
10041	This gaem haf multipaly but not wokring at al! evrithink pusibble done:( 0/5 dont bye this.
10042	Fun for an hour or two but if you leave the game it won't save... I tried getting everything done when I blew up from TNT and my body part flew under a table and couldn't get it. It was good for $1.99 but for anything above $2 I suggest not getting it.
10043	Don't remember when or why i got this, But i regret it.
10044	its crap
10045	this game sucks don't buy it it's a waste of money the controls are terrible and i'd really only ever recommend this game if i was payed to that's how terrible this game is
10046	Pretty cool concept, fun for about 3-4 minutes for a laugh. Don't pay money for this. It's just a cheep gag.
10047	THIS GAME IS LAGGY AND TERRIBLE GRAPHIC NOT FUN ,THNK TWICE!!!!!!
10048	its a stupid game 
10049	  wont load the game
10050	I bought the game, but when i click play, it comes up with BUILT WITH UDK is not working, then windows shuts the program!
10051	I don't recomend buying this game because it's just waste of money.
10052	whatever was on this game, has screwed up my software. I dont recommend this game.
10053	I think I thought I was getting a DOOM / QUAKE kind of game. I'm not sure  what  I got, but wasn't that!
10054	i dont know if this games is good becasue when i launch it an erro message saying'udk has stopped working' i need help how can this be fixed?
10055	Someone, somewhere, was paid to make this. Just let that sink in.
10056	Seemed like it could be a cool little game to mess with for $2. Didn't take long to lose interest and uninstall. For starters, it throws you into the game without directions. Once I looked at the control setup in the options menu I was able to figure out that I needed to get buckets and disposal bins from the machines. Just throwing that on the screen upfront would have been nice.   Then the mopping. You get like 3 swipes of the mop before it starts splashing blood everywhere making a bigger mess than the 3 swipes you cleaned up. While this may increase realness, it also sucks the fun out of it. And I kept knocking over the water bucket whenever I went to dip it. Is it really necessary to make the water bucket fall over that easily? It's just so tedious. I couldn't imagine it being fun in any way after realizing I'd need to clean my mop every 3 swipes. And you leave footprints everywhere any time you step in blood and well, there's blood everywhere. Hard not to step in it. And the first person view makes it hard to see what is directly below you. And if your mop starts throwing blood around, it seems a surefire way to get it on your shoes. I'm sure if you have patience for this game to move at a very slow methodical pace, taking inch by inch, you could probably master what the game expects. I don't know about other players, but I don't really want to spend hours dipping my mop and cleaning up my shoes. It's just unappealing.  There are a lot of setting options. I had to adjust resolution, toggle off window mode, adjust field of vision and mouse sensitivity, and toggle off head bob. So it's nice the options are all there to customize, but it still made me nauseated playing.
10057	This game is horrifyingly funny and yet disturbing. You make your way through Santa's workshop finding elf bodies, reindeer bits, booze, and explosives! This game is enjoyable for those who are OCD and is fun to clean up completely maybe twice at most. Good buy for $2 and I would recommend this game if you are bored out of your mind.
10058	Fun for a bit, shame of the bugs. Spent hours cleaning everything up and then found that a piece of intestine fell through the floor next to the bin-spawner and a candle beneath the fireplace (although I don't think that one counted for 'mess'). Impossible to get at. Cheated for no-clip so I could get to them. But it still wouldn't pick them up. Changed back to normal while beneath the floor and died. No way to get back. No tropy for finishing the cleanup. :( Gave up on it and restarted, then cheated the place clean because I was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Still didn't get the finishing tropy because I got the 'chrismas items all still intact' tropy which I didn't deserve. Bailed out. Shame. 
10059	really bad game
10060	No good, lousy, half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, worthless chicken nugget eating phagguts. This game is only good for playing with other people. I only collected those achievements then let the rest of the time reach up to an hour of playtime so I can at least benefit from that. This game is like bad rats. Except it isnt, Bad Rats is 100/10 COD Competition, but this game is the kind of game that makes you wish that your mum wakes you up on a Saturday morning, buys you a McRib then drives to the curb and bashes your head in. I will not and can not bear the thought of the game and wont be playing it again. UPDATE: My uncle has downloaded this and renamed it to 'Necrophiliac Paradise' So dont ask what the game is if you see me playing a game by that title. D:
10061	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME I DOWNLOADED IT AND NEVER GOT TO PLAY IT NOT EVEN ONCE
10062	I saw someone play the game on Youtube and it looked pretty fun. After an hour of gameplay I got extremely bored and lost interest in it. Waste of $2.50
10063	Although fun in the short term, this game quickly gets boring. I don't play video games to clean! What am I, a maid?
10064	i dont reccemend this game because its only good at winter and i need people to play it with me to enjoy it and its only 1 levle
10065	Don't buy this glitchy game, just watch UberHaxorNova play it.
10066	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
10067	crashes all the time, could play for about 15 sec and it crashes my computer, same with a friend
10068	WTF is this pile of Crap
10069	The whole game is just one joke that isn't funny.
10070	This game literally gave me cancer. If you value your life... I heavily suggest you dont buy this game. I played with a friend once and that made the game experience a tiny bit better, only because of the jokes we told about this cancerous game. 10/10 would clean my brains from the walls again.
10071	Why did I do it, why did I clean the whole place? Why did I repeatedly clean the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ as it got bloody and sooty again? Why did the game tell me it wasn't actually clean when I tried to quit? Why? Whyyyy? Why did I play this at all?
10072	I DOnt get this game a]like at alll so eayahaaa    ljksafd/sldkjfSL;KDJFLJKSFD
10073	Waste of money.. Wouldn't pay more then $0.50 Sadly enough did..
10074	Went in expecting weird, was not disappointed. Probably not worth the 2 bucks for most.
10075	Bad game, takes too long to finish, same thing over and over again, boring, turned the game into 'Player's Rampage'
10076	Hmmm... this game really makes you feel like you're trapped in the 19 hundreds.... in a way of speaking it probably has an engine DEVELOPED from that time....................... it has incredibly 19 dickity two features like not being able to play with multiple monitors... not being able to play over lan........... and in general being an autistic game that i would NEVER enjoy... worth 30 sense maybe... but not 2 dollah and 50... 0/10 would rather chug bleach or even listen to hannah montanaha have sex with her reality tv show brother......................................
10077	It's fun at first, but there's nothing really to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing do after you've beaten it.

10082	Not worth it...

10093	Waste of money. Just don't buy it.
10094	viscera is a game about claening up some elses mess but the problem is that the game doesn't run and the level is quite small to run around in.
10095	I would recommend this game if there was more content. The game is fun at first but cleaning the same room multiple times for a couple hours gets really boring.
10096	boring,just waist of money i just waisted 5 bucks on â¥â¥â¥â¥... dont buy it buy something else this game is just boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont buy it...
10097	its not christmas now, this is redundant
10098	meh a lie of a game in a way
10099	This game seemed like it would be awesome but after a while of cleaning it just gets BAF (Boring As F*ck). Not worth getting in my option.
10100	if you like cleaning, wasting time, wasting money and getting super mad this game is you for :) â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sucked 
10101	my brother bought this game       i want a refund     its kinda fun    but so stupid
10102	Kinda point less and if you want to play it efficiently you need friends
10103	Was the person who deleoped this game a sadist&gt;?
10104	The game causes my computer to run extremely hot for no reason and forced me to uninstall it at the risk of harming my computer. :\ The other games work fine except for this one.
10105	One level of pseudo work for your brain helps you to procrastinate and feel like you have achieved something...
10106	its not christmas now, this is redundant
10107	I would recommend this game if there was more content. The game is fun at first but cleaning the same room multiple times for a couple hours gets really boring.
10108	Just what even
10109	boring,just waist of money i just waisted 5 bucks on â¥â¥â¥â¥... dont buy it buy something else this game is just boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont buy it...
10110	I want to play this game, however its key bindings are set up to be arrow keys and every time i try to change it to ASWD and space it defaults back to arrow keys. Looking in the forums this has been a problem since the game was released and all they've said is 'we'll look into it'. Well fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing games controls before selling it or make the default controls appeal to the majoirty which is right handed people. Basically the default controls are lefthanded and the game wont allow changes. the options available but it doesnt work, so unless youre left handed dont buy this game.
10111	  the fact that i lower the volume and it goes back up just makes it impossible to play... i tried several 'fixes' and 'tricks' and nothing solved it...
10112	To read my full review, visit MouseNJoypad;  http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/want-human-review/   Iâm not going to mince words- I did not enjoy my time with âI Want To Be Human.â Outside of the gameâs buggy and outdated gameplay, it lacks anything memorable or interesting enough to keep anyone's attention for very long. Sure, itâs quirky- but it's that kind of humor thatâs weird for cringy sake. If you can get past the poor controls and frustrating level design, there are plenty of fun battles to be had. Sadly, I canât recommend this game to anyone- it just feels far too amateurish, and itâs even more disappointing when I see the work this one-man team has put out before.
10113	  I review games for my website  Nardio.net . I recieved a free promotion key for I Want To Be Human a little while ago when we were covering games at Pax East. To see the review with pictures that go to the link below. The text of the review is below. I know this is a harsh review, but this a really bad game.    http://nardio.net/2016/05/24/want-human-review/   Is I Want To Be Human worth your time? No.         What should I play this on?  I played/endured this on a PC with an X-Box controller.      What Did We Think Without Spoiling It?  This is a let down. I Want To Be Human is just a bad platformer that sells for a comically high price. Even if the game were free I would hate it. Seeing it sell for $14.99 on Steam is mind blowing to me.      How it Plays and Why it Fails:   Bad game design.    I love action platformers. I love interesting art. I love energetic music. I Want To Be Human should be a darn insta-recommendation from me. I was really, really excited to play this game. When we received a promotional key for the game I was giddy. Sadly and honestly quite painfully, horrible level design knee caps the game. I Want To Be Human is painfully bad game all around.  Ugh.  This was a frustrating game to play and even more frustrating to try and like. I want to be Human is just a bad game. I know I already said that, but I feel like I canât say it enough. The art seemed really interesting when I first started it up, but soon enough the flaws started to make themselves known. Often times foreground visual junk totally obscures the on screen action. I know this happens a bit here an there in some games, but itâs taken to an unforgivable extreme here. You just cannot see some enemies that are attacking you on the ground. You canât even see yourself!   In areas like this itâs just about shooting and hoping you get the kill. I want to be human has more problems than just foreground clutter, but that is the last thing that bugged me before I decided to uninstall the game and give up on it. I Want To Be Human has so many problems I think it patching here and there canât fix it. This game needs to be taken down and totally rebuilt from the ground up. There is a good game in here I am sure, but itât covered and covered in problems.   Lets go into some of itâs problems shall well?   Cheap enemy placement. Randomized enemy projectiles. Bad level design. Bad aiming control on a game pad. Visual clutter and bad in game lighting makes platforming and finding enemies unnecessarily difficult. Stupid text bubbles that constantly appear from the players mouth that interfere with your view of the game. (CANâT SHUT THIS OFF!) Horrible bouncing camera. Way to much unnecessary screen shake. (CANâT SHUT THIS OFF!)   I Want To Be Human is just a bad game.    It feels like I Want To Be Human is the developerâs very first game. It feels as if the dev took every new technique they learned and over used it all for fun. Then decided to sell it without cleaning the game up at all. Mechanics, enemy placement, and overall game design seems to have no concern for the player playing the game. I donât think this was ever play tested. I Want To Be Human plays that badly. Why are text bubbles constantly coming from the character that blocks everything underneath it? Why canât I shut that off? Getting knocked off a cliff by enemy bullets I canât see because my character canât stop calling dead enemies eight year old insults is beyond stupid. This is not an issue that should be in a game that sells for this much. Heck this shouldnât happen at all ever in any game. That is just bad game design.  If you hate screen shake you are going to despise this game. Even if you donât have a problem with screen shake this will bother you. As I was playing/enduring this Jasmine (Who has no problem with screen shake) was watching me play and felt ill after a while. I Want To Be Human is really that painful and uncomfortable to watch.  I really tried to get into it, I completed several levels and spent over an hour playing it, but it never felt fun and the level design only gets more frustrating. I got this game for free as a review/promotional copy and I hated it. This is in no way shape or form worth the $14.99 asking price.   Donât get this game even if itâs free.

10165	I tried, o how i tried to love this game. 500 + hours of Dark Souls 1/2/3 games, loved every minute of getting wrecked in them. This game however, tries so hard to be Dark Souls, that it forgets what makes the Souls games awesome, a FAIR challenge.  In this game, rolling is busted and hardly works, there's no stat to increase HP, the controls are clunky and fail to give the player the required fast and crisp input to complete the gimmicky bosses and over-used platforming sections. Not to mention that most of the deaths in this game come from either missing a jump, and dying, or getting hit off a ledge and dying that way. Thats not fun at all, there are hardly any fun 1v1 enemy encounters, it's constantly throwing multiple enemies at you that stunlock you, or send you flying, becuase if anything touches you, you GO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FLYING OFF THE SCREEN. Most enemies can 2 shot you, if there's 2 enemies on the screen, be sure as hell they will combo you around the screen like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Super Smash game.   The main problem with this game is that there are too many arbitrary and artifical ways they make the game harder. 'Here, fight this boss on a series of crumbling ledges that also periodically shoot fire at you' this is the definition of a gimmicky boss, sure it takes some skill, but the amount of trial and error required to get passed some of these poorly designed encounters, leaves the player feeling frustrated even after a win. Everytime i beat a boss in a DS game for the 1st time, i was so happy at what i had just accomplished, knowing i just completed a difficult, but fair fight (barring some cheesy â¥â¥â¥ bosses in DS2 of course). Another issue is that the game also reduces your total amount of HP everytime you are hit, another artifical way to increase the difficulty, even with the ring which helps reduce the amount of HP lost from taking those hits, its still completely unnecesary. It just feels like the devs made the game to make players feel bad, 'hope you like fighting on ledges that 1 misstep and your dead while 5 enemies are constantly chasing you and archers are launching arrows at your face! isnt it great how hard our game is!?' Its like the game just laughs at you and doesn't respect the player like a Souls game, which always builds up the players skills, making every new area a fun new challenge that's teaching you the ropes at the same time as kicking your â¥â¥â¥.  In the end, i think if there was far less crushingly difficult platforming and less ledges/cliffs/holes in the ground, i would have maybe stuck it out (The controls certainly don't help). But im sick of trying my best in a given section, only to have a trash mob enemy hit me once, and throw me flying off a ledge to my death. The Souls-like mechanics are well done in some places, the way Salt(Souls) work, fat rolling, weapon/armour variation and the tech tree is OK for what it is, the atmosphere is nice as well, but the game severly lacks the balance from a Souls game. That is to say, the balance of difficulty vs frustration, which is what keeps the player playing, that feeling of 'Man, i got my â¥â¥â¥ kicked, but i totally made some mistakes, and i can do better', not 'Hey this boss will 2 shot me no matter what happens unless I play perfectly for the next 5 mins' and 'Why am i fighting 5 enemies on a bunch of narrow platforms, this is cheap and makes me feel bad!'.   Im a patient man, having just finished casually speedrunning DS3, beating Doom on Nightmare (which was hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥, but so fun!), but this game will test the patience of any gamer i can think of. Be wary of this game, as it will crush your soul so hard, youll boot up a Kane and Lynch game while cutting yourself for reprieve.  -Rebuff
10166	game is fairly buggy and doesn't seem as if it has been receiving any support since may. my introduction to the game was being killed by a marauder in the tutorial area who stopped having a hit box. have also had other issues such as my salt getting tied to inanimate objects on death that cannot be interacted with, a known and documented bug that has not been fixed.  has a lot of your bread-and-butter PC port nightmare problems. borderless windowed seems to occasionally have an issue with the task bar gets stuck on top of the window, which i haven't been able to figure out how to fix other than to restart the game completely. the game had different gamma on full screen when i first played, but after realizing the game was running at 1920 x 1080 instead o my native resolution (thx,) now it seems it only runs with a murky, low-contrast gamma (I -believe- this is the intended way it is supposed to look, but there are no brightness settings to alleviate the issue of feeling like I'm playing a game with cataracts. I don't care how dark and gritty your game is trying to be.)  I couldn't get co-op working with a keyboard at all. It would prompt P2 to press space bar, but pushing space did nothing. Other fun design flops are the fact that in the default keybinding, the inventory is bound to the escape key, but if you try to set P2's controls to copy the default for keyboard, you literally CAN'T bind the escape key because the escape key cancels the input for key binding. Genius! Never mind the fact that they key binds or button mapping you set up in single player *DOES NOT* transfer to co-op and you have to rebind everything. Annoying.  other than that, the game is simply trying way too hard to be dark souls (name checks out.) It is essentially 2D dark souls without they clean, readable animations and with a lazy 'hurp burp save the princess' canned story. The Souls games have excellent stories and lore, but I guess whoever wrote this one had no ideas other than perpetuating lazy damseling nonsense. there's a PoE / FFX-esque skill grid for level ups, but as far as I can tell it is only for mundane RPG stats. There's also very little explanation of what each stat does and you are left to infer, which while your basic 'strentgh' and associated stats are fairly straightforward, others would likely be a problem for people not familiar with a souls-type game (which it is largely copying by the letter.)  It's dark, it's gritty, it wants to be souls, and the game can bug out and you can lose all your not-souls with no change of getting them back because the developers don't bug fix the game. It's lack of inspiration would be maybe forgivable, but for as many problems as I've had with it and its evidently now-nonexistent supprt, I simply can't recommend it. For almost $20, you should just go buy Actual Dark Souls and play that instead.
10167	After spending hours of frustration in this game I finally beat the thing. Not at all a perfect game its rather lonely. The only way that I know of to play with other people is to have them in the room with you. Which is an impossibility. I couldn't find a guest option, if it even exists which I found no evidence off. Not being able to play with friends online hurts the game quite a bit.  The content is a mixed bag later on. Difficulty seems to be there mostly in leaps of faith. The community doesn't help much either as they'll tell you to jump just to troll you. Which early on I became sceptical of any help they might provite. Bosses range from painfully easy or extremely difficult. Do note that I played through the game as a squishy caster so it may very from play style to play style.  Magic was far too shallow for my tastes which honestly hurts a lot of games in my opinion. Salt and Sanctuary does away with having 4 virtually identical forms of magic just with different damage or a different color. Which was nice but didn't make up for how shallow it was.  Finding magic was an absolute nightmare. I had to look it up online to find a secret passage just to get my second spell. Since I started with a fireball. It shouldn't have been tucked away like that in the beginning. Having access to your first spells and a mage early on was key to my overall success and having novice spells tucked away on a secret place really harms this for me. Mind you, I don't mind questing for spells. I quite in joy it. But If I haven't even got my barrings in the game or know what I'm doing this is a rather poor decision.   The end of the game was built up to fairly well with the little bit of diolog scattered through the game. Although its not much of a surprise, if at all, I wont spoil it. The community of the game does that for you as soon as you step onto the beach. Although the note in a bottle are more Cryptic clues from the community, it did lead me to the final conclusion I would have come to on my own long before facing the last boss. Even with that gripe, I found the story to be just enough to keep me interested in the world we where in. Which is a plus.  Punishment for death seems a bit steap. Sure, losing all your salt to a boss and some gold seems okay, but I died 99% of the time to falling damage alone. The game is DARK! Not 'OMG, Like that's gross and stuff. You know, like Scary', well it is, but dark as in 'Where the heck am I going. I can't see a darn thing!'. Which becomes frustrating because it artifically pads out the game far longer than It really needs to be. You might thing that falling to my death is my own fault. A few times it absolutely was... But not the majority of the time. Most the time it was just remembering when and where to leap. I ended up just ignoring large chunks of lost salt because It absolutely wasn't worth the effort to find the bat that'd spawn then spend the next 5 minutes trying to kill the darn thing because its everything you hate about bats in most 3D games only with a monsterous amount of health.  Salt is used for everything. Just about. Armor, weapons, leveling. Which si fine. Having something else outside of normal experience seems fine to me. I can't really complain about that, its a bit different but not in a bad way.  The skill tree is an absolute mess with a tone of redundancy. It looks sloppy and it feels sloppy. Even after I got used to it I found it to be more of a chore to work with than actually fun. The passive bonuses you get from it replace what would be called Attributes or stats in other games which pads out the leveling even further. I feel like there must have been a cleaner way to create it. Although its not as bad as other games which tie spells into their trees it still wasn't a very pleasent experience. At least it didn't fall into the same trap of trivializing old spells. But the game does that for you anyway. Which I guess its not fair of me to judge that on since most RPGs seem to trivialize your early spells.  Athetically, there really isn't much I can say about the game. It fits for the theme. Some of the bosses looked really interesting and a few of the enimes where legitamently terrifying. Though the ones that where usually threatening didn't look that intimidating and the ones that looked trully nightmare enducing where push overs. I didn't care for the over all design of the game, baring a few boss and enemy designs I found particularly interesting.  The game was Bundled into the Metroidvania summer sale package. And I can't honstly say this is a good Metroidvania game. The returning to old Locations to unlock new things or find new items is all there, but progression is pretty locked on that and few sectret items you find actually change up how you go about exploring the world. I found myself just looking up how to get to the next boss because I got so tired of stumbling my way around in the dark I just wanted to get the game over with. Which isn't a good thing. Compared to other Metroidvania games exploring the world you are in shouldn't be a chore until you want to unlock 100% of everythign. And even then most that time looking for random upgrades, bits and bobbles should be fun and exciting. Salt and Sanctuary didn't capture that for me. I found myself despising the areas I was in more than looking forward to that next discovery.  I think for me, the major recomendation factor lies entirely with Multi Player and its magic system. Since It doesn't allow for online co-op and the magic system is still too shallow for me. There isn't honstly enough here for me to recommend based on my tastes alone.  If you like the Dark Souls type games and a cryptic story with a dark setting. You'll Probably love this game. If You're looking for a Metroidvania game or a Deeper skill system in your RPGs this game really isn't for you. And Since I'm in the latter camp, I can't recommend this game.
10168	**I just completed Salt and Sanctuary with 100% of the achievements earned and it took me about 30 hours. With that being said, I think that I've seen all that this game has to offer and I find it hard to recommend this game to others.**  This game clicked for me immediately from the moment that I started playing it. I defeated the optional tutorial boss after only a couple tries. The first boss is very powerful and can be difficult for a freshly created character to defeat. If you defeat the optional boss, you get some endgame upgrade materials and an achievement. This is similar to the opening for a Souls game and I just ignored that similarity at that time.  After the first few bosses and some quick salt farming, I found that the game had a very similar gameplay loop to Dark Souls. You kill some enemies, collect salt, level up, kill the boss and unlock a shortcut to a previous part of the game. This is imitation as a form of artless flattery. The game has a wonderful art design but it just copies the Souls series a little too closely.   After some time, you get the ability to place guides at your sanctuaries. These guides sell a horn consumable that you can use to teleport back to them. After returning to them, the Guides allow you teleport to any sanctuary your visited just by talking to them. This essentially invalidates the need to unlock all the shortcuts the game offers you. There's very little point to them and you get nothing like the relief and achievement you would feel unlocking a shortcut in Dark Souls.  After some significant gameplay progress, I found that there was just too many similarities to the Souls games in general. Too many npcs and game mechanics were just copy and paste with a name change. It started to feel less like homage and more like plagiarism. Even the end of the game has a choice much like the first Dark Souls and it made the finale less satisfying to me because of that fact.  The bosses have some issues as well. Because everything happens in 2D, it's just a matter of dodging through the boss and hitting them after they do an attack. I defeated almost all of the bosses on the first try. There was only a few at the end of the game that gave me some issues, and that was simply because they had homing projectile moves or grabs that did very high damage. If a boss was challenging, it felt like they were just cheap. There were very few unique boss mechanics, most of the bosses are just damage sponges. I can only recall a few bosses that required some thought and that was just because you were required to attack a spot that you wouldn't expect. One boss had minions attached to it you needed to defeat and another boss was a sentient weapon, the wielder was immune to damage.  The next issue I had was the platforming. The jumps throughout most of the game were reasonable but the final few levels required far too many blind faith jumps. In the end it was just a matter of killing yourself until you memorized what path the devs expected you to take. It seems like they should have just taken a break and finished these final levels with fresh eyes. They are rushed and filled with artificial difficulty.  The final thing that I'd like to point out is the music. It gets incredibly repetitive. It's very rare that I mute the music in a game. I had to do that with this one. The electric guitar felt out of place and I just got tired of hearing it. The boss fights use the same song until the last few fights at the end of the game. The sanctuary song never seems to change, it's always the same tune. The sounds in general were fine, except for one water dripping effect in caves that was very jarring and artificial.  In closing, I'd definitely recommend this game on sale for 50% or greater. There's no doubt a fan of Metroidvanias would get his/her money's worth out of it. But I really want to impress upon others that as a complete experience, from beginning to end, this game is a flawed gem. It's similar to the Souls series but in a way that I found to be less than enjoyable.
10169	Bosses quit being satisfying about 4 from the end. I didn't care for it as a Dark Souls fan. I didn't feel skillful when I won, only lucky.

10172	It's a great game with a great art style. but this was NOT optimized for keyboard and it shows. It almost requires a gamepad.
10173	Salt and Sanctuary is an exercise in tedium.   When you first start playing this game it feels very good. The graphics are great with a nice crisp art style, the combat animations are pretty nice, and movement is at a nice smooth pace.  Then you start making progress and realize it just doesn't work.  It's designed to mimic dark souls but the execution is just not there. Time and time again you will mis-judge a roll assuming you will make it through their legs only to get stuck and killed, and you will be falling to your death non stop the entire game. The controls are the hardest enemy in the game by far.  It also makes strange design choices with mana and fatigue that make the game more of a slog than it should be, as you have to routinely go back to a bonfire even if your hp is full because your stamina is a mess. And this happens frighteningly fast, especially if you use magic.   It's just not good. It has alot of promise and feels great when you start out, but quickly becomes just flat tedius and you will be begging for it to end after your 100th falling death.
10174	Good game with an ugly porting. Sometimes you can't click the icons, so you have to wait until it works again, or you have to click many many times, and it isn't even a solution that works for granted. This occurs when you are buying items or talking to NPCs (Trinket for example), and is so annoying, it's so clear that this version of the game wasn't tested enough. You can use arrow keys to get rid of this problem, but sometimes it doesn't work either, so the better solution i've found is to point at the icon and then press space; seriosuly, what's wrong with these icons? Also, the game's indications are wrong, a bad porting again, if you have to buy an item, the game will say to press B (X box key) in order to confirm, while you have to press space on PC. Even if these are minor inconvenients, they makes clear that the developers didn't pay much attention to the adaptation of this product.  The game is good and I like its style, but it's annoying to spend 5 minutes in order to purchase an item, just because the program doesn't recognize that i am clicking an icon. I hope they will resolve this. I'm downvoting the game, because even if i'm enjoying it, some problems have to be solved.
10175	  PROS   - Art style is pretty cool. - Sanctuary system allows you to create a base to suit your playstyle. - Skill tree is straightforward and effective.    CONS   - Unlike Dark Souls, which is hard but fair, this game is pretty unfair in its difficulty. - Skill tree provides no real sense of progression, as health increases with level. - Stamina bar drains in like two swings.  A lot of people compare this came to Dark Souls, and it's clear why. It's extremely obvious in it's inspirations. The game incorporates a lot of ideas from Dark Souls, but implements them very poorly. In Dark Souls, dying to a boss is mostly due to lack of skill. In Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found many of the mechanics, and the enemy and boss AI to be poorly programmed. Rolling is unreliable, and blocking is clunky. There's very little indication of the stat requirements of the gear you'll find. Many of the attempts to create difficulty has resulted in things such as enemies and bosses that don't let you get up after being knocked down. I really wanted to enjoy this game a lot, and honestly I do like it, but it could have been so much better.
10176	Coop is a bloody joke. Only player 1 can play with keyboard + mouse and the progression mechanic is straight out made up by a total crackpot. Why? Have a read.  A lot of items is inaccessible for the guest player (unique items, tier 4 crafting mats, skillpoint rewards) which is a joke. Alongside the fact that a lot of things to do not work as well as in the single player version (avatars often do not grab ledges, ladders, etc.) makes the co-op the most tedious thing especially as the progression mechanics (which is ret*rded) makes you play the entire game twice (once for each player), so nobody misses out something. Also, there are gamebreaking bugs when you play past certain points as a guest e.g. if you defeated certain bosses in co-op as guest and then go play your own campaign, keys that are needed to progress do not drop.   But why would you replay it for the guest player? Because, and that is by far the greatest issue of the coop, the guest is permanently punished by not receiving specific loot, which then is in turn also removed form his/her own campaign!  Example: Black pearls are essentially skill points, some of them you can find after beating bosses, lying around in staticly placed loot bags, but in co-op only the host gets it, the guest is punished and receives a miniscule amount of salt and a sh*tty item (the salt they gain is later on far less than 1% needed for next level). And now comes the real deal: if the guest now wants to make some progress in his own campaign, the lootbags containing these skill points are empty, already opened. So player 2 is not only punished in co-op but in turn also in his or her own campaign. WHAT IS THE F*CKING INCENTIVE TO PLAY CO-OP!?   This is the worst game design I have seen in ages and although it is a fair single-player game, the co-op is a joke and an insult. Even singleplayer punishes you for trying out certain weapons, there is literally a handful of viable builds, the rest is useless.  Best thing is, all of these are known issues, just look into the official wiki, and people are posting again and again about this BS in the forum and none of these genii of devs bothers. And all of these are months old. Very consumer friendly.   It's a solid singleplayer campaign, but if you are buying this for a co-op experience, get your hands off. Too many things broken and the devs are not doing squat for months! If you want to throw your money at people for this sh*t, you're welcome.    A lot of people seem to be downvoting this review for no obvious reason, especially as all these things can be found as problems on the net, I guess fanboying manifests in the reciprocal like ratio of negative reviews. _______  TL;DR   Broken-beyond-enjoyable-without-being-high co-op and average to bad mechanics in general. Looks nice in general, but after 20 or so hours in game, you will find it lacking as there is too much broken and there is little to no variety of boss mechanics, builds or anything, really.
10177	I want to like the game, but I just can't. I keep trying to, but I can't. its not a bad game but its a platformer that tries to take its roots in dark souls. that just doesnt work, there are too many things that are specific to a game like dark souls that dont work in a platformer. you get caught on enemies way too often and lose part of your max health because you cant roll through an attack if an enemy is closer than your roll distance. oh, that scumbag cleric pickpocket, patches was right clerics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... tiny boss areas was a huge complaint in the souls series, every time a boss arena was too small people complained, cough cough dark souls 2 cough cough but tight boss areas is a part of platformers.... what makes dark souls hard definitely makes salt and sanctuary hard, but what made dark souls fair just doesnt work as well in a platformer.
10178	TL;DR: A game following in Dark Souls' footsteps must have absolutely spot-on animations, timing, and enemy hitboxes. Those are sorely lacking and thus the gameplay falls apart.  Overall, Salt and Sanctuary has a solid premise with amazing potential.  Unfortunately, improper i-frame timing, poorly designed hitboxes, and enemies with no tells for nearly impossible-to-avoid attacks take 'difficult but fair' into 'difficult, and also totally unfair.' Coming from Dark Souls (a fair comparison - this game's mechanics are completely a carbon copy of Dark Souls mechanics), the game was not enjoyable because the precise and fine details required for Dark Souls - namely, well-constructed enemy hitboxes, fluid animations, and proper i-frame respect - appears shoddy and sloppy, making the game frustrating due to fighting the controls and bad coding more than due to difficult enemies.  I had such high hopes for this game. It seems those hopes were unjustified.
10179	I really wanted to like this game, but it doesn't let me. Already the start is really frustrating: the first optional boss shouldn't be possible to defeat for beginners and doesn't punish for losing, the story just continues, BUT the advantage of killing him is huge and he can't get fought again. So the player repeats and repeats and repeats creating a character, scrolling through the prolog and fighting his first enemies just to learn the one-and-only tactic to defeat the boss and has to hope that over this very long fight he doesn't make some strange jump which ruins all the effort with one-hit again. The first main boss isn't much less a fun-killer. In his second phase, sometimes he jumps over the whole arena, does his combo and doesn't let the player stand up again. One of the two currencies can't be much used until now, so the player just loses it without really a chance to save and invest it in sth. meaningful. The normal enemies aren't really a challenge, just hack&amp;slay. But they can reduce the players life when they're still invincible (because of an animation) and hit you. Just looking in the wiki and after some own first experience it's clear there isn't much to customize. The game is more action than roleplay, most is straight-line, at least when somebody don't want to fail terribly.  I can't understand all these positive reviews, it's more like souls-fanboys-hype. There's the usual problem with controls but additionally there're strange hitboxes, slight glitches and not really a story.  This game has a good concept, nice graphics, fitting sounds, but lacking the finishing touch. In its current state there's sadly more of unavoidable annoyance than a learnable difficulty.
10180	This is actually a decent game and I really want to like it but many parts of the game require more luck than skill, which is why I'm giving a thumbs down because this flaw makes the game tideuous and nearly impossible.  Just to clarify, I've played and finished some hard games, all the Souls games, old Castlevania and Mega Man games, Hagane and many more, but this one is so ridiculously unbalanced that it's just not fun to me at some points of the game.  While normal enemies aren't that hard to deal with, you'll encounter some more difficult big enemies here and there, which are still manageable though.  The real issue with this game are the bosses. Since it's 2D, you're limited in your ways of movement, which means that sometimes there is literally no way to dodge some of the boss attacks and some of them can kill you (almost) instantly. This has nothing to do with player skill and makes the game luck based and frustrating sometimes.  You have to be lucky enough for bosses not to do attacks that are impossible to dodge from where you are standing.  If you can get over that fact, you should be able to enjoy the game however. It's pretty much Dark Souls in 2D, only difference is that you level up in a skill tree rather than just boosting up stats.
10181	If you want to get this game because you liked Dark Souls, don't get it. If you like Castlevania or Metroid, get it. I don't like Castlevania nor Metroid, so I would not recommend it, but I guess I can see why people like S&amp;S.
10182	Like a 2D dark souls only not as good, not even close.   While Dark souls loves to give you a cheap death every now and then, That is all this game is capable of. Bosses are 'hard' because of small arenas or spamming the same attack over and over before your character can finish the recovery animation. Meanwhile the bosses with large arenas and slow attacks pose little to no challenge, and can be killed in one or two tries at most.  Pros: -Nice art style -Great soundtrack -Some how wasn't sued by from software for 'borrowing' almost every mechanic from the Dark souls series.  Cons: -Artificial difficulty -A convoluted 'Skill tree' -Not very original -No online co-op (WTF)  In short, just go play your favorite SOULS game.
10183	I love me some Dark Souls, but this game's battles come up far short. They use the same weapon for parrying as light attacks so you will often find yourself doing a useless parry when you want to get in a quick jab after blocking an attack.   Also many enemies are cheap. In Dark Souls when something went wrong it was your fault, it wasn't that a giant enemy decided to do a giant attack that you cannot roll out of, dodge and groups of enemies will spam attacks with no time inbetween for you to counter.  Those are my big complaints, there are other smaller issues, the lore seems dull and lazy, the art looks junky and washed out, the mechanics are unexplained (and while that's true in Dark Souls, Dark Souls made me invested enough to learn those systems instead of just giving up.)
10184	Looking like Dark Souls â  being Dark Souls.  Sadly, I must confess that the game falls short of what it tries to be; a fair and manageable 2D Dark Souls. I use the word 'manageable' because what turns this review into the negatives all has to with poor gameplay:  The good: - Decent Dark Souls-like atmosphere - Nice music  The bad: - Lack of decent i-frames - Sloppy input registration - Shoddy timing - Badly designed hitboxes - Enemies with no tells for unavoidable one-hit-kills - Non-fluid animations - No wake-up action (can't roll/block as soon as you get up) - And the list goes on, but I'm gonna stop here for brevity  All of this makes the game frustrating due to fighting the controls and bad coding more than anything resembling a fair fight. Trying to string together hits turns the combat into - dare I say it - a salty experience. Button presses not registering makes it difficult to queue hits or rolls. React 0.02 milliseconds too fast for the extremely narrow window, and your character doesn't perform the action at all. Imagine Tekken, Street Fighter, or Dark Souls forcing you to wait until the hand from the first move retracted all the way back before you could activate another action? Good luck stringing together combos.  While trying to make a 2D-souls is a commendable effort, the QA was skipped in full and it shows. I'll return if the developers revamps the controls. For now, I can't bring myself to pick it up again, as the worst controls this side of NES Rygar-jumping makes it intolerable on a KarTRASHian level.
10185	I don't get the praise this recieved... the controls are awful.
10186	Great concept and overall game layout and thanks for Linux client. But it is plagued by poor, slow, unresponsive, clunky and awkward controls. Really, this game should be turn-based. I hate turn-based games...but it's certainly not twitch-based unless your twitches have the delay expectancy of a sea sponge. Pass.
10187	If you enjoy frustrating hitboxes - play this game. If you, like me, can't deal when boss puts small metal non-magical rod into a place that is 2 meters in front of him and you take damage while being behind the boss - uninstall and never come again.
10188	This is a rather tough review to write. This game is a frustrating one; not from it's difficulty, but from the many aspects it falls just short of. I'll do my best to explain those aspects throughout my review.  As a die-hard fan of the Souls series, I thought that I'd check this game out. This game does a great job of emulating the general Dark Souls-esque gameplay to 2D. As with the Souls series, the game is difficult. This game also shares the steep-learning curve that, once mastered, can make the game less difficult or even menial in some places.  The game does stray from Souls style gameplay by having an overall more agile player character. Later in the game the character picks up dashing and wall jumping, something not in Dark Souls. By having the Souls gameplay in a faster, 2D format, the game seems like a pretty good one. When delving into it, however, its flaws begin to show.  The game has platforming elements. Perhaps I was misinformed, or perhaps I was unaware, but I didn't expect this much platforming. I don't mind platforming, and I fairly enjoy games such as Mario or Super Meat Boy, but the platforming in Salt and Sanctuary frustrates me more than those two games. The beginning has little platforming, but it gradually ramps up throughout the game. I appreciate the smooth curve of platforming, but unfortunately, this platforming makes heading through the levels to either getting to your salt or return to a boss frustrating. By the time you get to the Pitchwoods or Crypt of Dead Gods, the entire level seems to focus on platforming. The levels become increasingly scarce of enemies, and your biggest threat becomes falling rather than death from an enemy. A better approach to this might be to tone down the platforming in the end levels while increasing the enemy count, to make it less tedious and more exciting.  Armor in the game seems to be nearly worthless. In the Murdiella Mal fight, I switched armor sets multiple times each with different resistances and weights, but no matter what set or combination I chose, the difference in damage recieved didn't seem to matter. I have tested this numerous times and it still seems to point to a minor difference in wearing armor and not wearing armor. I don't like that having no armor is clearly the best solution, rather than the game striking a balance between an armored character, and an agile character.  The various parallels between Souls and Salt and Sanctuary also frustrate me. I understand the game is inspired by Dark Souls but a lot of the features in this game have a direct equivalent in the Souls universe. Sanctuaries are Bonfires, Replenishing Healing Items are Estus, Creeds are Covenants, Upgrading is the same, and the list goes on. While this game has features that make it unique, I find that these are few and far between.  Some bosses have attacks that are one-hit KO's. I can handle one-hit attacks, but when the boss pins me to the wall and he's too big to roll through, I can't escape. Too often have I been almost done with a boss, only for them to throw out the OHKO move.  This isn't to say the game doesn't have positive features. As I've said before, the game does an excellent job of emulating the Souls series to 2D and it does an ok job at adding some unique features into the mix. This game is slightly more forgiving than Dark Souls, but that's a personal positive. The lore is also interesting, if not scarce. The 18 hour campaign is definitely worth the price.  Those are my main pros and cons of Salt and Sanctuary. I wish there was an alternative third option to the binary system on Steam because this is a game that would frustrate and â¥â¥â¥â¥ off a certain audience, and pleasure another. It also has the uncanny ability to do both to me. Salt and Sanctuary is frustrating because it's a game that I can complain about all day, but I'll be playing it again anyway.
10189	I have played all three Dark Souls, and I rarely next to never thought that my deaths were a cause of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game design. You can see where I am going with this. This game may try to avoid this, but half the time you are going to die because of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ key bindings (yes, I did rebind them) and the other half you will die from the dodge function being next to useless. I have never been this frustrated with a souls game before. If you are planning on buying this game, please note that it was made by triple amputee's or aliens where the concept of a hand is all but known to them.  tl:dr Have you ever tried playing Dark Souls on keyboard? Yeah, that controls better than this game.
10190	If you're a fan of Dark Souls and that's what drew you to this game, you will be dissapointed. Salt and Sanctuary is not only not like Dark Souls(I have near 400 hours logged between the three titles, so I'm not speaking out of my â¥â¥â¥), but kind of a bad game in general.  1: Literally the hardest thing about this game is the contrast. You cannot, under any circumstances, see â¥â¥â¥â¥. The grey enemies blend into the grey backround alongside the grey interactable objects. Fun. It's actually easier to see underground because then enemies are highlighted against black backrounds instead of the entire â¥â¥â¥â¥ing screen being greyscale.  2: Turns out platforming and Souls don't mix; you can't dodge in midair(at least they don't tell you how), and many enemies can simply swat you out of the air. The rolling is awkward as hell, there is collision by default and rolling allows you to pass through enemies, but only during certain frames, making it easy to roll gently to an enemy's feet ready to get smacked with a counterhit.  3: Enemies aren't hard to kill, usually, but they have this annoying thing where every single move is stupidly under-telegraphed(if you can physically see the enemy model that is) so you can't just organically dodge.  4: Confusing, overwhelming skill tree.   5: Overly simplified combat. Not even rolling attacks.  6: No bloodstains, dying to an enemy buffs them and forces you to fight them for you lunch money. Great.  7: The most difficult enemy in the game is the controls. The camera also likes to do whatever it wants sometimes, too. The game as a whole is way faster in every aspect that it should be, so it ends up being hard to follow and difficult to learn from your mistakes.  All in all, pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ adventure platformer with unclever rip-offs of souls mechanics that's most difficult elements are the lack of any color whatsoever and â¥â¥â¥â¥ moving as fast as Sonic Boom. I'm fairly certain I had a better time playing Cat Mario. 
10191	I'm a huge fan of the Dark Souls series. This game is basically 2D Dark Souls... that's pretty much it. I wouldn't say it is a rip off, but it is heavily influenced by it. It's very impressive that a two person development team created this game, but it fell a bit flat for me.   My main complaint is that I don't think the 3D combat of Dark Souls translates very well to 2D. This is most apparent in boss fights. In Dark Souls, you can dodgeroll left/right/forward/backward from a boss. In Salt and Sanctuary, you can only roll left and right. Of course, the bosses' attacks are all 2D as well. But I found this cumbersome and some boss attacks felt unavoidable.   I also found it difficult at times to distinguish enemies from the backgrounds.   It's not all bad -- I certainly had some fun with it. But the more that I played this Dark Souls-esque game, the more I realized that I'd rather play Dark Souls.
10192	Really enjoyed the first few areas, then got to Watching Woods and started falling through platforms. Not even the platforms that are supposed to break, though I fell through those prematurely as well, the static platforms' geometry sometimes ended before their texture resulting in me many times walking where I thought was safe then falling to my death.  Persisted to Red Hall of Cages where I encountered really bad enemy hitboxes and an extremely spammy boss that was based around that bad platforming I just mentioned. At this point I also felt under-leveled despite being level 40 and having a level 5 weapon. Everything felt like it had an unfair advantage over me. Like they didn't have to follow the same rules I did.  I recognize I am in the minorty in this thread so people are finding the good in it and that is great. I just wasn't having any fun playing it. I love a good challenge, I've put a lot of time into the Souls series, but they have always felt fair. S&amp;S in my opinion does not.
10193	The game is cool at first. It's like 2d dark souls and has an interesting plot to it. The lore is fun to read up on and I loved finding new items to use. Unfortunately the controls are subpar at best and I find myself doing the wrong thing not too often, but often enough to kill me at key moments which is annoying. On top of that the platforming elements are overused and just not fun to play with. No one likes to die from fall damage because you jumped early after killing a slew of difficult enemies, it's stupid and not good game design. Especially when the platforming is as overused and obnoxious as it is in the late game. On top of that enemy design is sort of a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. With only 2 dimensions they had to innovate or the combat wouldn't be very fun. Unfortunately innovation means a ton of annoying to deal with enemies that fly through walls, teleport, jump insane distances, and knock you thirty feet away and off a cliff to your death. I'd say this game definitely isn't worth the 20 dollars you'll spend on it and isn't even worth 10 dollars. Especially with some of the bugs still present in the game that will deprive you of your 'salt' and how you can easily die from stupid things.
10194	Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It is fun, and all that jaz. But when your fighting a boss, and it's attacks do not do the same thing, or even close to the same thing, then the whole point of the game kinda falls apart. I am mostly referncing at the cyclops boss here. He has a jump attack, one of his attacks you are to roll behind, but 1/2 of the time he does it, he flies past me, easy to dodge. The other 1/2 he jumps at me, same attack, I can't roll past, and get a face full of axe.   Like I said, it's a fun game, but it's a game of skill. The fact that I have to worry if I might roll past this time if I am lucky, or if I might not and end up dying, defets the full purpous of this game.
10195	Refunded the game after just around an hour, writing this more to warn my friends away from it, but you might benefit from it too.  - Controls are unresponsive, to the point that this felt like a bad Newsgrounds flash game from 2001.  - Dodge is a crapshoot. You're just as likely to roll into a boss's crotch and playfully tickle their junk as you are dodge through them. As a result victory or defeat feels entirely based on luck rather than skill.  - Apparently Ska Studios thinks 'atmosphere' means everything must be gray. Background? Gray. Foreground fog effect? Gray. Enemies? Gray. As you might imagine, this creates a problem beyond just looking washed out and boring; there are points where it is difficult to see enemies through all that gray.  - Over-wrought skill tree. Almost as bad as Path of Exile.  - No in-game explanation of stats, or at least none that I could discover. There's a difference between letting players figure things out on their own and abeing deliberately ambiguous. This game is on the wrong side of that line.
10196	I'm a die-hard Dark Souls fan. I can appreciate the effort made to pay homage to that, but this game doesn't pull it off as well. This shouldn't come off as a huge surprise.  Often in Dark Souls when you die, it's because you made a mistake. This isn't always the case in this game, with some deaths just being out-right cheap.  If you enjoy Souls/Metroidvania games, I'd say pick this one up during some kind of sale.
10197	This game have some good mechanics but it just doesn't work together well enough. Its 2D game. You can't just put 3d mechanics from Dark Souls and hope its worked.  For example: This game have 80% gray colored locations witch means you can't remember all things you miss,  And game have no map... Just try to play Castlevania Symphony of the Night without map, its impossible.  S&amp;S have hidden walls witch can't be detected completely. The only way to find them is to attack every wall on your way.  1. Enemies also colored mostly in grey so you can't see them good enought. And they tend to spawn right near you.  2. Weapons broken. Arming sword has same reach as spears, or maybe longer. Starting weapons very weak, in Dark Souls you can use your starting weapon till the end of the game and its not difficult.  Example: Starting Knights Sword in S&amp;S deal 8-10 dmg to first boss, morning star 20. Swords and daggers are very weak. (Two-Handed sword like Claymore are pretty powerful.)  3. Enemies are extreme in all sense:   Some have very far reach even if it seems that they don't.   Some of them very fast, if get close to axe-thrower guy you dead. He just make 4-5 hit combo in second.  Some of them can grab you dealing lots of damage. They can grab you through shields. Grab attacks have huge hitbox so you can only dodge it to avoid it completely.  All of them can spam attacks without cooldown. So boss fight are heavy RNG dependent. It is not hard to memorise attacks but bosses can f_ck you up realy easy by just spaming exact same attack over and over again.  And bosses and some mobs can deal damage up to 90% of your health with one hit.  4. Skill tree. Why potions upgrades and higher class equipment unlocks are in tree?  If you take away these nodes from tree, the tree becomes empty. It has only stats upgrades left in it. All that makes player to stop experiment with different weapons. If you take Axes you cant just take a dagger and try it, instead you need to refund passives or start new character.  5. The game just wants you to die as many times as possible. Its hard but in unfair way. Some people like it but its not what make Dark Souls such a great game. Yes the Dark Souls was hard, but you learned and become better. In S&amp;S you die in trap becouse you didn't see it, memorise it, come back and die on another trap. Repeat till you finish the game.  6. There is some little bugs.   Example: If you die from poison there is a chance to not being able to recover salt (souls).    Overall this game misses some 2d features witch can improve gameplay.  a) Watching below character is needed since you can die from fall damage.  b) Character mus be able to duck.  c) The Map - must have.  d) Replace rolling to dash.  e) Fix reach of some weapons and enemies.  f) Get rid of the Tree of Skill because it doesn't have skills... Or add 'actuall' skills in tree.  This game have such potential but it just trying to â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off.   Thanks for reading. Sory for my bad English.
10198	Just wait for it to go on sale.  Will eventually put up a decent review but at the current moment it stands as such:  First 5-10 hours: Having a ton of fun etc. Despite cliche even if straight forward NPC's  Remaining hours: Jesus Christ so much platforming, and someone for the love of god teach that guitarist a new song. And also take in the magicalness that is Narwhal Unicorns 1-shotting you as no lie, I played 'Narwhals Narwhals swimming in the ocean.' on various occasions when I was impaled by one. And I only laughed my â¥â¥â¥ off because my mind broke after losing 45k salt to one of them.    Help me. 
10199	I really wanted to like Salt and Sanctuary, a Dark Souls/castlevania mash up with awesome indie graphics, and i guess i did enjoy the first 7 or 8 hours, but after a while I just felt no desire to continue playing. I guess I prefer more action -packed 2d games, like metroid on the snes, or games like Dust, where you don't have to manage a stamina bar, and the combat is much faster and more fluid. Salt and Sanctuary just started to feel like a chore...  Now, this game is a great achievment for such a small studio. I loved the indie style graphics, and the lighting effects are really atmospheric. It also has a brilliant inter-connected world design which has you unloking shortcuts all the time and bringing you back to new areas with new skills to unlock secrets. It also expands on the Dark Souls legacy in novel and interesting ways, such as having your convenant effect the sanctuaries (bonefires) and being able to offer statues found in the game at your sanctuary in order to summon merchants and such. It also has a really cool skill tree that reminded me of the one in Final Fantasy X. So there's lots of great stuff about this game, just not my cup of tea.   and I see from the Steam reviews that a lot of ppl like it, but for me it just became more and more infuriating and less and les of a joy to play and this is someone whose sunk around 300 ish hours into the dark souls games. Maybe I shouls have persevered, but for now i'm gonna let this one rest.   Now, before all the fan boys and girls get their knickers in a twist, I'm not saying this is a bad game, but i can't recommend it as I got bored of it really quickly. Again, not saying it is a bad game, and really wish i could like it more
10200	Disclaimer - I am not a fan of platforming genre. Maybe people who really enjoy it would think of this game higher, than I do. I picked up Salt and Sanctuary because I'am a big fan of Dark Souls series. I think it will be more honest if I start with the things I liked about this game.  And to tell you the truth, it is almost everything. Fights, bosses, enemies, atmosphere. Everything is really captivating. On a level significantly higher than what you would expect from a non triple A game. Fighting system is a bit repetitve,and bosses begin to seem all the same after a few of them, but in which Souls-like game they are not? On the other hand, figthting is varied, offers you a lot of styles and meaningfull choices. Right my alley, I would say. Soundtrack is great. Also a bit repetitve, but still really enjoyable. Atmosphere - let's just say whis game would be a great succsessor to the Demon Souls atmosphere, although a bit more grim. Now, for a few negative sides of the game... There are generally two big issues that I feel ruined this game for me, and made ne unable to enjoy everything else. 1) Many enemies are created without even a bit of thought about counterplay in them (namely, Horsemen, Angsty bones, Invisible guys and many. many others)  They are made to be annoying, not to be interesting or challenging.  Their abilities are just not fun to play against. It's not that they are too hard quite contrary - they are just don't serve as learning experience or require special techniques to overcome. Wouldn't it be better to design enemies, whose abilities would be fun although challenging to counter? 2) Platforming. Just... When I play this game, I always remember Prince of Persia, both Sands of time-warriors withtin, and 2D ones - 1 and 2. I think about those because many of the things that are bogging down this game are already fixed there. How many times did I fall to my death in Salt and Sanctuary because I just bounced off from platform, instead of grappling on it? How many times I fell through the elevator without any apparent reason? How many times I had to not even try going for the pitfall, hust because that ment that I would have to run back here from Sanctuary? Many.  Too much for my liking. Why couldn't I just try this jump, and then turn back time (PoP or Braid style)? Why do I have problems with grabbing onto platform edges so much?  Especial in Haggers cavern. A couple of times, I just had to stay on one place and jump there for a minute, trying and trying again to reach the edge of the platform just couble of inches from my head...  Ultimately, for the main question of a platformer is how you deal with punishing players errors. Braid, Prince of Persia, Super Meat Boy - all these games were trying to minimise the impact, which single failed jump may have on your game overall, while also teaching you to play better. Is maximizing the punishment fro failed jump a good idea? Is running back from the sanctuary because of failed jump worth it? I don't know. Not for me, it seems. Dark souls souls-lost-on-death system is in my opinion doesn't play well with platforming. If you remember Iaito jump in DS1 or jump for Ostravas shield and sword in tower of Latria - take this, multiply it by ten hundred, and throw it, distibuted evenely, in the game. This is Salt and sanctuary in the nut shell. Also this is magnified by somewhat glitchy and unresponsive platforming, especially in the Hard Light brand parts.  tl;dr Great game, buried under endless boring and infuriating platforming.
10201	This game tries really, REALLY hard to be Dark Souls. It has a lot of the same basic systems that the Souls series has. The game follows a lot of the same design decisions that the Souls games, but missed some opportunities to improve in areas. The game doesn't really tell you how anything works. You also basically have to commit to a build instead of really being able to experiment at all, since you have to spend your levels into a talent grid, similar to what you would find in Final Fantasy 10 or Path or Exile, and they tend to put different playstyles about as far away as they can from each other. You can refund some points, but you have to find items to do so, and there are only about 20 of them per playthrough so far as I am aware.   Combat feels kind of slow and clunky.   Rolling exists, but the hitboxes can be kind of weird. Also, there are different tiers of rolling, similar to the Souls series, where the closer you are to the encumbrance cap, the less effective rolling is. This makes wearing heavy armor and trying to roll expensive in terms of stat points, since you are going to have to heavily invest in your carrying capacity.   Taking damage reduces your maximum health, so getting more potions isn't really effective, since by the time that you could use all of them your health will be at a point to where you will be killed in one hit anyway.   Magic seems useful, but is somewhat inconvenient to use. There is no lock-on system, so casting it in any direction other than straight ahead is kind of fiddly. Casting spells also reduces your maximum stamina. You can recover this 'fatigue' through the use of potions that you have to spec into.  Melee has a limited combo system similar to what you would find in old beat-em-ups, you will do some different combos depending on what order you hain you heavy and light attacks in. There only seems to be about 5 different combos per weapon types however. There are currently 16 different weapon types, including staves and wands for casting spells, so there is a variety of weapons that you can use. Each weapon talent path also contains a couple of different types of weapons, such as spears, scythes, and poleaxes, so you have some room to switch between a couple of one type doesn't suit you. Parrying exists, but doesn't seem to serve much of a point. Most of the enemies that you would want to parry, including bosses, aren't parry-able. Most of the normal enemies I can kill in one hit, so no point in trying to parry them. At least the parry animations look cool.   Bosses are fairly interesting. They aren't just larger versions of the normal enemies that you fight. Each one generally has a couple of attacks that it will use at the start of the fight. Once you get it to around half health however, it will pick up a new attack or two and start chaining its earlier attacks together. One of the larger problems with them though, is once they do hit the point where they start using new attacks, is that they start spamming them pretty much nonstop, not really leaving you with any room to get in any hits. Also, since most of the bosses are quite large, the character has some trouble trying to roll though attacks/models, and tends to roll in place and take a hit or two instead. Which you generally tend to die afterward, since the potions heal over time, and most of the boss attacks tend to be long, sweeping attacks and hit almost the entire arena.   Overall it seems like they had a pretty good game, and then they added a lot of 'featuresâ in order to make it 'challenging', while instead all it does it make the game tedious to play. It doesn't feel difficult, it feels cheap. I don't really feel victorious after beating a boss, I feel like I managed to avoid getting cheesed.  I really wanted to like the game, and maybe I will get to a point where I will start enjoying it more, but as it stands I would just rather be playing one of the Souls games.  
10202	Alright this is my 3rd attempt at writing a review, after calming down and thinking about my experience.  Is the game good? Yes, i suppose, mechanically. Is it fun? No. Not at all - therefore i cannot recommend it. Whilst the art style is very pretty, polished to perfection, and the game is mechanically sound, it is not enjoyable. Here's a few reasons why  [edit] just gonna preface this with the fact that, according to steam, I've played 241 hrs of dark souls 1, 431 hrs of ds2, 49 hrs of ds2: SotFS and 164 hrs of dark souls 3. (Thats 885 hrs of dark souls franchise). I've played a lot of dark souls games. I know how to learn patterns, find pathways, learn game mechanics myself etc etc. So I hope you can trust me when I make comparisons between this game and the souls franchise, and conclude that this game is not fun.    Platforming
10203	i really want to love this game but 2d dark souls was a bad idea. bosses spaming their attacks and has a really poor movesets, rolls works like piece of garbage sometimes u can't roll between legs of the boss and he start spaming their attacks at you, enemy AI is poor too, talent tree give access only for new type of armour/weapons/more healing potion it can't give access to something interresing, and music is really boring. verdict: better play dark souls P.S: sorry for my bad english
10204	I love a good rouge-like, Salt and Sanctuary IS NOT A GOOD ROUGE-LIKE. This game is not 'difficult', it is a 'pain in the â¥â¥â¥.' There is a difference. The developers accomplished this by trying sooo hard to copy a formula that they killed what could've been a great side scrolling game. All the pretty visuals, metroidvania type gameplay, all the positive points about this game fall to the wayside thaks to its MASSIVE flaws. Like Grandma cutting a huge green fart in the chair next to you during thanksgiving diner. As great as everything couldve been, just one nasty old fart ruined it all. Only the animation is smooth in this game. Everything else (like the made-up â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t language you have to decipher JUST to create your charicter) is like being dragged down a gravel on your bare naked â¥â¥â¥. The menus never get an explination, no tutorial to help you decipher the word salad, no telling what you can and cant do. The developer is clearly malicious in their intent toward the player, Unless the player is a basement dwelling short â¥â¥â¥â¥ turbo nerd that can somehow play a game that cant be paused while googling every little detail about that game as they go along. 'But gee golly'' you say looking at the creation menus 'It can only get better from here'. Wrong. They pooch it.  All your told is what the controls are. Some games start you in a similar situation, but those game do a better job. You know what games i'm talking about, go play those. This game is tragic, there is so much potential here, too bad it's all hidden behind a needlessly convoluted and bloated leveling system, combat that get both frusting and stale at the same time. Weapons, you pick up a new weapon only to see how long youll be carrying it around, wishing you could use it. That wouldnt be too bad... if maybe there were a few more weapons to choose from. There are a bunch in the game, too bad youll only be able to use maybe four, and youll NEVER be happy with those four.  For the love of god, go play Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Bloodborne, ANYTHING but Salt and Sanctuary. This game is masterpeice of failures. Breaks my heart just to look at it... knowing i cant get my money back. If you play this game long enough to see for certain that it is a pale imitation, Steam will say that you have played too long and will not give you a refund. I tried. Just dont, its soooo disapointing.  This game reaches for the brass ring... and pulls off a fingernail. it is just awful.
10205	Cool concept but not very fun. I really thought I'd enjoy this game, but it is quite hard and there is a lot to take in (classes, upgrades, vendors) that I just don't enjoy in this style of game. Here are my Pro's and Con's (which you may find are oppposite for you).  Pro's: Lots of Classes to choose from Customisable characters  Bosses  Con's: Much more  Dark Souls  than  Metroidvania  Difficulty is quite high Character faces look unfitting to game world Washed out Color Palette
10206	This game works well enough but is an example of the repetitious tedium this sort of RPG is infamous for, where one must build up strength, willpower, magic skills, dexterity, etc.  How long does one wash, rinse and repeat just to gain abilities that are not very apparent?  I've grown tired of this game already since it offers nothing new in this genre.
10207	I really enjoyed this game for awhile. Some spoilers ahead.    Up until the 3rd brand was given out I really enjoyed the 'explore kill and kill bosses' nature of the game. After that it sort of becomes a 'now explore with puzzles and get lost and figure it out'. I get that the game is supposed to be difficult, hell I really enjoy that part of it. But let me fight the monsters, let me fight the bosses, don't make me fight convoluted puzzles and a map that requires backtracking (which doesn't explain when you need to do this). You just have to wander aimlessly to try and figure it out.   This game was good, the combat is fun, the weapons are fun, the bosses are fun. The amount of running required in the later parts of the game were almost enough to get me to put down the game, and were enough to make me give a negative review.   I was ranting and raving about how good this game was telling my friends to buy it, but now I'm telling them not to unless they want a strange progression which isn't explained anywhere.
10208	I played for about an hour and 45 minutes, was falling in love with it and then the game crashed out. I tried several times to get back into my saved game but when I would do that or click 'New Game' it would give me an error that said 'Not connected to the Steam servers (I was) so you can't play the game. This is a pre-release issue.' Or something to that effect.  With minutes left on the clock for my refund window, I had to return it. I am just glad this happened before I was past my playtime limit - I would have been very unhappy had my game done that and I was stuck with it. Which is the point of this review: I don't know what happened, but my game quit allowing me to start a new game or load any of my saves. No troubleshooting fixed it, and I am not inept. Be warned.
10209	Pros: - Nice translation of a souls game to 2D  Cons:  - unresponsive controls (button mashing, i hate button mashing) - hitboxes seem off - game inconsistency (i.e. I can stagger using greatsword weak attack, but strong attack doesn't stagger?) - no wake-up action (can't roll/block as soon as you get up, which means enemies can attack or grab you constantly) - too many level interconnections (the levels don't flow together so tracking where you are and where you want to go is confusing) - spindlebeast (not even a boss, just an excuse to ruin the flow of the game. bad idea from the devs)  Reached lvl 93, then just got tired of the unfairness and stiff controls. I've played and beat Darksouls 1-3 and Bloodborne and whenever I died I knew it was my fault. When dying in S&amp;S, I know it's the games fault.
10210	you cant just copy everything good and bad from dark souls. For a 2D platfomer with a world this complex you should have a map! Imagine playing castlevania symphony of the night without a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ map, how that feels is what I feel
10211	BROKEN UNDER MAC OS!  The game is not playable under Mac OS. Ver 1.0.0.6 Mouse doesn't click on menu/items/etc. Not in full screen, not in window mode. It is necessary to use space and navigate with TAB. Some menu are unaccessible, as they cannot be reached wit TAB. I asked for refund, Steam refused to refund.  The argument was: you played more than 2 hours. But, I just realized that mouse was important ONLY after I could not navigate through skills tree.  
10212	It's ultimate downfall is the fact that it was designed by one man. This game needed months of QA and polish to realize it's potential, but alas real world constraints have left it in it's current sorry state. So much of it is frustrating, upleasant or downright infuriating. Where From Software titles offer you a finely tuned challenge that feels satisfying to overcome, this game offers a annoying slog you're forced to get through to progress. It doesn't help that the creator chose to increase the penalty of death, compared to the games he's copying, and then littered half the areas with instant death on failure platforming sections, each of which represents a 5-10 minute slog back to where you were just to try again.  Where Souls games test your ability to learn from your mistakes, this game tests your patience for arbitrary â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I've beaten DS 1 more times than I can count, DS 2, 3 and Bloodborne twice each. This game I've beaten once, and I'll never come back to it. I didn't enjoy playing it. Honestly, I think I stuck around to the end because of stubborness more than anything. Avoid, I do not recommend.
10213	The main cons of this game:  Performance: I don't know why, but in many of the areas, especially the darker ones for some reason, the game really stutters and runs worse than Dark Souls III does on my rig. There's no reason a 2D game should be running worse than an open world 3D one like DS III.  Platforming: This is easily the weakest part of the game in my opinion. The platforming just is not fun in any way. Most of it is simply jumping from one platform to another and hoping your character does not decide to not grab the edge and fall to his death. I've probably died as much from falling to my death as I have from actually fighting enemies.  Controls: This might have something to do with the performance drops, but the controls feel really sluggish in some fights. One of the most annoying things that happens is your character attacking in the wrong direction and hitting absolutely nothing. It seems like the attack button command takes priority over the move button command and instead of your character turning and then attacking if you press a direction and then press attack he will just attack and not turn at all.  Rolling in boss fights also has a bit of a curve to it. Bosses are treated as solid objects in all the cases I have seen and you have to roll in order to get past them and dodge their attacks. Unfortunately, the roll range seems really odd and more often than not I end up rolling into a boss and going absolutely nowhere because I get stopped dead in front of the boss.  If you can look past the control issues and grin through the platforming, then the game is pretty good. But, with all the Dark Souls clones that are either coming out or have already come out I think there are more polished games on the market that will give you more bang for your buck. This game has potential however and I'm looking forward to seeing if it gets more updates to polish out these problems or if they improve on the game in another installment.
10214	So imagine Dark Souls but in 2D. Problem is Dark Souls is hard to recreate in a 2D way. That's where this game falls short IMO. It tries too hard being something that it's not.   This game is meh. It has a lot of similarities to Dark Souls in terms of mechanics, customization, and overall layout. Problem with it is the difficulty. Personally, I feel it is challenging but for the wrong reasons; it's cheap. Enemies can corner you easily and lock you in, there are traps and pitfalls EVERYWHERE that have no indication of being there unless you already knew they was there, and all in all, it just lacks that feeling of satisfaction you get from getting past a difficult part, it's more like, 'oh thank god I'm finally done with that â¥â¥â¥â¥'.   Keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Dark Souls, and I review this game based off of the Dark Souls template. I think the game overall is decent, but it's difficulty supplement doesn't feel anywhere near as polished and rewarding as Dark Souls. It's trying too hard to be Dark Souls when it really isn't. If it were more of a Metroidvania game, I think it could be better.
10215	As cool as this game is, I didnt see myself getting into this game, I really liked the art style and game mechanics, but for me it felt a little bit too difficult even on the easiest difficulty, if your a fan of Dark Souls or anything like that, then its a game for you, but for me I didnt like it as much as I wanted to, fo a game like this it should be a wee bit cheaper anyway thats all from me
10216	Incredibly poor level design, poor keyboard and mouse support, poor combat. Tries too much to be like Dark Souls without doing it right.
10217	Very frustrating. Tries to be Dark Souls, but lacks the great mechanics that makes Dark Souls fun.   
10218	I bought this game soley because of the comparisons to Dark Souls. The Souls series ruined most other games for me, and left me craving a similar experience. So, I went into Salt &amp; Salnctuary with high (admittedly, maybe too high) expectations. I was sorely disappointed. It certainly nails the atmosphere of the Souls games while creating and maintaining its own identity, but something just makes the experience uncomfortable, annoying even. I can't quite put my finger on it, but playing the game just isn't enjoyable to me. Two flaws I can identify, however, are the combat and stamina system. The combat is just bad. It feels clunky and unresponsive. Fighting often results in the character randomly facing the opposite direction for some reason, completely ruining the flow of the fight. Like Dark Souls, everything in Salt &amp; Sanctuary is stamina based. Swinging your weapon, rolling, and blocking an attack all drains your stamina bar; even raising your shield makes your stamina recover more slowly. The problem arises from the fact that everything takes so much stamina. You will run out of stamina at least a couple of times in a fight, leaving you completely defenseless. Boss fights make this problem even more clear. The idea is that a boss goes into an attack sequence, you block and roll to avoid damage, and then you use the boss' brief period of inaction to retaliate. However, after blocking and dodging, you rarely have enough to stamina to attack and then safely get out of range.   Both of these problems could be fixed (it's even possible that I'm simply not used to how this game works), but the aforementioned general lack of fun I experienced while playing the game means that I probably won't be returning to this title. If your a Souls fan, buy it on sale just to try it. I don't see it being worth the full price, though.
10219	If u gonna play with mouse+keyboard as a Bow/Crossbow character dont buy this game. Aim system its just unplayable.
10220	A challenging Souls-like that isn't really good enough to want to you keep playing through the frustrating enemies/bosses, unlike the actual Souls series.
10221	Worst ending since the Mad Max game. Poor controlling platforming disguised as 'difficulty'. A game so unbalanced I beat 7 of the end bosses the first time meeting them. I agree this game is what would happen if Dark Souls and Symphony of the Night had a baby. But this is what would happen if they raised that baby as a fundamentalist christian. It would be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, like this game. Ever beat a game out of spite? Just to get your moneys worth? Cause that's the only reason I stuck through to the end of this crap. Still waiting for Ska Studios to put out a good game, instead of the janky hot messes they do release. And I have ZP2K9, Dishwaser: Dead Samurai, I made a game with zombies in it, zp2kx, dishwasher:vampire smile, and charlie murder. Great ideas. Janky as â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the implementation.
10222	Pros:  fun platforing good level design unique way to get npc's  large skill tree decent UI the sanctuarys are interesting npc's are unique TWO PLAYER! (offline) two player pvp (offline)  Cons:  Enemies are great at ganking an enemys bow, throwing weapons, and other ranged weaponry are much faster then the players Enemies and bosses can spam attack like their fapping no online pvp, or online co-op KNOCKBACK IS OP AF spam attacks its really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing to hard dodge, and shields are not very good you can only get passed enemys by jumping which is a bad idea, or rolling, so tanking is flawed they tried too hard to mke the boss attacks hard to dodge the hitbox is bs, for both players and enemies  they made it where you have to read item descriptions for the story, like in dark souls. does anyone actually like that they have to play it muiltiple times to know wtf is happening? people don't like that in the movie sucker punch, so i guess its a no  (largest con) if an boss/enemy does a jumping attack, and you move out of the way after they already jumped, they will change where they were going to land and A: stop mid air or B: go further which is bs. also, if an enemy aims to throw/shoot in one direction, and you move, they can defy all physics to hit you, and as said before, they can shoot/throw much faster then the player.  most cons: combat most pros: most are in dark souls and bloodborne
10223	At the time of writing this, I have had a total of 6-7 hours in this game. 3-4 on PS4 and 3 on Steam. I honestly tried to like this game. As someone who has beaten Demon's Souls 6 times, Dark Souls 12 times, Dark Souls 2 4 times, and Dark Souls 3 4 times, I cannot find a reason to keep playing this homage to the genre. I have learned a great deal of patience playing the Souls series, in fact I consider myself a better person because of it, but I can not play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time without getting mad.   Let's start with the positives, because there are some despite my initial paragraph. The game's platforming works well. The game has a fair bit of customization with its extensive sphere grid like skill tree. The weapons, for the most part, feel unique to each other and have weight and heft to them. The names of the zones are dark and brooding and I love em. While the humans look awkward, I do like the art style of the game. The music is dark and brooding, which is what you need for a game like this.   Now....for the bad stuff. The stuff I just cannot tolerate or forgive. The first is the god awful hit boxes. So many times I will get hit by things that I really shouldn't have. There are also times when rolling into an enemy to get behind them doesn't work, resulting in you getting hit anyway. An example is when I was rolling into an enemy to get past them, and got swiped into the air (because the hit box on the weapon seemed to be the entire screen despite being behind the hilt of the weapon at the time) and launched me into the air, falling down a pit just to get juggled by another enemy who knocked me down another pit to my death. Totally unable to prevent it, something Dark Souls is known for giving you a chance to prevent. There are also the enemies. Each enemy has unavoidable attacks which is a no no for a game like this. It may be fair, and some people may tell me to get good, but it doesn't FEEL fair. In fact almost 100% of this game doesn't FEEL fair. Dark Souls at least feels fair, if I die I know why and how to prevent it next time. I feel like each enemy I fight is just more bull stacked on top of more bull. 'Ok let's make an enemy who is invisible, can grab you in the air and on the ground, his grabs are unavoidable, and he can jump at you from off screen. Oh and make it take 90% of the player's life too.' 'Ok let's make a slime that attacks before you get a chance to react, and make it gravitate towards the player so they cannot dodge it, it instantly poisons him, and let's make the boss of this area throw them out during the fight. Oh! Let's also make it so there are no iframes after being grabbed so it can happen again immediately. AND, make it so each consecutive grab worsens the poison until the player dies in 1 second. Seems fair.'   Let's get down to the elephant in the room though. Even if the enemies are not being impossible, and I am making good progress without dying, the game is just simply not fun. It is not an engaging game. Maybe I have just played too much Dark Souls, but I do not think that is it. So at the time of writing this, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could, I wanted to like this game. I bought it twice. I gave it a solid 6 hours at least. I just cannot do it. I will continue to play the game, maybe something will spark my interest and if that day comes I will update this, but I think I am going to go back to Dark Souls for now.
10224	Like playing complete rip offs of better games? This homage (not a homage) to Dark Souls will test your skills as a gamer...well, only your paitence at jumping puzzles and un-ballanced enemies, weak level and character design.  Lest break this down. Graphics: Bland desaturated souls wanna be; both in level look and HUD style. We all love the Souls series and thats why we wanted to play Salt &amp; Sanctuary. Its just a shame that this game really has no style or direction much of its own. The characters are a pain to look at and the bosses apear to have been grabbed from someones lack luster doodles from 6th grade. Its a muddy confusing mess to look at.  Gameplay: Excesive jumping in platformers are a lazy gameplay/time extending excuse. Theres nothing old school about the jumping in S&amp;S. The platform traversing isnt there to get you around from point A to B etc. Its there to get in your way, or for the enemies to hit you off of. It would have been nice to need them to get around a labrynth like world. The bland layout will make you not give two salts about where you're going or what you're doing.   I like the weapons and how they look while attacking. They feel right and the gore adds to that; something i wish the Souls series had. I wont review the items and secondary trinkets as i generally dont care for that kind of item/gameplay mechanic anyway. Fighting is neat to look at but you tend to get sick of it when you have to go get your salt due to some BS enemies you cant see or lame lazy boss fight that you cant dodge roll around.  When you DO lose your salt you are kindly informed that you lost it FOREVER. That of course is on par with the Souls series, but this time its the above mentioned tripe thats takes your sou...er salt...away from you. When the game feels like its cheating you then punishing you for what its done; things get a little frustrating. Not only do you get the 'bad touch' from the game, you get charged for it too. You pay in gold to respawn back at the bondfi...er. sactuary. When you feel its not your fault you died, you feel like you got robbed. Pretending to be like those other difficult games without understanding why they're difficult but fun; doesnt make for a 'love of Souls games' game.  What the game does add that is nice: The extra abilities like wall jumping or upside down gameplay etc. When the game tries to be different (character design aside) it shines.  The whole time playing this game i just wanted to go play Souls instead. I admire the small team that made the game, and i like how far they've come. As a fantasy doodler myself, i like that the game is hand drawn. It's just sad that this game doesnt have much of its own design and style to be fresh. Trying to be a homage to that which we love, the game fails because its trying too hard.
10225	Alright. I like the game but i will vote no simply because whoever made this REALLY needs to take another look at his boss designs.   In this game you will fight 'hard' bosses. By hard a mean that they basically have undodgeable attack and combos that will one shot you. To win certain boss fights you'll have to rely on luck and nothing else. They wanted to make a Souls like game but they clearly missed the most important part, rewarding skill and punishing button mashing.   This game will punish you either way. For example; There is a boss in this game that will summon an orb that shoots out projectiles, if one hits you - you die. Now that sounds kind of bad right? It gets better. While this orb is quite easy to deal with alone, she can also use a machine gun skill, right? And if she's outside of a running distance - you die. Now this would be simple to do.. If she didn't fly.. OUT OF THE MAP. She can fly out of the map area, meaning that you'll be stuck at an invisible wall and you WILL die simply because there is literally nothing you can do about it.   And that's just one such example. I could bring up 10 more. The game concept is good but the execution is poorly done and you're not left with that souls feeling where if you lose you feel as if it was your own fault, in this game you feel that the game is punishing you for doing what you're supposed to do.
10226	Good idea, bad implementation.  Don't play if you like hitboxes to match what you see.
10227	Fun, but using m+k controls respond poorly. Feel sluggish. Mouse clicking completely non-responsive for menus, an issue many months old. Can't enable mouse during gameplay -- have to quit and re-enable.   Games like these are fun because the environments and enemies are challenging -- the primary challenge shouldn't come from buggy controls.
10228	Poorly designed 2D Dark Souls clone. Difficult for all the wrong reasons.
10229	games okay but could be better u can get mobbed pretty easy in this game an cant do much especially against the boss if ur cornered they just spam attacks on u an u cant roll pass them or jump over them instead just block until they kill you pretty much was expecting a little dissapointed since its supposed to be a dark souls inspired game but illpass an just wait for the dark souls 3 dlc an play a different game in the meantime
10230	If you love everything about the dark souls series (and all the pain and frustration that comes with it), you will love this. I wish I had researched it a little more.   It is everything I hated about when I first blindly purchased dark souls when it came out. You die and you get penalized for it. Die again and all your hard work grinding for experience is lost forever. I HATE when games punish you like this. Like come on it is a freaking video game not a do or die job.  Do your research if you are unfamiliar with dark souls. I am a fool for blindly buying this. It looked like a cool 2d castlevania style game. Its not.
10231	This game looked fun, I watched a bunch of reviews I looked at tutorials I looked to see if my computer could run it, which appearently it could, and I said screw it I'll buy it. I bought it, had a terrible time trying to install it, finally got it to load. Could barely navigate the starting screen. It was clear it was not optimized for PC, upon seeing that my mouse was moving sluggishly I attempted to lower the graphical settings. Which I guess, DON'T EXIST, about the only thing I could change was the resolution, buyt eh I've played Chivalry this laggy before, I've played many many games that were worse than this I can manage. No, no I could not my lord how terrible the control scheme is for this game. The mouse doesn't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ for this game, the block and parry were strangley hidden for a time and did not feel 'comfortable' I want to play this game but I'll wait till I get a better computer to retry. Maybe my comp is the issue. I hope it is.
10232	The game has a dirty, grungy style that I thought would grow on me. It did not. Worse, it's trying WAY too hard to be 2D Dark Souls, to the point where it essentially rips off (I think borrow would stretch the word too far) several key Dark Souls mechanics. The gameplay feels loose and unsatisfying mainly because it is trying to be 2D Dark Souls without the freedom of movement of Dark Souls. I just cannot recommend this game.
10233	Proof why Dark Souls HAS to be 3D. There is no way you can get precise hitboxes in a sidescroller, which the very essence of Dark Souls. This game is broken.
10234	It was fun for a while but the i got more repetitive and there was very little skill involved fighting bosses, it ended up just being me having to brute force attack them which is not very rewarding when you finally get them.
10235	The game looks great and mechanics are great. However it feels like they didn't make the game large enough. You'll run into a boss but won't be even close to defeating them. Instead you have to grind in a small area over and over until you level up enough to kill the bosses. Poorlevel design really. Doesn't quite deserve the metroid/vania tag. Almost but not quite there. 6.5/10
10236	No online co-op.  Local co-op causes significant issues for the second character's playthroughs.  No graphics settings.  In true dark souls fashion the port was never meant for PC. Unlike dark souls, the game didn't have a community patch to fix this within a week.  It's a worse castlevania with no map. Avoid.
10237	I like it, it reminds me of Dark Souls BUT!!!  And it is a big but!  2/3 of the time I feel like I died because the controls are not very responsive or because the enemy had some insane undodgeable cheap attack that they do over and over. It isn't challenging so much as infuriating and it feels cheap.  I know they are trying to be dark souls, but DS isn't punishing, it's fair. You die because you didn't learn enough. This game you die because the enemies have insane attacks that cannot be dodged, blocked or interrupted, or the controls don't work properly and you drop through a platform and fall to your death when you were actually trying to jump.  Needs work on the unresponsive controls, they really get on my nerves. Till it is tightened up it cannot be recommended despite the fact that I love the concept, and that its basically 2D dark souls.
10238	Everyone in the reviews seem to think this game is good, and its perfect for people who like dark souls. Problem is its like bootleg dark souls, and heres why.  this game is trying way too hard to be Dark Souls, Which is fine, but they don't seem to understand why Dark souls is good.  The Story seems to be as simple as 'Save the Princess' or something. which is alright i guess, but the problem is the setting seems to be just some island full of undead and monsters, and people just live here, just doing their jobs like nothing is going on. Nobody really talks about the monsters, like the monsters are just a normal occurance or whatever.   The first NPC you encounter just asks you some yes or no questions and then asks you if you follow any of the 3 religions, without telling you if theres any point to picking a god. Now with the Covenants of dark souls, the game would provide an NPC that basically tells you what they're all about. Like the way of the white is repersented by a priest. who asks you if you would like to join their cause and get some miracles.  So coveniants in this game are kinda watered down, big deal. what about the other friendly NPCs Like, i said. Everyone in this game is just off, but not in the good way. Theres a knight you meet sortly after you beat the first boss, and he asks you. 'hey there pal, would you like to hear about my quest!' I was like, sure whatever whats your quest. 'oh you know! gotta get into the castle and slay the dragon! haha!' Oh yeah, just gotta defeat the large beast, sounds like â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun dude. why are you here? who gave you this quest? What are you doing just standing there waiting for me to do it!  Well, story and writing sucks. hows the gameplay. the gameplay is not that great. This game is a 2D sidescroller Metroidvania! which isnt bad. i really enjoy games like symphony of the night, no problems here, map designs are fine. Weird thing is that they seem to have shortcuts everywhere. theres always seems to be a ladder to kick down or a door to open with a switch. Which i guess isnt too bad. makes backtracking less of a pain the â¥â¥â¥.   Another problem i have is the lack of a map, Since most the areas look almost exactly the same at times, you're going to need a map. But theres no map. meaning if you don't know where you're going, you're probably going to be stuck for awhile. which is not good in a Metroidvania.  The combat in this game is kinda fun. Whacking the weak undead is satisfying.  But the problem lies in the tougher enemies. thats when the gameplay seems to stop. instead of being intense 1v1s to the death. it turns into how many hits does it take to kill this guy. You can't naturally see enemy health bars. You can only see bosses health bars. another problem is that the bigger enemies attacks don't seem to have a windup on their attacks. meaning you'll end up taking huge damage because you couldnt 'act' fast enough to move out of the way.  well whatever, if enemy damage is annoying. lets just 2 hand the weapon since Shields just reduce the damage instead of outright BLOCKING like its supposed to. Well, i found this odd bug when you're 2 handing the Starting sword makes it deal less damage. when i was using strong attacks with my sword and shield, they did 10 damage every hit.  but while i was 2 handing the sword. it dealt only 8! 8 damage! What the hell!   in conclusion. its just a game attempting to ride off of the 'oh dark souls is really hard. so lets just make a hard game without understanding the elements we're lifting from it.'
10239	This is not to be compared to Dark Souls. This is a platformer with a broken stamina bar unnecessarily attached to it (Roll = 1/2 Stamina bar). Don't buy it if you came here because you heard that it's like DS, better buy a DS game you don't have.
10240	Not terrible, but know what you're getting into. The platforming undermines almost everything in the game.  And you're going to spend a lot of time just in recovery frames, because hits just send you all over the place.  Interesting entry into the 'souls' genre, but really misses the mark. I imagine the massive positive reviews for this are more for that it stands alone in this genre, and isn't terrible.  However, cannot recommend it, because it mashes genres without solving the problems it generates. Especially when it's a solved problem.
10241	I played this to the maximum 2 hours I was allowed before requesting a refund.  My final verdict? Meh 6/10. The looks and aesthetics are perfectly fine, it gives off the proper atmosphere and the background blends (though some areas flowing into others looks a tad odd). The animations and combat feel clunky though you can easily compensate and that alone doesn't take from the experience. Rolling in the game works fine, I had little difficulty rolling through blows even with fat rolling. The Salt is a direct rip off of Souls from Dark Souls, but its a proven mechanic and functions fine here alongside Gold. The sanctuary and levelling up system is interesting, I wish I could have explored it more though it seems to cripple adjusting builds. Only fought the Sodden Knight (first Boss) and he was a cake-walk so nothing to say there on Bosses besides block, stab, roll, jump repeat until half hp then block, roll, block, attack, jump repeat. Overall I like the game, so why downvote and request a refund? Combat in general. The enemies have very random patterns of attack which alone is not a big deal, but the game is prone to throwing a half-dozen of them at you at once making it difficult to approach the situation. They also benefit from infinite stamina and no way to properly deflect or hinder their attacks or movement rendering Shields virtually useless when they swing endlessly. Rolling is easy though futile if you are still in the enemies reach as they will turn on a Dime and continue thier frenzy without hesitation regardless of what combo they may have been in. Couldn't try magic but found no way of properly aiming with a Bow which I found rather disappointing. Lastly enemies with thier random attack patterns and endless frenzied swings will most assuredly stunlock and kill you if you are surrounded by any more than 2 at any time making groups a nightmare to handle.  All in all it was a nice game and these are my first impressions with the mere 2 hours of playtime I was permitted. The game does not suffer from poor controlls, aesthetics, or level design. In fact I found them stellar and well implemented.  This game suffers from poor enemy design which cripples the entire experience.
10242	Tried to like this game, but I couldn't: it just punishes you all the time. No matter what you do and how you do it: you wil die. Do not other players fool you: it has nothing to do with skill. For example, bosses, while having the memorable attack paterns, will use them faster and more frequently. When an enraged boss executes 3 attacks in a row you can only pray for one of them to be dodgeable via jump or movement, because you simply don't have enough stamina to do the third roll. Even the ordinary enemies may give you a hard time: did you do that roll half a second later than you should? Die from an attack series and die.  I urge you to look YouTube videos on how players beat the game: you'll see that even the ablest of them are constantly receiving damage (and a lot of it). Frustration is constant: clunky controls, slowpoke hero reaction and attack delay on every single weapon.
10243	Trying way too hard to be 'hard' but its just cheap and unfair
10244	THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS! No offense to the creators but whoever thought that insane knockback and damage by enemies plus nothing but platforms and infinite pits WAS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ what were you thinking? If you're gonna make a clone of dark souls and symphony of the night and give it fall damage and unbalanced bosses you took the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est parts of both and put them together expecting my nostalgia boner to fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥ign holes in your design.
10245	Don't get me wrong, the game looks awesome and is kinda fun to play. The only complaint I have (and it's a big one) is that travelling in 2D in this Soul-like game feels not right. Let me explain: 2D movements makes it hard to dodge something as you can't always go trough something while doing it. It makes some battles extremly unfair as you can't go pass the enemy to avoid damage nor running in the opposite way, because the attack got too much range.  I can add the game is way too dark, like you're gonna have a headache if you don't tune up the brightness of your monitor, and there's no option for that in-game.  Flying in every direction while taking a huge hit is not what I was looking for too but that's just my opinion.  Good concept, so-so execution.
10246	Low ratings because it's a negative review, period.  A 2D Souls game with some not great design choices. This game is not a roguelike or roguelite. It is a clearly Souls inspired game, even stated by the developer.  Good Animations are satisfying. Visceral and fun combat.  Nice atmosphere. Bad Enemies can grab you from different planes and from across ledges, notably the beginning wolves.  It has the DaS 2 equivalent of lifegems, making it a bit too easy to get health back. It's not clear how to tell if someone is an enemy or an NPC due to the art style. Not the most important thing, but it's annoying.  The inventory isn't very clear on how weapons and shields work. You have two slots for either a weapon or a shield on either side of the inventory, but equiping a weapon on either side will only let you use one of those weapons if you're two handing.  No obvious equip load indicator, so no way to know what's too heavy on sight, something Souls does right.  No obvious armor or weapon stats, so no way to know what's good or bad on sight, something that, again, Souls does right.  No normal enemy life bars, which is just a QOL thing, but still.  The UI is just clunky and doesn't flow well.  It's a more rough Souls, basically. I personally didn't like it, but hey, you might.
10247	This game is beyond stupid, damn near impossible, things happen when even if you've played before you're not expecting them and you get one shotted.  I hate everything about this game, the controls are crappy, the gameplay is fine, there is no set storyline and it's beyond difficult, it's unreasonably difficult.   
10248	If you are looking for a game that is a homage of Dark Sous, play Lords of the Fallen.  This game is a rip off of Daek Souls. When I reached the last boss, and I see the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t boss and the music reminisce of Gwyn battle complate with the piano and ochestral music, I uninstalled the game. Fighting Gwyn is much fairer than this final boss.   At least Lords of the Fallen attempts to put its own spin on the Dark Souls formula. This is a copy and paste job.
10249	I wanted to like this game so badly, but after not even 2 hours of playing I cannot go on for more. Enemies use cheap combos to kill you quickly, and will do it over and over and over again  I died to a freaking blob because there was 2 of them spamming their jump attack that stuns and poisons me, and I couldn't do a damn thing about it  The atmosphere is cool and the music + combat is fun for the most part, but with the enemies and the cheap tatics I just can't recommend this game to any of my friends im sorry  If steam doesn't give me a refund I guess I could attempt to play it again but I highly doubt it
10250	It's sad this game had so much potential to be a good game, but isn't.  Controls sucks. Attacking cancels any momentums. If you leaping forward and press the attack button, you immediately stop where you are and slash the sword.  UI is really really bad. This game has tons of items so Inventory UI is important, right? As it tuens out, this game's Inventory UI is so bad I have no idea what am I equipping right now. I don't know what kind of effect my current equipments has. I can't easily compare two equipments to determine which is the better item.  So, naturaly, I want to quit the game in less than half an hour. But I couldn't figure out how to propery quit the game!  So I forcebly killed the process.  This is ridiculously bad UI! I saw so many games with bad UI but nothing is worse than this.   I hope the developer stop making games and use my payment money as a fund to start a completely new work which doesn't involve UI design, computer game or software development.  The world will be a better place without this kind of game which looks fun but isn't.  
10251	Poor combat design doesn't make for a good challenge; it just makes for a bad game. Gaining inspiration from poor combat design makes an even worse game. I regret buying this. Pros: -World is sizable, fairly intricate, and the art is unique -Wide variety of gear -Good amount of classes -Majority of bosses are good, if not simple -Salt reclamation is an initially interesting idea  Cons: -Enemy AI is laughable at best, refund-worthy at worst -Jumping and climbling onto ledges rarely works correctly -Player animations and the roll mechanic are poorly designed, leaving you vulnerable and being seconds too long -Music is far from bad, but gets old fast -Talent tree is a downright boring and pointless selection of base attributes and gear access
10252	Played through most of the game and enjoyed it got to pitchwoods where I was punished for my playstyle and uninstalled grats guys. If this was just some difficulty thing I wouldnt be upset having put hundreds of hours into each souls game and loving all of them, but having my playstyle be made useless over trash mobs is insulting and honestly makes the game unenjoyable. do not recommend.
10253	Before platforming part kick in (platforming is just terrible in this game) game was great.
10254	I'm trying really hard to like this game. Was super excited about it, having watched a quick look of it and dug the overall feel of it. But, having got my hands on it I can't really recommend it. The controls are super clunky and unresponsive at best, to the point where it seems like a design choice in order to make the game more difficult. I was playing on a wireless 360 controller but even when I switched to mouse n keyboard it was still a major factor. There are big sections where a well timed jump is necessary and it often seems touch and go as to whether the game registers it or not. This goes for other controls like the roll as well. With it being a 2D environment, both of these are essential in defeating enemies but neither can be relied upon in a pinch. Thats not even factoring in the difficulty in actually memorising the (seemingly random) attack patterns of bosses and their ability to spin on a dime mid combo. I'm also finding the colour scheme difficult to look at for long periods of time. Even if I know a trap is somewhere I can still have difficulty locating it and feel like I'm constantly straining my eyes. Not really liking the general enemy design, especially the blob enemies. Their attacks seem cheap and too easy for the AI to land. I'm gonna persist with the game, and would probably give the game a 'maybe' rating if I could. If you can, try a demo.. Wish I had
10255	i realy wanted to like theis game, but the rng is to strong. and different to dark souls, the game is in many ways just unfair.
10256	this game doesn't work with a mouse at all, for a pc game that's a complete deal breaker for me. avoid this until they fix it or wait until it's 75% off
10257	Like Dark Souls minus the good parts.
10258	If you're looking for a challenge, for a real hard game that will test your skill and wit, that won't mess around and handhold you... you'll better look somewhere else, because THIS GAME isn't any of that. But if you're looking for an unfair neutered Dark Souls rip off in 2d where the developer decided that the only thing Dark Souls was missing was crappy platforming, then it's a game for you.  This game tries so hard to be Dark Souls, yet fails on so many levels. Appearantly harder=better, yet they completely forgot about any pay off! In Dark Souls, enemies are mostly slow, yet they can eff you up quite easily if you let your guard down. Here, their normal swing is faster than your attack while two-handing a one handed weapon! Dodging is useless, because when you dodge-roll behind them, they immediately turn around to complete their combo and shove a sword up your â¥â¥â¥â¥. Enemies spawn in clear day light behind your back, ready to once again introduce your sphinchter to an unhealthy dose of hardened steel. But the biggest freaking gripe I have with this game is platforming. WHY!? Why did you think it was a good idea?   Who needs good story? Throw it out the window! Let's add crumbling platforms! Our enemies are cheap and deaths are unfair! â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, we're trying to be dark souls, so git gud, it's not the game that's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's you who are unskilled.   This game sucks and is not worth your money. Go save up for Dark Souls 3 instead.  Upd: Attempted yet another playthrough of it. Nope. Still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gabage. Except I found another con - the bosses are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. They are bland and completely forgettable, and if they aren't pathetically easy, they're hard as balls because they depend solely on your damage output - you have to kill them before they flood the screen with their crap.   What a waste of code this game is. Avoid it at all costs.
10259	This game wants to be DarkSouls, it really tries hard. But falls so short in so many ways. I can appreciate difficulty in a game, even perceived difficulty can be appreciated once overcome.  This game just fills my salt reservses and doesn't make me want to come back to it. I'd rather farm Lothric Castle for 24hr straight... and that doesn't yield much.
10260	**GAME DOES NOT LOAD** I really wanted to play this game but I was unable to. IT's not due to bad hardware (I run a higher end PC, which I build and OC) but rather a .Net framework issue that I tried again and again to fix with no luck. I was able to get to the start screen one time only for the game to crash with in mins. I have many hours in DS1-3 and this game looked to be a decent 'souls like' game. I have to not reccommend though because with all the issues people have with AAA PC games these days I've yet to encounter one but I did with this indie game.
10261	Only difficult thing about this game is putting up with the horrible controls. Refunded.
10262	Imagine a metroidvania game with Dark Souls controls and without a map. Well that's basically it.
10263	Controls are frustrating and really ruins the experience for me. The game had so much potential.
10264	Game was pretty average to start then I got bored dieing against the Sodden Knight. There are better games to play instead!
10265	Has a lot of promise, but rather than have a fair yet challenging game that a large group would enjoy, they seem to have decided to cater to the small minority that get their jollies off of very hard games where you spend hours trying to fight the same boss over and over, until you become a robotic pattern master. Wish it was a little more Castlevania level difficulty and less 'let's make it ultra frustrating' level. Or at least an option to let the player decide.  There's too many good games around vying for my free time to spend hours frustrated trying to fight the same boss over and over.
10266	  It's embarrassing how hard this game is trying to be Dark Souls. Thing is, though, if I wanted to play Dark Souls... I'd go play Dark Souls. There's three of em now, surely there's at least one that'd handle my need for its particular brand of gameplay - I don't need a fourth one.  I do appreciate the experiment of bringing Dark Souls to the 2D format, though. I think I'd like S&amp;S a lot more... or really, at all... if it wasn't so blatantly trying to be Dark Souls. In many ways it could be considered like a progression of the Castlevania playstyle (but not Metroidvania/Castleroid style.) The gameplay is solid and I understand the many reviews praising it, but while I think it's technically proficient and put together well, I also feel it suffers greatly from being way too similar to Dark Souls. As I already said, if I wanted to play Dark Souls... I'd just go play Dark Souls.  Also, the art style is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible. I guess environment design is okay, but all of the sprites and characters look like crap. I know plenty of people like the art style, but I personally think it's crap.  I got the game for free from a friend and that's probably the only way I'd ever play this game. As it is, I've already had my fill. No way I'd ever pay for this.  Bottom line: if you want to play Dark Souls, go play Dark Souls and give this one a skip.
10267	you can see its influenced heavily by the souls series, unfortunatly does not work well with the 2d sidescrolling style of the game. gets very monotonus very fast.
10268	Recieved a Malware detection from my security and it took immediate action and removed the files. I have sent in the information to see what the issue is but it removed it from my pc on its own and it only does that to select dangerous files.
10269	I am not down voting this for being a Dark Souls rip off, im not down voting it because it's a bad game, I am down voting it because it is uplayable with the weapon reach every character in this game has (including your own) The reach is imaginary and much MUCH bigger than the weapon itself making it utterly impossible to know whether or not you will get hit and forces you to roll everytime you are attacked, this is hard considering you will spend alot of time attacking or jumping in a fight, you know, FIGHTING THE ENEMY YOU ARE FACING. Cant recommend this game with the broken weapon reach.
10270	Honestly, even Dark Souls was more fair than this game. I don't know how this trend even started like did they say 'make a game and make it unfair as hell so it will have more public whining and you will get more commercial' or something?   I will change this review and make it more extensive after I play it for a while but my first impressions are not good. Specially because mobs don't have a pattern and they can just do batshit crazy combos out of nowhere. As it seems some of them don't even have stamina so they can spam their attacks and block as much as they want. I think in games like these, mobs have to be similar to the player in general like they must have similar pros or cons. While you cant even block anything properly, a mob in the begining can take hit after another without even a scratch and attacks and blocks like he doesn't have stamina at all.  I'm really hoping that my opinions are like this because I just started the game but I think I'm kinda familiar to this type of games so I think I'm not completely wrong about my observations. By the way, I already beat the first boss and reached the second so I don't think I am a bad player)      
10271	Quick review: - sluggish controls - poor hitbox detection - no screen lock for multi-screen users. You mouse will move onto another screen and jump to desktop at the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ moments. - cheap level design with unavoidable leap of faiths. Why isn't there at least a peek around function. - boring repetitive attacks  Wait for sale.
10272	Every aspect of this game is STOLEN from Dark Souls. Devs call it an homage, but it's just another Dark Souls-like rip off. The gameplay feels clunky(not in the Dark Souls way). Everything is familiar if you've played a Souls/bloodborne game, but with none of the polish. Crashes, bugs, poor enemy AI, terrible map layout, and poor boss design and execution plague this game. I wanted to like this game being a fan of the Souls/borne series, but I cannot recommend this game until many things are fixed.  One more thing, this game has garbage platforming.
10273	Offical Salt and Sanctuary Review:   'Hey look heh hah huh we can make a Dark Souls game too heh hah so good man its hard dude so good PUNSHING gameplay and really intimidating skill tree wow lookout beginners so good our game isnt for the faint of heart woah dude sick just like a Souls game but 2D woah dark gothic artstyle that honestly looks poorly done and woah lets make the areas look like a complete eye sore that appears to have had a 5 year old get a hold of a dull, gray piece of construction paper and scribble sharpie all over it heh hah thatll be PUNISHING woah'
10274	Dark Souls is my @SS, I bought this 'game' because people kept talking stuff like 'oh! its a 2D dark souls', 'what a great mix between castlevania and souls series' and 'it's difficult'. The truth is that this thing is just a stupid ripoff rofl, I'm REALLY dispointed.  I think I don't need to clarify that I'm a souls/borne fan, DS1 is my favorite game ever, but I also LOVE the old castlevania series. I've spent a stupid amount of time playing SOTN on my PS1 with my cousing, who suprisingly got EVERY single item in that game haha xD Those were really good times! But Salt and Sanctuary doesn't really appeal to me, in fact, it's frustrating, the OST is really annoying (there are a few tracks that keep repeating itself rofl), there are TRAPS HIDDEN everywhere (I know, Dark Souls has traps duh, but they are pretty obvious and fair, since the game shows you the mechanics and don't even try to hide stuff from you, they are there to incresse the challenge, not like the malicious ones in this game!), level design is just poor (it's not fun, what can I say =\), 'human' characters are ugly (like really, they look like a 8 years old cartoon hahaha), the story is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too cheap (honestly, the lore here is more uninteresting than the game...) and finally, what is not Dark Souls is Castlevania LMAO  So yeah, the game does it right sometimes too, like the stones system for example, you can 'upgrade' your bonfire, I mean, sanctuary with merchants, 'leaders', blacksmiths, etc and the skill tree is GREAT (yet another copy *PoE* cof cof).  But that is just too little to keep entertaining me, this game is cheap and it doesn't have a mind / heart of its own.  'OH BUT THE GAME KNOWS THAT ITS 'INSPIRED' BY DARK SOULS' &gt; again, inspired is my @â¥â¥â¥!!! Hyper Light Drifter (an absolutely AMAZING game) has some inspiration from DS and other way older games, but still, it is a great and unique thing! The devs of this software (ska studios) are so lazy and shameless that they couldn't even NAME THE GAME RIGHT rofl. Tell me, 'Salt and Sanctuary' feels like a good name for you? I thought so hahaha, not even the name has creativity.. oh man.. what a waste of time..  If you are looking for a good 2D game, go play hyper light drifter, that game is UNIQUE and most important F U N !  I 'THINK' that the problem here is that SaS is TRYING to be a Dark Souls, when Dark Souls is a thing by itself, so it doesnt work, and at last, From Software + Miyazaki are GENIOUSES, and CopyPaste Studios, ops sorry, Ska Studios ...Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯  Yeah, I know my english is way worse than this game xD
10275	this game tries real hard to be something it will never be.
10276	Yet another Dark Souls wannabe which does not understand the difference between challenging and unfair.  The game just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off 1 hour in. ItÂ´s just a crap game overall, donÂ´t buy.
10277	I love Dark souls but this game that tries to be it doesn't know how to do bosses right because more often then not they pull a 'you're dead' combo that's nearly unavoidable making them more luck than anything.
10278	This is pure â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, the most important things like hitboxes and roll immunity are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up to the point where you can only â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guess whether you`re gonna roll out of a hit or not Get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing professional on your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing team, maybe give a call or two to FromSoftware, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dickwads.
10279	Hi, it seems I upset some very sensitive children with my last review, and was instructed by them to write more words.   So let me start by saying, note to self, cannot write a negative review or children will harrass you on end for some unknown reason.   Now about the game.  If your in the mood for a sit back and have a few drinks game this isn't for you. The game while having some good elements, can be difficult if your not switched on. It can be unforgiving and frustrating at times if you want a fast pace revive and move on.  To all the kids upset please forgive me, I hope I have not ruined your life.
10280	A game that desperately wants to emulate the style of the Souls series without understanding what makes those games brilliant beyond the 'it's so hard' schtick.
10281	It's 2D Dark Souls. That's a bad thing.  I had hoped that it could grab me where DS failed, that it could have been an improvement on it. But it has the same infuriating problems DS has, and then some.  In 2016 there shouldn't be any games that have checkpoints instead of saving freely unless the checkpoints are frequent enough. They are not in this game.  In 2016, no game should be made without a pause function. This game has none. How does a game not have a pause function? What the actual f*ck? What, nothing I have to do, like answer a phone call or the door or someone on IM is more important than playing this game? F*ck that, man.  As with DS, when I have literally any other game of the ones I play, why would I play this and get angry and waste time running to the same spots over and over when I can achieve SO much more in other games?
10282	Nope
10283	Does Not acutally have online multiplayer apposed to what it says on the store. Every enemy more so the bosses has phantom attack range and can turn around mid attack to hit you if you dodge past them, basically removing all chance you have of not taking damage (Easiest seen with the second boss when she digs her sword into the ground and then somehow 180's whilst they are still in the ground to hit you).
10284	Garbage. dont waste your money or time on this peice of trash game.  Falling damage simulator is what this garbage should be called.  only meme lords like this crap.  devs are lazy and shouldnt ever be allowed to make another game again. and by devs i mean the mom and pop team or 2 idiots.
10285	What a mess.
10286	Why did they make it not good when they could have made it a real good.
10287	Warning: running this or any of RuneStorm's other games can brick your system.  The installation manifest for this game includes an outdated, buggy .NET installer, which on some systems will force a reboot without asking for permission or giving an option to cancel, and afterwards, the system will be put into an infinite loop of automatic rebooting because the installer continually runs (and fails) on startup.  Despite this being a known issue from their previous games, the developer did nothing to address it for any of their titles. Apparently they think it's acceptable to brick users' systems and expect us to put in the time and work required to research and fix it.  To that end, in the hopes of mitigating the loss to others, I will go one better and at least provide a shortcut to anyone in need of a solution: when the installer fails with an error message, open Task Manager (from Ctrl-Alt-Del menu) to terminate the dotnet* process before closing the installer (this prevents the imminent reboot that will otherwise happen), and then download and run the NetFXRepairTool from Microsoft to stop the installer from running again on the next boot.  Note, however, that Steam will still not see a complete installation, and you will need to terminate the dotnet* process again when you try to run the game in order to get past the setup stage.
10288	Rooks Keep seems like it would be a good game, but the problem is that the multiplayer is completely dead, there are no servers for this game anymore, literally none, and in May the dedicated servers were shutdown.  The game has multiple modes to play, there are two chess modes, classic and combat chess, and then a range of arena modes, which really feel like they are intended to be played online.  from playing against bots (because i couldn't play with human players), the combat seemed enjoyable and it allows you to upgrade your character during a game with points you get from killing other players, you can buy upgrades such as increased damage and movespeed, and there are quite a few different things to choose from.  However the main reason i am not recommending this game is because bots will only keep you entertained for so long, and most of the reviews of this game were written a long time ago, so there was probably a decent playerbase at the time they were written, but a game like this without multiplayer servers is definately not worth the asking price, I don't think many people would buy something like CS:GO without multiplayer, and this game shouldn't be any different.  TL:DR Don't buy this game unless you are ok with playing alone with bots, or there is a price drop.
10289	  dead game to play online totaly not recomended to play online only for single player or to play with a friend out this avoid this all cost the game is realy good but due the multyplayer i vote no
10290	Game has little content, I value the game at about 5 dollars, you won't be playing this game for long but you'll dabble with it.
10291	The gameplay is probably the worst part about this game - it mainly lacks an intelligent design. I regret buying this.
10292	Could of been a good game if they could place the peices in the corect starting location.
10293	This game had potential, sadly noone is playing it online. A game that was released on 5 Dec, 2014 without dedicated servers. - That is quite disappointing.
10294	Bad game. Not worth any money.
10295	NO simply NO! crappy controlles, anoying sound and borring gameplay. absolut waste of money!
10296	its really laggy :\
10297	A top down action/adventure game obviously inspired by Silent Hill. Unfortunately it has a ton of issues:  The translation is pretty bad. The developers are Russian and there's a ton of spoken and written Engrish. The main character repeats the same lines over and over whenever you pick up an item. They should've kept the original Russian voices and gotten someone else to translate the text.  The level design is awful, the first three levels are nothing but mazes with almost identical rooms. There's a radar on the screen but it only shows you and enemies as dots and nothing more. There should've been a map system that slowly uncovers the level as you move through it since they involve searching for items and, as it stands, you'll spend a lot of time running in circles searching for the last Document you need because everything looks the same.  The game tells you to conserve ammo, yet the levels are so narrow that if you try to run past enemies you will get hurt. The only way through is to shoot them.  Unless this changes later on in the game the only enemy types are identical zombies that attack you once they get close.  Unlike most cheap Steam games these days playing it shows that the developers tried to make a good game, but it's way too flawed for me to recommend it.
10298	 Darkness Assault is an indie horror game in which you have been kidnapped and taken to some kind of prison / research installations, as Katrine you have to find what happened.   There are some things that makes this game a bad experience:      Enemy models are the same.  Different models would be great.     Camera.  You can't rotate the camera.     The level design is awful.  All rooms are the same just with different objects.     Poor animations.  Enemies moves like if them have pooped in their pants.      The voice acting it's a joke  You can clearly hear that them are having issues to pronounce some dialogues, due devs are russians.     Translation into english is poor.  You can find senseless dialogues *cough* *cough* Someone used Google Translator *cough*.   This game would be good,  sounds like a good story , but there are many things that makes this game another failed attempt of an horror game.  4 / 10
10299	 A bad attempt at a survival horror
10300	This is a very poor effort. It can hardly even be called survival horror as you find like 2 dozen batteries and only end up using 1 even though the place is bright enough to see everything for the entirety of the game anyway! Just a pointless attempt to make it seem like it has more going on in it than it actually does. Ammo is plentiful as well, as are health packs.  Gameplay is horrid. Walk down samey-looking murky corridors, aim at shambling enemies, shoot and move on. Your biggest enemy is getting caught on the furniture while trying to backpedal from your foes. I didn't think the levels were hard to find your way around as some have reported but maybe the map feature is new, which really does help, particularly in the third and arguably most winding level. The aim and shoot feature is horribly bugged, often needing to press fire several times to get one shot off. Even the ending is complete anti-climax. Not even a boss fight. You just kill some more of the guys you've been killing and walk down a corridor and then the final cutscene rolls.  Took 49 minutes from start to finish and even at that I was getting bored. All dialogue and found document text is complete gobbledygook. From what I could make out it seemed like the usual mad-scientist-abducts-people-and-experiments-on-them-to-create-zombie-mutants. Cause why not.  Avoid like the zombie plague.
10301	Darkness Assault is a topdown 'horror' game.  The thing is though that the horror is not in the game itself, it is more the things surrounding it.   First of all the game's highest resolution is 720p, which is not really acceptable in this day and age.  Secondly the textures simply look as if there was absolutely no effort put into polishing them at least a little bit.  Thirdly the animations look hideous or don't exist at all.   So graphicswise it doesn't look good at all, and soundeffectswise it won't get better: The voiceacting ingame is dull and repetitive. Though after 3 levels I still don't know where exactly the flashlight comes in now.  The guns sound like they were filled with blanks and there is no sound on impact.    Only performancewise the game is nicely done, with getting 60+ fps consitently.  The aforementioned facts are the most horrifiing things in this game, I am not joking. The zombies and other enemies as well as the ambient sounds are even less frightening than the Military Quater in Naxxramas in WoW... and that wasn't even that frightening to begin with.  Conclusions: I cannot, by any means, recommend this game. In the first three levels I felt absolutely no fear, which is the point in horror game in my opinion. Apart from that it looks and plays like a budget game, but money is not the problem here. It is the fact that this game takes time to play and I wouldn't dedicate any more time to that game than I did for this review.   First impressions video is here:  http://youtu.be/v9N9WIQ2nus 
10302	Bad. Just bad.  - Levels act like mazes. - Very short (although for the price given, this could be justified). - Poor transaltion and character says the same line every time you pick up an item. (i.e. you pick up adrenaline 5 times, you'll hear the character say the same line 5 times...) - The 3 weapons you get in the game all do the same damage. - Poor variety in enemies. 2 different enemies, Clones and Security guards. Clones, however, do have 2 different models. (Great!) - Game crashed 3 times for me. Twice when starting the game up and once while in-game.  Overall, I don't recommend it, even at its price. The 'game' becomes more of a chore through its terrible level design and lack of difficulty.
10303	I tried to like this game but is simply bad. The movement of the main character is horrible, there is low ammo, and the enemies are too strong and fast,  Total dissapointment, Don`t buy it.  Update:  They made a patch for the game, and I'm glad to say they fixed A LOT of issues,, now there are better graphics, the controls are more responsive but still a little clunky, there is more ammo and health packs, the enemies are not OP, and they added a map since the first level but you still need a good sense of orientation.  Do I recommend this game now? Maybe, it is much better now, and I was able to complete the game after the patch.  The players could have avoided A LOT of frustration if this patch would have released since the launch date.
10304	This game has a few problems that need to be fixed. First, the story is really bad. The game is about some old professor who is accused of experimenting on people. So this girl (which you control) wants to find out more about it. Don't even ask me who she is or where she came from because I have no idea. Second, there is no map or mini-map in the whole game. You will have to work your way through each level and remember if you've been to this place before or not. Lastly, ammo is very limited and it takes a few tries to kill just one enemy since there is no tutorial at the start of the game.
10305	I can't believe this game is not free....Seriously, i know free games that are longer than this, i finished it under 1 hour! Voice acting is very bad, judging by it's sound probably russian english. Story ending    is huge tease, you go to to some hall and then few scenes appear where you see killed profesor (person behind all of this), and then your character says something like 'wanna know how i did it? well let's leave that story for another time!'....Just WOW :O    Well i enjoyed only a little bit killing zombies, nothing special. Play this game only if you get it as gift (as i did) ! 
10306	Pretty boring third-person action horror game. You complete some trivial tasks like finding documents to get through each of the five fairly short levels. Translation into English is poor. Nothing of any real interest here.
10307	Oh boy. Another horror game. This is me being facious. This game is boring, andthe horror is non existant.  The best thing I can say about this game is the translation, which gives comical moments as the dialogue doesn't make sense. But regardless, you get a game that ugly to look at, very confusing in where it wants you to go, and doesn't have anything close to the word fun.  Also, had to restart twice after the game would not allow me to shut it down.   More information and first impressions here:  http://youtu.be/pwnvPLMnYd4 
10308	A girl wake up in a dungeon.. Well A lot games start with that. This small 3rd person shooter is a very small horror based game that will only take less then 1 hour to complete.   The map layout and the background BGM is decent and everything else is not. The control is simple but different then just about every 3rd person shooter game I ever played. The Graphics and view angle is really weird at time. And since it's only 1 hour long there are really not that much content. About 3 different enemy in the entire game with no boss make this game really scream out for more. More content.  As for now the game itself is simple and okish. Maybe developer can learn from this experience and make better games in the future.  There are some dlc for this game but it's only guns for level one to make it easier and some different cloth for girl to wear. Really not worth the money.  Achievements are really easy to get. Just don't miss the gun on level 2,3 and 4. I couldn't die enough times and shoot enough times by the time I finished the game so I had to grind a bit for those two achievement.  3.5/10 as for right now. A bug free game for me and it does have achievement for quick 100% and trading cards. Really not that enjoy on it's own.
10309	Darkness Assault... Well, they got the second part right, at least. I bought the Gold edition with a couple of the DLC on sale awhile back. Just recently, I had a chance to play it on SquirrelPlay Live.   I soon wished I had not.   If I was feeling incredibly charitable, I'd call this a hot mess.   I'm not.  Unfortunately, the words I want to use here wouldn't even be appropriate on Death Row.  Yes, folks, it IS that bad. Between the obtuse control scheme that wants to be a Biohazard game, Unity, muddy textures, really bright lighting, a fair lack of useful options , one might be inclined to think the game was merely bad.   Not true. The game, low-poly models and all, gave my poor potato heat cancer of the video card. Even with several large fans pointed at it in such a way as even kept DOOM (2016) running smoothly, I barely got 25 frames per second with the card running flat out... Which I managed to duplicate without XSplit running.   So, atop everything else, it's also incredibly poorly optimized.  On to the story: There isn't one. You get a tired, Mario-thin premise to set the stage, and then get thrown to the proverbial wolves. You've been dropped into a cell that nobody bothered to lock, nearly immediately find both a flashlight you don't need and a nepping  gun , and then get to explore the cell bay just long enough to realize the controls are hot tapioca before the first monster hits you like a starship doing Warp 50.   I barely had time to register it's presence before expiring messily the first time, and even knowing where it was the next attempt only bought me enough time to figure out that I can't shoot on the run. One simply  must  give the enemies a sporting chance, and target them first... Should you fail to predict their location with pixel-perfect accuracy, you're going to miss.  So I died. Immediately after that, so did the game.   It wants to be hard, and is simply frustrating and destructive. Unless you're a connoisseur of carp, avoid at all costs.
10310	This is a 3D-overhead 'horror' game in the mould of Silent Hill but not nearly as good. This mode of gaming doesn't work too well on PC.   The game is polished enough and relatively bug free, but doesn't run at resolutions higher than 1080p, making it look less than attractive on a modern system.  Controls are fine, but the top down perspective isn't the best choice for this kind of game.  Gameplay itself is where things get really bad - it's fairly repetitive, not particularly fun, lame zombies that wave their arms around are repeatedly positioned in places where you'd like them not to be. Run around, pick up batteries, medkits, ammo, and just wish you were playing something else. The game doesn't really go anywhere, which makes it seem a bit half done.  Laughably, there's DLC, which really works against any goodwill you might have for developers - they can't finish a game, but they want more money for skins?
10311	Do you like mazes? Feeling lost? No!? Well too bad!! I found myself constantly lost, the map system doesn't help at all because it doesn't give you an actual usable map. I was constantly replacing batteries because the game is so dark and they run out very quickly.   This game is just corridors with more doors stabbing at your poor sore brain. Play if you want to go mad.   ps~ I played this with my own quick Antimicro config and an xbox one controller but also with 'Excision - Virus LP' playing in iTunes. This makes the game much more playable to me. Oh yeah, there is also no sound menu in-game. I cranked up iTunes and dealt with it.
10312	Horrible. Just downright horrible.  - There's hardly any zombies in the game. Kill a couple at most and then waste your time wondering about the maze like corridors. - It's pretty short. In the short length of time it'll take you to finish, there's nothing scary at all. The game completely fails at providing even an adequate 'horror' atmosphere. If anything, it becomes a comedy with all the poorly translated (the devs are Russian) dialogue and documents. - There's not much in the way of weapons as they all feel the same. - The whole point of the game is to not only escape from the dungeon you're in, but to find out why you're there. Turns out the game decides not to tell you that, and instead just ends abruptly. The devs have no plans to make a sequel (they explictly said this on the discussion section), so if you're wondering why Katrine (the character's name) is where she is, just use your imagination. - Not much in the way of enemies. I know I mentioned the lack of my zombies at my first point, but really this is a big problem. There's literally nobody here but you. What kind of horror game has no monsters? - There's just nothing to see or do here. It's devoid of any sort of immersion factor. You'll find yourself bored, unless you think the character's awkward running is funny or something.  Overall, I don't recommend it, even at its price. The only thing good about this 'game' is the soundtrack, but you want to play an actual game, not meander about while listening to music.
10313	 So after finishing game for 1 hour i can say that it is bad...very bad
10314	User interface to correct.   A lot of bugs: character stucks on door or things.  Just for cards.
10315	While it occasionally has its moments, this is not a good game, the story is fairly generic, you rarely feel in any danger of anything apart from choosing the wrong way around the maze and running out of ammo, and the main way of trying to make the game seem harder is a high camera angle which means you spend the game looking at the floor in front of your feet instead of down the corridor.  Further issues include the camera angle shifting and being blocked when you go through doors, which is also when you are most likely to encounter enemies, so you have to adapt a strategy of opening doors and then backing off so you can clearly see the enemy (of which there are only two, the zombie like experimental subjects and later security guards with night sticks). Also for a game with limited ammo, the decision to have it so picking up ammo refreshes that ammo type up to a cap is particularly annoying, it generally means you have to spot an ammo container, then use up that type of ammo clearing part of the level, then find your way back to refill.  Overall the game is playable, but it is pretty flawed and there is nothing really to recommend it particularly - apart from the very start with no weapon trying to avoid the zombies on the first level it is a horror/survival game that feels more tedious and mildly annoying than scary or horrific.
10316	From what I can see this game has mostly negative reviews, this did not stop me from giving it a chance. After playing it for only an hour I can understand why. It's very confusing, dark, and not very fun.
10317	chromatic aberration simulator
10318	I don't like this game, it feels sluggish and it doesn't allow you to customize your controls.
10319	No real positives to this game. There's really no story. You wander around this dimly lit level with corridors, doors, and rooms that are copy pasted from 1 another, without a map, or any real direction. Easy to get lost because every room, door, and hallway looks the exact same, and theres no map or marker to use for guidance. To equip or use items every time you have to press escape, then go to inventory, then click use, you know, because the most simple things should take an unnecessary amount of time. You constantly get stuck on invisible items or nothing at all, any many times I couldn't back up because......bad game. Also genius of them to use an angled overhead view, so that you really can't see anything and it makes movement and everything else super awkward and annoying. After fulfilling all mission objectives and wandering around for 10 min and no clue where to go, I just gave up. Only enjoyable part was laughing at the broken, nonsensical english. 3.5/10
10320	Wow - The Reviews were absolutely right - Run For Your Life! This is an Assault on good judegement - Reviews Are NOT Mixed - They are majority Negative. You've already read about the awful camera angle, bad mechanics, dull story.  My Dad would say, 'Never beat a dead horse,' meaning not to labor a point that's already been made. So lemme be brief.  The subtitle translations can barely pass for English. The voiceovers are comical. Anybody remember Natasha &amp; Boris Badanoff from Bullwinkle &amp; Rocky cartoons. Thats where 'Get Moose &amp; Squirrel' would come off sounding like 'Geet Mus und Skveral.' Yep, this is one lousy Russian Fail. Even though I only paid pennies for this game, it was a big waste of valuable time. You've been warned..... by most of the Reviewers on this page. Cheers
10321	The first 2 levels are actualy kind of fun, it was nice to explore the areas and find objective items. The 'survival' bits are very poor though. The game gets painstakingly repetitive after 3 missions. Luckily all the achievements are attainable within these first 3 missions. This is a game I have to take in portions, I would NOT be able to complete this game in one sitting, it would be just too boring. Although maybe 3-4 times playing the game 2 missions each time (just guessing) would be fine to beat the game. Its not super bad, but there are for sure bad/boring elements about the game. Even then, I still cannot recommend the game.   Cons - Terrible camera angles - Locked camera angle  - Boring atmosphere - Cheesy audio all around  1. Boring zombie sounds  2. Footsteps are the same sounds looped  3. Enemy dialogue is the SAME and very boring   4. Voice acting is terrible - 'Survival' aspects are very basic and not a challenege at all considering you can run past all zombies - You get stuck on alot of things, walking through doors can sometimes be tough.   Pros - Guns sound really cool  - Easy achievements  This game is only worth the achievements, all can be attained within 2 hours.
10322	I cant recommend this game at all. The game setup would had been fun but it fails to do it.. Instead i run around 3 identical levels wondering around looking for stupid notes, keys, and other things while trying to avoid monsters.. Not many weapons nor ammo. You can beat the game in an hour. For 2.99 i believe this game should had been for free.  Pros Steam trading cards top down survival horror Inventory nice concepts  Cons barely any ammo wondering around maps that are the same/identical to the prev lvls Voice acting was bad Camera angles sometimes bugged out not worth the price
10323	Things i've learned from this game: - all male zombies must wear a towel to cover their testicles - zombies will chase you while wearing thong sandals - female zombies are weaker than male zombies but they have nice,untained â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyway-&gt; call Anita Sarkeesian,thanks. - you can't actually run for more than 4 meters without having a stroke - whenever you get lost in real life you can find your way by just looking at a wolrld wide map, because FU Google Maps - all doctors are bald and insane at the same time. And they're German too. Germans are evil. - a torchlight battery lasts for 15 seconds, much more than an Iphone's battery anyway - when you want to shoot something with a gun, always aim for the sky. F**k you Pidgey. - hospitals are made by bathrooms only. Who needs to eat in 2016? We just need to take our daily dump. - all floors must be soggy and covered in blood, no matter why.  Cheesy sarcasm aside, this is trash. Torchlight or not, you can't see â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyway. Floors all look the same, except the last one. Worst aspects of this game? - plot as deep as an espresso's mug - full of clichÃ¨s - it exists - a sequel might come to steam
10324	oh god i wasted 2 hours on this QQ
10325	The worst game I've played on any platform. The graphics and the level design are terrible. There are only three levels, two of which you will have to beat twice â and this is no joke. There are only three kinds of enemies (clones, fast clones, humans). There are just three save slots. The English version is atrocious. As a translator, I find this level of localisation absolutely disgusting. The 'voice actors' obviously don't speak English themselves.  On the plus side, you can get a perfect game in about 1-2 hours (depending on whether you miss any weapons, which fact will require you to replay the game â yes, the whole game â as you can't just jump to the level of your choice), and there are trading cards.
10326	Darkness Assault was an assault upon both my senses and good judgement (I should never have bought it in the first place).  OMG! The worst thing about this game was the camera angle; it was set at something like a 45 degree behind the character, looking down towards the floor. It gave my neck an odd sensation from trying to look ahead all the time towards the area out of view (the cost to fix my neck by a physiotherapist would cost way more than the game is worth). Why, for pity's sake, why? Either use a top-down setting with a wide view, or a first person setting so you can look straight ahead. This lame-brain notion, that looking down at the floor all the time is a good idea for a game setting, is rubbish.  Speaking of rubbish, the developers should have found someone who can speak English properly to write the dialogue and text boxes. The dialogue was understandable, but poor. Not the developer's fault if English isn't their first language, but they should have hired a reputable interpreter to cover that aspect of their production.  There was probably a lot more wrong with the game, but I didn't hang around to find out.  Sorry, but I found this game a real trial to play. So I stopped, rather than inflict any more damage upon myself. I may try Darkness Assault at some later stage, once my neck has recovered, but don't hold your breath. This game gets a thumbs down from me.
10327	Probably the worst game i've ever played. I only bought it as a joke and it was so bad I couldn't even make fun of it.
10328	This game is complete and udder â¥â¥â¥â¥ the movements are buggy you cant get around the zombies and the camera view sucks i wouldnt play this game again if they paid me 1k to play it there is no effort in the creation of this game and i would rather get a cup of coffee with the money i spent on this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and i spent 60 cents on this game because i got a coupon for it if i met the creator i would punch him in his left nut(and im a pacifist) this is garbage and i wouldnt wish this game upon my worst enemies
10329	A while ago I puked on the backyard. I ain't no doctor but I'm pretty sure it was a direct consequence of playing this.
10330	Please, this game is not worth a cent. There are better games on free online game sites. This game has 5 levels that last about 10 mins of walking around and a basic shooting system. It really is not fun. Then to top it off, there's 1 achievement that you can't unlock. The only upside to this game is that the trading cards cost about half the games price so when you sell the trading cards you make money. However if you're like me and like to craft cards the cards cost around 50 cents NZ each... Would not recommend/10
10331	1 played the game. 2 got my trading cards. 3 never played again.  i got it for $0.20 and for that price i gess it kind of pays for its self with the trading cards but i dont know. its just in general not a fun game.
10332	I played for a few min and the contols were so bad i quit....no options to change them either!
10333	Probably the worst game i've ever played  2/10
10334	Hey it isn't that bad if you buy it on sale... I saw a gameplay video for an early version and that was horrible. Now? It is playable. Hardly a survival horror... but playable.  + : ehh trading cards? there isn't really a highlight of this game.. the effort perhaps.. Just if you have it, you can play it and you can complete it.  - : the worst thing is the the map just show enemies and not the map, like rooms, corridors and stuff. controls are bad, graphics and lightning is poor, enemies are bad, story and voice acting is bad.  But he fixed some things from the early version - added cinematics, fixed gun equipping...  I won't recommend it. I'm just saying I can see the effort and clap - *clap* - but that is all. Lets say the creator has left room for improvements.  3,5/10 would not wander without map again
10335	Release date = 2015. Format = PC Can you remap keys to suit your playing style? = â¥â¥â¥â¥ no.
10336	One of the worst games on Steam...  What's the point of a medkit if every attack from an enemy kills you in one hit?
10337	Probably the worst game i've ever played  2/10
10338	I played for a few min and the contols were so bad i quit....no options to change them either!
10339	The game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ the gameplay is crap  I give it a 6/10
10340	Save your money people
10341	OK.First of all let's give some credits for the guys who made this game in Unity.I am pretty sure they put a lot of time and nerves into this game but that was not enough.Now here is my pov: -I played games from 2002 with better cutscenes. -Guns sound pretty bad.At least if there are 3 of them they should add more damage. -No backstory,you are a badass girl running around an asylum or whatever that is just to find a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed professor. -FPS drop from time to time,and graphics like s**t. -At least there were some screaming sounds who sent chills down my spine,but just that. Overall.Dont even try to buy this game.I am horrified to see that they made a DLC for this.But if you are an achivement hunter and want to waste some time go ahead.
10342	its kinda cool but everything looks the same the story is bad and the gameplay slow, plus you move like a tank.  overall cool Idea and play style just bad follow through. but if you can get it on sale just to try or something.
10343	Fun shooting zombies. Fun stops when your ammo runs dry. (NO MELEE FFS!!)  Also, this game is too short for me.
10344	There are a lot of issues with this game.The lack of stelth,the enemies that keep folowing you no matter the distance, and the flashlight, the light can be seen gonig through the other walls and light them too(as you may see at this screenshot)!!!     http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462978563   But it had the essensials for a... slighly horror game!!! Lack of light, resourses etc.  It would be a good game if it fix these issues!!! Good luck, i won't uninstall if it will be a better game at the next 2-3 updates!!!!   
10345	just a question, why is there lense flare ... ON A CARDBOARD BOX!!!
10346	Oh dang, shameless russian cashgrab. There is so much i dont like about this 'game'. The 3rd person top down idea is a nice style which has been tried and tested, but this game fell short. The map felt zoomed in at all times, you could not control the fixed angle or extend the distance. The lighting was horrid, i understand the game is called 'Darkness Assault' so pun, but bad design is a thing regardless. The options menu is horribly lacking when it comes to flexability. The game is playable with certain DLC packs, but vanilla it is a terrible 'survivor horror' cliche, with the Guns DLC it is a bad '3rd person action' cliche.   The game itself has a whopping 5 acts, with no big final battle, the story is confusing and feeds you nothing unless you open menus and read scraps of paper. Starts out a zombie clone game, became a cop killing game about locating professors. IMO, the only thing this game has going for it, is the rather small achievement pool and badge progression. It isnt the worst looking game out there, but the controlls are so terrible. So terrible. Straifing is a chore and combat is....well you can shoot. No melee, stamina and batteries.   It can be 100% completed within 3 hours.
10347	Terrible game, sorry for the devS but this can be an Alpha, not a full game. With 10 euros you can buy Resident Evil 4, Revelations, with 15 Hd Rebirth (one of the best).
10348	Kinda scary and buggy :/ 5/10
10349	Came for trading cards(90% off coup) stayed because I laugh at quality
10350	Terrible, I need a 'shower' after playing it for 5 minutes.
10351	This game sucks, check out my video review!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoGH493OSzs 
10352	Well, i do admit the game is bad and its not even close to be a 2015 game, it would have been a good day if it was released in 2006 or something. Because yeah ... it looks this old!
10353	(EDITED)The only reason why i bought this game was because i had the coupon and it seemed like i could get the achievements easy. Started playing it and noticed a few problems. The camera view is locked on like a half bird's eye half third person look witch makes the map look pretty annoying. Walking is increadibly slow. i noticed as soon as i got to chapter 4 that the gaurds just keept wrecking me. thats where i stopped playing the game. You dont get enough bullets to deal witht he gaurd that show up so the game's telling you that you have to just try you're best to outrun them witch never worked because id run out of stamina to fast or i''d run out of the medical bags to heal myself. although i liked the way the game looked. I liked the cut scenes during the chapter's. the voices were a little bad because you guys dont have a proper english talker's so it was a little hard to hear them sometimes so i just relied on the subtitle's.   Pro's: It's a decent looking game. Cut scene's are pretty cool to watch. Most of the steam achievement's can be done in about an hour of gameplay.  Con's: The camera is locked on in a stupid way. (wish it just had first or third person view instead of a bird/third hybrid view) 2 of the achievements are just a pain to get xD Slow walking. (perfect for the first three chapter's then it's just annoying how slow you are on the fourth chapter) Not enough ammo for the gun/s  Rating: 5/10 Just small problems that could be fixed. I would always run out of ammo trying to kill the gaurds cause i cant run away from them forever. they were EVERYWHERE!!!!
10354	A short survival horror game if you want to call it that. Most of the items are not needed such as the flashlight. There are 3 different guns you can get only real difference is rate of fire. Most of the rooms are basically all the same and the Steam Achievements are a joke. Were finishing the game should be an achievement you get some for dying a lot of times. Since I was able to finish without dying I had to go back in the game up to 25 times just to die so I can get all achievements. If I haven't gotten this game for free I would probably be upset had I paid of it. The concept isn't bad but the effort put into it is.
10355	Such a bad game. Bad story, very very bad mechanics and the gameplay is also bad. All and all, I would not reconmend this game. Even if it's cheap and you get achievements from it.
10356	'Ah, there you!' Best line of the game.
10357	Horribly game . . .
10358	I think developers who made this game are inspired from games like old Silent Hill, Resident Evil etc. and I liked that idea. Atmosphere is kinda cool but it's same in every place and voice acting sounds so fake to be honest. I didn't like the fact that player can't change controls in game because I'm a disabled person who can't use his left hand fully. So I always change running to a close key to W, A, S, D because I can't press 'shift' button. Finding map but not be able to see where you are in it is bad, especially when every place looks same. They should put more emotions, sound effects and deep musics in game. Am I dissapointed? Yes. But do I regret paying for this game? No. It didn't cost a much and hopefully supporting the developer will brought us better game/games in the future. So they should keep hard work and make better games!
10359	The controls are bad and you cannot change them. This game is supposed to be a horror game but does a really poor job at being scary.
10360	worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing camera ever
10361	This game is as good as it is bad. I have to say; I am lost for words about this game I love it as much as I hate it. Here is why the game is SD, and they use real photos with art on it, the characters art is good, but when the whole picture is art, then it feels out of place. Like it's not the same person that have made the art, and the characters don't look the same or should I say the same art style. The music sucks it don't fit the game in any sense there is no background sound to draw you into the VNG. The menu is way too simple if you ask me I don't like it. But when all that said I have to say the story alone does all the talking. Since I'm a loner with low-self esteem, I more time than not know how he feels and can be there with him most of the way, which makes my emotions build up in me and I even try not to shed a tear from time to time. This VN game has a Dark Story to it. I was surprised since I never read anything about this game before I played it and more of the outcome was surprising which just made me love this story more. So if you don't care about the art, the music, the menu, but only the story then this will be for you, and I care about it all wish make it hard for me to decide if I want to recommend it or not.
10362	I got this game thinking this will be a decent yandere game from the reviews and everything but NO! IT WAS NOT! It is pointlessly long, so far I have gotten through 4-5 endings and all I can think of is how annoying and wimpy the main character is. I do not want to read 12 pages worth of text about how out of shape you are from living in the city now that you are visiting the countryside where transportation is not as easy every 5 minutes. Sure there were funny parts like the main character's grandpa loves wearing Hawaiian shirts under his hama and other things I will not spoil, but the main character got on my nerves that I cannot continue reading.This reminds me too much of the anime School Days, I thought this would be more like Mira Nikki or Higurashi.  So if you want to get this game, please know the main character is annoying and wimpy. 
10363	Dialogue and narration are pointlessly meandering. Lots of flashbacks to scenes that just happened, and the main character ruminating on them, revealing nothing that wasn't implicit in the scenes already.  Characters don't come off as authentic. They feel like stock characters written through the view of the author's nostalgia goggles.   Art is ..... bad.  The few endings I read through didn't seem to do much beyond genre expectations.  There's a slim chance that the other endings were fantastic and I just missed out, but the prospect of slogging through that text again wasn't tempting.  If you want a long-winded, predictable yandere game, it's for you. But anything more and you'll be disappointed.
10364	 Honest review after 40 hours
10365	After 20 days, I can safely say.  This game did not meet its promises  at all.  This feels rushed.  This doesn't feel Mafia. This doesn't feel like the third sequel we're waiting for.  This feels like 'one man army badass takes over county' style. And trust me, its literally that.  I saved up a few months of money just to get this, and i'm in EXTREME Regret. (Note, Exagherrated really badly.)  Please, don't let your wallet cry that its money was spent on this.  k real review â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up so rip. also missions are repetitive, go kill this guy, wait for leader, EH.  only reason im doing it is cus of le storyline
10366	It took me almost 23h but I finished it. Here's what I think about it after beating it.  Pros: - Really cool atmosphere of 60s. Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit. - Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting. - Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there's nothing really new about them.  Cons: - My biggest gripe with it - it doesn't make you feel like you are mafia - AI is pretty much brain dead. Especially if you are using stealth approach. - Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests - Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches) - Little variety of cars and guns - Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!) - Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e.g. unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery) - No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling around  And in general, the game feels as if they didn't have enough time to finish the game properly. If they'd allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it'd be so much better in my opinion.  Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff. Which is.. well, not fun. I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. Maybe once it's heavily discounted.  See more detailed explanation of all points (along with some gameplay) in the video:  https://youtu.be/S1Q84XeixcM 
10367	I've updated the review after finally beated the game. Just in case, I'll say it. This is my review and nothing but my opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree as long as you respect it.    The bad. Part 1. 30fps never dies.
10368	[May contain spoilers!] Mafia III is an open world crime game set in the year 1968. You play as Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam war veteran out for revenge for the killing and betrayal of his family. I don't write many reviews but I felt like I needed to let people know what's up with this game, without talking about graphics.   The World
10369	First and foremost, let me be clear, I have been a massive fan of the Mafia series ever since the first installment, it was amazing and the realism/immersion was incredible with the speed limit, indicators, fuel, stuff like that, so you can understand I was VERY excited when I heard about this game.  Now, lets skip forward to just a few days ago when I finally got the game I was so eager to play... to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I am VERY unhappy with how Hangar 13 has failed in keeping up with the quality and attention to detail we came to love in Mafia 2.  I also apologise if my review is 'TL:DR' but details are important in a review. The following are the reasons why I don't recommend Mafia 3.  1: No fuel. The Fuel system in the previous Mafia games added a level of immersion that we hadn't seen before, it was what made it different from other similar games.  2: No speed limit. Previous Mafia games had an enforced speed limit, if the cops saw you going too fast they came after you lights and all, but in Mafia 3 you can buzz past the police as fast as you want and they won't even bat an eyelid.  3: No Indicators. This isn't a HUGE feature but it added immersion and that is very important in a game like Mafia. Previous Mafia games you used the indicator by holding left or right while in a vehicle, but none of that in Mafia 3.  4: Graphic issues. You will frequently see that the transition from day to night is VERY quick, sometimes its instant you just see it go from dark to light in seconds. The skybox at sunset and dawn is U.G.L.Y, it just looks horrible.  5: Car Flipping. Just like in GTA if your car rolls over you can just roll it back over and drive off, in the previous Mafia games you could not do that, you had to get a new car which is FAR better and much MUCH more immersive.  6: Combat. In Mafia 3 it feels as if you are fighting the same fight over and over again, much of the buildings are simply copy/pasted and it gets very boring. Especially when all you have to do is hide, whistle and stab, thats it.  7: Weather. Mafia 3 has no real weather. Yes it rains, but thats it, either rain or sun, no snow, no ice, no fog, nothing, I understand its New Orleans but it still snows in New Orleans. Especially when it comes to driving, Mafia 2 has snow and ice and that affected how your car handled, even NPC's slipped and fell over on the ice.  There are plenty other small things that made the previous Mafia games so much better than Mafia 3.  Such as, shooting hub caps, repairing engines, customising car in garage, random NPC, actual MAFIA not this Haitian bullsh*t, Can't interact with phonebooths, Police are nerfed in Mafia 3, No car wash, Can't use car trunk and finally NO BLOODY FOOTPRINTS!! (You also can't interact with the small things like sinks, toilets, lights, fridges and windows like you could in the previous games).  So I think I have made my point, Mafia 3 is NOT a Mafia game. Yes it has the name and the same devs, but I refuse to believe THIS heap of sh*t is what they had in mind after all these years.
10370	Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I'll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven't experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I'll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60's rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it's really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn't mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There's no in-game clock (at least I haven't seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC's both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date.
10371	As much as I wanted to like it, I simply cant. The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it's a cutescene and for the other 5 you're in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it's great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better. 
10372	Would rather buy Winrar
10373	I was super hyped for this game after the second game and I didn't mind the awful graphics and the 30fps lock. I could see past the fact that my 970 couldn't make it to 60FPS but the fact your game is so buggy that I cannot start the final mission after restarting the game twice is just ridiculous for 2016.   It is disappointing to have to give this game the thumbs down due to it's lack of story and very very repetitive missions after you finish Sammy's missions. It is locked at 30fps and you can unlock it to unlimited but I can't get a stable 60fps with a GTX 970 and the graphics definitely are not impressive enough to demand such a high spec. The game has almost no customization options unlike the previous titles and you can only unlock certain cars. It is the biggest disappointment of 2016 for me and the developers should be ashamed of releasing a product in this state. If I try and complete the mission 'My Name is Lincoln Clay' I can no longer progress in the game and it appears to be bugged.   I'll give an example of how repetitive the game is  Mission 1  - Meet Associate 1 - Destroy building for Associate 1 - Kill Enforcer for Associate 1 - Kill District leader and give control to Associate 1  Mission 2  - Meet Associate 2 - Destroy Store, Truck, Building for Associate 2 - Kill Enforcer for Associate 2 - Kill District leader and give control to Associate 2  Mission 3  - Meet Associate 3 - Small Story Cutscene - Small Story Mission  - Small Story Cutscene  Once you have done this and completed all missions for the associates you will be forced to do it again for the entire game because it never changes and they have absolutely 0 creativity in mission design. All of the story missions feel like side missions. The side missions are more interesting than the main story missions.  As a Mafia game it's the worst in the series for me but as a standalone game it's good but not worth full price so I'd say wait for a sale.  This game is the biggest disappointment for me in 2016.
10374	There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their youtube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none on that in the game. Also you cannot customize cars thought you could in a previous game. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people that have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photo shoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed.
10375	Mediocre throughout.  Incredibly repetitive Very bad AI The more fleshed out, 'end of chapter' missions are underwhelming. Locations and concept is excellent, execution in terms of mission design and gameplay seems rushed or cut for most missions. It feels like cool stuff was planned to happen in many of the story missions, but then due to time or other constraints, they had to cut them and replace them with the same, boring, uninspiring shooting that happens throughout the game Story isn't that good as reviews make it out to be, I think most of them just try to sound balanced and piggyback on the story to have some pros to mention as well.  Excellent facial animations, soundtrack, sound design in general and environment/level design.   Whole load of bugs and some of the dumbest keybinds I've yet to see in PC games (some of them corrected with a patch that came out 2 days after the game was launched)  Shame, it's like they built a cool world to explore, but then filled it with 50+ hours of the most boring and buggy content imaginable.  Hope they learn from this mess and build a great Mafia IV.  4/10. RIP
10376	I have here writing my first review of any game on Steam, and I have to say, I am a huge fans of the Mafia series since 2002 the Mafia: City of Lost Heaven.  This, this Mafia 3, is very very dissapointing. I try to avoid mentioning the graphical side of things.  Pros: -Bigger map, unique settings. -A lot enterable building assets. -Slightly more stuff to do in between story mission; collectables etc.  Cons: -Boring revenge story, every player know exact how its going to be with little to no surprise. -Gameplay graphics differ to cutscene graphics, it tricke dme to believe the game is really that good in the first hour of the game. -Low resolution texture, on Par with Mafia 2 which is years ago. -Extremely repetitive, same side/main story, same way to take over some places throughout the game. -The AI is stupid, a single silenced pistol can takout the whole place and the AI wouldn't even notice. -Minor physics clipping problem -Character animation is lacking; e.g. Flipped cars and character just magically pops out.  This game feels like a major backwards compare to the prevous two. The Mafia stuff were almost non-existent, the character face animation is great but it doesn't makeup the lackluster story.  If you really like the Mafia series or have spare money to spend, you can consider buying this game.  Otherwise, you should wait for discount sales or avoid this game.  Edit (9 Oct):  After seeing some video compare Mafia 3 to 2 and 1, I have to add this part in.  In Mafia 1,  -You can ride the tram -You can deform you car using a single bat -When you break the car glasses and the glass remains on the floor -The bullet sheels were visible on the ground -You can refill at the gas station -The police actually catches you but not kill you  In Mafia 2, -You can fix your broken car -You can freely customise you car -You can change clothes as you wish -You can close the god damn door -Tons of minor detail include you can flush the toilet and turn off the light -You can see yourself in the mirror -You can open the hood and trunk -When the glass brakes you can see them have physics -Blood trail after walked over a dead body -You can actually have a fight with people -You have to work the door to steal a car -The police will arrest you instead of killing you -You can bride the police -You have extra activity to do in the game like buy food and clean your shoes  None of them were in Mafia 3.   Edit 2 (10 Oct): Contains Spoilers  Now that I have beaten the game, the story are really no surprise, and same as what the devs told you. Your goal is to kill Sal Marcano and guess what? you did kill him and that's the end of the game. You can continue to play tha game but there are nothing left to do.   -You can go collect all the remaining collectables i.e. Playboys, Hot Rods and keep wiring stuff. -You can keep robing people -You can... er.... drive around in the city  And that's about it.  Also you can start over again if you wanted to.    vvvvvv Possible Spoilers vvvvvv     Well actually you have a few choices for the ending,  1: Leave the city after Sal's dead. 2: Rule the citywith your underbosses. 3: Rule the city alone which kills all your underbosses in a cutscene only.  The biggest difference are the ending scene which the speachs of Father James and the other detactive were different.      ^^^^^^^^ Possible Spoilers ^^^^^^^^    Would love to see more improvements and add more details to the game. I couldn't even let Clay go to bed or sit or eat, how could he possibly survive?
10377	My Thoughts after 6-7 hours:  Wonderful writing, a great soundtrack, well done atmosphere and great voice work are brought down by tons of technical issues, underwhelming graphics, repetitive missions, balance issues and breain-dead AI. Not the worst game ever, but not close to the best either, some aspects are improved over mafia 2, but many design decisions makes me scratch my head. I am starting to feel bored with the gameplay and mainly only playing more to see how the wonderful story/cut scenes play out.  Once the open world stuff opens up, it gets really repetitive which is a shame as the story is interesting and the atmosphere is great. I honestly wish they would just keep it linear and focused on the story not so much side quests, like Mafia 1/2, Sleeping Dogs and LA Noire did. Play to you're strong suit, which is story and linear missions! Mafia 3 Could have used more time in the oven so to speak. The first 3/4 hours the game seems like it will be great, but doing this same stuff over and over again for taking over these bases, gets very boring.  I went back and forth between positive or negative review, as my opinion on the game has been so up and down. I just hope the story stuff continues to be good for the whole game, I will add more to this review when I finish the game, the thumbs down could turn to thumbs up, but the bad aspects of this game really are a shame as some aspects are very well done, just not a very well rounded product. Also what is up with the skybox and the rain effects? They look ps1 or snes quality.   If I had to score it right now it would be a 6/10, it does some stuff so damn good that it is so sad when all the other stuff fails so hard. For me personally this is probably the most dissapointing game for me since Batman Arkham Knight. Wanted it to be good so bad, but there is just so much wrong with this game.
10378	Request to 2KGames: To be honest, I would rather pay $60 for a remastered HD version of Mafia1 on Steam, with some added content; than pay $60 for Mafia3. Which is supposed to not look as aged as it does upon release in 2016. +ADD FREE ROAM EXTREME DLC.  The game is medicore. It's just a plain and simple game. I've played Mafia 1, 2, 3. Played all of the games to death (Collectiables, etc). Why didn't they re-add FreeRoam Extreme or anything. Continue or New Game; only options clickable at main menu. It seems like a downgrade to me coming from Mafia 2 to say the least. The combat is average, death animations are meh (~3 for every gun/melee), driving is like Watch Dogs/Godfather and car damage is...no. Reminds me of Godfather 2 car damage and combat with a mixture of Saints Row 3 HUD from console days.   The sky is choppy and pixelated, no option for draw distance - can't turn off Ambient Occlusion. When Lincoln Clay gets hit by a driving car, he doesn't fall to the ground, rag doll doesn't take place: stationary standing still and says 'UGH.' You just got hit by a car, fall to the floor or do some kind of animation. Not just UGH. Clay can also exit a moving car at 90mph and roll to a safe standing pose with no damage being dealt. Didn't know Lincoln Clay was part of the Marvels squad. Fascinating. So much arcade present. We didn't ask for Joe's Adventures (M2), and yet you released it with a DLC cost. I watched and responded to people on the 2K forums, asking why you're adding point systems into the game. This isn't an arcade game, Mafia1 wasn't an arcade point game. It was story driven with cutscenes I will always remember. Do not do the same for Mafia3 as you did for the Mafia2 DLC.   Feel like I'm at the Coin Arcades back in the 1990's looking for quarters to play House of the Dead. The half cutscenes (when talking to NPC/non important people) just look blurry and terribly scripted. Really just appears they put the game together too quickly. Nothing flows or feels like you want to come back to the game; nothing drags you back wanting to play more. Has very nice movie cutscenes, and that's about it. Mafia3 holds your hand through everything - telling you where to go from driving to an objective, pop ups during missions literally explaining what you have to do, to icons being on the car door. Icons everywhere, icons on everything, icons ICONS ICOONS. Where's the adventure? Where's the sense of mystery? Playing on Hard difficulty, they could have made the game HARDER and get rid of all the icons and additional help with this difficulty selected.  Majority of 'missions' are go to point A, rough up X guy, go back and talk to guy C afterwards. It's a blast. The games' world isn't feeling alive. I feel like an 8 year old being taught how to play video games for the first time. Rain doesn't splash off cars, water looks meh, no first person option or change 3rd person view height. Character has the stamina of a 100 year old that has some how survived after 3 packs of smokes a day (get more stamina through certain underboss perks, which is also dumb).  Cops. Not doing their job. What else is new though. Aren't pulling people over or getting into gun fights with NPCs. How unrealistic. Cops billy-clubbing everyone back in that day without question. Billy-club now, question maybe later; maybe not. Ontop of that, enemy AI is plain horrific.. Did they copy paste from Mafia1 AI? Probably the only thing they took out of M1. All the player has to do is crouch stealth through all the missions. No NPC will notice you if you stealth kill - so easy. When you get the silenced handgun you can literally crouch and 1 tap every enemy without difficulty. I've hi-jacked a car in front of a patroling cop (walking on sidewalk), speed, fly through red lights, just about anything illegal in front of a cop; nothing happens. For some reason a little blue cursor looking thing pops up every time I pass a cop, but what's it for? Who knows. I'm not wanted and I just commited at least 10 moving violations/felonies.   Enemy AI/Hitman will shoot at me outside of a mission, and cop does nothing on the street. Everything that M1/M2 had to offer, is no longer valid. You can't fix your cars up at the shop, put superchargers on them (Mafia2), store them (no house just compounds with nothing to do), no weapon customization, no era changing buildings or rooms (M2), get pulled over for speeding; nothing. I don't really know why they took so much content out of this game. What made Mafia, Mafia; is not there.  I'll always remember moments from Mafia1/Mafia2 story; Mafia3 not so much memorable. Chasing after Frank in M1, Hotel bomb plant in M2, M3 is just meh.  27' BenQ XL2720Z AMD 8-Core FX-8350 ASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z SAPPHIRE Nitro R9 390 8GB (512-Bit) G.Skill Ripjaws X 8GB DDR3 1866 Corsair Force Series GS SSD DEEPCOOL CAPTAIN 240EX
10379	***UPDATE***: Since the 1.2gb patch that was released just recently, the FPS limit can be set to 60, and even unlocked completely in the options menu. Some other of my issues have also been resolved (I've stricken the points that no longer apply). I will keep my negative review up because I still don't feel it is quite where it should be just yet, in terms of the port work. Expect a revised review with future patches.  ***ORIGINAL***:  One of the laziest ports of a AAA-game I've seen in years.   So, the game seems pretty interesting. Likeable characters, great animations, fantastic soundtrack, okay graphics, etc. I haven't nearly played enough to review the gameplay or story yet.  What I AM able to say something about, is the PORT work. And boy is this one lazy. I'll jot my main issues down in points:    1. You all know about the 30 FPS lock by now. And yes it is a fact. The game is currently locked at 30 FPS. Either I've gotten so used to playing with my 144hz monitor over the past few years that my eyes have grown too accustomed to high-FPS play... Or something is wrong here. Something just feels off about how Mafia 3 runs. Like, it doesn't only run at 30 FPS; the gameplay just feels soggy and sluggish. Like everything's drenched in syrup.   2. There's mouse acceleration or smoothing or something going on, because the mouse movement is irritatingly imprecise. You're unable to disable that, of course.  3. Graphics options are laughably vague. Anti Aliasing choices, for example, are either 'Low', 'Medium' or 'High'. How hard would it be to give us the exact numbers? What is High, exactly? Is x8? What type of Anti Aliasing is it? FXAA? MLAA? MSAA?   4. Controls options are very limited, and the default settings are odd to say the least. While sneaking, you can whistle to attract the attention of enemies. Guess what button that's mapped to. Seriously, take a guess. Guess anything! I can guarantee you won't get it right. Guaranteed. Okay, have you guessed already? You ready for the answer? Ready? Okay. Delete. The default button to whistle while you're sneaking, is DELETE. Now, you can remap that button, but the fact that it's set to Delete just says something about how little the developers cared about making a proper port for the PC.   5. Further control issues; You can't map the mouse thumb buttons for anything. That is a HUGE offense for me. I use my thumb buttons in every game, and not being able to in 2016 is just odd. I accepted it back in the mid-2000s when thumb buttons were still 'new' and not everybody had them on their mice. Today, there's no excuse for it.   6. There's no way to disable UI elements like the compass/map, the 3D navigation and so on. Minor gripe, but worth noting if you like customizing how the HUD looks.  7. The auto-centering during driving snaps into action really fast, and it's not possible to disable it. So if you're the kind of person who likes to look around while you're driving, you're going to get annoyed fast; you'll be fighting the camera with your mouse constantly.  8. You can change your graphics options in the launch menu before you actually boot up the game. Except the changes don't apply so you have to change them all again once the game has started. 'Luckily', there are only about five or so graphics options to choose between, ALL of which have the same choices; Low, Medium or High.  9. You have to adjust the edges of your screen when you launch the game for the first time. Why? Can't the game just detect that on its own? Another miniscule gripe, but it just adds to the whole feeling of lackluster interest for making a good port by the devs.  10. As mentioned lots of places already; the game does not support native 1920x1080 resolution. It's upscaled from what one would assume to be 800p (ie Xbox One standard). You can force it to look at least slightly sharper through the Nvidia control panel, but not nearly good enough to warrant that 30 FPS cap 'for performance's sake'. I haven't seen a big game not being able to run at native 1080p resolution in over a decade now. It is absolutely puzzling to me why they would do this.   11. Remapping buttons is risky business, apparently. I remapped some buttons (like the weapon wheel), to Y. I just wanted it out of the way, really, as I won't be using it much. That is, until a tutorial message popped up, informing me that I could use Y to open the weapon wheel. I couldn't exit out of the message through any other way than hitting Y to open the wheel. Because the game needs to make sure that you aren't too stupid to understand what it had just told you, so it forces you to do exactly what it tells you. Alright, I'll play along. Y. Nothing. Y again. Y Y Y Y Y Y. Nope, it won't work. I can't get past it. I try hitting every single button on the keyboard, but nothing happens. I eventually just ALT-F4 and call it a night. F#$K this.    So, there's my early impressions of the port of the game. It's not abysmal, it's not unplayable (I haven't had any crashes yet). But it's lazy, and you can tell that the developers (or publishers) threw this port together in a hurry to make a buck, rather than showing the PC version the respect it deserves.   There's a good game in here, it would seem. You just have to fight a lot of unnecessary battles to be able to enjoy it. And I wouldn't currently recommend it at full price on the PC. Let's see if they get that 30FPS lock fixed first.
10380	I have to say im disappointed with this game. Most of the reviews you read will all say they dont like it because the fps was at 30 (before recent patch), for me though even after the patch I can't get into it.     To start, the game is remarkably different from the second. For someone who really enjoyed the second game this is a shame. The characters you meet in this game are people you will forget very quickly, unlike Mafia ll (Joe,Henry).     Mafia 3 starts off well but hits a low point when you start doing some of the missions. They are very repetitive and boring. Its all the same, go here interrogate this guy, do $20,000 in damage, 'boss'. After doing this a few times and spending 6 hours on this game,I found myself losing interest.    For someone who hasn't played any of the previous Mafia games, it might be worth to checkout. For people who have played the others though, Personally I can't recommend this game. Not because of performance, graphics, just because the story and missions are not that rewarding, In my opinion at least.
10381	This game isnt exactly a game of the year in my opinion, but ill make a list below of positives and negatives. Remember, these are only my opinions.   Positive
10382	Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of 'loading last save' you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -&gt; Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break 'follow that car' missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.  Update: Nomimated for The âFailure to live up to expectations set by previous games in the series and made me regret having enough brand loyalty to pre-order itâ Steam Award
10383	EDIT: I just beat the game so I decided to reformat the review and add any final thoughts  I never got around to playing Mafia 1 but I loved everything about Mafia 2 back in the day. The gritty realism, the somewhat unique story, and all the small mechanics that made the world feel so real and different from the other sandbox games at the time. If I had to choose right now, I would probably play it over GTA 4. Because of this, I got relatively excited for this iteration. I avoided every trailer, gameplay video, and blog post to not get my hopes up so that I could have an ubiased and uninformed play through this game. But after only a day of playing I have realized that this is a poor mans GTA for a rich mans price.  Pros:  - Story: The beginning, ending, and some of the story missions in between are very well done and will motivate some people to get through the repetitiveness of the game - Setting: I don't remember any games that take place in the racist South during the 60s, playing as a black man on top of that just sweatens the deal - Soundtrack: Every time I play a game like Fallout, Mafia or GTA I love the soundtrack. This game is no different. However, it is a let down that there are only three radio stations to choose from - Characters: The personality for each main and side character is unique and very well done. And their voice acting is top notch. I wasn't suprised to see the long list of voice actors in the credits because no one sounds identical - Cutscenes: Every time a cutscene starts I have to sit back and just appreciate how good they look. Other than some small shadow and clipping issues, the character models and facial animations are amazingly done. However, this is also a negative because once you get back into the game it brings home how ugly it is  - Story Missions: The only interesting and unique missions are the story missions which take place after taking over a district. There are around 12 of these missions (not all of them are good) with boring filler missions in between each one  Cons: - Graphics: This game is ugly. The intro cutscene got me excited to delve into a nice looking game, but it is obvious that this is a console port once you actually start playing. It's almost comparable to a mid gen PS3 game. Where are the GTA 5 level graphics that are shown in the cutscenes? I found that the only time this game looks good is at very specific times of the day, and at night. For about 95% of the day, the sun is blindingly bright and washes everything out - Pop in: This ties into the graphics. Cars and objects pop into view about 50 yards ahead of you, which makes driving really fast in the oncoming lane very dangerous. The pop in is even more evident in the rearview mirror. A wall of brown chases you and swallows everything 50 yards behind you - Audio: Everything is cranked up to the max. No matter how far away someone is yelling from you, it sounds like they are right next to you. This makes it very difficult to track down the last guy you have to kill - Driving: I don't even know what happened here. I've tried both driving modes and simulation mode is the most playable, but they both feel like you're driving an arcadey tank that can just plow through any car. I can hit an oncoming car at 100mph and take no damage but slightly nudge a stationary vehicle and almost die - Missions: There are four different types of missions that are repeated throughout the entire game. It's either: kill/interrogate this person or steal/destroy something. And all of the racket boss missions reuse the same buildings so there are no more collectibles or money stacks to find and pick up after the first visit - AI: I can't remember the last game that had AI this stupid. They can't see more than two feet infront of them so every mission leads to me running around stealth killing everyone without ever getting caught. And if you get bored of that and want to shoot some people, have fun with enemies that run at you in the open or poke their head out of the same cover until you shoot them. And once you get a silenced weapon the game becomes a joke. You can clear out an entire warehouse without being careful and no one will notice. Two enemies were next to each other talking and I killed one and the other guy kept talking while he took his gun out and walked around for a bit. No reaction to his friend being shot in the head right infront of him  - Cops: Are cops even in this game? Throughout the entire game I only had to deal with them when the story forced it. I have driven through red lights, in the oncoming lane, going 100mph, right infront of a police station and gotten nothing more than a little police awareness bar. I've also gone on a massacre and killed everyone in an area and nothing came from it. Witnesses to a crime will run past a cop to get to a phone booth instead of just telling the officer that's walking by - Customization: I thought I hadn't gotten far enough into the game yet, but no, there is absolutely no customization. There isn't a clothing store or garage in site so you're stuck with Lincoln's army jacket, and car upgrades are purely performance and not cosmetic - Weather: The skybox rivals that of old N64 games and the rain is ugly. The most obvious and possibly the ugliest part of the game is that the time of day changes in waves instead of gradually. If you're driving fast enough you can actually race the time change and stay on the line between morning and afternoon. It is very distracting when it's bright out and then suddenly a wave of darkness comes over everything - FPS: Before the patch, I was holding a consistent 30fps. But since changing it to 60fps I have been bouncing between 24-39fps. My rig is fully capable of running a game like this at max settings at over 60fps. Be upfront with your costumers and tell them that you haven't optimized the game to run at 60fps, instead of leading us on like this - The Interviews: The idea of having present day interviews with characters from the game was very interesting. But they didn't know when to stop. Between every mission they felt like they had to have a short interview cutscene, which really breaks the immersion of the game. And there were some parts of the game where I was thinking how the hell I was going to pull the mission off. But then you are promptly interrupted by an interview that spoils the entire mission and that everything went to plan. From the very beginning of the game you already know what happens to Lincoln and Sal because of what Father James says in his interviews  Overall: This game is a huge disapointment. It has its ups and down like any game but its ups don't carry it very far. I miss the days of Mafia 2 with all its little details that showed how much the devs cared. Cars had fuel, you could shop at or rob every open store, stores closed for a day if the employees were killed, cops punished you for breaking traffic laws, cops kept track of your license plate and clothing so that you had to change them, and every mission was vital  to the story and didn't feel like a filler side mission. The thing about this game is that it does nothing new. The story, while enjoyable, is very predictable. And every game mechanic that is present or missing has been done 100 times better before. The Godfather 2, which is a 7 year old game, accomplished more than this game. Wait until a huge patch comes out, or until the game is at most $30. Hangar 13 and 2K, thank you for treating a huge demographic as second class citizens with this abysmal and lazy port
10384	This game was praised by all the game magazines waaay before it's release.  Don't get mislead by the title. The previous two 'Mafia' games let you play a Mafioso. Now you play some random black person hunting down the mob.  So now I got a few hours into it:  PRO: - GREAT music. if you like the genre - decent story  Cons: - LESS content than Mafia 2 - NO new game mechanics. Nothing. Could be a 2010 sandbox game, or earlier. - Repetitive missions. Main quests feel like sidequests. Redundant.  Get it on a sale and you're ok. But don't buy 60 bucks for it.  Edit: Here, some dude made a video comparing Mafia 2 to Mafia 3. Now keep in mind, Mafia 2 is 6 years older than this game. Enjoy:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0    That says it all ;)
10385	Game still runs like crap, Badly optimized, waited literally a month for CUSTOMIZATION and car customization still isn't in the game, The game is buggy, ugly, released 30fps lock, BORING because you do the same side objectives OVER and OVER AND OVER again forcefully. I paid $60 for the game and the season pass. Just giving hope that It will be good because of mafia 2. 2k shouldn't have published a boring broken game and hanger 13 are on my no purchase list EVER. Most of my hours from this game are from it being on while I watched tv or left the house because It's so god awfully boring to play. Stay away from this it is a WAIT until (finished+all DLC released$20-30) used at gamestop where you say 'Hmm, I never bought this before so I may as well try it because I have trade credit' type of game. Oh god why have you done this to me? I'm poor af and I wasted $60 on this garbage. Buy on consoles for a smooth gameplay.
10386	  Not worth a buy
10387	Pros:  Music  Cons:  Extremely repetitive FPS Lazy textures Feels like a poor man's version of GTA  The game is bad, and the developers should feel bad.
10388	Oh dear, where should i start here? I hold off my review so they could release the patch unlocking the framerate and actually be able to play this since 30 fps is unplayable for me. After 11 hours in, this is what i got from it.  - Performance of the pc version is garbage, not much to be said here, not even a gtx 1080 is able to sustain steady 60fps on max settings. - It looks like sh_i_t. Low res blurry textures, graphical glitches all over the place related to lighting and shadows, insane pop-in, ugly weather effects. - The game is unstable. Many users are experiencing crashes at the moment. I was able to reduce their frequency by limiting the framerate to 60 from uncapped but it still does it at least 1 time per 2 hours of gameplay, usually at the worst moment. It can also crash during autosaving and corrupt your savefile so good luck with that (hasn't happend to me, yet). I know it's not something on my end because i have played dozens of games on my configuration without a hitch. - Buggy as hell. npc's clipping through walls, cars floating in the air, sometimes missions won't start unless i reload the checkpoint. It feels unpolished and rushed. - Repetitive missions. So far i've seen only a few types of missions, kill someone, interrogate someone, destroy something, take out the boss. There is some fun to be had here, but doing the same thing over and over and over again gets old real fast. A little more variation (like mafia 2) could do wonders. - Npc AI is straight up ret.a.rded. I won't go into details because i'd like to keep this review from being too long. Just watch this nice dude's video and have some laughs too  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   I know i pretty much buried the game but there are some good aspects too. Interesting story presentation and characters, solid combat mechanics (nothing groundbreaking, but enough to keep you going), nice music and voice acting. Sadly, these are not enough for me to recommend Mafia 3. Even if they fix all the technical issues, which i highly doudt, it still going to be a shallow and repetitive experience.
10389	sigh....... what to say about this game. well...... i was excited to hear it was announced and I couldn't wait, since mafia 2 was fun. but i did keep in my mind thinking it's a different game company and we all know how it is when a good game goes to diffent game developers and it it bombs ' cough cough halo 4' so i had an open mind going into the game. but WOW did they â¥â¥â¥â¥ up hard. basically the game is like destiny but with a story. you do the same mission over and over again for 30 hours. at first the game was intersting but after 5 hours into the game you don't care for the story anyomre because the game gets really tedious. Now the world environment. it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. you remember those cool moments in mafia 2, going to a resturaunt drunk off your â¥â¥â¥ holding everyone hostage while the cops trying to get you? well the dev's decided to say 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' to the communtity and you can't do any of that â¥â¥â¥â¥. All you can do is steal a car and beat up civilians..... thats it. and the cops WOW is that the biggest ' â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' ever. they are basically gta cops except they are more racist. If they just see you they will go after you and start shooting. and to escape you just leave a circle. It â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. the dev's of this game got so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy and didn't add anything to the world to make it fun. the world is just there for you to get to one place to another and no fun in the middle. what makes open world games fun is the actual map of it's self is the icing and the story is the cake. Parts of the cake is there but the icing is just â¥â¥â¥â¥. So i don't recomend this game to anyone. stay away from this game. it's not worth $60.  I forgot to mention 1 really nice thing about the game though. and that is it's badasss soundtrack. anyone that you talk to that has the game will say that the soundtrack is amazing. when you get to the main menu and hear jimmi hendrix all along the watchtower it brings some nostalgia. and then it ends when you press play sadly
10390	Great city, strong-starting story that just trails off near the end as Lincoln becomes more and more edgy. The 'Mafia' part is just a sideshow AI is absolutely the single worst AI i've seen in a game... ever. Driving is meh Every mission is the same. Shooting gallery, destroy this stuff, wire a few boxes if you want an 'advantage.'  Hangar 13 gave a good shot at it, but it turned out half-finished and a lot of features were cut that were in Mafia 2. Could've been 2K's fault, since they published the game, as in they forced Hangar 13 to release it early for budget or... whatever reason. But you never really know. Sigh... guess I'll go back to MGS V and spend two weeks working for the money I spent on this game back.
10391	Beyond the obvious issues with capped FPS, extremely low resolution textures, lack of graphical options and the whole game being 720p upscaled to whatever resolution you're running it at.. I've now come across another splendid issue (or, for me, the final nail in the coffin):  Autosaves.  I've lost over five hours of progress so far purely because they just don't work.  The game is supposed to autosave any time you start a story mission, complete a story mission, or take over a new racket. Despite me doing all of these the game hasn't saved my progress at any point, with the only exception being when I cleared the Hollows. Since then, I've been able to play the game, but instantly lose my progress anytime I die or exit the game.  I honestly can't believe something this game breaking would make it into the 'final' release. All the other issues aside, how did this one go unnoticed? You can't even manually save the game. Was there no Q/A whatsoever? Am I just very dumb and not triggering autosaves, despite making literal hours of progress? I have no idea what's the case at this point.  I would honestly refund this game if I hadn't already played more than two hours.  --  As for the gameplay:  The AI is by and large very buggy.  The world has lots of pop in from time to time which is jarring when it happens (roads randomly disappearing for a few frames, garage doors being solid colored polygons, etc -- this is on an SSD by the way so it's probably not a bottleneck on my end).  The vehicle handing is very poor, even on the 'simulator' setting.  The mechanic for storing money in your safehouse is very clunky. It actually gets replaced almost immediately with a better option, which in my opinion, makes the whole mechanic feel pointless.  The world lacks depth, as the only places you can enter are used for story missions, and you're forced to return to them a few times for some story missions. It can get kind of tiring to clear the same club two or three times. There are exceptions to this of course, such as random garages and storefronts.. which are only used to store collectibles and medkits.. or at other times.. are just completely empty.  The stealth mechanic is very weak. Moving between cover is clunky, as is whistling to get an enemy's attention, you get a throwable item that sort of replaces whistling later on that can receive upgrades but I don't find much use in it. It's very easy, even on the hardest difficulty, to just clear an entire area with a tommygun without using stealth whatsoever.  Now, despite all this, it is an enjoyable game and the story is quite nice so far. It's just nothing I'd write home about, it might improve as you unlock more abilities and upgrades but since I can't (or rather, would rather not) make it past the first zone until the autosaving issue is fixed, I wouldn't know.
10392	Deleted after 9 hours of play time.   Thanks hangar 13 for trashing my favorite game series
10393	The 30fps cap isn't the biggest problem of this game.   Let me put this first: I am a Mafia franchise fan. Always have been. I bought Mafia on it's release in English and German. I preordered Mafia II. I bought every single DLC for Mafia II and I played them all. I have more than 100 hours of playtime in Mafia II according to Steam. I preordered Mafia III and was looking forward to it and it's new setting.   However, Mafia III isn't closely as good as it's predecessors.   I won't give you a final rating of the story or setting of Mafia III. Some people didn't appreciante that they moved from an Italian Mafia background to a black gang background. I was (and still am in a way) open-minded towards it and a bit apprehensive. I haven't played much of the story yet but so far it seems alright, even though I got the feeling that I might already know where things are going.   The conversations and cutcenes are still of high quality. IMO the cutcenes are at least on a Mafia II level, maybe even better.   So that's fine. What's the problem? Primarily the game's technology. I won't even mention the 30fps problem this game has but it has bad graphics, bad controlls, bad sound and bad physics.   As long as your on foot these problems aren't that noticeable. Shooting and the cover system are similar to that of Mafia II. There are some developer decisions that I have to critizise in this regard though: Your health will regenerate really fast. You also have the option to take a medkit in order to regenerate it instantly. Enemies are very passive during shootouts. You can easily kill them from cover even on highest difficulty. The protagonist seems kinda overpowered.   This becomes even more apparent when you take a look at melee fights: When you approach an enemy from behind you can instantly kill him / knock him out. But even when you run towards him you can knock him out with one or two hits (unarmed people on the street get knockt out after one single hit). There is no advanced melee fighting system like in Mafia I or II.   Most of the technlogical problems this game has only become visible once you get in a car and drive around a bit.  Driving itself is very underwhelming to begin with. You can still select 'Simulation' driving mode in the menu but even if you do so the handling is very easy. You can drive at full throttle all the time without any problems. You can 'drift' on a straight street. The whole driving model is very basic, unrealstic and easy. I don't think I can find any open world game with a comparable driving model in the last ~10 years.   You will also notice several other problems while driving through the streets:   -Mafia III's world might be bigger than that of Mafia II or Mafia I but it feels empty and lacks details.  -The car's motor sounds are bad. They don't change when you accelerate or make a burnout. The Thunderbird has the sound of a sewing machine.  -When you hit another other car with high speed it will barely slow you down but fly through the air like it was hit by a NASA rocket  -All static objects other than traffic signs are undestroyable and will stop you instantly if you crash into them though. Even some(!) phone booths.  -When you drive into a pedestrian they will be stand in front of your car while beeing pushed around. They will drop dead as soon as you stop. I have seen better solutions in open world games of the pre-GTAIV-era!  -Volumetric smoke? Nope!  -All in all bad effects -Aggressivee LOD -Bad textures -Low draw distance -Fog -In the first daylight missions the weather will change within seconds from super light sunny with massive bloom effects to dark clouded and back. Quite annoying.  -All in all very bad lighting in the first daylight missions (bug?).  -Ugly, low detailed car models! Really. There are cars that look like they are out of the 50's. Some have a strong resemblance with cars that where in Mafia II. But they didn't take the models from Mafia II. They created new, similar looking models that look worse on closer inspectation. Makes me wonder why. Did they just buy the name and not the rights to use previous content?  -The damage models of the cars are worse than in Mafia II -Sometimes shadows are casted to different directions  There are also bugs where certain items fly in the air because furniture isn't displayed or instances where the player falls through the floor of the map.    Conclusion
10394	Waste..of...Money.. Nothing in the game convinced me. Mafia 2 is way..way better in every aspect..every
10395	As of now, I have no other choice but to leave a negative review of this game and advise not to buy it until proper PC support is implemented. I've played 55min and the game seems that it can be a good game, I like the atmosphere and the style but the lack of better PC support is not acceptable in 2016.   The 30fps cap has no place in PC gaming and worst of all the developer hide this info until the very end! I cannot accept this kind of behavior towards gamers! Too many times this developers use the 'day one' patch to fix a game after release, well, the game should be fixed before release and if it is not, then, either delay or in the very least let the consumer know what is going on! But not fixing it and not divulging this info is not acceptable!  Also, 21:9 is not properly supported. It has lots of glitches in menus (words and graphics get cutted)  I won't play anymore until the patch and after trying that I'll either change my review to a positive one or just get a refund for a game that was not made to work on PCs.  For now I cannot recomend this game!
10396	TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you're new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  â¥â¥â¥â¥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960's america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I've noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how 'brave' the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960's (I'm 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln's straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that's a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There's so â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different 'missions' even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c'mon guys that's just lazy/no working key rebind system? â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti's 6GB in SLI (the system req's call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn't put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a 'oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ we forgot do that' moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little â¥â¥â¥â¥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu's are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they're 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you'll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you 'simulation driving' to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it's really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you're meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won't refund me my money so i guess it's only fair that IF (&lt; big if) any of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly
10397	I can't recomment this game, okay the cut scenes look great, but that's all.... I'm playing this on Hard and I'm just walking through this, little to no challenge, this is a bad port for the PC glitches and graphics wise disapointed, won't recomment it.
10398	So yeah, it took me 39 hours to play through this game. That's not bad for a modern game, though of course I did take my sweet time and did all the side missions as well, and gathered all collectibles (still can't find that last album cover, it does not appear on the map).  Anyway, I honestly don't know whether I can recommend this title or not. I'll list the pros and cons, first things first.  Pros:  -Vito! -Great cutscenes! -No fast travel! -Music! -Gunfights (stealthmode is also very intuitive!) -The city is huge! -Well designed cars (they don't use any real life cars, but rather make some up by mixing existing ones - they really did a great job on that) - the driving is alright as well, although I feel that it should've been a greater challenge, especially since I was in simulation mode! -Upgrades for cars, your character, and item slots. Gives a nice sense of development as you progress through the story!  Cons:  -Handholding. Arrows pointing to your current objectives at all times, for example - it's just not necessary. You're also just a quick phonecall away to have a car delivered, weapons to purchase, and money to store. You can also disable phones with this 'feature', and eventually be able to call off the cops, even... I mean.... eh. It's just way too easy to succeed in this game. Handholding is bad. -Poor graphics, badly optimized. They look very blurry compared to other games, and there's no visual difference between high and low? Ok then. The framerate also suffered at times, though not too bad, at least for me. -Rackets. These are incredibly boring and repetitive - and you get to do them about 500 billion times. -Forced to unlock story missions. This is the worst move by far. -Very little depth to the majority of the characters. Example: You are forced to take over rackets and districts and whatnot to unlock more dialogue with some characters, and eventually you unlock this super dramatic dialogue and find yourself not giving two â¥â¥â¥â¥s because... well why would you? There's little to no story behind the characters, and you just can't sympathize. Basically the majority of the characters are just shallow. Not that great for a supposedly 'story rich' game.  I think that's everything, so now you see why I do not know whether to recommend this game or not. Hmm... signs point to no. The way the game is now... I just can't recommend it. Maybe if they release a patch to optimize it better - that way the pros will outbalance the cons.  This is just my personal opinion - if you like doing repetitive stuff for hours on end to see how the main story unfolds, then by all means go for it. I don't think it's worth the price that Steam is listing it for though.
10399	Just get Mafia 2 or 1, instead of this garbage.
10400	Too repetitive to recommend, 14 hours in and the story's barely moved, and I just got a whole ton MORE busywork to advance the story. They watered down a couple aspects that I liked from Mafia 2. I've been tearing around town, speeding past cops, and no one has noticed. Doesn't look like they care at all about speeding violations anymore. Also I don't think there's a fuel gauge anymore either, not a big deal, but I kinda liked that in Mafia 2, even tho I hardly ever had to fuel up.  The missions I've played so far are alright, but it's just the same thing over and over, oftentimes in the same locations as you've done almost the exact same mission within the past hour. The driving feels ok. Not exceptional, but I'm kind of a stickler for driving physics and I don't hate it, they feel a little stiff but still on the fun side of serviceable. Story's compelling so far.  This game ran like hot garbage at first, couldn't even maintain 30fps without stutters. Seems like it was CPU limited, maxxing my CPU repeatedly. Then I turned on Hyperthreading in my Bios, and it cleared all the stutters right up. Activity monitor shows none of the cores (real or virtual) getting maxxed out, and the load is spread quite evenly across them. This is the first application I've ever seen hyperthreading make ANY difference on, and the difference was night and day. Bizarre.  Now I can maintain 60fps/1080p with mostly medium settings, reflections and AA set to low. If I turn reflections up to medium, it's a playable 40-60fps, usually 50-60. i7 3770k, gtx980, 16gb ddr3, ssd. Not terribly impressive, given I can run GTA V with most settings maxxed, but better than playing the slideshow I was seeing for the first hour of gameplay.
10401	**I'll update after more play time.**  This is a painful review because the cut scenes and story in this game is very very good. The game made me almost instantly care about the characters of the game. I wanted to see Lincoln Clay through the end and I'll still give it a shot. Facial expressions during cut scenes and voice acting is awesome and after about 30 minutes of it in the intro, you're very excited to get out into the open world and tear up the city and see what else the game has to offer. After you leave the first area though and into the second part of town you start to see the games limitations, and it's painfully obvious.  I'm going to put aside the games CURRENT 30fps lock and lack of SLI support (as someone running 2 GTX 1080's it's really frustrating to see a AAA game locked at 30 and no SLI support), even though it screams 'I'm another shoddy PC port.' Even though this also happened during my gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfmFV_2Lhc  So with the potential PC conflicts aside lets juts look at two massive issues I see with the game itself.  Graphics: Very muddy textures. If you spotted Angry Joe's rant where he used the sky as an example and litterally compared the sky in this game to the sky in Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. It's pretty sad to see how lazy development got here. Some of the tree's and vegitation does look decent though, as a plus. However it's hard to miss the poor textures when walking around the city, even when playing it on resolutions beyond 1080p  Missions and game design: Yesterday I tracked down a collectable Playboy in an area. It was inside warehouse on the second floor. There where some stairs leading on the outside going straight to it. A few hours later I found myself in a totally different area of the game. I noticed another collectable playboy on the map and I went to collect it. When I got there I got hit with deja vu as I quickly noticed that this warehouse was EXACTLY the same warehouse as the first. Quite literally as even the funature, boxes, desks, machines, random garbage strewn about the place and even the god damn playboy was even in the EXACT same spot. You'll find a lot of places that are like this in the game.  As far as missions go, you will find yourself repeating the same missions over and over again as you take over rackets in the city. Which will get exceptionally tedious over time. If you are trying to collect everything, it will make the game really hard to complete as you will find that you are forcing yourself to get through the last half.   Based off my initial impressions so far. It's hard to reccomend this right now. Who knows what DLC will bring to it and how it will change. Also still waiting on this patch that will unlock the frame rate, However in it's current form as of THIS date this game is a hard reccomendation. If you loved Mafia 2 and really want to see how the story continues, you'll probably enjoy the story. If you're someone just looking for a good game, than hold off a little bit and see how 2k handles the post launch aftermath.  **Edit** So the patch to unlock the frames is out SLI still isn't supported, but I expected far better than 60fps with a EVGA SC 1080 at 1440p. Inside I was getting between 60-70 fps. The second I hit the road and started driving I had dips into the high 40's. Unless you're playing at 4k, a dip into 40fps with a card like that is unacceptable. The game needs to be optimized more.
10402	Bullsh*t if compared to the last game (Mafia II).
10403	Dont buy this raw console port !!! : - Remap key bindings and surprise USE function not working cant even 'grab those keys' at the begining of game (fixed) - 30 FPS lock in 2016 on PC (fixed) - Low res textures - Idiotic key binding (remaping keys not working) (fixed) UPD - after playing about an hour crash (no log) UPD 1 (after pach) - 4 crashes in about 15 minutes - lightnig is gliching UPD 2 - liberal marxist propoganda. Disrispect of Dixie flag and southern ground.
10404	Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man's Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: 'The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia IIIâs performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.'   That's the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It's so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game's launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. This was my birthday present, and it's the worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn't deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing years to sort all this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out, but you didn't. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don't buy this game.
10405	I've played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren't reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we're being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it's raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy: Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn't appear on the map. My 'GPS' path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you're a completionist, there's zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. 'Hey kill a pimp here..' 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there.' With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn't feel like it means much as the endings are the end. What happened to 'open world games' letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you're a 'one and done' player. If you're looking for replay value I'd wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can't recommend the game. It's buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it's predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*
10406	Even forgiving the terrible ai this game is a technical mess. 30 fps lock it's only the beginning of this game issues, there's a constant 'fog' that really kills your view distance, everything is upscaled, no real native 1080p or higher, there are glitches everywhere, shadows popping in and out, and sunlight appearing and disappearing. Definetly WAIT for this game to be fixed before buying it
10407	Review after 9 hours. I do not plan to continue. And the review mostly focuses on the negatives.   Mafia III had a rough start with the 30FPS lock which can make alot of people get negative feelings toward a game and see bad because they're looking for it. But I really like to keep an open and positive mind on a game unless it forces me to stop, Mafia III did that. The story and setting in this game can be a reason to play it, from what I've seen the story is quite good with interesting characters, but the story won't save a game because its a game and not a movie. The setting is of course what makes a Mafia game and its nice to see a 1960's world with all of its amazing music. Too bad that the game was advertised as having this amazing New Bordeaux city but for me, it kinda feel's boring and unmemorable.   That brings me nicely into the open wold gameplay... unless after 9 hours I havent unlocked the 'real game', its terrible. You can not get a haircut, can't at least change clothes, you can't even customize cars or even store them, there are set few cars you can call after you've unlocked them by progressing through the story. All the open world does is let's you pick which order you want do complete your objectives. Mafia II literally had more 'open world stuff' than Mafia III. Mafia II suffered from not being open world, Mafia III I don't think would suffer if it was linear. Mafia III could have been something interesting, it has such a potential for a GTA-like, open world game but set in 60's, but it feels very much like just another 'generic open world game' with no soul. Gameplay and world feel stiff and with terrible physics and with repetetive open world tasks you need to do. I'd love to have a world I feel like I live in like Mafia II, not the generic open world game world with nothing to do in.   What else we got... gunplay is quite nice, driving is much more arcadey than mafia 2 and I'm personally not into that, I liked the realism of slower and heavier old cars. Stealth is fine... quite a nice addition where you can chose if you want to stab everyone or go guns blazing, both work and are pretty much equally as fun so when stealth goes wrong, shooting is still an option. And stealth would be great if not for the absoluteley awful AI that will not see you when you stand in front of them (trying to play into racism that black people are harder to spot in the dark or what?), or when you LITERALLY STAB SOMEONE IN FRONT OF THEM,  https://youtu.be/hquqaGIR5SU   Aside from the 30fps lock, the graphics look fine... as long as its not daylight  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=778470153  The reflections in this game are garbage and day lightning makes me ill, shaders break sometimes. Really, games that are pre-alpha can look better than Mafia III and thats complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I paid for a AAA game and not early acess. In other situations its quite alright, the facial animations for an example are really nice.   Then theres other stuff, the glitches that you can find everywhere,   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  The extreme lack of polish this game is really pushies it over the line into hate territory for me. While playing you constantly run into a new bug every few minutes and it gets really distracting, like someone poking you once being alright but poking you once every minute would make you go crazy. I could have have rated it 'ok', as buy for a lower price when it comes and play this game that doens't really feel like Mafia II but a kind of generic open world game. But all this lack of polish and abundance of glitches, bugs and all other annoyances push me to say. Don't get it.  Its my opinion, I'd play it if it was some sub at least 20euro game after all of the glitches are fixed. Right now I only wish I could refund...
10408	Alright. So i have decided to not play this game past 2 hours just in case this fps fix ever gets released. And if it does, i want to have 1 hour left to test it. So here is my thoughts on the game after playing the first 2 missions, and i took the time to get out of my car and look at some textures, some animations, and stuff like that. Just to get a quick first impression of what this game is.  I run GTX 1080 rig with the lastest nVidia drivers, basically a PC that runs games like GTA V &amp; The Division all maxed out in over 60fps.  The first thing i notice is that this game can not run in window borderless, it's either windowed or fullscreen, which is the second hint that this company had no plans of making a good pc version of this game, the first hint was the fps cap. Neither 2k or Hangar13 said anything about a fps cap, until the game was released, when pc gamer wrote an article on it. Then the popular youtuber totalbiscuit started asking questions, and that's when 2k made a statement.  This statement does not specify anything other than that they know the game is running in 30 fps and that higher fps will come soon.  They do not say how many fps or what soon means . But it is likely they are trying to keep people playing and hoping, so that they pass their 2 hour steam refund mark.  It makes absolutely no sense to release a game in this state if they knew how to avoid it. No sense at all. So i will take all they say with a few hundred grains of salt.  Releasing a game to reviewers, the very people that are there to critizise your product, in a state that, in their words, will be fixed 'very soon'. Yeah right.. Very logical.   One thing that does make sense however is why this game had a review embargo.  TBH this game seems unfinished. The graphics looks like they are at least 5 years old. The city and the scale looks really good, but it looks like the entire game is upscaled.  This is a game that is not worth the price they are currently asking , not even close. I will put a hold on my refund atm, and see if a fix will arrive, but for those of you who are on the fence about buying this game, i would wait. It is a bad pc port, almost without any work gone into it.  In short:   +Narrative and story seems good +Absolutely incredible soundtrack  -Can't bind extra mouse buttons to anything -Rear view mirror has terrible draw distance -30 fps cap -Really low res textures all over the place -Looks like upscaled graphics -Horrible shadow draw distance on some objects   This is what i can remember at the top of my head. This is not worthy of a triple A PC release. Even if the game was running at 60fps, this does not look like a PC game with this price tag. So wait until it's on at least 50% sale.  It saddens me a bit to say this, because i had hopes for this game, i added it to my wishlist last December. And was looking forward to enjoying this game for the next few weeks until civilization VI releases. If it wasn't for the steam refund system, i would have felt robbed right now.  TBH this game has issues i don't think they will fix anytime soon, there will be plenty of fanboys saying i'm wrong about this, that a fix is just around the corner. But i can't see it happening. Maybe a 60fps fix is coming within the next week or so, maybe 2 weeks. But that will still make the game look washed out.  This review might change completely if they do something drastic.    EDIT:   Thanks to user :  Butcher of Blaviken , i'm now adding some information to this review. After i wrote this review, 2K released another statement which reads:   We currently have a patch running here at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III. We re verifying the patch now to ensure everything is working as expected. If everything goes well, we expect the update to go live this weekend.     EDIT 2:   This game is much worse than i thought. I have seen a lot of videos today showing hundreds of serious bugs and glitches. From the looks of it, this game is far worse than watch_dogs was/is.  So now i have absolutely no hope left that this game will ever be fixed, if you want to see, just search for 'Let's Break the Mafia 3 AI' &amp; 'mafia 3 gameplay bugs', and stuff like that on google and youtube and a lot of videos will show you how bad this game really is.  So i just refunded it. This is totally unacceptable, and 2K should have known better. And i usually defend 2K as they release a lot of quality content. But this is the first title made by Hangar13, and i can safely say they were not up for the task.
10409	So, I went into this game more hype than I was for GTA V, since Mafia 2 is a masterpiece in my opinion, a genuinely timelesss looking game with a pretty incredible story and a beautiful setting. This game genuinely turned me off of Mafia. I don't give a hoot about the 30fps lock, it's still sufficiently smooth, but..  Here's some of the things I find annoying, from a Mafia 2 perspective.  -The game plays like a movie. Half of my playtime thus far has been cutscenes. Decent story, but holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ I didn't expect to learn every minute detail of what Clay had for breakfast. Were the eggs runny? Was the sausage overdone? Coming up next in our next exciting episode. -The AI is in fact, bad. In the initial shootout, a guard ran back and forth in front of me, saying 'This is a massacre.' on a 2 second loop. It'd be funny if it didn't happen every room. -The cars are actually pretty fantastic, but there's no option to stealth steal a car. That gets old. -Cops don't like you. You exist. You are now wanted. -AI traffic drives around with hoods, trunks, and random doors open. That's jarring as all get-out. -I get a weird bug where glass just floats in the street randomly. Why? Iunno. -This game plays like a bad GTA IV mod. Picture in Picture on the rear view mirror has no AA. People in cars have no animations. The rear view mirror looks like playing Driver 2 on the original Playstation. -The 'Peds call the cops' mechanic is more broken than it's worth. You can literally just waltz up and one hit them. They rarely seek out a payphone. -The cutscenes look WAY better than the actual game does.  For having held Mafia 2 in such insane regard, y'all really dropped the dang ball on this one. Fix yourselves.  More playtime edit:  I thought this game -might- get a little better after a few hours, but spoilers, it didn't.  Here's some more irritating stuff that I learned about the game:  -The whole game feels cut and paste. The mission structure is the same throughout the whole game. Go into this district. Kill these idiots. Destroy this stuff. Kill this racket leader. Rinse and repeat twice. Kill the district leader. Give it to a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥y underboss. What variety? Even on missions that were showcased at E3 and other trade shows had their balls cut off. The main mission showcased, with the underground firefight that showcased getting intelligence and planning your approach ISN'T IN THE MAIN GAME.  -The cutscenes and the story It actually did lessen up, there's a lot more free play time after the first few hours, but this game is still crap. There's little story to speak of.  -The customization What customization? It's supposedly finally coming as 'free DLC' but I doubt it, real bad.   -The cars They all do roughly the same speed, rapid acceleration to 35mph, shift, okay accel to 50, shift, meh accel to 70, shift, hit whatever that car's limit is. Why? However, they did keep the moving windshield wipers from Mafia 2, which is neat, and even has the radio go static when you enter a carpark or go into a tunnel, which is a rad little detail.  -The AI THIS IS A MASSACRE  -The FPS patch This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off, really bad. When it came out, it redid the complete control scheme without explaining the changes or -why the control scheme needed to be changed-. Why? Cuz. These developers SUCK.
10410	Since i played this game a whole lot, i changed my opinion on the game.  As before: the one interesting thing is the revenge story, which features racism and has a cool django unchained like flair to it (black folk facing racism and stuff).  But damn the gameplay is tedious and repetitive. I forced myself playing this game for so long, hoping things would vary a little bit along the line. But i was soooo wrong.  You basicly do the same thing over and over: 1. Drive to contact 2. learn about a person 3.Kill or interrogate a dude, destroy crates 4. Lure the mentioned person out 5. Kill that person  Thats all you do as long as you play the game. There is no fast travel or anything and you have to drive around from point to point which can take a bit depending where you go....probably to lengthen the game.  The only fun i had was when i went nuts....drove to a point, killed the contact with a single headshot...and quickly escaped. The police isnt chasing you anyway even if you speed right past them.  Unlike in Mafia 2, you cant change clothes or lincence plates to become incognito, you cant change clothes at all. When you are seen commiting a crime, you punch or shoot the witness running to the telephone and thats it...nothing happened...if someone sees you shooting the witness, just kill the new one and drive away without a care in the world.  I Really REALLY wanted this game to be good....i thought the southern revenge story full of racism and stuff was more interesting then gta, more bound in reality...but this game is not worth it.  I recommend playing mafia 2 or GTAV; GTA V is the open world action king and will remain so because it has enough variety to keep you entertaint till the end.  Mafia 3 is entertaining the first 2 hours till you find out the stuff you did till then is all you will do for the rest of the game.  Dont buy this game, wait for a cheap sale if you are interested, but dont pay the price it is currently charged for.
10411	***Please note this is purely my opinion, you are free to disagree with me but keep it civil. Abusive comments and personal attacks will be deleted.***  Pros:  + Excellent cutscenes + Excellent story + Good music selection + Weapons sound realistic and meaty + Setting the driving to simulation feels really good  Cons:  - Repetitive missions (Go here, kill/destroy something, come back, repeat!) - Poorly optimized - Muddy, grainy textures (Looks like upscaled 720p textures) - Clunky mouse and keyboard controls - Can't rebind keys to extra mouse buttons - Can't jump! - When using the mouse to look around while driving it constantly resets itself to the default position - Moving around cover isn't as smooth and easy when compared to other cover based shooters - Multiple crashes to desktop  Verdict:  An excellent story hampered by some performance issues along with questionable and annoying design decisions.  If you are willing and able to overlook the many small issues then I urge you to at least try it for yourself because the game is definitely not terrible but for me personally I wouldn't recommend it... Not at full price anyway.  I would hold off buying it for for now. Wait for a sale as there are too many annoying issues bringing down what could potentially be a really great game.  If I had to give it a rating I'd score it a 6.5 out of 10 (slightly above average)   ***UPDATE*** A patch has been announced which should come out on the weekend. So long as it corrects many of the minor issues you can expect this review to change... Fingers crossed.  ***UPDATE 2*** After spending a little more time with the game (went over 2 hours... woops!) I have edited some of the pros and cons and adjusted my score upwards slightly, If the coming patch adresses things like frame rate, textures and keybinds I will adjust it higher again and possibly reccomend the game.  ***UPDATE 3*** A patch has been released that corrects the 30 fps lock and the game feels a lot smoother and responsive, however all other issues listed still remain along with some weird graphical bugs like objects disappearing and what feels like more frequent crashes which weren't present before... I have updated both my review and score a second time and this will likely be my final verdict and update.
10412	Broken out of the box, Quality control dropped the ball on this one.  You might have heard about the fps and graphics gripe (not to miss in most reviews) but what baffles me  is that the keymapping seems to break the game, leaving you stuck in a mission where the game tells you to press (key) and or (keypad) controller and nothing happens..   Tried out to reset all keysettings, and got it working: make sure you have no double keybinds and or conflicts. so if you use arrow keys walking dont use them for driving, this seems to mess things up  assigning keysettings to a mouse doesnt seem to work unless you can program mouse to emulate keyboard keys.  music and story are quite entertaining, even the shooting has a nice feel and look to it. couple this with nice driving but lackluster graphics its still a mixed bag, although the story is very compelling and well written.  After several hours in, i can say the story is still very compelling, i got drawn to the characters and just can't wait how it develops and see how my actions influence the game, the voice acting is superb, even the smallest details when you hear some people talk to eachother when sneaking around have me stop and listen, same as with the radio sometimes you just have to drive around to hear it.  Now the only thing that is getting to me is how long it takes to get to a cutscene to progress the story, the repetive nature and major flaw of this game seems to creep in, find object bug phone, find person, kill person and or interogate person, sneak or shoot (my favorites).  Although each in different settings but if the settings are the only thing to endure the time consuming repetive task of progress then i don't know i want to continue and even finish the game.  I realise all games have something repetive yet when it becomes to obvious it wears down my enthusiasm and i get bored, putting the game down and shelfing it.  It's better than mad max game but way behind the last grand theft auto or batman arkham asylum in the gameplay department, which just seem to have a bit more diversity in the long run to make you want to finish the game.  btw, i never in the 20 hours managed to take one of those brutal finishers, playing with mouse and keyboard, never saw the option pop up or just shoot them in the head as enemies can take quite a few shots before going down, a bit to much imho when you got authentic storytelling.   but i'm shelfing it for now, repetive threshold has been reached... very dissapointing for such a game
10413	Please just check this comparison of Mafia 3 vs Mafia 2 from 2010:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0   Story is the strongest point of this game. Just love brutality and language. But missions are repetitive with a lot of long, boring driving in between. Fast travel would be welcome here. Also AI is very stupid to the point when enemies are looking at the walls for 30 seconds from 20 cm distance. Is this Blair Witch Project ??? Graphics mostly are ok but also nothing like we seen in trailers or devs gameplays. The sky, water and grass are the weakest points. Also there is some serious issue whith water and cars slightly glowing at night. Combat is good but also very 'bare bons'. The only 'special' thing about it is you die fast if you do not try to be stealth or use covers. Cover system is good but sometimes clunky and hard to 'manage'. Driving is different and games like GTA, Driver or even FarCry done it better. I didn't encounter any crashes. There are FPS drops, some textures has low resolution and light/shadow glitches.Game was locked on 30 FPS without informing players before release day. This is unacceptable on PC and just outrageous. Overall game works - I7 4770K and GTX 980ti. But there are many people with crashes and games not running at all. There is nothing special about this game that makes you want to play all day long.
10414	I never thought that someday I will be so disapointed in Mafia game. ..will watch all the cutscenes on youtube, cause it's a waste of time to play it through. Degraded in every way possible from previous Mafia titles. It's even waste of time to write this opinion, cause none of us still plays it or considers to buy.
10415	Pro's:  - uuuhhh.. - Lincoln himself looks well animated - Facial expressions - Music - Some night, rain+lighting settings  Con's:  - Bought it as pre-order (thanks to this game, I'll think twice before buying pre-order stuff again) - Bought it with Season Pass (fml) - The graphics look average (like other ppl said, copy pasted console port) - DESIGNING MISTAKE IN 100% OF THE CARS! SRSLY, WHERE ARE THE TANK NOZZLES? As there are gas stations, those cars have to be fueled with something.. It ain't air for sure.. - Repetitive gameplay (like really repetitive.. Assassins Cree* Style) - 'Open World' is heavily restricted (can't plow through bushes, MANY buildings have only 1 or 2 entrances/exits, main gates to facilities aren't accessible by foot, but when you ram a car through, you got yourself a new entrance) - Lifeless surrounding AI - Stupid AI in general (1.) it's more fun to rush through your missions with a knife, the AI won't notice you anyway :D 2.) in bars for example, in which only white ppl are allowed, just sneak to the barman, knock him out and steal his money.. The guests are A: not even slightly interested in the fact that a black man knocked out the barman or B: just stand up, scream and try calling the police)   I really feel sorry for all the guys and girls who pre-ordered this half baked console port, as there are just so many things wrong with this game, I think they won't be able to fix. Still, I payed much money, so I will complete the game + DLC at some point, but I regret it in any way.  If I would be a developer, I wouldn't be happy with this product I made..  Can't recommend, sadly
10416	At the time of writing this review, I simply cannot recommend the game.  Terrible technical issues, a framerate stuck hovering between 30 and 40, disappearing textures, physics bugs, and more. The story isn't worth sticking with the nonsense that is this game's technical failure on almost every level.
10417	+ Neat cutscenes + Soundtrack + Shooting mechanics are okay, but the ridiculous easiness of 'whistle + silent takedowns' almost makes that a non-issue  - Graphics: pathetic draw distance, night-time missions, low-res textures, everything is very much 2012 - Physics, or rather lack of it - Car damage: generic, lacking any kind of appeal. Expecting Mafia I level of destruction? Nope, think NFS. - Driving feels very off, cars are basically undistiguishable from each other - Big sandbox; very dull world. Copy-pasted building interiors are supposed to add to the experience, but grow old very fast. NPC's are obsessed with racial issues. I'd venture to say that the universally lambasted Watch_Dogs fared far better in regards of creating a living breathing game world: not because it was so good, it was that much better. Yes, they actually butchered the late 60's America to death. This is not GTA: London 1969 3D. Euro Truck Driver's world got heaps more personality than this trainwreck. - Grotesquely Evil White People.  A technologically backwards and soulless take on a once-great franchise. GTA V has been out for 3 years, and this doesn't come close in any regard whatsoever. Not necessarily 'refund level' disappointing, but very disappointing nonetheless.  The 'in-your-face', obnoxious pre-game disclaimer, doesn't add to the experience either, to say the very least. I don't like my mediocre $60 games coming with the head writer, Haden Blackman's, take on racial issues, or rather any politicking whatsoever.  There's Twitter and there are supposedly AAA games. No need to intertwine the two.  Especially so when the end-result is basically a slightly polished turd.
10418	30 FPS cap aside the graphics in general are awful, view distance is terrible (cars pop up so close you canât avoid hitting them if you are driving fast), the city in the distance looks blurry, textures are awful and look obviously up scaled. Iâm playing at 1440p on an NVidia 980 and 4790k @4.66. Everything maxed out, didnât notice any frame drops. The game would look good if they released it 5 years ago.  The AI is incredibly dumb, can sneak up on them by walking up to them from any angle practically, shooting sections so far are basically galleries of dumb AI, definitely quantity over quality. Bit in the prologue where you have to get to a boss, and it just keeps spewing unlimited AI unless you advance forward.  In less than 2 hours the game has crashed to desktop twice, and froze once requiring an Alt+F4, a further time I got to an objective and it didnât trigger the next cut scene, so had to restart the game, as it hadnât saved my progress I had to replay the previous 10 minutes. The one saving grace is the story, and cut scenes especially are very well detailed, with fantastic animations and voice acting, just a shame the rest of the game isnât rendered to the same quality.   Iâve played 115 minutes and just finished the prologue, going to refund now on steam and buy it from a key reseller once it's patched a bit, devâs donât deserve much for putting this standard of game out.
10419	Really bad Port!  -30FPs lock, dropping down to 27-29 while driving. -Blurry text and textures. -Before starting the game, you have a choice to turn on auto Aim. -You can only set the Graphics settings in the launcher and after the long intro cutscenes. No options menu in the main Title menu. -There are sound glitches when setting your audio to a higher sample rate. -Bad mouse smoothing in menu, but quite decent in game. -There is an FOV option but increasing it somehow decrease input text size.  I'm really hyped for this game but they sabotaged the PC version (maybe gave us a beta build or something). Can't play for more than 2 minutes with the mouse and keyboard as it gives me migraine. They should have delayed the PC version when they clearly know it's not ready yet. Feels like playing afully priced Early Access game with Season Pass and micro DLC's.    
10420	Game feels like a downgrade from Mafia II  Pros:    Cutscenes facial detail is really good    New weapon mechanic feels good.    References towards Mafia II and events.    Map is well designed    Good voice acting    Story is ok    Spoiler:   Joe's alive?!     Cons:    Police AI, unlike it's predecessor the cops are just dumb, no level system(stars) and no realism like the last game(robbery/speeding ect.)    Where's the customization? Garages, clothing stores, ect?    To many characters = not caring for them. Should've focused more on the Father &amp; Donovan. I didn't feel emotionally connected to the decisions I made in this game like I had before(Mafia II)    Repetitive, doing the same thing over and over again for each territory = boredom.    Dumb settings. Opening the menu to decide for Lethal vs Non Lethal and FPS selection is probably the dumbest â¥â¥â¥â¥ I've seen in a long time.    Textures/Looks. The game looks like trash 90% of the time, the textures looked stretched and unnatural, except for in cut scenes.    Limited detail, unlike Mafia II, this game is just the game and that's it, there's no small details like eating, getting gas, or interacting with anything.    Limited car selection.    Game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ across the board, regardless of setting most users don't average above 45 fps.   Conclusion: This game had so much potential but in the end failed. It's repetitive and has a very limited replay ability because of it.   Don't buy this game, just go replay Mafia II. This game is a downgrade.
10421	Ignoring the fact that this once had a 30fps lock on it at launch. The game still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. Very poor port from devs. Only getting about 45fps on a 1070 at medium settings at 1080p. And even with everything turned off and on the lowest settings it cannot reach the desired 60fps constantly.   Graphics are a big downside to most people but i couldn't care as long as other major things like draw distance are fixed first.  Considering the massive â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥torm that the pc community give developers when the release sub par ports you would think that developer would try to lift their game and actually produce a good pc port for once. But so far it looks like doing the right thing is just too hard now days.  Sad to see the only game i was looking forward to this year be another game that wont be ready until another 6 months of patches.  Edit: Game cannot run for more thant 10-20 mins without crashing for me. Performance wise i have changed settings everywhere possible and i get 60 fps when there is nothing/no one around. But as soon as i get into town im lucky to keep a solid 40 fps.
10422	GAME CRASH, seriously?? slower than mafia2 and crash? ==== Updated - Found more bugs - Target mark is missing on map and u have to restart the game, happened once - Car driving AI is buggy, they drive like crazy sometime even cop's cars - Background Music was broken, once. - Jacket dances itself sometime - Car bump into (literally) a house for no reason, once - Traffic jammed itself, sometime - Cant turn on the car engine, unless u re-enter the car, once. - Real life navigation system is more reliable than the one in game, it direct me to drive through a bridge then ask me to do u-turn in the middle.  For the gameplay Maybe too soon to say, reverse story telling is kind of anonying.  Updated #2: After 6 hours gameplay kind of boring now. Driving experience and FPS are not as good as mafia1~2 or even GTA and i just get around 2x~3x FPS in gameplay after removed the FPS limit. I used to enjoy driving with my xbox analog controller, but not much fun with this title, not sure it's FPS, the AI, or the physic.    The in-game Menu is not user friendly, the scrolling is so anonlying, why make it complicated while it need to be simple and functional. Accidentally set a destination all the time on map page. Once u set a wrong destination, and u need to figure out how to set back the mission destination. There is no much details in the map... just road, sections, mission target..   And I can find more bugs than fun in this game. HIGHLY RECOMMAND to wait, for bug fixing, for sale, for mafia 4...  === Suggestion to hanger &amp; 2k If the game is not ready, just push back the release date. There is no reason to destory this title by catching up the stupid project timeline. As fans, money is ready for the game, you are the one who refused to take it.  It didn't match the quality of mafia series, more like watch dog with ton of bugs. To be honest, as a software engineer, with that amount of bugs, very likely they did it so wrong at the beginning. With that fundation, I doubt they can fix it (but not re-do the whole thing) without sacrifice anything, like performance (or they already did).   https://youtu.be/6KUVeGtJHfg    https://youtu.be/pReSEgmj5bU 
10423	Pains me to say this, I know the game is locked at 30FPS, that is not my main issue, the issue is that the game does hold at 30 but it stutters, it stutters badly, I do not know if it is because I have a 144hz monitor and I am noticing it more, its not playable in this state for me, such a shame. The game graphics are ok, not 2016 worthy and here's another kicker, it seems upscaled from 720p which could be the blur everyone is reporting, people are asking for an AA option, but realistically only a texture pack is going to fix it.  This is clearly a game for consoles that has been ported at the last min for PC with no love, care or attention, truly shocking, Hanger 13 should be ashamed of themselves right now, I would...  UPDATE 09 10 2016: (I will be fair to the game and update my review as development continues) They have now unlocked the FPS, even with my system I can only reach around 60 fps drops to 50 in parts which is fine, further more by capping at 60 with vsync on all the stuttering I experienced at 30fps has gone, not perfect but not as bad. I will not continue with the campaign at 720p upscaled graphics lol...   i7 5960x / Titan X (2) Maxwel / 64gDDR4 / Win 10 64bit
10424	I really like the main character and the people associated with him. I love the setting (even the bayou lol). The soundtrack is pretty damn good (especially for a bunch of songs i've never heard before). But the mandatory side activities get dull after the 2nd district you take over, turning the awesome setting/characters into a pretty boring experience. The story missions are fun and well done imo. The first major person you take out was in a pretty interesting place that i enjoyed very much. Also... this game just isn't optimized very well at all... there is barely any difference between medium and high. With a 970 and FX-8350 i can't even get the game to run at 60fps/1080p on medium, but the rec specs has a 780 listed -_-. They tackled a touchy subject, had the perfect setting/cast of characters but fell very short on the gameplay side of things. I will keep playing because it was a gift along with the season pass from gmg. But i'd suggest waiting for a huge sale or just avoid entirely. Either way, you won't miss much. Maybe Hangar 13 will polish their next game some more before releasing it.  **UPDATE**  After finishing this game, i must say that John Donovan is officially my favorite video game character of all time. The dude is the pure, uncut definition of awesome. If he gets his own game, I'll buy it just for his character.
10425	  First I want to clear I buy the game from cd keys and that's why is shown for free   The developers requested feedback, here is some problems that must be fixed on the pc.  First there is some very strange blur filter on the pc version. If I lower the AA setting to low the game still have that blur. This filter must be toggle on or off and a sharpen option must be introduced, like in the witcher 3 and deus ex mankind divided. The textures in the game especially on the environment are very low res and for the pc high textures option is needed the current looks like are made for 720p.  Ui scaling is also a must. The ability to switch settings ingame not only from the launcher. Things like tessellation and nvidia gameworks will be a plus. Personally I think the pc version was handle very poorly. It's sad because mafia was a PC francaise.Similar problems in 2016 are not aceptable in any AAA title. I watch the preview gameplay and I love what I saw. I pre order it an and the season pass. Now I'm very disappointed by the technical problems in this promising game.  My advice is wait until all the problems are fixed. The game have a lot of bugs and glitches like the lighting system, draw distance, textures and so on. I will not be surprised if the problems are fixed months after release like Arkham Knight. Until then wait for sale.  Current problems  - blurred overall picture (filter or AA solution)  - Very low res textures no option to switch to hi res version.  - 30 fps lock on pc (unacceptable)  - weather system and lighting dosent work corectly. (cloud shadows move extremely fast)  - physics and animation glitches  - Resolution problems abouve 1080p  - absence of UI scaling  Video samples of the problems   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g24KExuSBMk    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXNeDQ4bkGw   Very poor version I dont recomend in current state.
10426	This did not feel like a Mafia game to me...  Good story, I'll give them that, but that's basically where it ends. I literally kept killing the same guys over and over. There was hardly any challenge to the game, if you played the game stealthy. Just crouch behind something, whistle, and kill them when they are close. *YAWN*  Also, a lot of sidemissions are bugged. * Steel a boat ---&gt; No boat there. * Steal the truck ---&gt; No truck there.  Honestly, the bugs I can deal with. Let's face it, almost every game has bugs, but the overall experience I got from this game, is just really bad.  To me, this game was a complete let down.
10427	For a game I've been waiting for for 6 years, it's dreadful - There was close to 0 storyline as most of it is revealed with the whole game following a repetitive line of missions with the odd mission which isn't 'Take down the racket boss'. Never the less I played the game through because it had the title 'Mafia 3' when the game isn't even come close to being worthy of being called that.
10428	I'm going to talk about the storymode and its flaws now: The only thing that holds a story in this game are the cutscenes which can be seen as completely irrelivant to the gameplay, let me explain. So i ignored the fact that they gave us, the pc people a unfinished port. My love for Mafia 2 brought me in a state of disbelieve. Ignoring the glitches and half-baked framerate I went in the game just to get that feeling of rising to the top and feeling like a true mob boss. But the way the missions take place leave so much to be desired. In the main AND side missions you are doing the same ffing thing over and over and over again without the feeling of progress.  I have 12 hours on record and I don't know how, I don't feel like I have achieved anything. The first few hours were amazing but the rest is starting to feel like a waste of time. Now I don't know how far I am in the story but I do know that I have lost interest in driving from point A to B and kill a bunch of people, then driving back to point A to tell them I succeeded in killing a bunch of people. This game made me wish for a quick travel option..  Am I really the boss in this game or am I still a puppet with strings being played?  Haven't we learned from far cry 4 that the hero is often just a slave to the side characters? How (in)appropriate for this game, atleast we got to shoot them kkk members so it's worth am I right?  Why can't I buy clothes? Oh you are going to add 'costumes' in a later patch? Which you probably have to acces via the start menu just like switching between lethal an non lethal kills eh?  Why can't I go to a car dealer and buy cars? I get a set of cars picked for me? For free? Jolly good, such choice.  Why don't the police mind me speeding? Do the police even give tickets? What is their use other then being just another gang. Why is the entire police system a downgrade from mafia 2?  Why are the lockpick mechanics a step down from mafia 2? I could see the freaking lock in that game, even opened cars that way. Now i just bash a window and jump in gta style.. is it cause I'm black?  What happend to the licenseplate system? Yo, that was cool. Why can't I buy a safehouse? All this money, well not really cause you run out of ammo and adrenaline shots so quick that you spend most of your money on it. Because you keep dying cause you can't stand waiting in a corner and whistling until the dumbass ai comes to get killed by you. I wanted to buy houses and fill my garage with cars. It makes the game more personal.  An ingredient to succes for games is putting the player and the main character in different scenario's, this keeps the player interested. Wolfenstein the new order is a great example of this. But even Mafia 2 did this, in the game you lived with your family, stayed with your friend, got a new appartement and stayed in jail. That's progression via different scenario's I expect to see from a open world game in 2016. It adds value and weight to the story you are moving through.  In mafia 3 tho, I don't feel like I'm the character that I am playing. It started of really good by putting me in a situation building up the story but in the next hour or so I've killed so many people that I've emotionaly become disconnected to him and his revenge story. He has one simple goal but decides to go unnecessarily overboard with his plan just like this review. It leaves no desire in getting sidetracked and forgetting about the main missions. Now I just want to do the main missions because I am hoping that there is atleast a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. I was hoping to play mafia 3 and not a serious version of Saints Row(xbox 360). The missions are repetitive and thus you will get bored of this game before you finish it.
10429	~ 4hrs in; Update: 25 hrs in, after first patch   Pros  - Good Story and Presentation (Soundtrack is on point, Interesting Characters, Voice Acting, good Cutscenes) - Keyboard + Mouse works perfectly (driving is still more fun with a controller) - car behaviour in 'Simulation' mode (lets you choose wether you want realism or a more arcade way of driving) - Gun fights (variety of Weapons, Gun behaviour, responsive and direct controls with mouse) - the city is crowded and feels 'alive'  Cons  - 30fps (???) Update: fixed with patch - I had 4 crashes so far (the game just goes back to desktop, no error message or anything; Update: no crashes since patch) - Physics of objects and bodies look clunky sometimes - Graphicglitches with lighting, also Characters have a weird greenish glow on skin and clothes (could be my graphic settings, I dont know) - bad performance optimization - Update: very repetitive mission design (story and optional missions) - Update: missing a lot of little details which we know from M1+M2 (look at the comparison videos on youtube) - absolutely horrible AI (mostly exposed when you choose the stealth approach) - engines sound more like modern V6/V8 rather than the old muscle cars - I dont like the UI  All in all its a good game, but the technical issues are annoying. The PC port feels rushed and unfinished and shouldn't have been released like that. Update: After the first patch and more hrs of gameplay, its still a thumbs down. I dont really mind the weird graphic glitches or the blurryness or the horrible textures or how bad this game is running on somewhat good PCs. What really kills it for me is the mission design and the lack of those little details which I loved in Mafia 1 and Mafia 2. Why would you remove the speedlimiter? Why do cops not care when you pass them with 200km/h? Why do they shoot on sight, instead of arresting you, giving you a ticket? And the list goes on and on.... At least it was not 60â¬ like some other crappy games.
10430	Pros:  - Nice story - Seemless animations for Lincoln - Satisfying gunplay - Absolute tip top music  Cons:  - Struggles to hit 60 when cars are on screen on a 980ti - graphical downgrade - 512 x 512 upscaled textures - graphical bugs out the wazoo - launcher doesn't remember the settings you told it to use - no msaa - forced fxaa - can't disable fxaa it in control panel because the launcher doesn't remember you set it to low - no cocking animation for the model 1887 between shots - intro stops after 2 hour mark because money - dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ ai that can't see a bumbling 6'4' man in a clunky jacket 5 feet infront of their face all because he's pushed v to hunch over
10431	Stutters like mad while driving on lowest possible settings. PC - i5 3570k @ 4,2 GHZ, GTX 970, 16 GB Ram. 35-50 fps while driving, sometimes 60 on foot but there's a lot of frame pacing issues and stuttering. Blurry graphics, low resolution textures, repetitive missions structure, lots of bugs, extremely dumb AI.
10432	Here we go, my first review ever.  I were superhyped about Mafia 3. I've played the first and secod countless of hours and enjoyed almost every minute of them. Sadly, the third did not meet my expectations. Not at all. Not even close  Though the story and cut scenes are very good it does not compensate the extremely bad game. This is nothing like Mafia or Mafia 2. This is some kind of gta remake in the sixties. All you do is kill a lot of people whitout any meaning.  The game is so poorly optimized so it will most certenailly lag or in other ways not work.  The mission was fun, maybe once or twice. The 38th time you did it, not so much. In Mafia 2 there were a lot of different missions, like robbing a place with stamps and infiltrating a hotel. This was just the same two or three missions all the time.   I cannot recomend this game to anyone, sadly. I love the first two game so much. Besides Ocarina of time, I would say that Mafia 2 is my absolute favourite game. So if you liked Mafia 2, do not buy this game. You'll get dissapointed.   Please bring 2k czech back for the next game.
10433	Quality of this game is like early access.
10434	I loved mafia II. I realy wanted this game to be as good. after taking all 3 first bosses i can't say it is... it's not a bad game, but it's not a AAA game either on 2016.   soundtruck is amazing,the art concept also nice,realy it's nice. the most thrriling part is the driving handlling, while listning to the guitars and flyin over the biutyfull bayou scenery. but thats about it.   the game is like BorderLands, go kill go fetch. and it's all repetitive, and get real easy to kill enemis stealth or if you choose to go guns blazing all the same. but it's not the worst game. it's got a story line. only problem is, that the story is as hard as the story of DoubleDragon. all family members are killed, revenge. the grafics are quite pour, yet 970 oc cant work on 60 fps, its struggel to stay above 40 on medium, and realy for no reason, for a game that looks like last gen. we've seen a lot beter looking games like GTA V ,witcher 3 ,mad max ,assassin creed paris and london, who worked perfectly fine on high or super high on 60 fps. it's optimise poorly. the port is as bad for pc. game play is a bit fun, in the first repits. but if i could take back time i would have paid 39 on releas not a peny more. probably wait for 50% even.  forgot to add  the pointles 'are we cool' and 'seems simpel enough' objectives in the bayou are broken. send me to empty places where at first was what suppose to be.
10435	I mistook the story missions for side missions...
10436	gtx 1080, i5-4690k even with the FORCED 30fps cap the game still stutters and performs terribly.   Graphic settings lead a lot to be desired.   *Horrible bluring, probably some caused by FXAA which cannot be turned off beleive it or not. But most bluring comes from depth of field setting which can be turned off thank god. It blurs everything in the distance constantly.  *some blury textures, and some reasonable textures. but obvious inconsistency. *30 fps cap that doesnt even frame pace to 30 fps properly.  *no borderless window option  *launcher graphic settings do not apply to game once loaded  And yes, this does massively affect the gameplay and enjoyment level. So pople who say its all about story, etc, are missing the point about good art, and how good art/performance/tech can increase immersion and impress upon people.   THIS FEELS LIKE RUSHED TECH. THE MAFIA 2 ENGINE PERFORMED BETTER THAN THIS NEW ENGINE THEY BUILT
10437	Just to start off , i'm a big Mafia fan and this game was very dissapointing for me .  Here we go  Edit:I just tried to finish the game but i can't ,it's really boring because of these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ repetitive missions.   Pros:  -The story is great -Level-Design is great -Sountrack is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great  -The voice-acting is great  -The facial animation are perfect  -The combat was inproved in some ways (and downgraded ...). -The collectives are great (if you know what i mean ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) .  Now we get in to the dissaponting part   really dissapointing  .  Cons: -Bad optimized (can't even hit 60 fps with my gtx 980). -Great future removed from the other games (i will link some videos to let you guys see). -Very repetitive missions (and you have to complete them to get further in to the story). -Very ugly textures and effects (there are some fixes online to make them look better). -Alot of bugs (on the level of bethesda games...). -Dumb AI  -Enemies look almost identical (i mean wtf , it's 2016 ...).  Here are the videos   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=getp6QCcdqg    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA   Buy it when it's on sell if you really want it if not just stay away from it .  Edit:Some futures were restored (car customization and outfits).  6/10
10438	  Still Not There Yet
10439	EDIT: So the fps unlocking patch has been released and behold the game can't run stable 60 fps on a 1080 GTX even, it fluctuates between 40-58 fps using the 60 fps limit and G-Sync seems to be handling it quite well. However there's till frame timing issues every now and then that cause major stuttering even if it's running at around 50 fps.  Game has three major technical issues that makes it very hard to recommend this game to anyone who has issues graphical issues.  1. 30 FPS lock, controls are very sluggish and it basically feels like playing on a console when you try to aim with the mouse, it's actually preferable to play with a controller at all times for me right now at least.  2. The lightning in the game has some very bad issues. First of all light sources have a very low view distance keep popping in. Secondly shadows seem to render on and off just by turning the camera a bit back and forth without moving yourself on certain objects.  3. THE BLUR... everything looks like someone smudged it with some acid or something, like it isn't enough that the textures look a blurry mess from the start they decide to blur it and then blur it some more! NOTE: It's mostly the anti aliasing technique (FXAA) causing this, setting it to low actually improves the graphics as long as your resolution is high enough to compensate the jaggies.  Other bugs would include some very strange physics in the game with ragdolls bouncing around as well as objects not rendering at all (Had a bunch floating stuff that I could walk into in a garage only to suddenly spawn a table underneath when I entered the car). Had a single CTD crash just as loading screen started about 1 hour into the game but then no problems for the rest of my session. Seen the exact same rendering and CTD issue on some streamers so it's a game issue.  The good part so far is that voices, lip syncing and close up models look good and the story has also been quite intriguing and fun. However the missions themselves are starting to feel very repetitive.  Will update the review as I go along but seriously why would you go some much backwards from Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1 from a technical aspect....
10440	Let's start by saying the game in gameplay and story aspects feels great, the story is very intriguing and it is really motivating. Basically, the concept of the game is similar to that of The Godfather 2, where you hurt gangs by taking their business and make them yours, only thing there's a bigger goal in this story. The protagonist is damn strong and i like him since he seems always confident about his purpose. The combat is great, the mechanics and finishers are badass, corpses remain with bloodshed and do not disappear, blood is splattered against wall, the animations of how enemies react by being shot are similar to GTA V. That being said, the game is trash in perfomance and graphics, it is very hardware demanding for its mediocre graphics, no wonder they locked it at 30fps. I've got a 1080 and i can barely maintain solid 60fps in open areas at 1080p &amp; Ultra, if the game was nice looking i could deal with this, but it is really not. The fact that people have had to install optional graphical settings like ENB, Sweet FX and reshade is embarrassing for a fresh released AAA. I'd recommend everyone to wait, because i really want to enjoy this game, but not in its actual state. I'll be adquiring a Titan X Pascal in a month i will update this review upon completion of the game asuming it's been patched significantly.  Specs:  GPU: ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 8GB ROG STRIX OC  CPU: I7 6700K OC 4.5Ghz DRAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4-3200 Memory MOBO: MSI Z170A GAMING PRO CARBON SSD: Samsung 850 EVO - 1TB
10441	I dont recommend at all!  reasons:  Graphical issues:    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776343050    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776346702    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776346792    Im having a problem of CTD every 30 mins or so, my latest CTD was me just driving around  sound fx cutting out  you got convertables but cant put the top down or up  no damage on cars... at all and im using sim style driving  motion blur keeps turning back on  no speed limiter! does 2k know how annoying it is to keep tapping W when driving past the cops? (also there are no road signs i have seen for the speed limit! what are the speed limits!?)   no glass smashing sound when breaking into cars just a thud  not a lot to do right now other than doing story missions (the story is great so far)  Cant turn the mirror off in the car  the enter vehicle sign stays on for me when entering vehicle in passanger side  No NPC slider (variety or density) or traffic slider for density, which it needs as the whole city seems dead   Oh and having to go into the options to switch between non-lethal and lethal takedowns is a tedious thing to do  30fps &amp; a tiny bit worse graphics than mafia2 (characters hair) are a minor for me right now with these problems im having,  it needs an update fast for extra things to do and optimisation then i will update this review and more than likely change it to a yes i can recommend  *edit*  Despite updates the game still CTDs.  lighting and multiple bugs have not been fixed.  No point in changing the settings before you launch the game as they dont change in game so you'll have to do it from the options menu again.  All the missions are repetative, i know all games are but when you have to repeat the same missions over and over again that isnt a quality game.  Here's the full game...  go here take this down or tail someone,  Kill or save?   come back to me,  kill this guy,   assign whoever,   kill the leader of the district  and repeat.  still nothing to do other than story missions  AI are the dumbest i have ever encountered in a game  it get really boring after an hour of play  Just wait for a sale or dont bother at all.
10442	If you're looking to play Mafia 3 because of Mafia 2, don't buy this game. Why? Because for each territory you about to take-over there are plenty of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ side-quests in it. And you basically do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again for like 15-20 hours? And not just that it took me less than 30 hours just to finish the whole game without any side-quests. Plus you can't even customize your appearance or your cars (just yet). And in order to make the game more fun to play you have to buy the season pass which include 3 more missions, if only you have $20 extra to add in for your game or buy it with $30 extra if you already buy the game. Afterall I really don't recommend the game, And Mafia 3 really disappointed me. It gave me a feeling of Watch Dog game.  PS: The only part that's satisfy me is what happen to Joe.
10443	One month after the release, the game is still poorly optimized for PC. No new info if this is ever going to be fixed.
10444	tl;dr 6/10 buy but when discounted.  +combat system + stealth +driving physics +soundtrack +storyline +ending + joe resolution  - most of story line are repetetive 'secondary-like' quests - glitchy wierd outdated graphics /draw distance fog and else - crash physics - glitches and bugs  Might give it a thumbs up if it wasnt in a Mafia series, did not live up to the name.
10445	grindy and repetitive, fun for a few hours, then its boring. pretty average graphics too, AI are dumb as dumb can be.
10446	Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this game. Let's just forget that they released the game locked at 30fps....low blow to the pc community. After they unlocked the framerate to 60, you could see even more that the game was really badly optimized. It is sometimes glitchy and I was lucky enough to never encounter any lighting issues or clip issues or gamebreaking bugs/crashes.  That said, the game actually began as a great game. Graphically is nothing special but also nothing too bad. I really enjoyed the game in the beginning, many things reminded me of the old dear first Mafia rather than the second one (which I also liked by the way). The driving was great and shooting was also a very nice feeling. Narration started very interesting and the story began like it had a lot to offer, everything was very promising. Sadly after a few hours you notice that all you have to do are repetitive tasks: damage this racket, kill this guy, steal this truck. Those are not even side missions: you need to complete these tasks to progress in the 'main' story. Which revealed itself to be no real story at all. I was not able to finish the game because of all this nonsense. I doubt the ending would be a lightbringer. I progressed to what looks to be 75% of the main story (I checked a walkthrough with a mission list) and really can't force myself to finish it.  In a way it behaves like a Just Cause game....damage this, damage that, kill bad guys in the meantime, go around with the car etc etc.....but Just Cause has a reason to exist because it focuses exactly on that, and it does it well. Also every Just Cause had good graphics to begin with. This Mafia has no real purpose, no real identity or story, and on top of that there are all the various glitches/framerate drops and average graphics. I preordered it thinking that being 2K the publisher, it could not be THAT bad (they always released good games). Also I liked Mafia 2, it obviously it was not as good as the first Mafia, but I thought this third one would have been more or less on the same level with Mafia 2. Nope, not the case.
10447	Mafia 3 has crashed on me multiple times , it's good that they unlocked the FPS controlls and I have unlimited but after 5 hours of game time I have exited my game only too come back and my save file was completley corrupted and wanted me too start from the begining again.  I am running this on my Alienware 15 and what I first thought was cool ( My key board flashing red and blue when I am being chased by the police) it randomly decided too freak out and flash like crazy in a multitude of colours and was causing me a mini freak out and I had too restart my computer .   there's a ton of other amusing glitches , ( charcters repeating 2 lines of dialog in a panic, people flying back with one pistol shot, random cars being on their side blocking the road , mirrors acting like fun house mirrors that are paused) Etc   The game is clearly a broken mess, and it's hard to reccomend with such an intresting and exciting story which I now have too repeat ...  wait for this game too go on sale or be fixed but that's unlikely but save your money for now, I was sadly bought into the hype by playing the previous 2 installments hoping this would be the best and It's clearly the worst quality wise.  Update: I have had my progress wiped 3 times now by corrupt saves past the point of talking too the Voice. IT IS BROKEN!
10448	Flop of the year. stay away. bad bad bad. it's 2000 not 2016 in terms of gameplay and graphics.  My money is lost. save yours.
10449	  butchered and downgraded version of Mafia 2, shouldn't be called Mafia game really   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA 
10450	This feel like a poor wananbe GTA to be honest, loved both Mafia 1 and 2 because it had some small features who stod out and made them special.  Few things that i loved about mafia games that are missing in this: 1: Simulation mode for cars, for added difficulty. The simulation mode in Mafia 3 is arcade at best. impossible to loose control of the car.  2: Cops who care about the public safety, here they dont care if you drive 120 mph across red light in opposide side of the road. 3: Shops who serve a purpose, in mafia 1 and 2 you could get food, clothes, upgrades in shops. in Mafia 3 they are empty husk who serve no purpose.  GFX in this game looks ok from a distance, but once you get closer it looks like they stopped development before the final finish. So far the only thing i like about the game is that it is honest to history and dont try and cover up rasicm, and actualy use it to its advantage.  So far i am far from impressed and quite disapointed  Edit October 8, 11:00 BST  Cargo: Cargo crates are welted, glued and bolted to the chassis of the car/truck you drive, so when transporting moonshine or weed there is no chance of damage the good like in Mafie 1 and 2, such a shame that they cut this feature too.  A.I. : or lack of it, npc dont reach to firefight 5-10 meters from them if there is a small garden wodden fence in the way, at one point i shot 3 npc enemy on enemy territory, and 10 meters away there where another 3 enemies who kept talking and havent heard the gun shots.  Copy and paste: Starting to see the same building and building layout over and over again, they have not even bothered to change the colours on walls or anything to make them look even a tiny bit different.  Final edit October 10, 11:00 BST  Finaly completed the game and can give a final review, reason for amount of hours is lots of time afk in game.  Found a few more things that realy got to annoy me the more time i spend in the game.  1. Repedative: Do the same missions over and over again, attack a certain building in a area to lure out the leader of the area only to have to go back to exact same building after you done enough damage to lure him out, becomes realy repedative.  2. Encrease area value: When taking over a area you can increase the area value a bit by doing a side mission, this could be steal weed, moonshine or a truck. But once the area is at max, you still get the side mission icons on the map, but the area is empty and you cant do any thing there. Realy annoying that you are told you can do a mission that you cannot do because your 'racket' value is at max.  3. Cops: Cops serve no real purpose in the game other than to annoy you and make A.I. look stupid. Killed of most of the guest in a dinner and cops where called, they never went to the dinner i stod outside off and gave up the seach, there was also 3 cops standing 30-50 meters away from diner but they could not be bothered to go there.  They dont care about you breaking every single traffic rule, and if a mobster starts shooting at you and you dont draw your weapon but run and hide, the cops will start hunting you too, but will not care about the mobster who is unloading his tommygun in your general direction no matter what he hit.   4. GFX: running at max everything 1920*1080, npc looks so bad when you get close to them, hair looks like plastic wigs, mirrors was better in the game Duke nukem from 1991. cutscenes looks almost same quality as Mafia 2.   Final Vedict:  If you like Mafia 1 and 2, then dont get this game because it is not a mafia game in my mind, they have left out all the things that made mafia 1 and 2 stand out from games like GTA or Saints Row. And even left out things that are/was standard in Mafia 2/ GTA or Saints Row, like minor customizing. If you want a open world game then get GTA 4 or 5, they are far better than this, and offer much more things to do, and are superior to this game in every way. And that is a real shame, since i love mafia 1 and 2.
10451	Refunded, as the game doesn't run at stable 60 fps on the following PC even with all settings at lowest@1080p:  i5 4670k 4.6ghz gtx 970 1.5ghz/8ghz 16gb ddr3 2400mhz Samsung 840 pro 256gb SSD win10 64  Don't bother with the game unless you can handle FPS drops below 60fps, don't mind 30fps lock, or have an i7 5xxx/6xxx and a gtx1060 or better GPU for stable 60fps@1080p. as for 1440p, not even a gtx1080 can max it out at stable 60fps.  It's also worth noting that the devs have entered the Soonâ¢ mode when it comes to patching the game.  Updated with a video so you can see for yourself how it behaves in a cpu limited area.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omZv7mkmaYI&amp;feature=youtu.be    On the other hand, if you don't mind sub 60 fps, the game feels much smoother once you fully shift into GPU limited territory, for example, at max settings. The downside is, if you game at 60 fps all the time, you might feel nausea until your brain adapts to lower framerate.   https://youtu.be/hmGc5rKBpbE 
10452	I was really looking forward to this game, because Mafia 2 was one of my favorite games the year it was released. But Mafia 3, oh man.. I'll go over the positives and the negatives.  + Game looks really good sometimes + Story is somewhat interesting + Some main missions are really cool  - The game doesn't run that well (I got a GTX 1080, I expect a solid 60 fps at 1440p, and I don't get it). - It doesn't feel like a Mafia game, it feels like a GTA clone in the 1960's - 1970's. - Repetetive side missions, even the main missions.  - Sometimes the game looks really bad, the skyboxes, draw distance look like â¥â¥â¥â¥ most of the time.   I could recommend this game for 29.99 or 34.99, not for 49.99 though.
10453	Blatant console port.  comes with purple haze setting  http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/251464760163000824/52D606B9BB619DFF0BD16599E9BBFC17C7A2E283/?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;output-format=jpeg&amp;output-quality=95&amp;fit=inside|2048:857&amp;composite-to%3D%2A%2C%2A%7C2048%3A857&amp;background-color=black   Shocking draw distances.  Graphics are a let down.  You can set screen size, but it doesn't account properly for ultra wide monitors, despite supporting the resolution - see this screenshot  http://steamcommunity.com/id/age_uk/screenshots/?appid=360430   The menu interface is broken when the game loads and mostly unusable.Which makes for a poor experience right from the word go.   There are some upsides though. Driving mechanics are enjoyable. Shooting people leads to them falling down and wailing in pain and misery on the floor, writhing around. This adds to the immersion and makes it feel more brutal when you pop over to finish them off.   The characters and the acting is fairly good. I think once it's patched a bit more it'll improve vastly. Just a shame the shambles was released like this in the first place.
10454	Pros: + great storyline and great characters + many decisions on how to take control of the city + attention to story details + nice landscapes  Cons: - many bugs: mission related and not (felt in the river and had to swim for 10 minutes to get out of there although the slope was ok for that) - after some time it gets repetitive although the bosses businesses are diverse - AI dumb: make some noise outside of a big building, and a guy from the first floor walks for 1 minute directly to you - AI very dumb: sometimes they will come one by one at you even though they are really far away - Escape police in car way to easy - no multiplayer / ko-op - the car chases are made of adamantium: not a scratch after a full frontal crash  Summary:  For the current price i don't recommend it, although i loved Mafia 2 a lot and was looking forward to this game. Wait for a Sale for it. 
10455	I wanted to like this game, I really did.   Mafia II, while having some issues was a solid game, it lacked enough side activities to truly be considered an Open World game in my option, but the story left you wanting to play more, to see new cars as time ticked by, and try different tactics to siege a base, or objective.  Mafia III is just...dull. It doesn't know what it wwants to be, having gone with an open world feel ,but having lifeless side activities. Go to X, steal this truck. Go to X, steal this boat, go to X, steal the pick up. This would be somewaht forgivable, if the main uests were more exciting, but they are unfortuantly not.  Main quests are a hamster wheel of repeated tasks. Kill 2 smaller bosses after completing enough side quests to reveal the main boss of the area, kill the main boss in a linear attack vector so that we can set up a show piece.  In the current format I cannot honestly reccomend this game, you are better off picking up GTA, or Saints Row as both have more character, and are better Open worlds depending on your choice of super campyness, or somewaht more realistic story lines.
10456	I will reconsider changing this review if the supposed weekend patch sorts these issues out.  Even if I may not have the most high-end system, I should be somewhere in the middle of the minmum and recommend requirements for this game, but the game looks awful at the lowest settings and runs horrible for something to looks so bad. The game is also locked to 30 FPS and the settings are subpar for a PC-game. The fact that you cant even use a mouse is the menu says alot about the console port that this is.  And even if I may not have been completely sober when buying it, I made the mistake of getting somewhat hyped for this title and preordered it as a result, even going off work a bit early in the hopes of playing it. The lack of review copies and other independet previews should show that the developers or atleast the publisher knew full well what they were doing and it seems really strange to announce that a patch that will fix FPS and settings issues will be released a few days after the actual release, although we will see how this actually works out.  Hopefully upcoming updates fix these inherrent issues, but if not I will refund it and would not recommend to anyone unless they fix it.  Update after the weekend patch: While it runs better it's far from optimal and still feels like a rather half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port in many aspects, and after playing it for a bit I reached the conclusion that this was really not for me.  So I ended up refunding it after all, may buy it at a cheaper price in the future depending on the situation. The first part of the review will remain as it is important to remember how much they messed up the initial launch.
10457	I had previously put a positive review for this game, however after playing the game further it has become quite clear that the missions are completely boring and unoriginal. Most of them follow the formula of 'go to marker - kill guy / destroy stuff - repeat - ok now go back to the original marker and kill guy'.  I've also changed my mind because the patch that was supposed to address the 30fps lock is useless. This game is an unoptimised mess and even with the patch I barely push past 30fps. In fact, in the Bayou I struggle to get 20fps! This is despite the fact that the graphics are nowhere near what should be considered demanding on a system.  To top it all off, this game is a buggy mess. The game constantly crashes. The latest crash happened during a cutscene at the end of a story mission. I rebooted the game and the checkpoint takes me to the end of the mission, as if the cutscene had just ended, however the objective still says I need to complete the mission. If I die, it says mission failed. I can't continue the game and I can't reload a past save because hey, who needs saves when you auto checkpoints right guys?  I have now lost my temper with this game and uninstalled it.
10458	Mafia II looked way better, and played way better. This is just 2k embarrassing themselves.  Release a HD patch or something, holy crackers the game just looks horrible and crashes all the time  Update: 6 hours in and the game is incredibly repetitive.  'Kill this guy, so you can kill this guy, so you can kill that other guy'  The story seems alright but i can't look past just how horrible everything else is. I feel robbed.  Will play more just cause i can't refund it, but i don't see any light in the end of this tunnel so far
10459	I don't usually write reviews, but this time I genuinely want to express my thoughts:  THIS GAME IS BAD!   As you probably know, there is a 30FPS lock (which according to Mafia III official page, will be fixed soon), gameplay feels wonky (shooting is okay), the AI probably has inner monologue which would explain some funny reaction delays and decisions, and the game looks and feels outdated... Like  last-gen  outdated.  If you really want this game, check the reviews to see if anything was fixed. In this state, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.   EDIT:  Forgot to mention the odd traffic. As I was driving around, I noticed some cars abruptly changing their paths, or driving in a zig-zag style. This happened with a cop car as well, which was going in the right direction, and all of a sudden it made a sharp 'jump' (it looked like the car re-spawned) and appeared 15 meters right in front of me. Needless to say, we crashed...  There also appear to be issues with lighting, where objects are improperly lit.  The only thing I liked in this game are those cutscenes that look like interviews. They are detailed and the facial animations are gorgeous.  This was my first and quite possibly the last pre-order, I'm glad Steam has a refund system in place. Thank you Valve!
10460	Is there an award for the worst game of the year?
10461	I'm not even going to comment on the obvious optimization problems with the game, my focus is the story. It appears the good people at 2K decided to go political, but not in any kind smart meaningful way. Basically, think of every negative 60s southern white stereotype then magnify it by 100. In the Mafia III world, all whites use N every other word and if you weren't a crooked cop involved in a conspiracy to keep the Black man down, you were an overalls wearing, black woman â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, moonshine swilling hillbilly. I found myself actually laughing during the Dixie gang missions because it reminded me so much of Redneck Rampage(not a good thing). And again having black people on street corners with their very in depth two line conversations about LBJ and Nixon is equally as laughable. 2K's attempt to tie Mafia III to any kind of serious vietnam/civil rights commentary is akin to a 'Jack the Ripper' game trying to make the Women's Suffrage movement a large part of the storyline. Let's not forget who we are here Mafia series, let's cut to the chase. This game glorifies and celebrates the Mafia. An organization which has infected arguably the highest levels of American government, corrupting and killing untold numbers over many decades. Like GTA, Saint's Row, and others, gamers check their brains and morality at the door while pretending to be thieving mass murderers. To even attempt such political commentary in a game like this brings 2K's taste and judgement into question. When it comes to history, stick to what you know, clothes, cars, guns, and nudie magazines. The shallow end of the pool is where you should be swimming 2K, don't stray from it.
10462	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776257037   Nutshell: So an arms dealer is upset that she was shutdown because police think black people will buy guns and shoot white people. The main character then proceeds to buy a gun from her and shoot white people. This is one very confused game.   Cons:  - Buggy in general  - Floating objects  - Lighting issues  - Clipping with objects  - NPCs that can be pulled through walls  - Story is a contradiction of itself and poorly presented.  - Plays exactly the same as every other open world game you have already played.     Pros:  + Soundtrack  + Runs smoothly for the most part (ignoring the FPS drama)     The game has been poorly written and it's hard to feel sympathy or understanding when the developer keeps undoing the points they think they are trying to make. In one scene they will try to show how poorly black people were spoken to with name calling. But then right after that, the black characters themselves will call other black characters 'N****R' and 'Coon-asses'  Another example is when a scene is set up to make the player feel sympathy for a poor woman 'Abused and used' by a horrible man that the character is required to kill, and then once again undoes the whole scene by later revealing that she was faking it all. Why? For what purpose?  The dev fails at trying to make a statement with the narrative by trying to play both sides. Don't try and garner sympathy and understanding for a character's plight when they themselves are a thief and mass murderer. Pick one and stick to it.   At the moment I couldn't recommend this game to anyone for either the gameplay or the story.   -------------------------- i7-4790K @ 4.00Ghz MSI GeForce GTX 980Ti Gaming 6GB 16GB ram ASRock Z97 Extreme6 Samsung 850 EVO Series 1TB SSD
10463	This is only a Mafia game by name, almost no other connection to Mafia 2. What a ripoff  In Mafia 2 you can go into car shops to customize everything from wheels to paint to the license plate. Go into clothing stores and buy different suits, and go to diners to eat and restore health. You have several different homes all with a garage where you can STORE YOUR CARS AND KEEP THEM FOR LATER. The characters are fleshed out and actually make you care about them. None of this is in Mafia 3  In Mafia 3 you play as a jarhead Vietnam vet that lives in the basement of a burnt-out bar for the entire game like a troll, wears the same jacket every day. You have a set of 6 cars (not counting the ones on the street) you can chose from that you can upgrade, you can't change paint/license plate/wheels though. The characters are laughable and you never develope any sort of connection to them the way you do in Mafia 2. And worst of all is the gameplay, it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. The entire game consists of: Receive mission from dude, Kill/Interrogate this dude, do it again, do it again, go back to original dude, kill boss, rinse, repeat. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, the only attachment to Mafia 2 is the fact that Vito is added as one of the side characters, and Leo Galante is referenced several times and makes an extremely brief appearence near the end of the game.   4.5/10, don't waste your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money on this.
10464	Steam should be held accountable for collusion with the developers.  Screens and videos do not match the game istelf.  Game is so poorly optimized, it will actually hurt your eyes. Worked at a steady 30fps last night, now I can only get 5fps.  Can I sue for punitive damages? I for one, am tired of games like this poorly polished console port being allowed on the Steam Store.
10465	AT LAUNCH:  VERY BAD Optimizations for PCs VERY BLURRY Graphics (with Motion Blur off) LOOKS 720p BADLY TEARING even with VSYNC ON 30FPS LOCKED (WTF!!!!!) NO CROSSFIRE/ SLI Support  Refuse to Play until fixes  GET IT TOGETHER 2K 
10466	  This game isn't awful   , but you'll get easly bored by this game after 5-6 hours. The missions are so similar, that it's feels like you are repeating them over and over. And the only reason you may bother to do that is to experience the storyline which has quality. I like the fact they aren't pâ«ssyfoting around subjects like racism. And I also like the soundtrack.   I have never understood why someone would watch others play games on youtube (and similar channels), but after experiencing this game i do understand. I would rather watch someone else play this game than play it myself, maybe even by someone as goofy as 'pewdiepie'. It might even be fun to see the boredom of this game suck the 'life-force' out of them, and maybe they will even question their existence in life and on youtube.
10467	Lots of fetch quest and 'busy work'. Story is nice tho. 6/10
10468	This game is mediocre at best and lacks feature that made the 2nd in the franchise pretty fun to play. I think if they would of added a Shadow of Mordor general type of system with mob bosses and luitenants it would of been much better. To sum it up, Mafia III is like playing an outdated Mafia sequel with better eye candy.   Cons:  ~Very repetitive, for example: Missions, animations, and music that makes the game feel more like a grind than enjoyable.  ~Weird lighting that makes lakes/rivers glow like the sun when the sky is dark and cloudy.  ~Arcade feel all around. ~Classic mafia gameplay that has less features than Mafia II.   Pros:  ~Decent graphics.  ~Voice acting and facial animations are very good. ~Colectable bewbies. ~The stealth system. ~The story so far is predictable but, still enjoyable.
10469	i was really excited for the game....its pretty and the story is cool but the game is overly repetitive
10470	So, as with just about every game thats released these days Mafia 3 needs more. More of what you may ask. More of everything. It's not a bad game. Very much in the vein of GTA, but with less to do. 45hrs in and I'm quickly running out of things to entertain me.   The missions vary in location, however the mechanics of each engagement are almost identical, especially once you get a silenced pistol: Pick off senries or patrols, move in to the interior ring of patrols in stealth, pick off (either headshot or whistle/stab) further guards until you confront the boss. Usually a grenade in the final room is a quick and efficient way of clearing the boss and anyone else unlucky enough to be in the room with them.  'Interrogating' informants? Nah, just shoot them in the head. No need to 'chase' them down. Just shoot them and they'll kneel in place waiting to spill the beans.  Mafia 3 rewards stealth gameplay more than any other. This is a little odd as the Mafia are not remembered because of their invisibility.   If you're looking for an open world crime game then GTA V would be a better choice if I'm honest. I've enjoyed Mafia 3 and don't regret buying it, the world thats been created is both beautiful and brutal. However boredom is now setting in. Theres only so long I can do the same things over and over and over.  There will obviously be DLC for this game (getting so tired of this model. The passion for creating a profit over a product), perhaps I'll revist then, or perhaps not.
10471	UPDATE at 9th of October 2016  It is just fair to give you informations about the last patch:  To make it short: nothing has changed concerning freezes, crashes and bluescreens. Every 30 minutes the game decides to kill my PC and I have to make a hard reset.  Also the keyboard mapping has not become better. Double bindings are still not possible and extra mouse keys (thumb keys) are still not supported.  At the moment: Stay away from this game until they have fixed it.  Considering the bad textures, developers might be interesting in updating those too.  Framelock has been lifted. Possibility for unlimited frames. Does not really change a lot.  ***  Freeze, crashes, restart, crash, stutter, lag and pixelated textures. Even after reinstalling newest nvidia driver, crashes and now the game even starts in German, but crashes immediately. 30 fps lock did actually not bother me for the 20 minutes I played it.  I am sure the story is interesting, I am sure the dialogues are great and the experience in Nouvelles OrlÃ©ans is going to be new and cool. But before I actually can experience this, I am pressed to unfortunately give this game a negative rating.   Besides of the mentionned crashes, the 20 minutes I played, I did not like that the controller settings do not allow to bind extra mouse keys, that double bindings of keyboard keys is not properly solved. That the camera is jumping back to default even if you turn it with the mouse in another direction. These are all typical console port problems you will get from a bad port. It is actually a shame that 2K has been recently developping mostly very messed up games. I remember that they have been top in PC development. But sorry, this port, this release, this so called expensive AAA game is a mess.   Now we know again why no PC reviews have been available before release. I do not want to refund the game, because I am sure that I like the game - if I am able to play it -, but the developers have to work fast and hard now to patch all those problems out, in order to give the PC community just a normal port of a decent game. Did we ask too much?  Until then, I can't recommend the game. This is hopefully going to change in a few days and I am willing then to review of course my position then.   Besides of this. No native 3D vision support is also a big let down. But I understand, asking for this at the actual state of Mafia 3 on release day is simply too much.  You want to compare Mafia III to GTA V. Forget it! I just say worlds in between.  Developers, get to work on PC patches and fixes !!!
10472	First, the game won't even start if you have an older AMD CPU with no SSE4.1 support that is otherwise perfectly capable of handling a game of this level of complexity.  Even No Man's Buy devs had had this issue sorted within a day after launch IIRC.   Then there's the 30 FPS cap that has no reason to be there because the picture is apparently upscaled from 900p so  any  half-decent GPU should have no trouble rendering this blurry mess at 45-60 FPS.  And of course there're crashes and freezes and all kinds of hiccups that will happen at least once per hour on average.  However good the story and gameplay may be, this is a completely botched port hastily copy-pasted from consoles. Please show some self-respect as a PC gamer and don't buy this game until it's properly fixed  and  50% off. This level of incompetence on the devs' part  should  be bad for their business.  Refunded.
10473	I went to a games expo on the last weekend and the video demo was great. But it was a video.  I have a gtx 970 with 16 GB of ram. all but the GPU is new from this year.  Game is locked at 30 FPS and at high/max setting, it doesnt look good as the videos.... besides the cutscenes, which look like 1080p. Also the game crashed 2 times. going from the cutscenes to gameplay.  For the 1 hour and 50 mins I've been playing. the story looks good.  I hope they fix this or I'm getting my money back.
10474	Stay away and spare your wallet.  I mean, It was boring. And it lacked the signature mafia feeling that we learned to love in mafia 1 and 2. it feels as the game almost tries to be more like gta in order to appeal to a wider audience, but it fails misserably. It has alot of bugs and is as optimized as a potatoe. The driving is sluggish and dosent feel right. The game is very repetetive as you need to do basically the same thing 8 times per district and there are 6 districts. The game isnt even hard as i played it on hard and thought it was easy. There are no options like customizing cars or clothing and it lacked in small details which led to the world just feeling a little bland and dead. The AI is as stupid as a rock. It has some annoying elements to it. Like you loose half of your money you have on you when you die so you need to store it. There arent that much you can spend it on other than weapons and upgrades like vehicle upgrades which is just a wasted opportunity opposed to having an actual vehicle customization system. You can also buy upgrades for Lincoln which is also wasted opportunity as a level / progression system could have been in place instead. The story missions are good If somewhat mediocre And The cutscenes look amazing. The gun play is on point and The soundtrack is Great. Overall.. Its just a repetetive mediocre experience
10475	This game was made for console players with their restricted outdated hardware and thrown to PC as a cheap port. The graphic options are a joke and the graphic itself doesn't even nearly look like 2015 or 16's PC standard. It's a blurry upscaled mess.  They knew exactly why they didn't allow any testing reviews before the release.  An unfinished game but demanding the full price.  For all those whining fanboys:  Yes, we are on Steam platform and not XBOX Marketplace or Playstation Store. So i await a game on PC standards.  I took a refund and as long as all this mess isn't going to be patched i'll keep my negative review.  Ich habe fertig!  Specs: i7-6700k 16 GB RAM 2x 980ti SLI
10476	the frame rate is unlocked now and they fixed the weird resolution/blur issue, but the game doesn't run at 60fps. i'd recommend the game for the story, soundtrack, gameplay, graphics, but none of that matters until the game runs well.  edit: i just started getting crashes as well. change graphics settings, crash. cutscene ends, crash.  i really want to play this game, i enjoy it quite a bit but it seems like the game is doing everything it can to stop me from playing it.
10477	Story: 4/10 Starts really strong but then quickly turns generic and boring throughout the whole game. Even Vito offers nothing interesting.  Gameplay: 3/10 The missions are unfortunately VERY repetitive. There is no difference between the main missions and the optionals except for a very small number of unique and cinematic missions (like the steamboat or shooting up the KKK). The guns are fun, but the horrible stupid AI (who is just so willing to be killed by you) make both stealth and combat super easy. I only died a couple of times because of the stupid, not-computer-friendly controls and the cover system. You can just whistle to lure someone into your direction (they will go 1 at a time), kill him, repeat over and over again. The 7th guy won't be thinking 'hmmm what happened to my 6 buddies?'... Driving behaviour and physics are awful, but tbh I still had fun driving around. Altho there isn't much driving included in the missions (except for the optionial boring stuff), so wasted potential here. And for some absurd reason they got rid of features that were in the previous games, like buying/changing clothes (or stores in general), car physics (demolition, destruction), cops that don't shoot you on the smallest delict (plus I want to note that the whole state knows about you the very second one bloody cop spots you - no matter how quickly you take him out), and many more.  Graphics: 4/10 People complain alot about the overall graphics but for me it's more on the technical side: Graphics glitch out or don't load properly at times, especially when you drive fast. The lighting, which can be very awful and points and then be really great in other moments. And second, the skyboxes... they are just... really effin weird. There is also some really weird weather transitions at random points (not talking about quick transitions that are mission-related). The overall graphics like geometry and textures are totally fine to me and had some beautiful moments. Especially the cinematics and animations are really well done. It seems like performance-wise the game is alot more demanding than it should be for this quality.  Sound: 8/10 Weapons and vehicles sound good, soundtrack is great (obviously, c'mon you know the songs!) Tho, it's really annoying that your wheels are screaming the very second you hit the forward button.  Final words: This game does not deserve the title 'Mafia III' The game can be fun and I played through it because of the great soundtrack and atmosphere. But there is also alot of frustrating and boring moments. If you want to give this game a try, do it when it's on sale. Not worth the full price.
10478	Played 2 hrs of Mafia3, it doesn't seems to get any better because after the patch 1.01 my fps barely even 30 fps and my game was freezing when i was aiming or driving and crash at almost every single save point.   Story is good and all but the AI in game are just bunch of idiots walking around even i set it on hardest difficulty.  The view point + view distance was just more screwed up then i thought.  The Graphic all were so pixelated and without high textures at all, and i wonder why you even need high resolution setting when everything were almost the same as low resolution.  Conclusion: This game is a waste of time and money, i rather play a solid game with freezing and crashing, with great graphic and fps. Don't even buy this if you don't want to go though all this stupid issue they have before even publishing it.So i refunded it.
10479	This is far from even being beta
10480	First off, the lip sync in some of the cutscenes are so bad. Lag when you reach a high speed whilst driving or even when your normally driving. Missions sometimes glitch out, e.g. You go into a building but the character you are with doesn't follow you in there glitching out the mission which makes you have to either restart the game or the mission.  Don't buy it for it's current price.
10481	This is a bad console port of a rushed game.  - Repetitive gameplay. - Full of annoying bugs. - Frequently crashes to desktop. - Runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the lowest settings. Even though I can run GTA V on ultra.  I can not recommend a game in this state. Maybe I would after several months of patches... 
10482	 Not recommended
10483	 Mafia III Review Final Result: 1,0/10 - Batman Arkham Knight all over again
10484	I'm a huge fan of Mafia II. Loved the story, gameplay and had tones of fun. Didnt bother me that open world aspect of the game wasn't as evolved and interesting as you can get in GTA.   This one is just far from OK. I have been waiting for this game since I saw trailer on youtube and what I received is a childlish version of some idea that could have been great. AI is just unbearable! What a shame and downfall of this great title.  Would't recommend and I feel I wasted my money!!!
10485	This game is unbelievably hit and miss...  The story and presentation are stunningly well done, it's a little generic but the delivery is impeccable. The shooting feels great and the setting has the potential to be gourgeous, that's the key word here, potential.  Pretty much everything feels almost solid, almost great, but not quite there yet. The city is beautiful but dead and plagued with graphical errors, glitchy citizens, awkward animations, a 20ft draw distance, the jankest weather cycle I think i've ever seen and so much more. The swamp is once again, beautiful but ruined by a terrible draw distance and odd glitches. The gun play is great, the AI is stupid. The melee combat is impactful, the animations are awkward and clunky. The visual design is stellar, it's ruined by a low framerate. Nothing is perfect and the only area where it truly excels is in the presentation of its story (The small amount of it that i have seen atleast).  Now aside from the big FPS problem and all the issues listed above the game is playable, very jumpy and annoying, but playable. The issues which make the game nearly unplayble for me are the filter, blur effects and glitches. The game has a p*ss filter which cannot be turned off, the filter is to make the game more 'thematic' as though you're viewing it through an old camera. This does make it feel somewhat more thematic due to the documentary style of delivery but honestly it isn't worth it, I'd rather just enjoy the period as it was. The blur is beyond frustrating if anything is more than 10 meters away it becomes incredibly blurry, text is unreadable, NPC faces become gelatinous blobs and gun fights are like a god damn earthquake. It feels as though the developers are trying their hardest to hide their lower res textures with obnoxious visual effects masquarading as 'style', it's just bad.  The glitches are a whole thing on their own, cars pop through the ground and glide through you until you die, NPC's fall over for no reason and fling through walls when ever so much as touched in a car, the police walk on water (not kidding), take downs don't connect and sometimes enemies will just stand still and shoot at nothing. It's ridiculous and the game even crashed to desktop twice during just two hours of play.  Potential is coursing through Mafia III's veins, but raging type 2 diabetes and concrete surfing soft tops make sure you never bloody see it.  I'm not giving a rating with just two hours of play, don't buy it until it's confirmed that these problems are fixed.
10486	Pre ordered from GMG so I can't get a refund (completly my fault) but if I could I would. I cannot play games at 30fps (unacceptable in 2016) so I waited patiently for the patch before playing unfortunately, the game is a mess even with the patch. I can't get 60fps, no SLI suport so one of my 980's is just sitting there chilling while the other is having a stroke struggling to run a s****y consol port with 512x512 textures at a steady 50fps (game fluctuates between 36 to 43fps). Lesson here is don't pre order kids.
10487	The game storyline is brilliant but there's other factors that made me don't recommend this game...  Pros: -Great storyline -Loved the combat system -Liked UI -Graphics are brilliant -Cutscenes are realistic  Cons: -Don't like the main character (No offense, I just don't think he should be the main character) -It doesn't look like it's optimised (Several freezes occurred during playing) -Volumetric lighting, reflection quality is too demanding... -Changing screen resolution can sometimes makes the game in boardless window. -Feels like GTA...  Overall, the game can be improved in terms of performance, some settings are demanding however but it shouldn't be a major issue if you and I don't have such a great PC. However, the game feels like it's GTA which actually put me off. I liked Mafia II, I prefer that over this game any day.  Score: 5.5/10
10488	We all know about the low 30FPS, which is being sorted as we speak.  3 or so hours into the game and here's my pros and cons.  Pros: - Great Storyline (So far) - Music is great, as always. - Cutscenes are fantastic, makes you feel part of the game.  Cons: - Obvioulsy the FPS, lags when driving in high detail areas. - Game can crash at certain times, has happened to me a few times. - AI are stupid, had to restart a mission due to one being stuck and unable to follow me. - Poor lighting when weather changes. I've had it that numerous times that when I'm driving on a sunny day, when all of a sudden it's dark and cloudy.  Will 're-review ' once the new patch has been released, but for now we'll have to either now play, or put up with the FPS and bugs,
10489	Well first off I'll say that I knew what I was getting into, just bought this due to huge boredom.  Story is ok so far, but the thing that probably annoys everyone playing Mafia 3 is that the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over again. You go in to a place and shoot everyone, then you interrogate the gang boss and either kill him or make him join your crew. Graphics are ok for the most part, but there are some really hideous textures like the whole damn sky, which looks like it's from ps2 game. Performance is ok after patches (100 ish with drops to 60s at max settings with 1070, i5 6600k @4.5ghz). If you for some reason want to play this game make sure to turn off vsync and put framerate to unlimited, locking the framerate will cause ridiculous stuttering and drops to 0 fps for no real reason. Wouldn't recommend getting it unless you just want to shoot people repetively, since I found the combat quite enjoyable.

10491	***FINAL REVIEW*** (This is my final review after completing the game's storyline. This review contains SPOILERS)   Mafia 3 had a lot of potential but unfortunetly failed to live up to expectations. The game's story is a typical revenge story that has the predictable 'I've become the monster I set out to destroy!' ending. The voice acting and motion capture for cutscenes are generally top notch, though occasionally there's a cutscene where the visuals look terrible and the acting feels awkward, especially with the priest and his future interviews. His fake crying is unbearable to sit through. I did enjoy getting some closure on the events of Mafia 2 concerning Vito Scarletta and Joe Barbaro, but they felt more like fan service rather than well thought out extensions of their story. I liked the mysterious way Mafia 2 ended, and the fact that they are suggesting that Joe survived kind of ruins the impactful ending of Mafia 2. So yeah, the story is decent and definitely the best reason to play Mafia 3, but it's nothing extraordinary.   The gameplay is where we start running into some serious problems. After a long 2-hour introduction where the timeline jumps around to help explain how the Mardi Gras heist went down, the game suddenly drops off into a highly repetitive crawl throughout the 'open-world' city. I put open world in quotations because the world is beyond empty. There's quite literally NOTHING to do in New Bordeoux aside from the side missions and main story missions. This would be fine if the side missions weren't required in order to unlock story missions. Each district in the city requires you to complete 8 repetitive side missions that pretty much always involve you invading an enemy controlled territory and killing a VIP inside. You can approach these missions with stealth or combat, but neither method makes a difference. There's no reward for playing the game stealthily so there doesn't seem to be a reason to bother most of the time aside from the thrill of sneaking around undetected. You can kill enemies lethally OR nonlethally, but for some reason, you must change a gameplay setting in the game's pause menu whenever you want to switch between these methods.   Once you complete a bunch of these side missions, you are forced to return to that district's friendly AI (where you are a treated to a lazy in-engine cutscene that looks like something out of an old Tony Hawk game) and they tell you to go to one of the side mission locations you JUST cleared to kill an underboss. After killing the underboss, you're only halfway done... now yuo need to meet another ally in the same district, complete 5-6 more side missions, and then kill another underboss to unlock an actual story mission. Now the story missions are a lot of fun most of the time. They are generally large set-pieces like a burning boxing ring or a crashed river boat where you fight your way to one of Sal Marcano's lieutenants. There's about 14 of these large missions and those alone would have made for a fun experience.. but unfortunetly you're stuck grinding away at this lackluster open world and completing side missions for 20 hours.   Thankfully the side missions can still be fun with the well done ingame economy. I never felt as though I had too much money to spend nor did I feel like mone was too hard to come back. I slowly managed to earn enough money to make upgrades to my arsenal, health, and vehicles. The melee kills are all awesome and never get old and combat often feels really realistic. The vehicle combat is pretty awkawrd, with strange lock-on targetting rather than freeaim and the cars seem to all handle pretty poorly, with vehicles often crashing into curbs and flipping over themselves.   Now that we're talking about bugs... let's talk about this game's technical aspects. They're terrible.. they're all terrible! This game crashed at least 10 times on my system, with an average framerate of about 55fps on the maximum graphic settings, and graphics that either look good, or look like GTA San Andreas. Often times when driving on long bridges, the game looks impossibly ugly. Other times, especially during the evening in the Bayou, the game looks beautiful. The game also causes my gtx 980ti's fans to get really loud, suggesting that the game is forcing my GPU to run way too hot.It's as if they stopped half-way through when making this game. I encountered several bugs that forced me to restart from checkpoint simply because friendly AI failed to perform scripts that allowed me to continue missions. I also had plenty of vehicles spawning ontop of eachother, AI acting strangely, visual glitches like clouds moving too quickly, and really strange massive saturation when inside buildings.   So if you're on the fence with your purcahse of Mafia 3.. let me help you. Don't buy it. Wait till it's $15 at most. This game is a disaster of a port and even without the technical issues, it feels unfinished with a lackluster game design and repetitive gameplay. It's a real shame beacuse I was really looking forward to this game, but I don't see myself replaying this one like I did with Mafia 2.   ________________________________________________________________________________ PC Performance Benchmark:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBSTG9fH04U&amp;list=PLTxgzJqWtkFZysGjlxeyWbwyJaJbMfWBJ&amp;index=1   Mafia 3 First Impressions Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW3VdOZwGZE&amp;feature=youtu.be 
10492	Even with the patch and all graphics settings maxed out, this game still looks like something from 2009.  Also the K/B controls need some improving. There's no way to remap 'melee' to one of the extra buttons on my mouse and even the 'counter' button needs to be remapped better. The devs at Hangar 13 probably don't know that there are gaming mice out there that have more than just a left button, a right button, and a middle mouse button.  Okay... it's a day later and I found that I needed to increase the FOV for my 24' monitor from the default 60 to 78 and it improved the graphics. It's still not as pretty as GTA 5, but still better than when I first started playing. Also, I read somewhere someone's suggestion to lower the AA in the game and that seems to help as well. But, I did increase the AA in my NVIDIA control panel.
10493	SHORT REVIEW: Average Game not worth $80. Buy it only for $30-$40  LONG REVIEW:  So, after beating the game completely (with all side missions and stuff) I can say that this game is worth buying only on discount or rent. Throught out the whole game the best part to keep you coming back is only the story (WHICH IS DRAGGED AS HELL) and right after you beat it you just dont feel like playing it anymore at all. I just realise how much I had to force myself to play it until the end. The game might and probably will fascinate you at first like it did to me, but later on it just gets SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING REPETETIVE to the point that you just sit in your chair bored as hell and trying to reach the end. The gameplay is very repetetive but the part that repeats itself (driving and combat) are made on a pretty good level which makes it possible to play this game. The story on the other hand in my opinion was pretty good but WAY WORSE than Mafia 2 story. From the beginning to the end you already know what is going to happen and its just simply disappointing. The ending isnt that great either they only made it a bit better by showing a little surprise and a throwback to the older games. In my opinion Vitos storyline in this game is better than the main one. So lets see the pros and cons of this game.  GAME SCORING: Combat 10/10 Driving 8/10 Open World (Alive but nothing to do) 5/10 Story 6.5/10 Vito's Story (Very Short Since It's A Side Story) 9/10 Level of Repetitevness (Try hitting a wall a thousand times and make yourself think that you are doing something new every time) 10/10 Cinematics 10/10 Graphics 7/10 Atmosphere 8/10 (Good atmosphere but just isnt that Mafia one that I wanted when getting this game) Soundtrack 9/10 (Just too short and gets repetetive often) Boss Levels 8/10 (Again good levels but are just too predictive and simple (even on the highest difficulty))  OVERALL SCORE: 6.5/10 This game is an average game that is not good nor is bad. Didn't find it that great to be honest and I alreadt know that I wont buy any DLC's or play this game again unless something really attracts my attention. Buy this game only if it's on discount, rent, pirate it, or just watch the cutscenes on YouTube (that's pretty much the good thing about the game).  Was very excited for the game and expected to get a masterpiece like the first titles but got an avarage game not worth $80 in my opinion. Same as with Battlefront from DICE.  EDIT: Not gonna lie after some time passed I do wanna play it again LOL only due to the combat. In my opinion it's very good and makes me wanna play it. But just like overwatch only for a little bit of time. In the future when they release more updates for the open world and who knows what, if they will turn out to be fun and make this open world an actual open world where you can do more than just shoot and drive, I'll change my opinion and will say that it's worth the money. Just like GTA this game will get better in the future but I ain't sure about that. They have the potential but didn't realise it yet I think...
10494	To day Lates Patch Finally Got a chance to play..   And found it somewhat laking in enjoyment      ///////////////////////////Original Comment///////////////////////////////////  Currently the game Is broken for a large number of people.  For me as soon game launches near instant crash to desktop.    Maybe I will update review IF/When game is FIXED.  -- Update even with the new patch game is still broke,   While not the biggest waste of my money in resent years. It was a definate mistake.
10495	As a fan of the 2 previous Mafia games, this one so far is a disappointment. 30fps locked (mumbles something about consoles) and random crashes. I expected the physics and the graphics to be better. They are ok, they don't seem to match the screenshots even after changing graphic settings, maybe I'm missing something but I doubt it.   The only good thing about it at the moment is the storyline. I can only hope they fix the major issues quickly or I will be requesting a refund.  Gone are the days where you can expect to pay top dollar for a game that isn't full of bugs on release. 
10496	  Bad stuff first.. Post 1.01 Patch still broken wait a month or so.
10497	If you're expecting the same level of gameplay depth as mafia 2. Run away. This game is a very dumbed down version of mafia. Signs are all over the place to show you with turn to take (no kidding) where doors are. Even picking a lock has been simplified. It's really an insult to our intelligence.  AAA games have been becoming more and more dumbed down throughout the years and this is a sad example of that. The game is still good, but it's really an insult we shouldn't just accept.  The graphics? The light effects look better, everything else looks weird. Objects close to you will sometimes be blurry (especially your own car), teeth of the characters look strange too. Overal, I'd say mafia 2 looks better (for now).  TL:DR if you never played mafia? Buy this, play this, then play mafia 2. If you've already played mafia 2. Stay away until you lower your expectations.
10498	Mafia 3 is still broken, 2 of my missions are broken, the sky in the game is broken..the morning sunrise, looks like hell on earth...... skies in free games are better than the sky in this game. DO NOT BUY until like 2018, maybe then after about 50 patches it'll work. BTW, It has had 2 paches, each 1.2gb each one.
10499	Let me start by saying, that I couldn't wait to play Mafia 3. The game has a really strong start plotwise, but then the side quests kick in... And after that all you do is:  1. Pick up a mission. 2. Go to a few places, where you kill a bunch of goons and interrogate their leader to get information. Now you are being offered a choice to either spare him and add some money to your racket, or kill him and earn some cash straight away. 3. Go to a another place, that is, again filled with goons - Kill them all. 4. When you have done enough damage to lure out the racket boss, you will have to kill him and his goons.  After you've done all of this, the main story continues a bit and you get to see a cutscene. Then repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat.   The controls for the keyboard + mouse takes a little time to get used to. AI is also pretty dumb. For example, when I was interrogating a guy, another goon just stood there pointing a gun at my head, and waited for me to finish the conversation before he would react.. And when I entered a vehicle with hostile goons in it, the guys at the backseat started shooting at the driver, who I'd just thrown out of the car. There's bugs here and there, but to some of those I just can't help but to laugh at.  Some positives though. The soundtrack is really kickass. When you fire up the game, you get to hear Jimi Hendrix + the game offers many hit songs from that era. Don't want to stop driving when I hear songs by Steppenwolf, Roy Orbison, Otis Redding etc.   I will continue to play this game, but I wouldn't recommend this to players who:  1. Don't like repetitive, grindy side missions. 2. Don't want to be forced to complete side missions in order to continue the main story.  That's my 2 cents folks!
10500	NOT WORTH THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE  i wouldnt suggest buying this unless it was on sale for at least 50% off.    . blurry textures, very low res textures on many things, locked at 30 fps at launch . Shows how out of touch this developer really is with PC community. Game looks like vaseline was smeared on the screen before you played.    lazy design on the NPC's. cleared a room of 'workers' in a heroin den. EVERY DAMN ONE OF THEM WAS THE SAME NPC.. the npcs you look at look like they are rendered at 240p.  Im going to play the game because i cant get a refund from GMG .   story seems ok.. but right now that all i can say good about it
10501	This game is, wait for it! ... -   FPS:  You all know that it's locked at 30 fps by now, and that they are going to release a patch for it. Sure, I'll take that. But why did they even release it to begin with, with a 30 fps lock.. It's so idiotic.  Graphic: I immediately felt kinda 'dizzy' once I started driving a vehicle in the very begning of the game, even though I had motion blur off. My eyes kinda hurt, an absolute turn off for what is suppost to be a beautiful game. Then, if you take an actual look around the surrounding, you will notice how bad everything truely is. The vehicles just a few feet in front of you won't show any details what so ever until you even get remotely close to it. When you turn around, facing your own character.. - You can't even see ANY details WHAT SO EVER in his face, and I swear, theres even some blur ON HIS FU*#&amp;NG FACE!!   Story: Don't know, kinda rage quit and refunded game. I bought the game for the story though, but the overall game is just to bad, can't bother continuing.   ... - Absolute trash! This game is absolute trash!  Thank you, shoutout to my mum &amp; dad.
10502	I have lost 53 hours of progress after a random crash corrupted the one and only autosave. A truly flawless design and implementation. It may sound frustrating, but I was already planning to abandon the game. I have a high tolerance for repetitive gameplay, but the last 10 hours were a real drag. Being a completionist I have collected and completed everything throughout the game. Do not make the same mistake! Do only what's absolutely necessary, backup your save manually and maybe you will reach the ending with a happy smile.
10503	Very very disappointed with how this game turned out, story is shiiiit. This game is disgrace to the Mafia series
10504	  game is playable but its still a mess in itself... its not a arkham mess but pretty close. controller (XboxOne Wireless) commands do not show for me and some are not even assigned like the CLOSE command when those damn tutorial messages pop up. playin with mouse and keyboard without problems. 12 crashes in 10 hours of gameplay. at some times it looks worse than gta5 on a ps3 or xbox360. no steam cloud save support. i do not recommend this game in this state.
10505	Review in Progress [Don't Buy, REFUNDED THE GAME]  [Updated 4:03 PM 7/10/2016]: Game Crashed after a cutscene  [Updated 7:03 PM 7/10./2016]: Shooting mechanics are fun, Water effects are outdated. [Updated 12:04 AM 8/10/2016]:   -Adjusting Menu Graphics setting doesn't affect ingame graphics setting. You have to manually adjust the setting again inside the Game in Display option.  - Turned off Vsync (Still locked to 30FPS) - Setting AA to low will reduce the blurrines of textures. Image seemed much sharper - Gemoetric and Lighting seems to have huge hit on FPS when set to High. Reduced my FPS from 30 to 15 on High. - Day One update still haven't arrived.   [UPDATE 10:46 AM 9/10/2016]: PATCH 1.01 is RELEASED which has unlocked FPS and keyboard binding fixes but thats just it!. No other visual improvements or anything.   Time Played: 67min  NOW:   Pros:   1. Gameplay is fun and engaging 2. Vehicle Handling is good 3. Combat System seems to be solid 5. 30 FPS won't have a huge affect on gameplay 6. Cutscenes and Loadtimes are good [running the game from SSD]  Cons:  1. There is a 30 FPS Lock 2. Textures are blurry 3. Menu UI is sluggish and looks outdated 4. World MAP and Player HUD graphics looks outdated 5. NO SLI Support  6.Game crashed after a cutscene  7. Looks like a Console Port 8. Water Effects are outdated  9. Film grain effect?   Graphics Setting: 1. Custom, All high except Geometric,Lightning and AA on LOW   System: 1. Core i7 4700MQ 2. 16GB DDR3 RAM 3. nVidia Geforce 780m SLI DUAL 4. Samsung SSD 840 EVO 5. Windows 8.1 64BIT  6. Using Latest Nvidia Geforce Game Ready Driver for Mafia 373.06   A patch for PC seems to be coming very soon which will fix the 30 FPS Lock and give options of 60 FPS and above. Other perfomance updates are coming soon. I will update this review after the first day one Patch!. Wait for the patch and see how it improves for others then buy the game.
10506	i am going to keep it short the story(cutscenes),music and voice acting are good. gameplay is repetitive you keep doing the same thing over the 9 districs you have to take over, the world feels very empty no customization for cars,clothing and buildings the ingame money you earn feels like it has no use then buying weapons wich you don't do most of the time weapons they all feel the same all you do is headshot with any weapon to insta kill   i would skip this game i am sure there are better games for 50-60 bucks
10507	Honestly, i can't recommend this game, here's why:   1) It looks not very good, it's low on detail, the districts are very short of people, towns don't look 'Alive' and i was honestly expecting it to look about as alive as atleast mafia 2.   2) It looks like it was made in unity and honestly i expected more here too, it is a AAA game that cost millions of dollars to create. I hope maybe a patch can fix this? maybe not, we'll see.  3) The game is choppy, and i mean very choppy. It has nothing to do with the 30 FPS because honestly i don't mind. But if i can run GTA V on highest settings, i expect to run this game without lag and 'choppiness'. It ruins the experience.  4) It plays weirdly, the controls are unresponsive, making for a worse experience.  5) The current amount of glitches in the game. If you stand on the roof of a car, your legs will literally stand on the seats. He won't even stand on the roof, but it seems that certain parts of the cars are 'not there' and you can go straight through them.  6) (This is a minor non game breaking one) The talking to people cutscenes that aren't real cutscenes so they can't be skipped, are so annoying. You stand there talking like it was a cutscene, but you can't skip them. They bring nothing to the story, and its an unnecessary evil  In it's current state, i cannot recommend it, i've loved mafia since the first time i played mafia 2, and this game honestly is not worth it, not in it's current state, there is a patch coming, and i hope to update this to a good review when it's out, but for now heed my warning. Have a nice day ^~^
10508	Not telling audience about the 30fps cap was shady enough.  But now it makes sense the reason that the game was initially capped to 30fps was that the game was horribly optimised. Running a 980 sli + 4930k and the game can't hit 60 outside or in.   If the framerate had been good I could have forgived the rubbish graphics which make gta V look like a new crysis, or the generic mafia plot e.g. guys mess with you, build up and empire, slowly pick them off, have a couple crises of morality, kill main bad dude, family avenged.  For PC gaming to be a good overall experience for the Â£1500+ we spend on our rigs we have to shed the developers that cant be bothered making a good PC port because the guys with the spreadsheets think we'll buy anything Hello games was a recent example and now its Hanger 13.
10509	The graphics are dissapointing. Could've added First Person Driving View so that the rear view mirror function doesn't seem redundant. Like how the driving works when changed the settings to 'simulator'.  Played 2 hrs into the story, didn't get me hooked or excited unlike the first 2 series (I'll try to finish the story, but as of my first 2hrs, I don't feel any hype in the story as compared to it's predecessor). Mafia Games are supposed to have the most punch in their story!   In short, Mafia III gave you alot of content to play with at the cost of a cinematic story experience. Mafia 2's story and cinematics were so great! Can't believe they killed it with Mafia III. =(  Mafia 2 had content quality. Mafia 3 gave content quantity.  Waited for months for this, bought the physical collector's edition. I must say it's quite dissapointing. Recommend others to wait for content/graphics updates from 2K before buying.
10510	Just beaten the game...  Well, as a Mafia game it is pretty average.  They should fire their mission designer, also the one came up with the 'It's a good idea to make this game looks like some stupid console port so let's make it 30fps lock' guy.  First, let's talk about 30fps, they DID say that there will be a patch allowing you to go 60, but why in the world would anyone think it's a good idea to NOT have 60 on launch, same goes for changing cloth, as it should be a LATER free update... Is this game half finished?  The mission is lengthy, repetitive and unbearable, you want to do a progress a story quest? Sure, do ALL the regional quest( as in, kill somebody, destory something kind of quest with zero plot involved) first, then you get your story quest. I believe this bs is used to make their the game lengthy, but it feels like some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing grindy korean mmo to me. Once I'm done with the main story line, there's literally nothing left for me to do... 19 hours. Pfft.  The whistle key is 'Delete', I have no idea who designed this, they really didn't put any effort on this....  Just don't buy it...
10511	While this is a good game in gameplay and story terms, I cannot give it a positive rating as I won't support their development process/model.  30 fps. 4k UI scaling is terrible. hardly readable. Gameplay so far is good.. But for a 2016 game and AAA, it should have unlocked FPS and alterable UI scaling or at least a better one than this.
10512	8 crashes in 2 hours.  EDIT: MSI Afterburner / Rivatuner seems to be what caused the crashes. If you use Afterburner, be sure to disable the in-game overlay.
10513	Well, I bought the game because I was excited for the next game in the Mafia lineup, but only untill the day before it was released did I know it was gonna be locked at 30 frames. Then 2K somehow got all the major game magazines and websites to not write a review untill the actual release date, so no one had no way of knowing the game was gonna be locked at 30 frames because they thought no one would pay 60 bucks for it that way. I know I wouldn't. They already released a patch to fix that, but it still doesn't run at 60 frames. A few other guys plus myself still can only get the game to run at 40, at most, so theres that. I'm mostly confused as to why 2K would develop a game on a computer, like all videogames, then not opitmize it for PC. Plot goes something like 'You're not actually in the Italian Mafia, but you fight them.' Great way to ruin the trilogy. People ahve been complaining that the main character is black. I don't have a problem with a minority main character, but like I said, I am dissapointed that the player isn't actually in the mafia. So. Here's where we stand. I got a triple-A title, for 60 bucks, that wasn't even opitimzed for PC, without any way of nowing it, thats so far unplayable, has nothing to do with either of the former games all relased by a developer who cares nothing for the PC community. But hey, at least I got called the N-word within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, y'know, right before the game crashed. Moving on. Cops are worse than in GTA 5. For whatever reason, the cops shoot on sight, regardless on whether or not I've comitted a crime. I'll just be driving down the road, a cop'll yell something like 'hey, stop right there!' and just start shooting. Cops have unlimited ammo, but when they die, they don't drop any guns or ammo. Speaking of which, cops don't make arrests. Accidently crashed into a light pole? Too bad. Dead. When you die, you loose exactly half your cash, any ammo you used in the gunfight and you get respawned wherever 2K pleases. Very poorly thought out game. 0/10. 2nd worst game of all time, next to No Man's Sky.  Update: This game keeps crashing and my PC keeps overheating. I run a GTX 980 TI and a 3.6 GHz processor. This shouldn't be happening. Serious optimization issues here.  Update: Game just crashed for the 6th time in less than 20 hrs of gameplay.
10514	Mafia III a game about a group of criminals (AAA Developers) in a organized mafia. Its goal is make PC video games â¥â¥â¥â¥ and unoptimized while making console versions better, thus monopolizing video games to be sold to consoles. Which means, more people jump on the console market, people buy the games for console = $$$
10515	Cons: - Can't rebind keys to extra mouse buttons - Muddy and Blurry textures (looks like console textures)  - Locked at 30 FPS - 3 crashes to desktop in less than 1 hour of play.  Pros: - Story is great - Music    2k Announced a patch that should come in this weekends, until then i will recommend to wait with purchasing this game.  Update#1 : Fps cap removed , the game is way better now. Games still crashes a lot (4 crashes in 20 min!!!) textures are blurry and all same issues remain.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  Not going to change my review because i don't support Devs for this on fly fixes and the bad import they made to PC.
10516	'Me Too': This is obviously the motto the Game designers went for when making this game, It has the Shallow 'Do this, than to the same thing again, all over the map'-Syndrom from a Ubisoft Sandbox, the unnecessary Hitman X-Ray vision and the Terrible interface from GTA V seemingly just because it tries to fit in with them, and fails.   It blaitantly ignores established Mafia canon (mentioning Chicago, the city that Lost Haven was supposed to be replacing in Mafia 1, it renames cars aswell as guns for no reason) but the biggest offender is the missing features for me, You can't customise your outfit so you are stuck with the Military brown Rubbish Bag Jacket and you can't customise cars and with that saving them has fallen out of need as well.  (Note that they have released a patch to adress the outfit Problem but it still is simply too late for anyone to care)  The entire game evokes the fat kid trying to befriend the Cool kids in school and doesn't succeed with that or with it's grades, and as it's english teacher in this metaphor I give the story it tries to tell a D- with none of the characters getting any depth and no character dynamics being conveight, it smacks you about with time jumps and flashbacks that are simply more irritating than a story told straight forward which also smacks of just doing this because the game saw it in Hollywood movies rather than because it helps the story in any way and it ends up a mess.  Towards the begining... excuse me, Twords thah beginin' liddle Boahi Mafjah 3 do has the noshion of naht carin and juhst wanting you get to do the gauhd damn clearin out missions, which carreh no weight what so evehr. You would get the same feeling just colouring a map with crayons and punching yourself in the face every time you want to continue.   Every feature that added a bit of realism and lighted up the commute to a new mission from Mafia 2 like lockpicking your way into a car of choice,having to get fuel for it, being able to make it dirty, wash it and giving it new rims and new paint, drive it to a restaurant and have a sandwich is gone which odd to take out because no one has ever complained about it (and if it's not broke, carry it over to the sequel) but it adds to my suspicion about the developers ('Hangar 13' instead of 2K Chech this time) trying to be a Ubisoft sandbox which in my opinion is the like being the much more boring and limited Playmobil instead of the free ,careless and infinitely customisable Lego of the GTA series.   And besides AssCreed really has been an â¥â¥â¥ in recent installments,in case you haven't noticed.  It doesn't feel like it's own thing, taking aspects from other games to use without caring that it is all a mess in the end.  Plus it certainly doesn't offer a satisfying sandbox experience like other before mentioned Crime-focused Car-driving sandboxes do, with none of the customisation and none of the fun and instead of that trying to convince you that filing Disticts under names all day liken a magical politics fairy is fun.  But if you like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ story, string of unfunny clichÃ©s about the 1960s,racism and Dah Saouth and like to hear Born to be wild 5 times, Fortunate Son 3 times as well as that song about thing being painted black four times in the first two hours (no joke, I counted) then the game is for you, moron.
10517	Wish it would play on my PC, start screen loads click start attempts to start game then drops it and goes back to the desktop. Now I discover it doesn't play on PC's with AMD CPUs, and there is no patch so it can! Who in their right mind releases a game for PCs that doesn't play on half the worlds PCs!  Quote from  windowsreport.com  'Also, gamers confirmed that Mafia III doesnât work on AMD CPUs without SSE 4.1 support. The game crashes at desktop, just like MGS V and No Mans Sky. Taking into account their previous experience, gamers are now waiting for devs to roll out a patch so that they can play Mafia III on Phenom CPUs.'
10518	I mean, come on. 30 fps?  Update: first crash within less than 20 minutes of play. Let's see if it gets worse.  Update 2: I've had five crashes in my 40 minutes of play, I'll stop playing the game until a patch comes out. Although I really enjoy the tone and the general direction the game seems to be going, I cannot reconmmend the game at its current state.  Update 3: The dev came out and confirms that they knowingly launched the game with the 30 cap, for reasons I can only infer from their statements were due to consoles' limitations. To me, that is no excuse. They say that they know 'how important having options...and frames [are]', blah blah blah. It's not like they just announced PC version yesterday. If the dev made a mess, I'll call it what it is.   P.S. for people whose arguments are: 'The game isn't even out in most countries', therefore the game is somehow not launched and the problems that I'm presenting are somehow invalidated? No. If it is launched in even just one country, then it is launched. If the game is broken in one country, the game is broken, and it shall be rightfully criticized by the customers of that region.  (Running on I7-5930k and a 980ti)
10519	Pro's  - Great, solid and well written story - Can be played at max grahics at 1440p with a GTX 980  Con's  - AI is dumber than a bag of hammers - AI repeats the exact same catch-phrases over and over and over and over........ - 30 FPS lock (holy cr*p WHY?!?!) - Some graphical glitches (should be easily patched) - Texture pop-in is not a problem while on foot - catastrophic when driving at speed - If you want to sneak properly - you will NEED a controller  I would give this game 10/10 if not for the fps cap and glitches and brain dead AI   Worth buying if on sale, NOT worth it in its current state at full price.
10520	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Pc graphics and Keyboard+Mouse Support  Runs like a potato~ Can't even rebind keys to more than the defult mouse buttons Short and simple~ Great game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU for making this a console only trash game... Arkam Knight Everybody... Again
10521	EDIT: The game has now been updated to include the new framerate options. It definitely plays much better although it still needs optimizations but considering how fast they pushed out the fps update I have no doubt optimizations will be coming soon. When playing with the 60 or unlimited framerate options I recommend using vsync as the screen tearing at this point in time can be pretty bad. I'll continue to update my review as I play and hopefully I can work towards a recommendation once I play more.  Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes the game is locked to 30fps but the developer has said they will be releasing an update with 30, 60, and unlocked fps options. They still don't get a free pass on launching it this way but at least they're not ignoring our complaints to fix it as fast as possible. With that being said, the only other major complaint I have with the visuals is that the game seems to be rendered at a much lower resolution than what you choose to natively display it as. I can't prove this fact but with how incredibly blurry the game is, even at higher resolutions (4k) It seems to be this way and I don't know if this can be improved or not.  Lack of visual options for user adjustment is a downside as everything ranges from low-high instead of giving us PC gamers what we are generally used to in terms of visual options. I should suggest that while other people have experienced crashes on a much higher scale, I have only crashed once so far so I have been lucky it seems.  On to the good stuff: -the game has a superb atmosphere that really captures the heart of the time the game takes place. And not just visually but the way people interact with you, cops always being supicious of you/etc really adds to the realism of the time. -music is awesome just as it was in Mafia II adding to the atmosphere once again -storytelling seems to be well thought out with great performances thus far as well as characters that are generally interesting -gunplay is solid although I do recommend turning off aim assist for the best experience -audio design outside of the soundtrack is great as well  General comments/personal preferences: -the driving is best when switched to simulation mode but it's still far from perfect. I don't mind it as much but you may hate the inconsistency of it -Ai needs some work. Open world games usually lack Ai that is well programmed or unique, this is no different, can be bad at times but don't let it detract from the overall story -play with a controller, your life will be much easier -collectibles are back! (Playboys :D, and others)   At its current state I would suggest most people wait until the game is fully patched up and fixes the major issues mentioned above, but for anyone who is either a fan of the series or isn't bothered by the 30fps cap that is currently enforced, pick it up but be aware you still and probably will run into issues.
10522	The launcher is nice, but once you want to see what you spent money on, the game stops working. Will give an update when I actually see the main menu.
10523	Pretty much GTA. For example.......  ***MAFIA 1*** 1) You speed past the cops, they pull you over and give you a ticket. 2) You run somebody over, you get arrested. 3) You bump into a car, you live to tell the tale.  ***MAFIA 3*** 1) You speed past the cops, you get shot. 2) You run somebody over, you get shot.  3) You bump into a car, you get shot.  What on earth happened to depth in games.... 
10524	terrible optimization. I put everything on low and still lag. I have i5-3470 3.20 ghz 8 gb GPU nvidia gtx 650 TI and on the minimum salary schedule similar to mafia 2 which I played at top speed! give optimization! I only have one question will you reduce the lag! or I bought the game for nothing and I will have to change software!
10525	My Review was Positive for 32.1 Hours of Playtime in Mafia 3. It had 88% Positive Feedback and i will re-post my old review when the main aspect of my negative Review is being fixed.  Look at the Discussion:    http://steamcommunity.com/app/360430/discussions/0/341537671995256038/   and    http://steamcommunity.com/app/360430/discussions/0/343788552553810086/    After you killed the 'Big Boss' and can choose between Vito, Burke or Cassandra to give a district, there is one Mission where you cant progress. After the Mission: 'Burn Like Napalm' which is quite lately at the end of the game you can choose to give one district to one of your crew. The Window doesnt pop up and you are stuck watching at Vito without making any progress.    Be aware that some people can make progress and finish the game but some people can't. Some People can't even start the Game. FIXES?
10526	Worst game optimisation in my life. THIS GAME NEEDS MORE ATTENTION the devs left it in the dust tho so dont expect many more optimisation fixes, i wished i had refunded this game ealier.
10527	I was used to love mafia. When it had good story. Not any problems with FPS. No problem with sky/weather.  This is just..sad :c  I like mafia 3 , i dont hate it , but i expected alot more.  But i must say voice acting and cut scenes are perfect , love those.
10528	Refunding I will buy this game again only after its patched more than once and not having errors game crashed to desktop during cutscene no error message or anything really wanted to like this game I purchased the digital deluxe edition so I hope developer can fix it soon.

10529	TL;DR Should you buy this? No. Not yet.  Although the trailers made me feel like this was going to be some generic 'you're a badass, work your way towards it' game, the story is actually compelling and the characters are very interesting. Sadly though, that's the only reason to get this game so far.  It's like mafia 2, only worse. Graphically it's all drab and dark, there's no color or ambience like in Mafia 2, although it has some appeal for itself. Right now just expect minecraft graphics and you might be pleased with what you get; they downgraded the graphics and tried to compensate for it by spamming post processing effects.  You'll see out of place textures, effectes and objects that make the whole thing not feel like 1 world, but more like a world with objects in it placed by the dev.  Also it's worth noticing that the day and night cycle will appear in 2 seconds, literally. You'll see the sun flying past you on the ground and at least a second later it'll all go dark for nighttime, it's just broken.  I've even had one occasion where it all went pitch black and eventually gained more and more brightness after 5 seconds of waiting, probably also an issue with the day/night cycle.  All in all this is a terrible port, they even had the balls to release it at a 30fps cap, which as now been removed. Sadly though, it's VERY noticable that the rest of the game hasn't been adjusted accordingly. You'll get a very poor framerate at a high end PC, resulting in something that looks WORSE than mafia 2.  How, you ask? Mafia 2 is outdated by now, this is a AAA next gen game. Well it's not any more impressive than Mafia 2 graphically. It's very clear when playing this that this was intended for consoles exclusively; textures are very drawn out and blurrish and one look at the skybox will reveal that it's a stretched out JPEG with no effort in it.  Heck, just look up some footage of a mirror in this game. It's a picture in picture screen with a 10 second delay. In english; this means if you look in a mirror after walking at it, you'll see yourself about 10 seconds ago. Wait for another 10 seconds and it might load the picture of you standing closer.    Game is full of bugs, and i do mean full. As an ArmA fanboy and Early access tester i've never shyed away from bugs, even on a AAA title.  However in this game you'll see at least 50 of them within 30 minutes of playing. Dead enemies will ragdoll into walls and objects around you, melee kill animations will clip you, your opponent and your camera through walls and objects alike. Cars will teleport in front of you as a result of the console's intended view distance. My personal tip; never drive at full speed. A car will eventually spawn 1cm in front of you standing still and you'll have a deadly crash.   The AI is horrendous. I'm not sure how scripted the AI in mafia 2 was, but it definitely seemed better than here. You can basically 'sneak' at your enemy, AKA crouch-run at your enemy. If you react within 5 seconds of him seeing you, you can still press control to slide lincoln into cover at the enemy's feet. He'll then be like 'what's that sound' instead of 'why is there a huge â¥â¥â¥ african-american war hero sliding past me', and as a result you can easily press Q to kill him.  As for the cops; they're on the 'broken AI' bandwagon. You can drift diagonally across 4 lanes at an intersection with 2 patrol cars and 4 officers on foot watching you, you'll get a blue marker indicating they're 'about' to get alerted, but they won't. They won't chase you if you speed, they won't chase you if you cut them off in incoming traffic, they won't chase you if you drift like a maniac.  They will, however, immediately pull their weapons and start firing at you if you slightly hit something. The good old bribing and them attempting to arrest you at first is history. It's mafia 3; it's dumbed down, so don't expect any details like the ones you got in mafia 2.  Stealth is no challenge whatsoever, i'm challenging myself to do the entire playthrough guns blazing, although i'm generally a massive fan of stealth gameplay.   Gameplay and graphics wise it feels like a letdown from mafia 2.  Storywise and characterwise however; it's definitely worth it. That is if the game gets fixed or deserted and discounted down to 20 bucks. Don't pick it up for any higher price for now.
10530	How the F do releases like this keep getting put out over and over again where there are horrid issues to begin with? I'm very much looking forward playing this when it gets fixed but right now there is no way I can play it when the graphics are so muddy. My vision is bad enough I'm not going to slog through this mess. They even muddied up the Steam overlay. HOW? Perhaps I'll change my review when it is fixed and can 'see' what an awesome game it is, perhaps not because really junk like this needs to be punished.  Edit 10/29/2016: After 3 weeks and 50+ hours of play I do like the gameplay but the poor performance and graphics persist. The promised patch was released quickly but didn't seem to improve a single thing. I can max out graphics or set them to low and get exactly the same poor performance and muddy graphics. Even the audio quality is poor with popping and to make it even half way reasonable sounding you have to lower the quality of your entire PC's audio to minimal. To add to the problems is a very confusing mission progression system where you have missions available but they're not really available because you haven't done something in the game yet which would actually allow that mission to be played. For example, you might have a mission to steal a truck or boat or whatever and you spend lots of time getting to that objective only to find out it isn't there because there is something else you need to do first and the game does little to nothing in explaining how this works. So you spend lots of time driving around to play missions that can't be played. I'll keep powering through the game but had I been in a refund situation to begin with I never would have kept it. I do love this franchise and hope they get their stuff fixed.
10531	EDIT: I decided to refund this, but I will leave the original review at the bottom. I can't pay for this and I feel bad for the developers because I don't think any of them wanted to release this game as unfinished as it currently is. Characters, animations and especially the facial animation are really high quality. Soundtrack and sound design is awesome. Storytelling is great and story itself seems really good. Everything points out that they were making an awesome high quality game, but there are a lot of things that seem to be unfinished or need some polish. Physics are wonky and don't work correctly. Lighting has issues and there is flickering and weird reflections. Textures are really low quality by todays standard. AI is dumb, game is full of glitches and is crashing from time to time. 30fps is not acceptable but the limit is not my biggest issue with the game and I don't believe that all of the issues are going to be fixed in future patches. Locking fps to 30 also hints that the optimization is also only half done. I am disappointed.   ---ORIGINAL REVIEW---  After quick testing I can throw in a few pros and cons:   PROS  - Story seems good. - Characters and character/facial animations are well made. - Soundtrack is amazing!! - Driving is pretty good when set to simulation. - Cutscenes, overall feel and also the collectibles!   CONS  - Locked to 30fps which is NOT enough for a pleasant experience. - Way too much handholding: Button prompts and floating markers everywhere and I found no option to turn those off. Collectibles are marked on the minimap and even highlighted with an icon when nearby. - Low res textures here and there and very low res reflections on vehicles. Chrome on the bumpers/trims especially looks horrible! Car models are not that high quality and seem to have weird reflections. - Traffic pop-in at distance. - Graphics generally are not that great excluding the characters. There is a blurry feel overall even when the Depth of Field, Motion Blur and Anti-Aliasing are turned off. - Sun/clouds are working weird. When driving around everything will suddenly go dark and then bright again. Ofcourse this is how it works irl when clouds cover the sun but the effect ingame is way too fast. - Guns seemed to be frustratingly inaccurate when shooting medium to high range, even if you shoot one round at the time. I only had little time with guns so this was really the first impression.   VERDICT  I want to like this game. I am a huge fan of the previous games, but the more I play this one the more disappointed I get. Story and characters seem ok, but everything else feels like its half complete. I can't really enjoy the game with framerate locked to 30 and it makes some of the cons seem worse, but that is not the only problem with this. I 'hope' that this was just released too early and future patches will fix all the graphical issues and not only remove the framerate lock. I will revisit this review if I get a reason to do so, but it's not looking very good...
10532	Review in progress - game on hold until patch(es)...  So far:  The story itself looks exciting - I really like the documentary style, the characters and the atmosphere is promising. But this game suffers from major issues.  The 30 FPS lock will be the least of our problems (never should have been there in the first place), the graphics doesn't look as good as it should be, low quality textures everywhere. There is also a constant blurriness which spoils the look of the game even further. Suffers from lots of minor (but annoying) bugs, full of glitches and other issues (regarding both graphics and gameplay).   The AI is stupid, sorry there isn't any, this 'openworld' gameplay must be a joke in 2016. Watch_Dogs seems like GTA6 compared to this game.  All of the problems mentioned above could have been avoided if they take some extra time to polish the game and delay it for a couple of months.  Will update the review when I finish the game, until then I can't recommend it.
10533	I just nominated this mess for The 'Biggest Disappointment' Award.   2K Czech made the Mafia series great, Hangar 13 took everything great about it and threw it out the window.  I had really high expectations for Mafia III, and to call it a disappointment is an understatement.  I feel that they took too much inspiration from other titles and kept too little of what the first games in the series great. I'm not saying everything they added is bad, some of it is great, but some of it is terrible and executed even worse.   Gameplay:  They showed us a badass trailer but nothing that happened in the trailer happened in game. In the trailer it looks like you will have the gang with you causing mayhem in the city of New Bordeaux, but in the game they actually just sit on their â¥â¥â¥ the whole time while you do all the heavy lifting. The game want's you to believe you're in charge of your 3 underbosses, but in reality you're running around doing everything for them.  Shooting in the game is decent enough but with only 2 weapons, it feels like they really want you to go stealth. Stealth is almost too easy, you can just whistle and knock people out all day.  Some UI elements feel very unnecessary, signs popping up along the road telling you the direction to drive, and sings hovering over weapons saying there is a weapon on the ground.  The sandbox elements in the game are rather pointless. Many buildings to break into is a cool idea, but when every building looks exactly the same inside it becomes boring pretty quickly. You can also break into junction boxes and wiretap them, so you can see all enemies in the area trough walls and all collectible items on the map.  There is a few different types of stores around the city, liquor stores, diners and such. But they have no purpose other than for you to steal money from, no clothing stores and no garages to modify your car. And since this is the future and you don't need gasoline, gas stations are only there to explode even if you didn't crash into anything. There's also no garage for you to store your favorite cars in like Mafia 2, now you call with your cellphone no I mean radio of course, and someone will deliver a car to you.  Driving in this game is so weird it almost feels like the car isn't moving, just the ground and camera. There is almost no difference what speed you have if you crash, even at low speed the screen gets red like you're about to die, but don't take any damage. Trying to drive from the road up to the pavement is not always an easy task, sometimes it goes smoothly, but sometimes it's like hitting a wall. The cars doesn't really get that banged up either, just a few dents and broken lights, but all of a sudden the engine explodes.  The AI is so stupid it's hard not to laugh at them, and even your allies will drive you down.   Controls:  No jumping is okay, but the movements of the character is so limited and you can't walk up or climb over so many of the obstacles.  I have still not done many brutal takedowns, because I just can't figure out how to do them.   Graphics:  First of, Mafia 2 came out 6 years ago and I don't see not much improvement in graphics. The lighting looks really great at times, but suddenly it is bugged and looks horrible.  Mafia was originally released only on PC. Here we have yet another poorly optimized port, but it has so many issues beside that. The 30 fps cap was nothing compared to how aged this game feels even though it came out just a few days ago. I also feel like the graphics options in this game is very limited. Just look at how Rockstar worked on optimizing GTA V for PC before they released it. It has a long list of options and it runs smoothly on older computers and looks way better than Mafia III.   Sound:   The sound is all over the place and I hear tire squealing shifting from ear to ear all the time, and sometimes in firefights it sounds like people shooting and screaming on the left, when there is nobody there. It might be a little less noticeable with speakers but with headphones it's really distracting  The soundtrack is superb. So many good tracks to drive around to.   Story:  The story is told in a documentary style and reminds me of the first Mafia. I just wish we got to know some characters more, I'm supposed to avenge some people I barly know.  The story is a bit short and I feel like I did the same thing over and over again in the side missions and the story missions were over way too fast.  I really like the setting and the feel of 1968 New Bordeaux, I just feel they put too much technology and science fiction in it.   Bugs:  The game is full of bugs and glitches: floating items, sinking cars, AI running in circles, AI driving in circles, double render of Cassandra. And many many more.
10534	So if you played Mafia 1 and 2 this will be extremely disappointing. This doesn't offer even close to the same experience as far as being a mobster, in fact you play a character taking apart a mafia in Louisiana. If there is one place that doesn't remind me of the Italian Mafia, it's Louisiana... They start the game with a disclaimer stating that they don't agree with racism which tells me that the vast majority if not all of people making the game are white and have little to no experience with actual people of other races and possibly even white southerners. I can safely say that every black person I know would have offered the feedback to the rest of the team saying, don't put that in there it makes you sound stupid. I could go on about that but it's not even close to the worst part of the game. They basically just made a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas clone based in the 60s/70s, this isn't Mafia, this is GTA. There isn't any class to it, there isn't anything remotely Italian to it. They take the main character from Mafia II and make him an ancillary throw away character who really could have been anybody. There is almost no character development in the story save for exposition by third parties in cut scenes that really aren't necessary and quite honestly become annoying as hell after the first few times they happen, but never end.   You know what I'm not going to put any more effort into this review than they did in making the game. So short answer, don't buy it unless it's on sale.
10535	I know there is gonna be a patch soon. But for now it looks like its a smartphone game
10536	If you try to find Mafia game here - it's a bad place for it. This is not Mafia, this is Mobgang squad game. Remind me PayDay. Too bad, the Mafia is dead. Graphics look â¥â¥â¥â¥. For real? 2017 coming soon! What a â¥â¥â¥â¥? + Additional to this: 30 FPS lock, crash after 40 min gameplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ subtitles. 2/10 Not coast they price. Refunded.
10537	I can't even get the game running,
10538	From my point of view - it's a shame the entire series.   The game does not match the previously stated quality. During the game you start to realize that it was made in 2005, by indie developers in a basement which is located in the suburbs of Pyongyang  Mafia 3 is a hoax and an attempt to steal from fans of the series as much money as possible for a pacifier.  This game doesn't deserve to be the heir of a series of games Mafia.
10539	I do not recomand the game,is just feel unfinished,unpolished.Apart from the 30 FPS lock the textures look blurry and one of the biggest problem for me is the lighting system beeing to dark or to shiny,switching suddenly from cloudy to sunny and all that is becoming tiring for the eyes very fast. And the handling in not simulated in any way especially that there is not a speed limiter like in Mafia 2 to just cruize along.   https://s13.postimg.org/sebb3a3uf/mafia3_2016_10_07_17_41_19_19.jpg    https://s21.postimg.org/3sgxhqz2f/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_02_41_40.jpg   https://s22.postimg.org/buz7lg96p/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_02_54_44.jpg    https://s21.postimg.org/7hwe9zdmv/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_04_22_08.jpg   https://s12.postimg.org/8a0wer5tp/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_04_25_46.jpg 
10540	970gtx 30-70 frames depending what your doing in the game , graphic arnt wow.. they are like ok  update: serveral bugs and crashes.... and really struggling to finish this game its that boring ... its one of those games where you get nothing out of it and keep waiting for something redeemable then spend so much time on it you feel you have to finish it... i would say dont even get this game get mafia 2 may not have as good graphics... but its twice the game that mafia 3 is...    playing what i have played so far capturing two whole terrorities ,this game doesnt live up to mafia 2 infact its a step backwards in many ways... you will know if you played mafia 2 before  also if your playing this because of the whole back mob thing thinking it wil be a new different kind of mob story... when your really think about it you could be playing as a white dude... yes there is racism to make you feel like your killing these dudes because of that... but its a poor attempt...  the game doesnt feel as dynamic as mafia 2 for reasons ill list below...  1. the mechanics dont feels as dynamic as mafia 2... there is something off about it i cant put my finger on it ... maybe its the fact you cant repair your engine or it doesnt die... car damage feels off i feel like i can smash into a brick wall and still drive. police dont turn up after you rob someone and corner off the building... police dont feel as aggressive.. dont set up roadblocks... dont chase you if you speed, dont stop or chase you just because they feel like it (racism?)  2. the story is super repeatitive .... like kill a bunch of dudes over and over .. collect this... yes the cutscenes tie it together (but they are starting to become a bore) but the rest of the game feels like a drag... theres no thing like (mafia 2 spoiler) rescue leo cos the mob is about to kill and also your friend is doing the hit act fast.... the story tied with the gameplay just feels a little bland  3. i dont feel any emotion for lincoln like i did vito... personally... this is possible because its a bit of a grind to play where as mafia ever bit felt like you where experiencing his life doing things for reasons... earning money for reasons... this revenge story feels drawn out... vito doesnt feel like the vito we know either ...but maybe he has changed over the years who knows.. so id allow for that ... he feels more of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ you vito... i dont care about anyone ... whereas in mafia two he cared about his family joe ect...  4. although the map is big personally i got bored of the map quick especially with all the run here do this missions.. i ended up skipping the side missions because i could tell after doing three sets of them they were completely boring ... the only reason to spend your time with it is cutscenes with the side characters  good things about the game.. are soundtrack, cutscenes.... and maybe story but i cant be arsed to grind through this to play all of it...    i recommended this game on a sale and if you dont mind grinding a bit .... good played in little bits when only doing story missions...
10541	A big dissapointment.. I'd rather buy it on sales period after 6 months or so. TOO many bugs, the missions repeatble in the same numb sequence. The crews after every racket capture are same regardles their boss, only their colors change. The story though and the numbers of missions are kinda sufficient though. Nevertheless , its a very, very sloppy outcome.
10542	Worst console port ever... Those devs give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about PC-gamer. Even with the fps-patch its almost unplayable. Full of bugs, crashes and other weird stuff.  + Story + Characters  - AI is insanely stupid - Graphics... come on man its 2016. It looks like Mafia 2 - Performance... 50 fps with GTX 980 TI, i7 4770K - Bugs
10543	I've played Mafia I, II and now this. The game looks rubbery, its extremely boring and repetive, graphics are bad and the city is not lively. This game consists of mostly grinding, assasins creed style district takeover. No soul, no true story or advancement. Everything this game consists of is repetitions and grinding. Only a few characters that have any personality or life, rest is just gray mass, for example: Holding up a drug dealer versus a high end mafia man in a mission, both act the exact same way, both areas are setup the same way enemy wise and you ALWAYS have to do the SAME thing, run up to the target and press Q, its always the same, knife on the throat and same dialogues. The game is dead, its a ripoff and a huge letdown for the erlier Mafias. You ruined a great game series with this. This is just constant NOTHING. the game makes you feel empty. And last words, this has _nothing_ to do with what Mafia games are about. This has nothing to do with Mafia, this game is about a PTSD Vietnam veteran who snapped and is brutally killing everybody. Btw, after stabbing 100 persons with the Q button, you get so bored of him cutting open throats and sticking the knife into people. Its not classy like erliers where, its plain, repetive and the last and the most horrific, its _ARCADE_. You are constantly following ONSCREEN advice and MARKERS, it takes the last bit of fun out of the game, its so arcade, so easy and so handheld game that it hurts and insults me. Please, do not buy this game, you will feel bad for supporting this ripoff, the producers are not even trying anymore, stop buying â¥â¥â¥â¥ thats coated in glitter.
10544	Crashes when you select Start Game in the launcher. Trying to raise awareness for these issues.  (Will write review when the game is fixed.)  EDIT: I have verified the game installation. I have tried reinstalling the game. I've done both of these twice. I updated my drivers. I also tried redownloading Microsoft C++ 2015. No my computer is not a potato.  Intel i5-4690K 3.50GHz GeForce GTX 970 8 GB RAM  I'm sorry I haven't included these details before. And I yes I watch some porn myself.
10545	  inconsistant crashing makes this game a miserable play at times. when it stays up, it's pretty fun. glad I didn't spend money on tihs title (came via a digital download with my MOBO)
10546	The game is fun to play and I like where it's going but it's very much unplayable at this point. I'm using a gtx 1070 and even though I can live through the 30 fps lock, the game is crashing every 10 minutes and in every cutscene. Will change review when the game gets a much needed patch to fix the crashes.
10547	  Odd and cranky movement commands. Long and many cutscenes. Quite boring at times. I love Mafia II. Not recommended to purchase at full price. I got this game free from a purchase of an Asus GTX 1060 6gb.
10548	**First Impression**  At this point in time i can't recommend Mafia III. It doesn't feel like a Mafia to me at all. It feels really choppy and the controlls feel...weird... driving also does not feel like Mafia games used to feel. To quick, cops don't care about going to fast/passing red lights..well at least they never wanted to give me a ticket yet, which was one of THE features i got hyped about in the first Mafia for some reason.   Also it looks...â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my eyes at least. First time i started it up it looked like some game from the early 2000s to me. Graphic settings were set to 'optimal' which was the standard config, so i switched to custom and upped everything to the max.... didn't see much of a difference happening.
10549	Mafia III comes strong out of the gate but then slows down and turns into a marathon grind. Many features that you would expect to be in the game are noticably absent (some are promised in future patches) and while the core gameplay of driving and shooting is satisfying, how they are executed in the game is pretty lame. Repetitive missions for each district require you to do the same 4 activities before you can challenge the racket bosses which allow you to challenge the capo. The 4 activities are: Kill some people, destroy some things, interrogate some people, or steal some things. Nothing else.  The game does contain some very notable bright spots. The representation of the location, a New Orleans-clone in 1968 Louisiana, is beautifully depicted and contains the institutional bigotry and racism that were a horrendous hallmark of the era. The characters can be compelling and interesting and the cutscenes are like watching a movie, engrossing you in the story's progression. As stated before, the shooting and driving mechanics are fun and even though it's a typical cover-based shooter, it feels more satisfying as you use your pistol to snipe shot someone 50 yards away (kind of like the AI does in other games...). The cars handle better than refrigerators on wheels, but still lack the finesse of cars with power steering. It's that delicate balance that makes driving enjoyable. Also the period soundtrack is amazing, although I'm kind of disappointed that Jimi Hendrix's 'All Along the Watchtower' is only played during the opening menu... Any fan of 1960s music will appreciate the soundtrack in the game.  Missing features plague the game to keep it from being a truly enjoyable experience. The lack of a home base to store cars, change outfits, collect earn, or even upgrade to spend money on, kind of makes the experience pretty hollow. It feels less like you're running a criminal organization and more like you're just running around killing mostly racist people in your linear quest for revenge. 2K did say that they were going to patch in character customization (e.g. the ability to change outfits), but that should have already been included from the start. Even the 60+ FPS framerate needed a patch that was released a day after the game came out. Why 2K feels the need to patch these things in at a later time is beyond me. You should not be paying $60+ dollars for an incomplete product.  Mafia III is best enjoyed in short bursts, grinding out a racket or two in between other games. I hoped that 2K wouldn't be patching in features at a later date, but it seems like that's what you're going to have to wait for. Don't buy it in its current state for full price. Wait for the new features to be patched in and then buy it. It can be an enjoyable experience and hopefully once it's complete, the game will live up to the potential that was laid down from the beginning.  Pros: - Good setting - Combat/Driving is fun - Decent main storyline, when you're not grinding it out - Good voice acting - Great soundtrack  Cons: - Incredibly stupid driver/pedestrian AI - Enemy AI is pretty shaky - Repetitive grinding for Rackets/Bosses/Capos - No character customization (promised in later patch) - No car storage - No hideout - Repetitive animations - Wonky weather system - Dated graphics - Graphical glitches - Couple of crashes (3 so far at the time of writing this review) - Feels rushed and unfinished  [Update: The devs have patched in outfit customization and car customization. But for me, it feels a little too late. I've already beaten the game and I really have no desire to go back and grind out the game just for the features they should have added in before release. I think starting now, it would be a good game to buy, on sale, at least 25% off. 2K needs to be punished for not releasing a complete game and foolishly giving them full price for an incomplete game, like I did, just rewards the bad behavior and will encourage them to do it later.]
10550	**First Impression**  At this point in time i can't recommend Mafia III. It doesn't feel like a Mafia to me at all. It feels really choppy and the controlls feel...weird... driving also does not feel like Mafia games used to feel. To quick, cops don't care about going to fast/passing red lights..well at least they never wanted to give me a ticket yet, which was one of THE features i got hyped about in the first Mafia for some reason.

10551	As of right now i think its best to wait to get this game. It starts off great but is destroyed by pc issues. The game is locked at 30 fps if you care about that and I crashed alot. Im only into 40 mins in and the game has crashed on me 4 times.   Once these issues are fixed i will update it   pc specs gtx 970 Intel core i5 4960k
10552	The game is technical tragedy. It lags, crashes and looks like a game from 2007. Also a 30fps lock, which is UNACCEPTABLE on PC.  Too bad, because the game itself is really fun, and the story is good.  They will probably fix it, but you can launch your game only once, and Mafia 3 blew it. Fix it.
10553	30 FPS lock in 2016? Your funny.  (Updated review when 2K fixes this)   EDIT:  Pros:  Fun and interesting Gameplay Great Story  Cons: Repetitive missions 30 FPS lock Mouse Acceleration Potato Graphics   EDIT 2:  The game was patched... it runs worse. I can't get a steady 60 FPS with GTX 1070 and i5 6600K?  Again. The missions go like this:  -Talk to someone -interrogate/kill/sabatoge someone -a miniscule story mission which, again, is just kill/interrogate.  The really messed up.
10554	The story seems great, but the game is of so low quality that it hurts. It feels like the developers never ever tried the game on PC. So far I've had crashes, buttons that I'm supposed to press that's not working(and then the only way is to kill the game, cause settings are then disabled). Tha game graphics also seems strange but still heavy to run.  This game seems rushed and unfinished, but it might become a great game if they put some time into fixing stuff.
10555	Perfect example of PC players being treated like second class citizens by big company, even tho it's this very people who supported them all this years. They seem to think we are their test players and not paying customers. For all those who know about X Rebirth release, This is it...   Console games not optimized for PC!!! 
10556	Mafie is not a great game. It's not even a good one. It's okay.  It's two years past (god, it turned out to be 3 already) we got GTA V and it's main competitors didn't capture what makes such games awesome.  It's a combination of interesting characters, fresh story and well though mechanics.  Unfortunately, Mafia 3 gets not more than 6 out of 10 on all of this points.  Characters are pretty stereotypical, considering ongoing political agenda. U got rough but means good black guy, you got sneaky and cocky CIA operative, you get couple italian, irish and black allies. And all of the enemies are sick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in one or the other way. Plus exactly one main character in each side is woman. 4/10  Story is also quite boring. Seen multiple times 'I'll revenge death of my close ones, while deciding weather i'm good or bad person'. Side quests are written pretty good. You get the feel of the era, but that's about it. Final twists are actually great, but they do not overcome all the boredome of 30+ hours (2 first hours and last one are good). 6/10  Mechanics is the worst here. It seems developers got lazy or cocky or put into position of rushing the game, so you basically have couple very boring things to do. Drive around, kill or kinda-kill-interrogate (shoot, until he knees, then hold one button, then actually kill him), do it 5-10 times, kill mini-boss (same as interrogation), do all of this twice, get district, assign it to one of your allies, get some quire irrelevant perk, do it all over again 8 more times.   And yeah, to maximize your profits you actually have to drive at least 18 times all across other end of the map, make routin kill of everyone around, get into the truck and slowly ride all the way back. Oops, 20 minutes just went out of the window 17 of which are dull driving. And there is no fast travel at all.  Finishers are dull, it feels like it's 15-20 of them. Stealth gets really boring fast. Takes too much time without getting things easier. You can just stay in distance and shoot everyone with best gun you have unlocked so far.   Ocassionally you get some interesting cutscene or minigame like boxing or untying yourself, but that's it. 3/10  And I get it. It's hard to develop a lot of new and fresh mechanics on every corner of the game. Learn from GTA then. Script some great missions over and over again. Put a bomb under car. Poision drugs. Wreck a train. Steal some fuel from airport. Swap cash for guns deal. Smoke out some people on a factory. Put some fun dialogues while you driving.   But you get nothing.  Game tries to be engaging, educational, eye-opening, atmospheric, dynamic, a bit of strategic and economical, a bit of RPG and raising some moral questions. Instead it turned out to be dull and cliched.  Don't waste your money or what's most important - time. Go play GTA or FarCry 3 if you still haven't.
10557	  Disadvantages: NO vehicle modifications. NO posiblity to buy/upgrade a car, house, garage. (I have half mln. cash in vault.) Many similar missions. There is useless mirrow but no cockpit view. You can't repair car or fuel up car like in MAFIA II (2)  To easy to rob a shop. Not posible to change outfits. like in MAFIA II (2)  Advantages: Open World. Good (but not excellent graphics) Posibility to change driving styles (Sim, normal ) Lots of shops to rob ( still to small reward from it) 
10558	Locked at 30fps.  UI is garbage at anything over 1920x1080.  This is quite possibly the most zero-effort port I've ever seen and I've played the original Final Fantasy 7 port that didn't let you rebind the controls off the number pad.
10559	Absolutely not recommended :(  Boring as hell...repeat, repeat, repeat...infinite loop.  0 customization, 0 alternative activities, 0 originality... -.-  Graphics are poor even for 2010... GTA V's are much much much better than this ****  This is the last Mafia I buy.  PD: Do you want a mafia experience? 'The Godfather II' is much funnier than this 'game'  2 / 10
10560	Absolutely waste of money if you think you're buying anything like the last 2 games.  Where to even begin on this money grabbing train wreak.  First of, the glitches and the bugs that are so painfully apparent in the game that should have been fixed long before release. First released on 30 FPS then an update made to reach 60.  The weather and day night system is so broken it's not funny, you can be driving at night one moment and then suddenly be driving in day the next, only to return to night a second later with completely random rain.  Secondly, there is no point in this game being open world exploration at all, the money you make can only buy weapons and ammo, there is no changing of attire, upgrading cars (I know that is coming later but it's so insanely stupid that it's not apart of the original product) No other interaction beside story line quests.  This is pathetic compared to the last 2, it's your standard triple A money grabbing peice of trash. Do your self a favour and do not buy this.  0/10 
10561	Cannot recommend this game currently, which is a shame considering how much I was looking forward to playing it. Locked frame rate of 30fps for ANY PC game is unforgivable as far as I'm concerned, give people the chance to lock the framerate themselves but don't not give an option in the first place! The graphics just seem...washed out and blurry like I'm playing the game looking through frosted glass and more like a playstation 3 port at current state. The attention to the little details also which immerse you in games like these in the little while I've played, seem poor. For example I've walked past three mirrors in Sammy's bar, not one reflection, so either secretly Lincoln is a vampire or they just forgot about those little details. Hopefully things will improve with a patch, but we shouldn't have to expect that from every game which comes out, which sadly it seems more often the case now than not. If you were looking forward to this game, give it a miss for now and wait for a patch or two.
10562	Oh well this game is so limited if it comes to physics, graphics, game settings. It's just terrible. 30FPS lock did I mentioned that? ;)   The open world is not sdo open and is very limited. Do not expect to be able to do even half of the things you can do in GTA V. GTAV thta is the proper open wirld game. Not this one.  Textures in this game and details... OMG it's just terrible.   I do not own top end game rig but it is not that bad either. GTX970, i7 4790K, 16GB of 1600MHz RAM, and the games crashes and stutters from time to time.   The game lookd really awful but the only thing that keeps me going is the story. The story is great. The rest is just not even medicore. If you're OK with that, oh well buy it. If I would knew what I know already I would wait for a sale which will probably will happen soon as the reviews are not so good...  It's your call guys but I would recommend to wait fro a sale...
10563	No UI Scaling No Cloud Saves  Even after the patch with dual 1080s the game struggles to hit 60 FPS.  People are saying that the story becomes repetitive, I have to say that I am not sure as I have not gone through it enough to find out and at this point I have stopped playing until at least the 3 issues above are rectified.   At this point in time, I definitely do not recommend it. A very bad port that makes you think you are actually living in 1968  EDIT: Engrish.
10564	âGame looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥  âGame plays like â¥â¥â¥â¥  âGame performs like â¥â¥â¥â¥   ââ¥â¥â¥â¥ game confirmedï»¿!
10565	Just a precursor to this review, I grew up playing the original Mafia back in the early 2000's and I have Mafia II for both my Xbox 360 and PC. I remember purchasing Mafia II right at release six years ago and within the first few minutes of gameplay, I fell in love with the game. Mafia II still remains one of my favorite games to this day and I'm sure I've spent hundreds of hours throughout the years playing it on my 360.   Mafia III failed to captivate me like the first two games did. The most prominent flaw lies within the art design. While the cutscenes look great, the in-game graphics at max settings, 1440p look like something out of 2006. Blurry textures, horrible lighting, poor render resolution, â¥â¥â¥â¥ yellow filter (which can't be turned off), and way too much fog are some of the most noticeable problems. Paired with terrible framerate, braindead AI, and clunky keyboard and mouse controls, this game is a major disappointment for me. Mafia II from 2010 actually looks and plays better than its successor which came out six years later. Mafia III's story and gameplay may very well be good but the technical issues are bad enough that I don't want to force myself to keep playing. Oh, and if the capped framerate wasn't bad enough, SLI doesn't work either so one of my graphics cards is acting as an expensive paper weight right now. Suck my unit, 2k. You killed one of my favorite series. Refunded.
10566	Don't waste money on this game...Go and buy Battlefield 1
10567	This is the first Mafia game I have played, everyone raved about the previous story lines so I thought I'd give it a go. How dissapointing. It doesn't run well, is riddled with bugs (cars floating without wheels etc) and is mediocre at best. The story seems to bump along and the world is lifeless. Why didn't I just load up GTA V again..?! I can't get a refund but luckily I didn't pay full price. I can't recommend this and I can't see how it will be improved even with patches, so save your money and play some GTA instead.
10568	heist was great now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy 
10569	Do not buy it, it feels like u are playing a game from 2009, very bad grafic and bad game play
10570	Unfortunately this is currently a let down. Full controller support is BS for PC at the moment. There's no corresponding display icons and the game's pop up windows require a keyboard to exit out of. Very annoying when you want to put your Steam link to use. I also had 2 crashes. Now I'm waiting for a patch to come out before I even start it up again.
10571	patch just came out - crashes every 30mins or so - - so its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game on pc - beware!!!!
10572	Windows 10 x64, nvidia geforce 980Ti 6GB... everytime computer reboot after first cutscene with Kernel-power error code 41 .. latest drivers.. X_X
10573	It was a good idea to have: - Great and intriguing story/characters - Great fitting soundtrack - Great driving engine  - Believable facial textures  It was a bad idea to release with: - 30fps lock  wait for the patch. unacceptable.
10574	Mafia II has been released in 2010 and it's still a good looking game even nowadays and also a fun game to play , I was expecting them to do the same with this title too  Mafia III is decent, but it could've been better, I feel like they don't give that much attention to us, the pc gamers  The 30 FPS Cap shows it pretty clearly, they post on the community hub and say that they are working to fix the issue and we should expect soon to be able to play in 60 FPS, is this a joke, in 2016 you release a game like this with 30 FPS Cap and also blurry textures ported from console ?   Pretty disappointing
10575	I expected a lot more. The graphics are mediocre at highest settings and although the main story is interesting, the missions get quite repetitive and boring.
10576	I want to love this game so much. It has everything required to make a good game, a interesting backstory and time, originallity and a good dev team but it falls short on every aspect but originality. The concept and story is great in theory but it does not live up to expectations in any sense of the word. The driving is too powerful, the combat is sloppy, the sneaking is just awful in general but the worst is the AI. The AI is so bad and this ruins the game. Im ashamed for it to be a mafia game As I enjoyed the previous mafia games. I do not reccomend.
10577	Screen tears and 30fps... Come on man I'm not playing a xbox one
10578	In the beginning, I felt so excited but now its really boring, everything are the same!
10579	1. Wait for patch 2. Try to play 3. Crash 4. Crash 5. Crash 6. Controller setting go off  Okay, great, now we have 60 FPS but it doesn't really help to make game any good - it still crashes every here and there, controller mapping disappear, AI is dumb as hell, your character can get stuck near knee high obstavles, cars drive awkwardly and graphics quality is way worse than Mafia 2. This game surely gets 'Dissapointment of the Year' prize.
10580	I ain't seen textures this good since WarZ!
10581	I pre-order this game and im disappointed with everything expect story. First what im going to do is cancel all pre-orders BF1, Dishonored 2, For the Honor etc... Im not gonna pre order anything. You will enjoy story for sure but gameplay, textures, low fps and other stuff you will say why the hell i bought this crap. Im not gonna lie and say i didnt enjoy even with those problems but recommend this game to someone NO WAY! I was so mad on first day of release because of 30 fps lock.  People dont pre order games because developers rush their games and make them unplayable  . They also patch 30fps and put unlimited fps but even after that game stutter and lag. Wont even talk about bugs (flying cop cars etc..). They develop this game for 6 years and what they did nothing. Mafia 2 is better in all aspects. Im so sad that Hangar13 ruined mafia series like that. I regret pre-ordering this game and buying on steam store for full price. People if you are here for the story buy the game but its gonna be frustrating play this game on 49 fps not even :S. Wait for sale or buy cheap on other site.   For those still looking how bad mafia 3 is look at this video    Mafia 2 vs Mafia 3   Thanks for reading!
10582	+ Story  + Music + Shooting &amp; AI damage hitpoints + Ambience  + Sounds are nice except for car sounds. Voice-acting is very good. The car sounds itself aren't that great and also won't adjust to surroundings (including the car horn). I have the feeling they didn't have time to implement this. They did have time to add an effect when you ride into a big garage underground and the radio signal gets messy.    -  30 fps lock on release  (removed with patch) - poorly optimized for pc - game crashes  - Low texture quality - Sometimes texture pop-ins - Weather skybox - Launcher settings not applied in-game - Broken key-rebinding. Latest patch solved a few things, but still broken.  - Enemy AI sometimes spots you through buildings - Gameplay gets repetitive  - Cars damage model - Fighting compared to previous Mafia is simplistic   Save your money. Also comparing to Mafia 2 a lot of smaller things are missing like particle physics, world interaction (police bribing, kicking doors, eating hotdogs, ..)
10583	Pros: -Awesome game -Spanish voices  Cons:  -30fps lock -developers laugh at us -30fps lock -some major bugs -30fps lock  Aditional cons: -30fps lock  note: 30/60
10584	---MAFIA III Review--- Okay folks I was very hyped for this game, honestly who wouldn't be? An open world, crime, sequel of Mafia II set in New Orleans, with freedom to approach any mission the way you please, sounds great right? What we got was horrible optimization, hardly any freedom in terms to activities, and just pure utter disappointment. The story is actually pretty good, but the way the missions are executed is horrible. You do the same thing each time, Interrogate a dude, kill some guys, break some things, then kill the boss. Rinse wash repeat. It's horrible, but the one thing I'm utterly disappointed in is the lack of activities in the game. In Mafia II, speeding was considered a ticktable offense and you could actually get tickets. Now they just throw themselves at you and try to gun you down. You can't even sit down at the diner and enjoy some good ole' southern Boudain, you can merely rob it for it's petty cash. This game was rushed out, and poorly executed. I do not recommend this game for the price of $60...
10585	The game itself is great. The storyline is awesome, the cut scenes are really detailed and well polished BUT and I mean this is a big but, this game isn't ready. Like everyone else, the 30FPS lock is extremely frustrating. It took me a while to get used to it enough so I could play it. Also, i've noticed randomly the game will freeze for a few seconds, then resume, then freeze again when I am entering a new area. (This isn't a hardware issue I run all other games just fine). A lot of people are saying stop being so hard on the devs for the issues but I disagree. These are easy fixes that should have been seen way before launch day. If you haven't bought the game yet, I would wait until the the patch comes out to fix these issues.
10586	Buy Watch Dogs 2.  ACTUALLY optimised and has more gameplay variety.
10587	I loved Mafia 1 and 2 and I was excited to buy Mafia 3. But I was Disappointed when I played it. It felt like Mafia 3 took a big step backward's. It felt like 2k games didn't play Mafia 1 or 2. You can not do anything in the environment. The thing I loved the most in Mafia 2 is the Interaction with the world around you. In Mafia 3 the world around you is dull and boring. The people just walk and weight and in Mafia 2 the NPC walked, talked to you and other people, they look at stuff and waved they even read newspapers. you can open the hood and trunk of your car but you cant do that in Mafia 3. And the police are so @#&amp;! frustrating in Mafia 3 but in Mafia 2 the police arent to bad and you can bribe the police. The only thing I liked about Mafia 3 is the story and songs. This is just my opinion.
10588	complete waste of money...lame graphics, horrible gameplay. Only good thing is the setting and music imo
10589	When Mafia 1 is more realistic than GTA V and Mafia ||| shame !!!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI 
10590	Worst game ever ! and No Turkish Language Support !  Just watch it u can understand what i mean :P   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKTZObO3bew 
10591	This is the worst Mafia title to date. First problem 30fps lock for PC. Second problem, bad console port considering Mafia was always a PC title when it first came around back in the days. Third problem, there's no customization what so ever, you can't go into any stores to buy clothes or anything, the only purpose the stores have is to rob the cash register and there's hardly any around. Fourth problem, there's no longer any gas in vehicles, which was always a thing in Mafia games, so gas stations have no purpose what so ever. Fifth problem, regular crashes from time to time which makes it unbearable to play. Sixth problem, there's CONSTANT pop-up windows trying to explain â¥â¥â¥â¥ to you over six hours into the game. For â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake 2k, what the hell did you idiots take making this game? Seventh problem, they're reusing waaaaay to many assets for missions and side-missions. What a joke and the list goes on.  One positive thing I found in this title was the radio messup when driving through tunnels, that was a really nice touch.  I'd recommend Mafia I or II, but III not going to happen. Wait for patches and mods to come out before playing this title unless you want cancer. 2.0/10.  'I never asked for this.' - Adam Jensen.  Added video that shows just how better Mafia II is vs Mafia III:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA 
10592	EDIT: The patch has landed and with it there is some good news and bad news, perfomance is everywhere, if you get 60, be glad, some people even with gtx1080 can't reach 60, it's still early though, i myself can't get the option to work and i will have to do a fresh install i think, but i will do that later, ui scale has not been fixed yet so it is still rather bad for my screen sadly.  It's still early for the game and they have promished more patches, it is a good start, but the game is still not in a good shape of what you can expect from a pc game.  Wait for a sale if you want the story, and if you use a widescreen monitor (aspect ratio 21:9) be sure to check that the ui scale has been fixed, else you will have a really bad experience with it.  TDLDR; Bugs a plenty, fps is fixed (mostly) performance is all over the place and with a screen that goes above 1080p be sure to check for bugs on the net on forehand, i can not recommend the game right now.  The story however should be excellent, sound fantastic and gameplay good, but for me the game has too many issues regarding my system (ui scale, turning my keyboard light off and oddly enough options not saving so i can't use the new 60fps/unlimited, will try a fresh install later, but for now the new options aren't working even when changed manually in the configs).  Edit: As it seems people do not understand what i mean by UI scale, if you play at 1080p it is most likely fine, but at 1440p, oh boy the game will most likely be unplayable   http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/438364144686443853/B5390B400B7C541B203BAC2D6D5BE88DD048A798/   You can check my other screens of the game as they are from the same screen and how they look at various resolutions, the aspect ratio is 16:9 and the screen I'm using is a pg279q rog swift.
10593	sh!t, â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥. System exceeds minimum but can't get the game to play. Grrrrr
10594	I really wish I didn't buy this game..I played both Mafia &amp; Mafia 2 and loved them both. I was so excited for this one that I actually pre-ordered it, something I rarely do. Came home from work on the day it released and played it for probably 6 hours straight. I have to admit, the storyline and cutscenes had me gripped at first, but it was quickly overshadowed by the horrible performance issues and constant crashes. I soon realized that the game is extremely repetitive, something I didn't expect at all. It's literally the same type of missions over and over and OVER..what were they thinking..!?  Now, several weeks later, I don't even play it anymore. Even after the 'performance updates', the game runs pretty much just like before; like â¥â¥â¥â¥. I even went out and upgraded my GTX 960 to a GTX 1060 6GB...almost zero boost in performance (at least none worth mentioning). I get pretty much the exact same FPS as before, even though all my other games run amazing now. From what I've been reading, even people with 1080s and i7s struggle to get 50-60 FPS, which is just pathetic!! So many bugs and glitches in the game that it really takes you out of the zone and reminds you that you're playing a video game...a crappy one at that. No joke, I have played early access games that were more prepared for release than this garbage - it's a slap to face! It's completely disrepectful, something EA would do!!  I'm not even mad...I'm terribly upset and disappointed. I have waited several years for this game to come out and it was a total failure in my book, or at least the PC release. If you ask me, 2k should be working their asses off to get this game running perfectly and from what I see, they've shown almost no remorse and have done very little to fix their screw-up of a game. They released this game entirely too early and they know it. It's so horribly optimized that it's laughable and if I even thought for a second that Steam would give me a refund, I'd be fighting like hell for it.  Total waste of money and I will think twice before buying Mafia IV, or any 2K or Hanger 13 game for that matter.  AND BY THE WAY - After reading these positive reviews, I'm convinced the majority of people are either paid to write positive reviews, or they have some type of affiliation with the creators. There's no freaking way someone could think so highly of this, much less ever recommend it to their friends. They aren't very good friends if so.
10595	This review is into the technical aspect of things; I might update it when I am getting a bit more into the actual gameplay.   However, the first look at this game cries 'lazy port from console' out of every of its voids:  - 30 fps lock and graphics look like rendered from an internally low resolution badly upscaled to the actual screen resolution - in fact, lower graphic settings can give a clearer pictures. For example, the higher the antialias settings, the more the picture is smeared onto the screen. Yes, less jaggies around the edges, but not in a good sense, because less detail overall. To make it even more tedious, every game restart revertes antialias back to high - though you can choose lots of screen resolutions, not all of them play out properly. For example, 1920x1080 resolution will have text messages on the screen that overlap each other in an akward and sometimes unreadable way - There is a menu to rebind controls, however a) not all keys that work in most PC games as bind are possible and b) even if you can rebind a control doesn't mean it will work ingame (for example, binding movement controls to mousebuttons are accepted in the binding screen, but simply won't work later)  I know the devs are saying they have a PC patch in the making. However, from what I have seen so far, I don't expect too much. So far, it looks like the game is ported from consoles (and their quality definitions, meaning peasant hardware) via an emulator, and system requirements have been defined by: - Minimum: Anything that can run the game - Recommended: Anything that is able to reach the 30 fps lock  So, my expectation for the patch is what I experienced with Evil Within: PC Patch for uncapping fps, leading to max. 40 fps given the recommended hardware instead of 30 fps locked. And we don't know if the game will run into problems later when there is more than 30 fps, because what I have seen so far from (obviously not!) testing different settings (see the text overlap problem at 1920x1080 resolution and the control binding problems) says 'give the pc guys some options so we can say we did, who the hell cares if they work properly'.  Maybe they should have taken the GTA V approach and take a year to make it an acceptable port to PC.  So to summarize: In its current state, I cannot recommend the game given its AAA price while its subpar technical quality. Not broken, but there is definetly some room for improvement.  UPDATE / Addition after the Patch 1.01 on 9th of october:  Framerate not locked to 30 fps anymore. However, quite exactly what I expected: It is running at 40 fps now. Well, when fiddling with the settings it gets the fps into the playable 50ies (floating between 40 and 80 depending on the rendered scene).  Also quite expected about the rest of the patch: Though they said they worked on the control bindings, what I would like to have as control layout STILL DOESN'T WORK. Concerning the antialias setting not saving: I had to redo it once, however, another time it was saved correctly between games. Lets see how that works out in the long run.  So, there is improvement, at least I am getting not so sick from playing anymore, however there is still a long way to go. This patch made the game from a no-no to rather no.  Addition 10th october:  After playing a bit longer, I got to say that i am not impressed. Other bugs, annoyances and general cheap and lazy programming / design attitude are just the icing on the unsharp low fps graphics: - uneven loudness of character voices in one and the same dialogue  - drove the car into water -&gt; instant death - characters doing idle / bored animation while talking a sad story about their past   The story can't make up for all that shortcomings, lazyness, and sheet.  Unfortunately, it's too late for a refund now. Thanks to all the defenders of bad games who say you can't judge if you haven't play long enough. My initial impression didn't change. So, lets just eat this subpar thing because we paid for it, and get even more cautios when preordering next time.  So my final suggestion is: Buy it when its price tag falls below 20 bucks. Because it is a poor man's gta v. But still needs a very beefy graphics card. I get two times the fps in gta v compared to this â¥â¥â¥â¥ here.  Update 25th november: Game still sucks. I just nominated if for the âPutting an end to a great franchise by totally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the latest installmentâ Award
10596	As a punitive action for this developer releasing the game in a state contrary to previous representation I am submitting a permanent negative review. Developers have a responsibility to stop doing this. I will not change this review. Redistributable files such as directx and c++ should install automatically before startup. Graphics options should be greater or equal to console equivalint, not less. I had to sit through 5 minutes of game crashes to be authorized to leave this review.
10597	Well, I never add comments to steam games, but I believe that I'll save money for some of you.  # All missions are the same  # Many bugs that're drivig me crazy, like:   Boss that stuck in the wall and you can't interact with him  enemies that see you in two floors above of you   Items that you have to destroy but you can't  and many more... # Missions are too easy.  # You can kill squad of enemies with only knife # Stupid bots  Bottom line, this gave not deserve this price!!! 
10598	Mafia III review from someone who played 1st and 2nd many times  I won't beat around the bush, 3rd part was a complete disaster from my point of view. No feeling of Mafia at all, some guy from the hood wants a revenge and goes berserk. I managed to pass the game regardless of pain and agony in my heart thinking how they managed to name this game after Mafia franchise...  Some pointers in general  Negative: - Main character goes whole game with no suit on ('very mafia like...') - No public transport throughout the city (there are rails, but nothing ever goes on them...) - City in general looks vague and empty (expected more from game this size) - Mafia 1 AI was better than here (it tells alot, and no, it's not a joke) - Don't look into the sky - Car handling reminds Need for Speed - 0 challenge - Cops... what cops... - Because of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ police there is no speed limiter for your vehicle anymore too..  - About 90% of the game you will be doing one and same thing in same places - Very little dialogues or any kind of input through out the game (like some capo speaking next to you while you drive to places), makes whole story look bad with missing pieces - They managed to put VITO in some district manager's place... what can i say...  Positive: - Cinematic and lip sync was great, really great - I won't need to pass this game again  Creators took everything great from this game and added Assassin's creed and GTA elements. Do not buy this game, at least not for price it goes now.  
10599	Pros: - Interesting main characters and story. - Awesome soundtrack Cons: - Mandatory sandbox to progress. Boring routine. To play each story mission player should grind for 2 hours. - Mediocre story missions.  - No characters development in missions. - Not consistent and sometimes awful graphics. - Strange control scheme. Why scope is on another button that aiming down sights? - Cowardly consumer-unfriendly marketing with embargo on reviews before release.  5/10. Mediocre and boring game. Not candidate for buying even on discount.  
10600	An abomination of the Mafia series. Repetitive mission design and glitches ruin the foundations of an excellent game. The game does not appear to be running in native 1080p and is one of the blurriest messes I've seen this generation.  HARD PASS. Buy for $5 when (and if) they fix it.
10601	Had high hope's but  Despite all the AMD claims I am all AMD and this game runs fine. But it all ends there  awful Graphics 3/10 .30fps lock so what all Maxed Vsnk off no stutter.I experienced a lot of clipping and see thru Played 48 min on PC  played 4 hours with nefew on PS  Graphics looks no different then the PS version. I wont even re-buy it on sale for 20 bucks   Story ;Dime store book at best After 1 hour on PS it was old and predictable  Played the 48 min on hardest settings Pc All I can say is Really WTF. A 10 year old could beat this game with out a Youtube vid or a walk thru guide there is nothing to do but follow all the markers and thats annoying as all hell. Aiming on hard is easier than most games on med No in car cam driving is sluggish and slow.Even if follow all the rules of the road you will have cars pulling in front of you all the time.Seems I spent most of my driving time going around things. BOO If you want to Refund this game in the 1st 2 hours you will only have 15 minutes game play. The rest will be spent Driving LOOOOOOOOng distances and watching cut scenes. If you are 10 you will love this game . If you are looking for a challenge forget it. This is not a game It is a Movie that you get to move a character around in sometimes getting to shoot and pick something up  I guess you could call it a collecting game also. There's most likely that part.I saw some things to collect. so is just a guess  very disapointed with this game  Refunding
10602	So personally I've never bought many games on launch day. I'm always the guy reading reviews about day 1 crashes and instability problems. This time the role is reversed.  This review isn't about the game, rather it's about the frequent crashing.   Every time i go into a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cutscene i get a CTD. This is awful considering when i load back up the game, the cutscene is over and I have to piece together what happened.   Please fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs. I'm not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about the 30 FPS Cap here, I simply want to watch the cutscenes on a story based game.
10603	  Repetetive quests and lack of variations in cars in traffic, weapons and quests. Mainquests are almost like the sidequests.  You do not feel that you have made a difference or that you have come forward after some quests.  Feels like the game are 50% done. Like the deadline were too close and they just had to give us SOMETHING at the realase day...  Otherwise, it's good graphics and a good open world. But that doesn't compensate the cons at all. For me it is a uninstall after just 8.3 hours of gaming...  Had high hopes on this game after Mafia: 2.
10604	So the 1.1 patch is out now and despite the fact that my PC can play Witcher 3 in Ultra Settings, modded mind. GTA V in Ultra Settings, Doom in Ultra settings all at 60fps (you get the picture) this isn't going over 42fps at the best of times. Not to mention so many graphical glitches and low res textures popping up. Never mind the repetitive missions, the only thing that is keeping me going is the interesting storyline (And most of that happens in pre-rendered cutscenes and shows you what the game could look like if they actually bothered).
10605	It was a big disappointment, for some people, it's entertaining for sure, you feel superior and strong, but it is a disaster compared to mafia 2, i don't even know where to start. 1. The vehicle physics are unbelieveable, it's a absoulte joke, in Mafia 2, you feels like you're really driving a heavy, solid car. 2. The NPC have no character, when you stroll around the streets in mafia 2, you walk at a normal speed, different people have different postures, different reactions, everything tells a story, but in mafia 3, every civilain are the same in a way. 3. The objects around Lincoln. I walked into cassandra's home, accidently knocked over a bunch of stools, they fell and break into pieces and then disappear, Okay. 4. You just keep playing, there is not much to tell, repeat repeat repeat, at the start, it's compelling, then mid-way though, you just feel like Marcano and his goons are bunch of weak studds, no one will travel with you, talk with you except for Donovan, the whole story is just lost it attractiveness, the Father James thing was also a nice touch but then it's also just not interesting to play anymore. 5. Hand to Hand Combat or takedowns, way to eaisy, some are good, most of it aren't, it makes the enimes too weak, the enimies also have no personality presence whatsoever, they are all the same, they all lack any self-preservation, stupid af, and weak, their reaction to bullet hits are also disappointing, makes you feel good but I'm not impressed with it at all like when you punch a gu in the face, he fainted, like they are acting poorly to pretend they are knocked out by lincoln. 6. Things you can do, no eating , no sleeping, no changing, no nothing, and no replaying levels, either lives and the town that you rule or start a new game, the ending was not powerful by all means, you felt like that's it, okay, goodbye. 7. Bullets hits, try shooting a car and then'll know, the glass physics is â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor, there are also no solid bullet holes, when you shoot a enemy, the guns acts like a health reductor instead of a gun, the sounds are not good the reactions of enemies are also bad. 8. Finished the game in the diffculty set to hard, still not hard and i didn't even used backups, cutting phone lines, bribing cops and weapon van, not even once. 9. the building an empire thing just dont fit well with a mafia story, it's like the underworld or criminal sim city. 10. the scene shown in the launch trailer felt nothing like the game. 11. the lsit could go on and on
10606	Played in 4k and boy is it a shity port. No UI scaling, glitches and draw distance is a joke.  sound 9/10 they should show the title of the songs , grafiks 2/10 (4k ultra), shity draw distance, shity skybox and half of the textures is â¥â¥â¥â¥, story cutscenes 6/10 story was ok  story gameplay 2/10 almost no mission variety collectibles 10/10.. collecting playboys was ok i guess  complaints: can only carry 2 guns, dumb AI, limited number of cars,   positives: aesthetic of the 60s :)   buy on sale for 10$
10607	I loved Mafia II so I was expecting something good here. But this game does not hold up to the old game, not at all. I find myself doing the same stuff over and over and over again, it quikly gets boring! Now, it's not that this game is such a bad game, it's not! But if you compare it to Mafia II it's not that good. If you have not played the second game I would recommend this game, but if you've played the second I'm not sure it's worth it. Kind of ruined the whole Mafia name for me.   There's not much detail in the game and it repeats it self too much. The graphics are nice but it doesn't matter if the game's not that good.   It was hard giving this game a thumbs down because Mafia means so much for me, but I'm hoping the dev. team can learn from this mistake.
10608	Well the game overall has huge potential but its held back by MAJOR FLAWS -HORRIBLE textures, absolute garbage,so many examples but go look at the water....it will make you cringe -HORRIBLE controller support, wont even show what buttons do what in controller layout, just shows nothing...been guessing the entire time as i dont want to play this game with k&amp;m, cant even figure out how to whistle or throw grenades. -bad 21:9 support if any, start menu is unnavigatable in 3440x1440, in game is fine for some reason after switching from 2560x1440 -30fps cap (if not fixed) -overall looks muddy like there is extreme TAA on at all times even with low AA -no button to stop sticking to cover  THE GOOD -characters are great and have alot of depth so far -Story is also really good so far (as it should be being a linear game) -DRIVING SIMULATION...thank you for that, it feels great to have different surfaces impact drifting/stopping to varying degrees -shooting supprsingly feels very good as well had alot of fun dumping a full clip of a thompson into Baka (only to have him take a knee and wait for a cut scene... really?) -lighting i feel is very good too, if only the AA and textures didnt suck so hard.  overall i feel the game isnt worth 60 dollars right now, they really need to fix the textures and AA or whatever makes this game look like im playing a cool game with vaseline slathered glasses on, because while the gameplay and story are very likeable right now, the graphics keep breaking the immersion (and so is the framerate, if you dont have Gsync, even if you do have it it would be 100% better at 60fps+)    EDIT: so the patch has just dropped and lets just say the decision to refund was almost instant lol, worst port ever. the game was capped at 30fps because theres no way in hell ur gonna run this at 60+fps unless ur at 1080p. couldnt get more than 50fps (this wasnt a constant 50 either, more,like average 45) when absolutley nothing was going on around me in a decently empty area in the game (keep in mind i run witcher 3 anywhere from 50 on very rare occasions all the way up to 90 fps on ultra without AA or hairworks on 3440x1440p). Its a real shame too as the story actualy did have me wanting to play more but i just cant do it, its no many sky performance all over again. :(
10609	Crashes on startup
10610	I really wanted to love Mafia 3, but Mafia 3 has been a huge let down. The game is simply abysmal. I've refunded and no matter how much they patch it, the first playthrough will be etched on my mind. This game could have been utterly superb but they botched it. Not only that, they misrepresented the quality too which is awful business practise. This game is not worthy to be in anyones Steam library. It should be tied up and dumped into the nearest river, I'm sure even Lincoln Clay would want that.
10611	Just more â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy developers.
10612	Pre-refund review, please take with a grain of salt.  Graphics-wise, it feels completely unfinished.  - Lots of blurriness or flat out ugly textures (even at 4600x1600 res). - Recurring visual glitches, such as a massive shadow on the ground approaching you when switching from overcast to clear day (and it swung back and forth between the two 4-5 times). - Car parked in garage before a cutscene got fused into the ground, turning it into scrap metal. - Sunlight bloom (or, well, not proper bloom, just a huge bright spot) clips through all objects, literally couldn't see the road in front of me because of it despite that it cut through a wall and a tree. - Graphics options are lacking, cant even turn off AA.  Gameplay-wise, your painfully average console game mechanics all the way.  - AI is typical, either stands and just shoots or runs to cover and peeks out to easily be killed, nothing worth mentioning. - Difficulty level doesn't mean much, since you're never pushed up on by the AI it's just a matter of hiding and waiting for the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ health regen. - One-button takedowns all the way, because apparently it's all about showing off animations rather than trying. - Melee is pretty much just running up and spamming one button. - Stealth is about as unimaginative as usual. Sneak up, takedown. Sneak up, whistle, takedown. Yawn. - Good point is that the enemies at least don't take 30 bullets each to kill. So at hard difficulty you can at least pretend that it's somewhat realistic. - Driving physics are fairly good at simulation mode. Crashing still seems to have no effect, with the other car often being pushed aside while you keep on driving like nothing happened. - Cops are surprisingly effective, they managed to pop two tyres and ram me into a river, nice stuff. Stopped chasing the moment I started swimming though, so meh.  None of this touches on the storyline, which I reckon is the game's strong point, because with max 2 hours I wanted to test as much as possible before 'playing for real' the next time around. However, there seems to be extremely few moral choices, so it appears that we're just along for the ride.
10613	If you liked mafia 1 and 2 you will be disapointed.  'The game is an insult to the series. What were they thinking!?
10614	Save your money and don't buy this.  The game repeats the same pattern over and over again. Kill, interrogate, destroy, steal. In some places when you have cleared a place from enemies, 10 minutes later you have to do it again, as a boss guy has appeared there.   Npc AI is weird. People can't drive at all! Ordered a shiny new car and some ammo at my location, only to find that the driver for the new car drives straight into a pole, and the ammo van crashes his car to mine a few seconds later!  I found it ridiculous when the main character was soaked in gasoline, only to light the lighter himself just a moment afterwards to light up the enemy who was also soaked in gasoline by the player. Like that wouldn't have ignited the main character as well.  The skybox is the ugliest thing I've seen in a while. And I've seen a lot of things.  Soundtrack is awesome. Voice acting is great.   I only remember a couple of fun and interesting moments in the game. That's it.
10615	Just a bad game. I'm surprised there are any good reviews.   Listen to the reviews and save yourself the money
10616	So far, lm enjoying the game. The animations, gunplay and music are on point, and the story is being told in a very interesting and enganging way.  However, due to performace issues, l simply cant reccomend this. Even with the patch, I can't get more than 50 FPS,even if l turn all settings to low, with a PC that has better specs than the ones reccomended by the developer.  Also, wtf's up with the new wanted system? It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. If a witness calls the cops saying some random car was stolen, the cops will not only immeditaely now it was you even without having your description or licencse plate, but will continue to pursue you if by the time they arrived you're on a different car, and they'll shoot to kill.Just for stealing a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car. This is a major downgrade from Mafia 2's wanted system (which in my opinion is the best in any game). You can't even picklock cars anymore.  Also, on the subject of cars, is it just me or they never â¥â¥â¥â¥ing break? I need to crash several times at high speed just to see a dent in a car ffs.  Lastly, the missions so far, save for the first few ones, have been really repetitive. Go to an enemy truf, kill them, then either kill a VIP, steal some â¥â¥â¥â¥, or destroy â¥â¥â¥â¥. Over and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing over again.   To sum it up, Mafia 2 is a better game overall.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0           Also, the mirrors in this game... they're a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. The fact that mafia 3 is sooooo much worse than mafia 2 is already â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. But the fact that literally Duke Nukem has better mirrors than Maifa 3????? WHAT THE ACTUAL â¥â¥â¥â¥ï»¿ DUKE NUKEM CAME OUT 20 YEARS AGO AND HAD AN ENGINE MADE BY ONE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GUY
10617	Whith this game i was expecting a colorful story driven and rich quest much like Mafia 2, not true here you have a rinse and repeat game play. however although the textures are better the driving physics are spongy at best, the cars don't damage as they should. The gunplay is poorly optimised and makes Clay an unrealistic one man army. The best way to sum up this game is to say that it has the graphics of a GTA game and the game play of Saints row.
10618	The game has flickering bars on 3440x1440 which for a 'next gen' game should NOT BE!  The Bloodsplatter Overlay is set to 16:9 and stays like that even if you play on 21:9... which is REALLY ANNOYING. Dont forget the 30fps cap which never got revealed until the last day before release...   So a BIG MINUS. Overhyped trash like No Mans Sky
10619	I am a huge fan of the mafia series. Been playing since xbox (mafia 1). I don't recommend this game because my system is well beyond the recommendation, yet I cannot get it to run at 60 fps unless I lower the settings to 720p. Even like that, it still drops framerate to below 45fps sometimes and the screen makes all the letters and everything so big that it covers the screen. With my system, I should be able to run the game at 4k 60fps like my other games. I think this game has some problem with nvidia and just generally does not work well. I bought it becuz I love the series, but I would suggest waiting until after they fix all bugs and the game starts running well on pc at 60 fps with max settings. Just play mafia 2 for now. That runs perfect.
10620	After Mafia II, this is a disgrace. Batman 2.0 is what you get here. I am someone that can tell a difference between 60hz and 144hz. 30FPS locked is unplayable for me. I play at 4K resolution and this game does not even support UI scaling. Everything requires me to lean forward to be able to read. The AI is god awful and stupid. They stand right in front for you to shoot them. After playing shooters like The Division, the gun gameplay in Mafia 3 feels stiff and clunky.   I never ever pre-order games and I regret I did for this one. Mistake made, lesson learned. At least I didn't pay full price for this POS port. Wait for a super patch if ur on the fence. But I will say the VO and the storytelling so far are top-notch.
10621	Nice launcher and music! Now if only the game worked...
10622	A warning to those who are thinking about buying the game. I would hold that thought for a few more days - you probably aren't going to be playing it anyway.  I really don't have a problem with the graphics. Heck, I think the game looks pretty good (so far). My problem is with how it plays... Or rather, how it doesn't play.  You can't remap keys. If you do, it apparently 'disables' that key permanently. At least that's what it did for me. - I remapped the 'Stalk' (crouch/sneak) key. Before the remap it was working. Now it isn't - and it doesn't work if I change it back either. This means I am unable to sneak, a pretty important thing really...  In addition the game keeps crashing/freezing - often, but not always, during a cutscene. When I load the game up again I am on to the next mission. This effectively means I lost part of the story. In one instance I didn't really know why I was on a mission... The story behind the mission was basically 'skipped' because the game had crashed.  To summerise.:  The game is broken -- unplayable for most people. Don't buy it until they fix it. A shame really, cause it looks so good. 
10623	I am sick of watching game trailers and being wowed only to be given a lemon when it comes out.   spend thousands on a high end PC so people on console can enjoy a smooth 30fps  Do i refund now and maybe buy it again if they fix it? or hold it in wait for a patch to give us a game that is represented in the trailers and screenshots of the game?, and not get a refund as we held it too long.....  Chances are most people buying it on PC have a Pretty decent gaming rig for todays standards and yet this shows how much they know / care / listen to gamers on PC. Like the corporate world we â¥â¥â¥â¥ing have to live in now, they care more about sales to consoles than delivering a game that is complete, tested and what people want.  i cant bare to play this game on my 4k monitor and 4k rig its like i need glasses or there is something in my eyes its got this annoying cheap blur to it, and like No mans Sky if you dont make it at least 60FPS and i see it crisp up, ill be getting a refund regardles of the gameplay, just looks so cheap.  So far i say wait, at least till 60fps patch, music and area and era seem good, and car handling is pretty good so far. will update is any changes for people with 4K setups
10624	I'm already stuck with the first mission, im suppose to take a guard down by pressing 'Q' for stealth attack but nothing happends. I love this game already.
10625	I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW  1080p max settings! 40-60 fps? really?????? this game is extremely poorly optimized for pc! like most games! except Gta 5! i freaking could play gta 5 on high 60 fps with gtx 560!    you guys should learn something from rockstar! how a open world game should really be!.   i gave you guys first a good phrase but now we get 60 fps patch my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pc can't run it stable 60 fps? and the graphics ain't that special as well . nothing happens on the screen as well.... why am i getting 10-15 frame drops with my pc???   disappointed! also there was a guy that made a 60 fps patch before you guys literally 1 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guy was faster than a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing studio!! i used it and was getting same fps drops so i thought it would be the guys fault who made it...... and expected that if i waited for you that i would get stable 60 fps fix. WTF!! literally WTF!   The game weapon combat sucks! its like we shooting with paint! they don't get bullet wounds, only get splatted with blood! hit the feet their whole body is bloody like we shot them with freaking paintball gun  Car physics sucks  Game performance suck graphics is nothing special. weapon combat sucks! when you kill someone they become ghosts and nothing hits them anymore you only can paint them with ( blood )if you want with your paintball guns.   with something looking like that i should be getting 100 fps with my pc.  Just because the story is good &amp; music track is good, that we should forgive all those other â¥â¥â¥â¥ that we cannot accept... no sir..... but why would you guys care right just make the money and you are good.. â¥â¥â¥â¥ us right   its like the game was made in 2013 and they tweaked a tiny tiny bit and released in 2016.  mafia 2 was way way more authentic &amp; realistic than mafia 3 and i do not think that it will get better from this point.   There you go! mafia 2 vs mafia 3! look which one is way more authentic &amp; more realistic   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0   mafia 3 has a good story &amp; sound but the game content is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥! look at mafia 2 why couldn't you just LOOK first before developing mafia 3!!    I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW  I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW  I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW   This is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t !
10626	This game was not what it was hyped up to be. I had fun playing but it's not worth $60. Wait for a sale.
10627	AMD Phenom users beware, this game requires SSE 4.1 and 2K has yet to aknowledge the problem and say they are working on a fix for this. If you have ANY CPU that does not support SSE 4.1 you WILL crash on start-up of the game. DO NOT BUY unless 2K resolves this issue or until you upgrade to a newer CPU.
10628	Performance is awful. Not unplayable but definitely not desirable. 2K please fix. Will update review if it's fixed.
10629	This game has a great potential but the devs didn't want to use it.  This game is a lack of things!   CONS:   -Graphics (shadows are not good, police light awful, sunrise and sunset are too bright). It looks like an old game  -Glitch and bugs (some textures are awful)  -You can't change your outfit (It's not normal in a free roam game), eat, buy cars or sleep (like in Mafia II)    PRO:  -Old vehicles are beautiful  -Music is awesome !  -The plot is very good and interesting (It's good choice to set the game in the 60s)   I hope that this review will be read! The devs, if the want to improve the game, MUST add other things and improve graphics! In this state this game looks an alpha not a complete game!    
10630	Graphics are blurry and upscaled. The game crashed twice within the first 20 minutes and the fps lock doesn't make it any better either.
10631	At this time its a Major Disapointment! But its becoming the norm in the gaming industry. Mafia II was produced by 2K Czech' A great game'. Mafia III has added Hangar 13 to the developers pool. If this is a good thing I am failing to see it.  I want to love this game based on playing previous titles but I cant keep the game running long enough to do so.  No where in the awesome movie trailers does it say:   This game may fail to load This game may crash repeatedly This game is locked at 30 Fps This game has resolution issues This game is not ready to launch This game ' Fill in the blank'  Please pay us $59.99 so you can tell us whats wrong with our game that we failed to test for our selves. Actually we knew it was not ready but launched it anyway.   I know patches will come out and fix a majority of the issues and the game will be awesome eventually.
10632	How do you take such a great game franchise and â¥â¥â¥â¥ it up.Its easy, just take everything great about Mafia 2 and make sure you don't put it in Mafia 3.Oh yea, Make sure you release the game with crippled frame rates, Because you know PC gamers will love that.Not to mention game crashes,Lost game saves.  If all the cut scenes were done with the game engine.I have to ask,What game engine were you using,Because its sure as hell was not the one that I got.  Last but not least make absolutely sure the game is painfully repetitive.  Steam would not give a refund since it showed 4 hours of game play. Well Steam half an hour of crashes and the last crash I walked away from the pc not knowing it was still running in the background.It did run a half hour the first time I ran it before it started crashing.
10633	i tried to 100% this game but it failed to keep me hooked to the very end, which isnt a THAT bad of a thing. ever single quality of this game (driving, shooting, sneaking, ai) are all very OK, ASIDE from the story. the story if very very good but the game really makes you work for it by making repeditive side-mission-quality tasks part of the main story. if you want a really good story definatly pick this up during a sale. i cant recommend the story enough but everything else is holding it back so im not going to give it a thumbs up.
10634	Locking the framerate is bad enough, locking it as low as 30 FPS is even worse, but the move that ensures I'll never again pre-order a 2k game again was the fact that they refused to hand out advance copies to reviewers.  This shows a clear awareness that this was a serious problem that would affect pre-orders and sales in general, but rather than informing us about it before release, they did their best to conceal it and keep racking up pre-orders.  Acknowledging the problem and promising a fix is a good start, but the lack of an admission that they intentionally hid this, not to mention the lack of an apology, makes things crystal clear. This is an attempt to minimise refunds and salvage future sales, not an admission that they behaved poorly, or that they will learn a lesson and do better in the future.  This kind of unrepentant deceptive behaviour is unacceptable, and I for one will think long and hard before ever buying another 2k game, and definitely won't pre-order one again.
10635	Buy on sale. like 50%-70% off  You can't keep any car you find. Nothing to do besides the story poor graphics bad physics Repedetive gameplay  The lack of quality and repetitiveness of the game makes it sad and boring. i feel like i have to force myself to play the game, and i don't want to just go around and explore the open world because there isn't really anything to do. The level of detail and small extra features from mafia 2 are gone. The best thing about this game is probably the soundtrack.
10636	EDIT: This is not a complete review, as it focuses only on graphics. for me, for pc gaming, that is a prerequesite, that, if not met, does not require any further gameplay review, as I wouldnt play it. Good graphics and tweaking abilities are a prerequisite for a AAA Gaming experience imho.  --------  So, does NO ONE care that the resolution is upscaled?  That is not glitchy graphics, that is less resolution than advertised and less as seen in the 2015 gameplay vid. Again, like in Witcher 3.  That results in blurry graphics so that even a bit further away nothing appears really sharp, rather broken down in lines, blurs and undistinguishable shapes. (no fps issues for me i7-4770K, 16GB R, 970) This bluriness becomes most obvious with moving objects, like cars.  My native resolution would be 1920x1080.   Again, the RESOLUTION IS ONLY UPSCALED FROM 720p.  And that is why I cannot recommend to buy the game, because for me that is so off, so insulting as a PC Gamer that I cannot and cannot go past the first few turns in the first mission.  So, in all honesty, this isn't only an offer you cannot refuse, this is an offer you should definately refuse until they fix the resolution, graphics, fps and principal â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ porting.  Salut, madonna, what a disgrace! (If the boss only knew...)
10637	The game is locked at 30 FPS, which makes it UNPLAYABLE. It gave me a headache. The graphics look like crap. It renders at a lower resolution, looks like 720p upscaled. The textures terrible, very low quality. I get a lot of tearing. It lacks so many Options. Mafia 2 probably looks better in general. It sure not worth playing at this stage, nor does it worth the $60  I like the soundrack. I can't talk about the gameplay and the story since I can't play the game like this, it hurts my eyes.  The developer announced an patch coming this weekend to Fix the fps cap and some issues, I hope the game becomes playable after this. Also this game was developed by Hangar 13, and it's their FIRST game ever, I hope that they did not just fail.  I will change this review if the game gets fixed.  Update 10 Oct. 1st Patch: They removed the FPS cap and they fixed the 'blur'a bit. That's not enough, the graphics still look like shÎ¹t, these textures come from 2006, and the optimization is horrible (~30fps with GTX1060 at 1440p) and the is a truckload of bags, everywhere. It also crashes all the time. Also some of the game mechanism are garbage. You push a person and they instantly die. you hit someone, they instantly die. WTF?  This game was far away by READY when they released it. And they have no excuse since it was 4 years in development. They FAILED.  Edit 2: After playing a couple more hours, all I gotta say is that this game is so poor and bad made that can't be fixed.  Edit 3 (12 Nov 2016): After another update (5.8GB) the performance was improved just a little, the graphics are still garbage and the game is still the same garbage.  I doubt this will ever be fixed.
10638	  UPDATE SINCE THE ORIGINAL REVIEW... 30FPS Cap has been taken off, the game is a joy to play in 60 fps, I can only show respect those guys for listening to the consumers and reacting so fast with a 1.2GB patch, as well as the fps they apparently made some improvements, hopefully made some fixes about the blur that randomly appears on the screen, and the frame drops in certain areas... any other comments in the original review still remain my opinion except my comments on the 30 fps nonsense which obviously has been resolved)   The game has great potential, story starts off extremely strong and the story telling is very effective, gunplay and close combat feels personal and extremely satisfying, making you feel like a complete badass. Voice acting and lip sinking are absolutely top quality, HOWEVERRRRRRR.... I do not know who was in charge of the PC port, but they shall be forbidden from creating any video game content.... 30FPS Lock in 2016? To whistle at guards you have to press the 'DELETE' button? Who thought that was a good idea? Game randomly gets blury, and the contrast between colours can get real buggy during cutscenes or during fast driving...  My only criticism about the actual gameplay is the AI being more stupid than the Aliens in Colonial Marines...  The game itself in my opinion is pretty solid so far, a little bit repetetive but then again I have not played long enough into the story to find out if this is just a phase or if this is the core of the game, hopefully it is not, and there will be other type of missions, won't mention any mission types don't want to spoil anything.   At the moment as the game stands with this terribly awful PC port I'd rate it a 5/10... If and when these problems will be resolved and it would work as intended, with a decent PC port which we should hopefully be getting through patches and updates in the near future, only then with the solid gameplay would I give it a decent 8/10. As I said this game has potential to be really good, too bad that the PC port degrades it soooo much. But then again folks, maybe if the story turns out to be a dissapointment too, this rate could change too... We'll have to wait and see if 2K manages to get the patches out as soon as possible so that we can enjoy and finish the story at a much more comfortable 60FPS, and then we can look at the whole picture
10639	shocked and annoyed , 30fps !
10640	I believe that a patch is in order. Thirty frames per second in this day and age is really not acceptable anymore. I'll refrain from demanding a refund in a week time but if there's still no patch to fix some the performance issue, I won't wait a second longer. I mean, really? Expecting players to play a shooting game on 30FPS? Come on, guys. The grainy looking post-effect isn't something I'm particularly fond of either.
10641	So they fixed the issues that shouldn'tve been issues to begin with and I have actualy gotten some time in. Unfortunately the game is medicore at best. As many have pointed out it is repetitive and the open world is lacking substance. There just isnt much to do aside from killing people and taking over rackets and then killing a boss. That is literally the whole experience with nothing to entertain you in between. Also, you can see through â¥â¥â¥â¥ing walls. I dont use the feature but come on, is the gaming community that bad now that you are expected to have ESP hacks in the game at launch?  Anyways, I would get this game for no more than 20 bucks. The story is great, the voice acting is great, the idea and the world the game is set in are both great, but the gameplay just falls so short that I really don't want to keep playing even though I want to know what happens in the story.
10642	Excellent first 2hrs. Utterly dull and repetitive beyond that. Weird lighting, A.I. misbehaviors and poor car handleing. Repetitive mission structure, no small minigames or things to do in the world other than just killing constantly. This game is like a AAA 'Hatred' clone.   Shame, because that intro was just so good.
10643	A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  To make it easy to comprehend how terrible this game is lets compare it Mafia 2.  Story:  In Mafia 2 you play as Vito, a man who became an Italian refugee before World War 2. As a poor family you became mixed up with bad people from an Italian mafia and eventually arrested and send to fight in WW2 as a soldier and translator, and after getting back because of your situation you were forced to continue with the criminal activity.  In Mafia 3 you are a black guy whose friends were killed and now you must take revenge!!!!!!  In all seriousness the story in Mafia 3 is terrible, they make you feel nothing for the character and only after 6 hours I already forgot the name of the characters that where killed in the beginning. The actual story missions are also terrible, you just do the same thing over and over again in different places on the map with an occasional cut scene thrown in. This brings me in on to my next point  Game mechanics:  This is a complete joke. In Mafia 2 you could do anything from tuning your cars to buying clothes to eating a sandwich from your fridge. In Mafia 3 there is absolutely nothing. Literally the gameplay consists of killing a guy, destroying his supplies and eventually killing a boss in that district. Thatâs it! Nothing else, you canât even change your clothing. It feels like the game is not finished, I canât even describe how little there is to do in this game.  Graphics:  I donât even know what to say in regards to this. So I will put it simply, Mafia 2 a game from 2010 is in fact graphically better than mafia 3 a 2016 game. In Mafia 2 there are working physics, better lighting, you can leave bullet holes in vehicles. And this is only a beginning. There are so many graphical issues with Mafia 3 I would spend all day just writing them down. But here are some one worst one's. Itâs SUPER blurry, like I canât even see the writing on the subtitles, sometimes the weather bugs out and all you see is shadows teleporting everywhere, sometimes the NPC's just disappear.  Controls:  Mafia 2 had decent controls. Mafia 3 is a console port so itâs terrible. If you have a controller I guess it would be fine, but for the love of god do not play this game with mouse a keyboard.  Conclusion:  Absolute waste of money, do not buy this 'game', itâs simply not finished. They removed features, downgraded graphics, made so many bugs I've lost count.  The issue's I have mentioned above are just a tip of the iceberg there are so many problems with this game I could write a book on this.  2/10 I would rather pay a dominatrix Â£30 to spank me, than purchase this game.  
10644	 Things I HATE with Mafia III:
10645	Since everyone else is talking about the technical issues with the game, let me begin with the problems with the actual design of Mafia 3, the things that really be can't be fixed.  At my current point in the game, its just 'Go to this racket, kill all the people steal all the money, tail this guy steal the money, do this little objective after killing all the people and stealing all the money, and then kill/team up with the guy that runs the racket' Did the developers not play Mafia 2? I'll give it to them, the intro was outstanding, and it really made me feel like this would live up to what Mafia 2 was like....but then it just became a generic open world game to me.  One thing that made Mafia 2 special was the 'pointless' things you could do, like getting drunk, opening and closing the hood/trunk of a car, and even turning lights on and off... this game has none of those details.  As of writing this review there is no character customisation, I know this is being added later on, but surely this kind of thing should be in the game, considering most people will have finished and been done with this game buy the time its here.   There doesn't seem to be proper car customisation in this game other than a few upgrades you can just buy from a generic upgrades menu (this menu is really dull and doesn't really feel imerssive at all).. where has that gone? that added hours of extra gameplay for me in Mafia 2 (Remember the Milk Truck?)  Leading on from those last two points. In Mafia 2 if you commited a crime there were several things that could happen, you could be fined, arrested, or shot at with either pistols/shotguns, or if you were even more wanted, machine guns. As well as that feature, there was a system that made you a wanted criminal, the Police could recognise your outfit and the vehicle you were driving, another feature completely ignored in this game.  Going on about cars again, I never really feels like you own a car (I havent gotten to the point where you seem to get lincolns car back) because you can't seem to store cars anywhere, there doesn't seem to be a garage system like in Mafia 2, it just feels like I am jumping from car to car (if not just walking because I don't want to deal with the police, because its not really fun in this comapred to Mafia 2)  The sound design feels a bit off as well, when in a vehicle it doesn't sound like the exhaust sounds are coming from the car itself.  The rear view mirror is just awful, get rid of it. All it shows is a partly rendered world behind you (that even if you look behind and render the world is still not rendered properly) I definetly don't remember it looking that bad in the trailers (the cars headlights don't even light up, but the beams of light are there). If the rendering in the mirrror is that bad, it makes me think they just nerfed the hell of it to try and ease performance issues (which are bad enough now as it is).  One thing that really got me going about Mafia 3, was the music, but even that falls flat. I have only played for 7.6 hours at this point (and not much of that has been in cars) and I am only hearing a few songs (Mafia 2 didn't have the biggest variety of music, but it felt more fleshed out than this does).    I have probably missed somethings, but I guess I will move onto the technical stuff.  The graphics on the highest settings look bad in a lot of the environment (sometimes worse than Mafia 2), some aspects in regards to player and NPC models is really good, but the world is really lacking.   I am getting a pretty poor framerate (980ti, 16gb, i6700k) at near max settings (had to turn off some of the post processing stuff entirely to even be able to stay above 30 in some states), If I can walk through Boston in Fallout 4 at a pretty high setting, and pretty much stay at 60 most of the time, but not in this game? you've got a problem.  The lighting is bugged to hell and just ruins the look of the game.  Its been fixed now, but F**k the 30fps limit.  I have so far only crashed once, but crashing once in 7 hours of play is still too much.   This technical stuff could have been easily fixed if they jsut delayed the game a bid, did they not listen to CD Projekt Red's reason for delaying The Witcher 3 again?    Overall, if you loved Mafia 2, and the style of game it was, this is most certainly NOT like it. The only real resemblence of Mafia 2 in this game is the name, and Vito being in it (and a few references here and there. The Story itself is interesting (I love the flashbacks and film clips), but the gameplay, and the world design let it down. If only the rest of the game was as interesting as the introduction, because the rest of it just feels rushed and done by an inexperienced team.  At the end of the day, if you were looking into this because you played previous itterations, I can't recomend this to you if you wanted a similar experience, I don't even think I can recommend it to someone who just wants to play and open world crime game... because its not even that good at that.   I am not even mad, just really dissapointed.   I just wish they got 2K Czech involved with the developement of this. 
10646	Personally i loved Mafia 2 but Mafia 3 really doesn't meet the mark it needs to.  Cons first:  1. Graphics for the most part don't look very good like sometimes the lighting is pretty off and it just has this wierd look for me that doesn't appeal to my eyes. Not everyone might agree but i just don't think it looks very good clouds don't look super good ethire. And if you wondering i play with everything maxed and 1080p, everything but ambient occlusion. 2. Cars are WAY to easy to drive like, drifting i found super easy and when turning it simulator it does make it harder, but it's still pretty easy. 3. Car Damage is terrible like slamming into things at 100km and the car has not a scratch while my hole front end should be â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up, it's kinda silly smashing into a wall and literally nothing changing about your car yet i've seen guys drive into sheds at lower speeds and there car spouts flames. 4. The sound system is really wierd, cars and cutscenes have great sounds but yet whens it raining i can't even here it like i should here the pitter patter of the rain on my car and roof tops, it really does add a personal feel of Immersion. Also guns while they sound alright don't sound to great and are pretty average. 5. Theres some glitches that happen now and then but there not to open but one big problems is the game is pretty repetitive where i'm at 6 hours in and i am already finding it to be flightly repetitive with simple go here shoot loot and do it again.  6. Even though visually it isn't to good looking i still get only 30-40 fps, you may think oh thats your computers fualt well i'm running a GTX 1060. Withcer 3 a game with a better draw distance and 100% much better graphics runs 60-70 fps solid almost all the time where here i never hit 50. It just isn't well optimized.  Ok the possitives:  1. The gun play is fun though with the repetitive nature of the game it can get boring is all around pretty solid, though there isn't a huge amount of guns to choose from it's still pretty solid. 2. Driving at leat on simulator is pretty solid though not to hard it does present some challenges. Gets you around pretty fast and is pretty fun for the most part. 3. The story seems to be going into a good place though only 6 hours in it is pretty interesting.\ 4. Cutscenes and voice acting is very good, faces look good and i just wish the game always sounded and looked as good as it does in the cut scenes.  Thats all i could think of i'm sure i'm missing quite a bit. Sorry for anything i misspelled my Grammar isn't the best.
10647	Don`t buy this game. Poor optimization and 30fps lock
10648	AAA+ title with 30 fps and other unoptimized sh*t on release date is not acceptable in 2016. we did not spend thousands of $ on our pcs just to play like this. so dissapointed. stop buying this crap. let the devs learn for once.
10649	Game is fun in the beginning but becomes pretty boring and repetitive after some hours...  The missions are always the same and dont change much. The only thing which motivates you is the story line, but its kinda hard to keep playing when doing the same things over and over again.   Graphics are good, but nothing special for 2016.  Atmosphere is good aswell.  Get this Game when its on sale, but dont bother buying it for the full price. It's simply not worth it.
10650	Was so hyped for this game, ended up dissapointed. The main flaw with this game is the waisted potential with the map. The map is so well done but they dont do â¥â¥â¥â¥ with it. Ontop of that this game plays exactly like Lord Of The Rings Shadows Of Mordor, you kill a lieutenant which leads to the capo in whatever district (like an orc general in LOTR), eventually when you kill all of the Capos you get to kill the main bad guy aaaand THE END! Hangar 13 destroyed this game on so many levels including the whole frame rate debacle which just showed that they were hiding the fact that they didn't attempt to make a PC port for this game.   Here's a sparknotes Review of Mafia III:  Pros:  -Gunplay -The driving -Dialouge -Historical Accuracy -Story cutscenes -One of the best if not the best soundtrack in a video game -Setting of new orleans (not the graphics)  Cons: -No SLI support -Mafia II argueably looks better than this game -Free Roam aspect of the game is waisted potential -Stealth mechanic is so broken -You can easily take out an area of oppenets with a silenced weapon -Horrific AI -Textures are capped at 30 frames still -you can break any traffic law known to mankind and the cops will just ignore you  Verdict: 6/10  Even if the performence issues got patched ( which shouldnt have to be patched) the game is still not worth $60 wait for a steam sale or get it for christmas. There are so many mistakes of sloppy game development here I can sit here for hours telling you things they messed up.
10651	After waiting for months for a decent game to come out I thought Mafia 3 would be the end to the boredom. How ever the game story is slow and the physics are just crap.  Ive now played 21 hours of this game as i thought it would get better the further i get into the story, i was wrong. For Lincoln being an ex SF he cant jump over walls that are clearly jumpable, he cant get up a small ledge from the water, as for the AI all you need to do is crouch (X) and litiarly walk up to an enemy in plain site he will see you but nor react and then strangle or punch him to death.   This game has every aspect of a good open world game but lack simple basic gameplay.  Very poor show.
10652	Pros: +Good car handling +Combat is alright +The Story is pretty well made +Responsive AI Combat(partly) Cons: -Repetative missions -Autosave tends to just not work -Police are oblivious unlike other Mafia games -Not much to do outside of missions -The clothing animation tends to mess up in cutscenes -The unlocks are pretty much useless -Story feels more like a anti-racism campaign with random regurtitated nostalgia from other Mafia games. Overall: The game is playable, but has nothing to do with Mafia, with annoying bugs and pretty useless unlocks, rushed, buggy animations and overall a disappointment.
10653	Terrible graphics, looks like a game from 2008. Terrible car physics. Mafia 2 was way better. Hangar13 wtf you doing??
10654	This is a nice game and all but it makes me miss the Mafia 2 game.This game has nothing to do with mafia 2 except a Vito old as â¥â¥â¥â¥. And yet i like the story.Worth if you want some kickass action but not if you want to see what happend at the end of mafia 2 story. The 2016 games has to learn what 'game series' is about. This is like a complet diferent game and it does NOT feel like mafia to me.
10655	My FAVORITE part of this game is when I hit play on the launcher and it crashes never ceases to amaze me, 10/10 game of the year thanks devs i'll never forgot this wonderful experience.
10656	Crashes all the time, fewer options to change graphics, doesn't work smooth on a decent system, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ blur effect. To those people who wrote the story: survived after being shot right in the face. Seriously? Shooting feels nice though. Driving - not that much of a difference comparing to mafia II, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ drifting with some nfs 2016 camera-angle effects.
10657	Game works fine, but a lot of stuff from other Mafias is missing: garages, clothes, police chaseing for speeding, limiter to car speed, indicators, manual gearbox.. You earn money, but have nothing to spend it for.. Thats basics when developing game! Sad to tell, but the game is average..
10658	This is a nice game and all but it makes me miss the Mafia 2 game.This game has nothing to do with mafia 2 except a Vito old as â¥â¥â¥â¥. And yet i like the story.Worth if you want some kickass action but not if you want to see what happend at the end of mafia 2 story. The 2016 games has to learn what 'game series' is about.

10659	My FAVORITE part of this game is when I hit play on the launcher and it crashes never ceases to amaze me, 10/10 game of the year thanks devs i'll never forgot this wonderful experience.
10660	The game won't even start.....
10661	the game is almost unplayable, bugs and other â¥â¥â¥â¥
10662	Extrtemely repetitive when you get into the main game. AI dumb as rocks. Cons are pretty much everything outside of the story. Optimisation is lacking. Fat minus for not sending out review copies.  Pros are the great main story, great characters, great style and voice acting.
10663	I had the day off and was waiting all day to play this. My excitement reaches its peek when it finally unlocks and I boot up the game..... to not make it past the splash screen. I try 20 more times with alternate settings, with no different results. Instant crash to desktop after the splash screen. Are you kidding me?!! AGAIN!! Another PC game that won't play at launch! I shouldn't even be surprised anymore. This seems to be the standard. I'm literally tearing up from rage right now! Why do I keep falling for this?
10664	really, REALLY sad I have to write this review as someone who thoroughly enjoyed Mafia 2 seeing Mafia 3 in this state is depressing.  First of all I'm not even going to mention the obvious flaws everyone is mentioning such as 30fps lock or the 720p textures.  But I am going to mention how horrible this game is to play visually.  In my short time playing the constant stuttering and bad lighting gave me a headache and hurt my eyes. Then for the icing on the cake the game randomly crashes on the opening mission and I am forced to ctrl+alt+delete out of the game, and I mean a complete crash too such as the whole game pausing, no modern AAA game should have those issues on a machine capable of playing this game on the max settings.  I was excited for this game and was a proud preorder customer of the deluxe edition because I was confident I would enjoy all the DLC as I did with Mafia 2. I paid Â£52.00 for this game and it is an unplayable mess.  This is truely disappointing. I am therefore doing something I didn't want or think I would do, refund my game.  until this game becomes enjoyable to play and not a headache inducing blurry piece of crap I won't be playing.  and as an added bonus to this review here is a nice bit of 'gameplay'.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXvezu8K5pk 
10665	So .. ... ... Mafia 3. Another by the books open world game.  Lets just call it like it is:  You can beat the game whistling behind crates. What a masterpiece! You take down the Mafia whistling behind crates since the ai is programmed by people who apparently thinks gamers are children who dont like a challenge. Press a for cover, arrow left for whistle and b for kill. Is this â¥â¥â¥â¥ what we want now? We have been brainwashed into thinking this is the norm for gaming. Since every open world game now have it. But its crap!  Seems like developers just go by a check box making these kinds of games: cover system for children - Check! Easy stealth with enemies who cant see or hear anything - Check! Open world busy stuff - Check! Poor ai - Check! Repetitive gameplay becuase gamers like busy work that will keep their brains in a loop of semi entertainment for hours!   The new word for reviews now: Addictive! This game is good because it is addictive! â¥â¥â¥â¥ off! Thats not a word to describe anything good. If a game is addictive, thats a bad thing. What they really mean to say is immersive, but they dont know any better. Dont blame them. Thats whats happens when games like this is made over and over. Boring repetitive easy gameplay. Then its easy to confuse words like addictive with real emmersive gameplay.   Perhabs its time to wake up and smell the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you are being fed. Because they can do better, but we dont demand better.   Btw. The story, characters and the world seems kinda cool and well made ^^
10666	Crashes all the time, fewer options to change graphics, doesn't work smooth on a decent system, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ blur effect. To those people who wrote the story: survived after being shot right in the face. Seriously? Shooting feels nice though. Driving - not that much of a difference comparing to mafia II, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ drifting with some nfs 2016 camera-angle effects.
10667	This is not a mafia game at all, it feels like you are some murderer wanting to kill  This game is just boring, I can't even get myself to play it anymore.  Go there, kill them, go back, and go and do it all over again until a boss arrives.  Now the story is meh, but my god is it a beautiful looking game.  now if you want a good mafia game, then play mafia 2 or 1.
10668	Nice work, capped at 30FPS, resolution and graphic bugs. 4 years development cycle and you guys come up with the idea to patch 60+FPS in after release? Good job  Edit: Story starts good but then... same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over
10669	Figured it would be better, Mafia 1 + 2 have more features
10670	Dont know why they release a game that isnt finished.
10671	Crashes every 10-30 minutes. Poor graphics. Repetitive missions / lack of ambition-creativity. Glitches everywhere.  Just No.
10672	Pros  - Soundtrack   Cons  - There is no mafia atmosphere  - Ugly low res textures in many places on max graphics  - Horrible shooting mechanics  - Driving controls are unrealistic.  - Game crashes   That game has no right to be called âMafiaâ. Real name for this trash is âNew Bordeaux Verminâ.
10673	Mafia 2 was great, Mafia 3 has gone donwhill. Boring history, gameplay the only positive thing was the soundtrack.
10674	I am enjoying the game, and the story is really nice, but the game is about 24 hours long, and the combat is the easiest thing ever. Not worth $60, although I would recommend it if it were less money.
10675	I used 44min not to play the game, but to try fix the graphical issues.. Blurry, lagging and an unfinished game.! requested for refund..

10678	GOODS : Good music  : Interesting story  : Great setting  : Donovan is hella funny  : Get to kill racist â¥â¥â¥ holes  BADS : Bad Graphics  : Repetitive side quest  : Glitches/Crashes  : No customization  : Bad AI  : Doesn't have interaction with objects and people like mafia 2  : Must have vsyn on without it there will be screen tears  : No fast travel  : Not so good optimization   : Fps drops (Without Vsyn)
10679	Game is unplayable. 30fps lock, stuttering, 2x crashed after a few minutes. I would wait for some patch to fix this.  **updated**:  Updated to latest patch. Game still randomly crashing (first time after 7min. in). 30fps is gone but performance is very poor still. It is just a very bad port. Not recommended to buy at this time and for sure not for full price.  If they can fix the main game maybe but actually its too late. Move on guys nothing to see here.
10680	A combination of this game, no man's sky and homefront: the revolution, taught me not to trust a damn thing the devs showcase before the release of their game and to not trust games that have no review codes.  My biggest grudge is the all of this terrible visuals on a triple A title. It's riddled with visual bugs from the sky to the shadows and the awful draw distance and half the time the visuals don't fully render unless you look from the right angle, and even when you do, it's still poo-poo quality. There is a magnitude of bugs and the crappy AI just put a nail in it's coffin.  The driving is fun in this game and the frame rate is OK for me (80fps @ 1440p with a 1080) but I wouldn't say it's the same for everyone. (especially considering it has worse textures that GTA V which was released 3 years ago).  This game will get repetetive after ~ 2 hours or so. All the tasks are generally the same with little plot difference, go in, try to be stealthy or not, kill everyone, destroy everything, interrogate some guy and either recruit him or kill him. It's practically the opposite of mafia 2 was, where mafia 2 had little to do outside of missions, this game is a lot of repetetive mandatory stuff outside story that give you no satisfaction or addition to story. The story itself isn't any good either, it's something you see from miles away, you already know what's gonna happen so after a while, there's no urge to see it through either.  There's one good thing about the story though, and that's the way you treat your underbosses and the multiple 'after endings'. (ending is still kill sal, you'll make choices as to what happens after though). You can split everything even between bosses, make one or two feel alienated and give all power to the other two/ one guy that is your fav or you can just screw all of em over and keep everything for yourself. So at the end you come to these choices (spoilers)    endings are rule together, rule alone or leave the city..... the 3rd option leaves whoever has most earn to run the city.   There's also side missions (underboss loyality missions) that you can do to learn more about them. For example what happened to Joe explained by Vito.  There are few strong point to this game, one of which is the somewhat accurate description of racisim in that time period, something that you can see today as well. The soundtrack is also pretty good and the world looks really good (in terms of design). The textures of buildings actually render ok, it's everything else that is awful. Listening to the in car radio talk about the current events or some dude rambling is pretty fun too, but it only has 1 station and gets repetetive after a while (especially since by the 4th hour you've heard every song 10 times over). The voice acting and facial animations are also pretty solid, let down by textures and bugs however. Now all this being said, it does not justify piracy, if you want to pirate it, watch a youtube playthrough/game movie instead. People still worked on this pile of crap, the overall result might not be satisfactory, but it doesn't justify piracy. I say that because i'm an artist and I understand this stuff. The polishing team didn't do their job, but there were still people who voice acted, animators, concept artists and so more that did their job.  If you really want it, grab it at 50%-75% off.
10681	ive played about 18 hours so far and its boring as hell. Why can't I buy clothes? Why can't I go to a car dealer and buy cars? Why don't the police mind me speeding? Why is the entire police system a downgrade from mafia 2? Why are the lockpick mechanics a step down from mafia 2? What happend to the licenseplate system? Why can't I buy a safehouse? loved mafi 2,dont really like mafia so far 
10682	The atmosphere, storyline, voice acting and the soundtrack to the game are strong points but this is let down by the technical issues and repetition. There is little variety in the mission content, you take over territories in a typical open world manner without a variety of enemies. The gunfights are fluid but the gameplay is let down by the repetitive stealth mechanic in the game. Overall, Mafia III does not offer enough content for a large open world game and the lack of mission variety, enemies and activities is not up to the standard that you would expect from a major title in 2016.  The main protagonist can see through walls with an X-Ray abiliity and this is highly unrealistic for a game based in the 1960's. The user interface doesn't suit a historial period piece at all, it is very patronising and it even indicates what button to press to open a car door. This would be acceptable in a Batman game but Mafia III is a gritty, realistic third person shooter set in the past and the user interface and the superpower ability detracts from the immersion.  The game would receive a recommendation as not many single player games in 2016 have offered such a high quality of story and voice acting but that could change with Dishonoured 2 coming out next month. The lack of polish with the graphics, technical issues and the repetition prevent this game from reaching the heights of previous Mafia titles.
10683	Worst pc port ever made.
10684	30fps, shadows pop in, detail pop in, lod, distance view, fog, low quality reflections, upscaled textures, no proper ultrawide support, lots of bugs and unfinished stuff, poor port. My GTX1080 is at 70% at times- WTF? This is the last retail boxed game I buy. From now on only steam so I can refund it.
10685	Awful in every way except for the story.  Horrible optimization, blurry graphics with low-res textures all over the place, no attention to details, empty 'open world', dumb game mechanics and ridiculously bad AI, terrible driving simulation.  I didn't like Mafia 2 all that much (great open world potential wasted on linear gameplay), but the Mafia III is just a huge step in a wrong direction.  Uninstalled after &lt; 1 hr.
10686	Game is currently very broken :(  Huge disappointment because has I was really looking forward to this title. When they uncapped the FR from 30 performance was poor on my GTX 970 with dips and glitches.  I had been enjoying the story and gameplay, but now it crashes on launch so I can't even play D:  Don't buy this game just yet!     
10687	Well what can you say that already has not been said.  This game is a mess that could have been something much much better.  The game is very and I mean very repetetive with capturing districs by talking to someone, interrogate some people, kill some people and boxes and such then you kill or recruit the district's boss and so on till the end of the game. If that is repetetive as hell then I don't know what is.  As the story missions though some of them are quite unique and others feel kinda meh.  If they put more thought into the story missions and changed the way you capture districs it would have been a different story.  The gameplay feels okay i guess, I went the stealth path which is pretty satisfying from my experience.  The graphics are... well... I played the game when it just release so... there were issues. The game looked bad on high settings, there was an FPS cap to 30 (now fixed) and it just didn't that great of a game. It had a lot of bugs and if they only worked on the game more and polished it, it would look better and run better.  The story was a good old fashioned revenge story, Linclon as a character was this big badass guy who won't let anyone stop him and the other characters were entertaining as well and great voice overs. The district missions kind of distracted me from the story but the story was good in my opinion.  Lastly if you're buy the game you are gonna get either bored or have fun killing people in different places.  And also buy it on sale aint worth 60 dollars.(20 dollars sure)
10688	only real mafia fans would under stand
10689	Save your money, game is boring and easy.
10690	  Got this as a birthday gift, I....was pretty syked. I get to be swol as â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry black man. It got repetitive EXTREMELY fast. ( Played it cause Vito+ I miss Joe Barbaro.) I really avoided any type of spoilers etc. And I have to admit it's a MASSIVE change to Mafia 2. Plus I was gifted with the curse of IGN, water is glitched beyond â¥â¥â¥â¥ and Cassandra is a poor as â¥â¥â¥â¥ head with no real â¥â¥â¥â¥ to give me. Cause lol.  Example-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvHQOEsods   IGN would have a field day with you Hangar 13. Just wait till it's like 20-30 bucks.
10691	The Game has many potentials but in the end it's unplayable at all many glitches, stupid AI, repetetive missions with long driving distances, textures is a mess, day and night cycles are going crazy and finally controllers not supported only xbox one doing fine and any other controller won't work.  what drives me angry is that how could they have noticed all these and still released it!!!
10692	What a great game - the story it captures the life of the mafia, it shows friendship - it shows horror - it shows beauty Mafia 2 is the one and only game I'll continue to replay until I die.... Now time for mafia 3. SET! in a downgraded new orleans filled with rackets and rackets and rackets and one good mission every 5 hours into the game, This game captures everything like the constant blur to the lovely wallpaper in the distance and what else but the skybox that litterally lights on fire at some points in the game.  LOL - Call of duty have been killing there games????? At least they produce the same thing over and over if 2k did that they may have had a good game here - I COULDN'T REFUND BECAUSE THE INTRO TO THE GAME IS LONGER THEN 4 HOURS GG.  I never normally pre order a game and this is why.
10693	The story may be ok, B-U-T:  - 30 FPS, you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ kidding me?! - the graphics are not really as good as they should be - the controls are really bad on PC - the they tried to copied watch dogs and gta too much - I turned the music volume to 0 and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game is playing music in a lot of scenes, wtf guys!  This is a bad, bad console port! Keep your PC version or do it right!  I regret the purchase, really I do, I should have bought Witcher 3 GOTY or just enjoyed the GTA Online update....  Update Patch 1.01: - more FPS now, but the port is still bad programmed, that the performance is real bad - graphic is still not what everybody expected  I still ask everyone to: safe your money! Let's go and play the new GTAO Update!
10694	waited a long time for mafia III to come out and i got one word for it ----&gt; disappointment
10695	*This review is made after the 60 fps patch  Mafia 3 is one of the worst console to PC ports I've experienced in years. Other similar games such as GTA5, The Witcher 3, Mad Max, all look vastly superior visually and perform at a solid 60 fps @ 1400p w/ ultra settings, while mafia 3 flucuates wildly between 30-60 fps all the while looking like a last gen game with some of the worst textures I've seen since ps3 ports.  The controls suck. And the interface is ridiculously frustrating.   Only good thing about the game? A superb soundtrack. CCR is the greatest band of all time.  Bottom line: DON'T BUY MAFIA 3 (unless you are satisfied with driving around New Orleans listening to some great late 60's music and nothing else.)
10696	Boring game, buggy. Lot of crashes and repetitives mission. A real waste of money, once again â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU 2k. This thing gets boring after 4 hours and there is no point to do the side missions...Really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up stuff for 2016 game. â¥â¥â¥â¥
10697	Ive been waiting for the devs to release the smallest of dlcs to make the game enjoyable, if they cant add dlcs to fill in the the missing peices of Mafia 2 after almost 2 months, then its safe to say the game and title is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I really enjoyed Mafia 2 and bought this game thinking it would exceed my expectations but its just not there. Wasted 105$ on this game, im never buying a game made by hanger 13 again. Way to ruin what shouldve been GOTY.
10698	30FPS locked on PC in 2016 Graphics looks like GTA 4 from 2008 Game crashed after 30 minutes...  What a joke...
10699	30fps lock has been patched. The game still runs like a potato for almost everyone. Blurry textures, awful upscaling from 720p. And on top of all that i won't get a refund because it was bought through a retailer... Thank you Hangar 13 for ruining a good Video game franchise.   Don't buy this crap. These developers are FAR from competent!
10700	Just finished the main story line without skipping any cutscenes in roughly 27 hours. Kinda feels like playing an updated version of The Godfather II.  Cut-scenes and voice acting are amazing, but the game get's a bit dull after taking over five rackets. Also lacks customization features like most other games in this genre and the previous Mafia (II). I felt rather dirty wearing the same uniform for 27 hours!   It feels like the team has delivered a 'half' product. Earlier today I read their new announcement of what free content will be added in the coming months.. Luckily it's for free, but unfortunately it'll also be too late.  If you are a Mafia fan this game comes highly recommended, however for the average gamer I would suggest to wait a bit and get it when the price comes down. Therefore I do not recommend this game at the moment, there are better ways to spend 50+ dollars instead of buying half a game.  After the recent updates it's still not worth the money.
10701	------------------------- review 1.03 ------------------------- good: - i can play it now without crashing at start - little less blurry - added new outfits - seriously? look at GTA 5 and their 'outfits' and then call this an 'improvement'  bad: - still no (Steam) Controller fix - slappy performance  Still not recomended for that price, if you want to buy it then wait until it gets 20e or less ------------------------- review 1.02 (hotfix?) ------------------------- well... game wont even run now, it crashes at 2K logo screen...   this. is. just. sad. story.  ------------------------- review 1.01 ------------------------- this review is written after patch 1.01 and updated after a few hours of chillin, because i was in killing rage mode. who would blame me, i throw friggin 80 euros in the wind.  gone with the wind, right? welcome to the 2006. why 2006, you mean 2016?! nope. wtf then? ill tell you good and bad stuff.  bad first: - textures are like from previous decade - video resolution is upscaled from 720p - blurry graphic - some kind of (magic?) annoying orange filter - poor optimization - keyboard keybinds are a joke, man who binds 'DELETE' key for anything?! and here is for w histle lol - ai is dumb like a hell, probably have some connection with aliens from collonial marines; they would do great duet together - video and sound settings are almost basic, no advanced stuff or something like that; thats too bad because soundtrack is over the top - no fooooking controller support! you cant even bind your own keys nor export other controller configs.. just broken af - console port - WHERE THE FOOK IS JOE, DAMMNIT?! - i started to add 'BOY' into my sentences -.-  good: - story seems interesting, from what i saw - gunplay is okay, but still ai is braindamaged - soundtrack is amazing, probably best thing in a game - i kinda like this setting in new orleans and all that stuff about 'black mafia', racism etc - you can kill KKK, hell yeah - youre not rambo and cant carry XYZ weapons, you can carry only 2 which is realistic - bill-ray was a preachers son, but i still didnt meet him... maybe 'ol gator ate him?  conclusion: game is broken, thats a fact. they shouldnt release it like this because game in this state is a shame for a whole mafia series. IF (and a big one) they fix all that crap which is broken (hmm, wonder how long will take them to do it) grame will be pretty much amazing, but we will see and time will tell.  and yes, im still heartbroken because my controller doesnt work here.  ------------------------- review 1.0 ------------------------- i give them chance to fix what was missing after release, but they dont care about us, pc players. game is still in state like it was before patch, only fps lock is removed. on store page it says 'full controller support', and my steam controller dont have any presets available!! worst thing is that i cant even bind keys for controller! f-uck this!  i DONT recommend this game, f-uck preorder, f-uck 2k (and ubisoft too); im not gonna preorder their s-hit anymore.  im done here guys, if you are smart enough dont buy this until they fix all mandatory stuff!
10702	First time in years that a game does not even start after clicking on the exe.file ...... AMD Card with latest drivers and latest Windows 10. There is no error, no notification or whatsoever, it simply loading for a couple of seconds and stops right after it. Latest patch is installed.  The devs should really be ashamed of providing this piece of software â¥â¥â¥â¥ to PC-Gaming....  Edit: It seems that it is due to the fact that AMD Phenom II CPUs are not supported by the current version of the game.... All other mordern games run fine with my system set-up, but a modest current-gen console port like this is not supposed to work. I really hope that the devs will fix this.  Question: Was any PhenomII user out there able to start this game somehow?
10703	More like belongs in the trash
10704	The game looks ugly, the performance is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the gameplay is repetitive. Huge disappointment of a game even though the story and characters showed alot of promise.
10705	At this stage I would not recommend this game. Even after 30fps patch you barely get 50fps. Blurry graphics. Weird glow around the edges of the car and characters during day time. Blurry faces. Its just a mess to look at.  BUT, on the other hand, Great gameply, Stunning soundtraks, and Amazing storyline is what's keeping me playing.   
10706	Agreed with many other users posts, that being; game is unacceptable and needs work. I shouldn't be crashing randomly 20 minutes into the game. I could handle the 30 FPS limit if they game was stable at the moment. That being said, my personal experience with this game ... not happy. I've read a few other posts where individuals mentioned they were unhappy with the graphics; I also concur. More or less, game looks washed, grainy, outdated, etc. Yes, I agree a good storyline makes a game. We've all played games where the story kept us entertained rather then the graphics, sound, or even the gameplay for the matter. However, this is 2016 and the bar has been raised for console and PC gameing alike. Not complaining, demanding, or pointing fingers. Just not understanding how all us PC gamers have to wait and cross our fingers to hope everything will work right. First Forza probelms, now Mafia III probelms. Let me guess, Gears 4 ... problems? Just saying....ok, I'm done.
10707	wtf did they do to mafia?   bugged af  game crashes insulting graphics 30 fps lock wtf?   
10708	looks terrible, mafia 1 had better graphics
10709	Mafia 3.... is just bad  grafics has not improved, since mafia II A.I is just so bad, cops dont care anymore and AI driving is just stupid the world of mafia 3 is just boring not living at all, 100 shops in the game but nothing to buy Missions are just repeatable, same mission different area everything is done by the 'Middle mouse' no garage, no gun shop...  Im so disappointed of this game and what they did to this franchise.
10710	I have a GTX 1060 and even on low settings I can't get 60 fps all of the time. Also the stuttering is terrible. I wonder if the developers even played the game on lower end cards because you'll need a lot more then what the system requirements suggest to play this game. Mafia 3 is far from perfect, but I have been enjoying the story so far.
10711	This game is so poorly optimized for PC that it is unplayable, even with a really beefy PC it suffers from brutal FPS drops and constant microstuttering. Whatever graphical settings you use, the result is the same. Not one word about this from Hangar 13 either, so I would presume that the issues is not even on their fix list. Had I bought this in the Steam store, I would have asked for a refund after less than an hour of gameplay. DonÂ´t waste your money on this crappy excuse for a game.
10712	Excellent story line. Going strong till now. Environment has been captured perfectly. But awful PC optimazation. I don't know if the testers were drunk while testing but a lot of bugs. I won't recommend till those issues are fixed.
10713	Yes, I waited for the 30fps-unlock-patch, and I waited for the next one, still, my opinion didn't really change, and if, just got worse..because, it still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥, performance is still bad (I just finished QB, looks awesome, runs nice), the weather looks terrible at times, and sometimes it switches between ugly rain and nasty sunshine in a second. overall not a pretty game. and the game itself is not very good either..is not just the performance..do you basically always the same, interogate, kill, destory, and begin again. the only really good thing about mafia 3 is the soundtrack, great selection of Soul, RnB, RnR. get the soundtrack, forget the game. 3/10
10714	While there are minor improvements to some of the overworld elements in Mafia II, overall this game is a huge step down in quality. It feels less like a Mafia game and more of a collect-a-thon similar to Assassins Creed, as well as having some of the most boring optional side missions I have ever played, leaving me struggling to stay awake. I guess that's where the difficulty is supposed to be found?
10715	I had to change my review. At first I did recommend it, It runs ok on my system. I have had 4 or 5 crashes in 20 hours of gameplay. Graphics look better when on a LOWER setting, yes LOWER. On high the reflections just ruin the look of the game. The AI have random moments of madness when driving and start driving around in circles, including the police. So if your driving fast down a road you don't see it coming and SMASH! As people have mentioned, I arrived at a optional mission last night after a 15 minute drive to find the truck I was supposed to be taking wasn't there. The game is really poorly optimized, It's far from finished. The story is great and loads to do but that is ruined by the bugs and graphics. The devs, release one patch to unlock FPS WHICH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN THE FIRST PLACE! Now....... well that's it. No info on next patch, no reply to anyone as far as I know. Looks like they are more interested in the other games they released recently. SO.... I would say, in it's current state It's not worth the money. Who knows when it will be fixed and good luck getting any support! POOR 2K!
10716	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disgraceful  2/10
10717	This game intitally is very impressive, it slowly shrivels up into a piece of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ a couple hours in.
10718	This game is so poorly optimized for PC that it is unplayable, even with a really beefy PC it suffers from brutal FPS drops and constant microstuttering. Whatever graphical settings you use, the result is the same. Not one word about this from Hangar 13 either, so I would presume that the issues is not even on their fix list. Had I bought this in the Steam store, I would have asked for a refund after less than an hour of gameplay. DonÂ´t waste your money on this crappy excuse for a game.
10719	I have a GTX 1060 and even on low settings I can't get 60 fps all of the time. Also the stuttering is terrible. I wonder if the developers even played the game on lower end cards because you'll need a lot more then what the system requirements suggest to play this game. Mafia 3 is far from perfect, but I have been enjoying the story so far.
10720	hello,   I have played the game till the end, and i must say im a bit dissappointed. The story is cool, but for a game that is made in 2016 its bad because your doing the same thing over and over again. Just in a other district.   Buy the game when its in sale or much cheaper.
10721	Now, i wouldn't say that this is directly a bad GAME, but a truly horrible interpretation of a Mafia-game. There is almost nothing resembling it's predecessors, it's a disgrace to the loved series. It has no 'mafia feel', the era is poorly captivated, the streets look dead, and is nothing near what was expected from it. This - for me - was supposed to be the revival of the Mafia-series, the one that i've been a fan of ever since i layed my hands upon Mafia I. It disappointed me from the Mafia perspective in ever single way, i've uttered myself to play game for as long as i have, but no more. I've gotten an insight in what this game is trying to be, that's enough. I will be leaving out the technical quirks the game has, since there's a billion other reviews for that.  Hangar 13 made this game into a grindfest with a very uninteresting plot which featured next to nothing compelling. The plot (briefly summarized) is about a man named Lincoln, a Vietnam veteran coming home (they could've hit homerun with this story even though it's very generic). He finds himself lacking stuff to do and feels overall useless, so he joins a gang (I honestly don't remember the name of the gang, but it's the Italian counterpart of the Black mafia). He meet's up with the leader and they plot a heist, the italian's end up betraying him and the black mafia. Resulting in them all dying except Lincoln whom is now pumped with bloodlust and revenge. Sounds generic? Well, it unfortuantley is.  The game itself is okay, the gameplay is okay, very generic and all in all just completely O.K. nothing revolutionary. Never the less, the place where the game really shines is in it's cutscenes, oh my god are they good. They are infact revolutionary, i have never seen better. They have an immense attention to details in the characters face, and it's surroundings featuring some insane graphics in the cutscenes, but this is unfortunatley the only place the game really shows it's features to me. It's like two different worlds, there's the low polygon, poorly made player controlled world. Then there's the highly detailed cut-scene world. How did you possibly go so wrong Hangar 13? I feel I'm bored out of my mind with the same missions on repeat in each of the 9 districts the game is divided in, and it turns into this agonistic behaviour where the one grind tries to be better and stronger than the other grind. There's NO variation what so ever. Sure, you might be into this kind of thing where there's an openworld grind, but this is no storydriven game at all.   I find myself disheartened, uncompelled, disappointed and lost in faith for this game and it's future franchise (?). I hope so very dearly that the devs will find themselves wise enough to play through all the games, then come to the conclusion that they made a grave mistake in releasing this game as it is. May they create a new game that mends my sore eyes after playing this. May Mafia 4 be a better one than this. If not, the franchise will die and my faith in 2K will be lost.  3/10 coming from a Mafia fan.  5/10 coming from a gamer.
10722	The most repetitive game that i have ever played.  It's not a Mafia game, it's a freaking district take over simulator.
10723	The gunplay is good, the atmosphere is good and (mostly) authentic, and the story (so far 21 hours in) is reasonable. That was all the good things i have to say about Mafia 3. The graphics and driving mechanics are a huge step down from the (six years older!) predecessor, and the protagonist is amazingly even less relatable and interesting than was the case in Mafia 2. The idea with you having 'underbosses' to help you is good, but the execution is almost laughably bad, none of their bonuses really add anything, apart from the one you get when you originally acquire them, and leave no reason for you to care about which boss you choose. Naturally the game is far from reliable, with quite a few crashes straight to desktop, in seemingly random places, and even though the graphics are notably worse than Mafia 2, the game still has really bad problems with unstable, and generally poor, framerates. All of this is pushed in the background, however, when it comes to the missions. There is NO and that is _*NO*_ variation at all, in the missions after the introduction of the general mechanics of the game. Every single mission is: Drive to this highlighted place on the map, shoot everyone there, and pick up anything that grows green in your magical see-through-walls-vision. That's it. Nothing else. And even though this seems like a rather easy thing to manage, the game engine still manages to mess that up, repeatedly removing the icons from the map, never to be seen again (until you restart the game anyway), and the AI of enemies is beyond stupid, with them wading slowly towards the sound of me, completely oblivious to the ten dead bodies of their allies lying in the exact same spot, where i can just point my gun and wait for them. The design of the shooting galleries is rather bad as well, with virtually no levels that has more than one or two entrances, and almost no possibilities of playing a more stealthy approach.  All in all this game is on a level i expect from a â¬10 game from some backwater startup developer, who bit of more than they could chew, not a fully priced AAA-title from a company that has shown that could make superior games half a decade ago!  Avoid this game like the devil, until it's on sale dirt cheap, it's really not worth the price!
10724	Wouldve loved for this game to be good. But its missing SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many things. What it does good is graphics, characters and the beginning of the story.  The city feels empty, theres nothing you can do or spend your money on, youre the don honcho and yet youre doing all the stuff that a lowlevel gangster would do, after a while its the same missions over and over again only different sites/scenes.  It has good ideas (the taking over the city part/revenge story/and underbosses) but it never fully catches that because it lacks so many things if it wants to be an open world. 
10725	This game gets boring pretty fast.
10726	I had such high hopes for this game. Boy was I disappointed! The story is good, but the missions are so repetative they feel like what most games would call side quests. I actually felt more engaged with No Mans Sky than I do with Mafia 3, thats how hollow and badly structured this game feels.
10727	Silky smooth 28 FPS simulator
10728	It's an ok game at best. Got no issues with the graphics, sound, gameplay, character design. If anything, the Story is great ( cutscenes, dialogue execution ) - the immersion experience is commendable - this is where your money is going.   I would like to recommend this game on full price, BUT the mission design killed it in as far as expectations from an AAA title. It's repetitive for the most part. Mafia II was definitely better in this aspect. There were many opportunities to design the missions with more variety but I didn't see that for M3.  I recommend this title only for when it's on sale, unless they do something drastic about the mission designs in the future.
10729	Alright, after playing the game for a few hours and getting into the gameplay i can now officially say that this game is 'OK'  Pros:  -The games story is amazing, phenomenal, even. -Time period is captured accturately and portrayed as it should be. -Soundtrack is awesome. -Gunplay is what i expected to be, somewhat modeled after mafia 2.  Now to the bad  Cons: -Consistant crashes, especially in the downtown area (every 30 minutes to an hour the game crashes, sometimes less) -Pop ins, this is a minor problem and can usually be ignored if aren't focusing on it. -Gameplay is somewhat repetetive, although it reminds me of godfather 2 which i actually liked. -Some serious lighting problems, although this can be rectified by downloading a shader (Still, something you shouldn't have to do with a so called 'triple A title') -Vito does not look like vito, like, at all.  I've been a serious fan of the mafia series since the first one, and had been patiently awaiting this game's release, but what i recieved for my 80$(CAD) was an unfinished mess. If more time had been allocated to this game and the release day pushed back it could have been better, the game has the poetential but just not the heart unlike mafia 2.
10730	Bought this game in preorder deluxe edition because of old love to Mafia 3. At release I was mad at 30fps lock , but decided to give it a try and look into this game as a whole not just by graphics. Thus I decided to write this now.   TL;DR   Don't buy it, game is worth 20$ for me not 50$.   Long version:   Graphics is a bit avarage. For a price of 50$ I expect something good, not excelent, but good. Story is intresting at start but after couple of hours it is dull and I stoped caring about protagonist, sidekicks or even villans. Immersion is top notch at begginig but after couple of hours I realised that I cannot interact with any occuring events (some people are being stoped by police) apart shoting them. Character progression, building own 'mafia' is boring. Its just simple give district to one of 3 sidekicks. Tried diffrent combination and as far as I can tell it does not make any diffrence who gets what. Some of side missions are cool and kept me enterteined. Collectibles do not grant You anything. Not even collecting music records opens new songs in radio. There is no benefit from doing it. From 4 first districts I've collected everything, even dig through trash (not true) and after realising it acomplish nothing I decided not to waste more time on it. I love how cinematics look and thats some of major plus for this game. Also voice acting is awesome. I like how enemies reacts to bullet impact. There is no melee combat what so ever. More about how bad this game is look on Youtube for Mafia 2 vs Mafia 3.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE 
10731	Awful textures + crashes. Wait for them to fix this.
10732	This game gets boring pretty fast.
10733	Everything i loved about Mafia 2 was taken from the game &amp; swapped for a linear shooter experience, waste of your time &amp; money.   Final Score 5/10

10735	honestly this game looks awesome, but it gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up with 30 fps lock.  and another thing i noticed, you cant rotate your camera while driving, i mean you can do that with no gas pressed, otherwise your camera will be reseted to front ahead which is stupid  i dont recommend this game by now, since the stupid fps lock i might wanna change this review to positive but lets see
10736	i dont usually say anything on these forums.... but seriously please fix this laggy, buggy, pain in the â¥â¥â¥ that i spent 80.00 on already. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t!!!!
10737	Awful textures + crashes. Wait for them to fix this.
10738	This review is coming from a big fan of Mafia 2. I played Mafia 1 also but only once. I was really grabbed by the 2nd game in the series - the setting, the music, the story, the graphics even. All was very well done and with a thought.  Playing Mafia 3 is a disappointment. -The graphics are horrendous - they are like from a game from 10 years ago - there is a muddy filter applied on your screen. Whoever thought this is ok for 2016 is a challenged person. Thank God there is a custom graphics mod that makes the game look acceptable. If you decide to play this game, look for it: 'Nyclix's official colour correction reshade'. The thing that it cannot fix though is the draw distance. Stuff at a relatively near distance are a lot blurred. The day/night cycling is a joke too. It is like hitting a dark shadow wall when it becomes night. -The story as a concept sounds great and there are various cut scenes that are created professionally. However, playing through the story gets boring quick - for every district you have to do one and the same thing - go steal something at place A. Interrogate an informant at place B. After that you face the disctrict boss at one of the same places - A or B. That's about it. -Most of the Playboy pictures are the same from Mafia 2 :D There are some new collectibles with naked girls but they are drawn. -Speaking of collectibles - there is no achievement(s) for it. That's a real let down for an achievement hunter and this could have squeezed lots of extra hours of gameplay for some people. +The music is good as the previous (if you like such type of music), but they did not compose it so it is hard to mess that up. +A big plus of Mafia 3, especially compared to Mafia 2, is the gameplay length. However, this comes at the expense of quaility. At the time of writing I have played nearly 20 hours and I am not sure that I am nearing the end yet. The previous game could be completed easily in below 10 hours.  Conclusion Devs nowadays are trying too hard to make new game part of a successful series and they end up making it too different and with less features than the previous. There are lot of examples for this and Mafia 3 has become part of that group. Anyway, if you are a Mafia fan I would suggest first playing a few missions through alternative means and if you like it - buy the game then.
10739	OK, so it's 30+ hrs of gameplay and about 4hrs are truly fun, BUT where this game is good is the story. The post-credits cutscene is surely one of the best moments ever, but is this game worth buying? No! Don't! It's generic and is a bad GTA wannabe, but if they ever made a movie with this skill as they have their cutscenes we'd have another 'Goodfellas' 'Casino' and 'Donnie Brasco' all in one. Overall 6/10
10740	I really enjoy this game. I really do. The animations are beautiful. The cutscenes are beautiful. The car driving could be better, but at least its unique in its own way. The guns are so satisfying to use.  But. There's a ton of things about this game that disappoint. The textures are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ on anything except priamary NPCs. Its embarrassing. It's like looking at the ground in vanilla Skyrim. It makes me want to throw up. You worked on this game for how long? This is what it looks like. â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The light is terrible anywhere outside. Everything is washed out and tries to cover up the terrible textures. Its also finicky and flashes around when turning the camera 180.  Also, your settings menu is really frustrating to use. I understand why you have an app launcher. You obviously couldnt figure out how to use an 'apply' function. Anytime I switch a setting, it immediately activates it. Going from windowed to fullscreen crashed the game twice. I have to play it in windowed because it wont started without glitching around at fullscreen. And seriously? No option for borderless windowed?  I enjoy the game. It works sometimes and I enjoy playing it. The story is amazing, so far. The gameplay is great. But these things that should be standard in a game on PC are missing. It makes the experience less than enjoyable. I cannot recommend this game.

10743	First few hours of gameplay seem promising, but had to stop due to how rubbish the graphics are at the moment. They should have not bothered releasing it until it was ready for PC
10744	ARCADE! ARCADE! ARCADE! Lets the player down with hopeless combat, driving and stealth  Unbelievable that they cannot come up with a game as good as the first mafia all those years ago  REFUND! REFUND! REFUND!  Waiting for Mafia 4...
10745	This game... Been looking out for this game for so long. When its finally here, i cant say anything other then its a big disapointment. 30fps, crashes, frame drops etc.  I hope this will get fixed soon otherwise its just a wasted 50 euros.
10746	Ok so basically these companies don't want us to play games on pc anymore? They all want us to buy a console? Thats the conclusion I have come to after the last couple of years worth of games that run and look great on console but then look and run like crap on pc. Well the videos and screenshots look GLORIOUS but then we play and think... I waited for this...? Oh and I need to have a pc rig that is worth (roughly) $2000 compared to a $500 console to run the game smoothly and actually play it? AND it doesnt even really look much better... How does that make any sense guys... As a fan of games and pc's this is just downright depressing. Not just this game, but so many other games as well are not seeming to care about pc users very much if at all. Perhaps a minimum amount of caring to squeeze peoples wallets but thats about it?  Man I'm done with any hype for any game. Never pre-ordering again. Never looking at another gameplay video before the game exists. The pc game market is failing horribly imo too much just lately, although there have been a few gems, so many AAA titles over the last year have just been outright disappointing and overhyped. Then add the dlc factor and tbh it makes me wish I didn't even play games. Look at what they are doing with hitman, we are like guinea pigs now they just want to see how much they can get away with? I feel like a person who has been hooked by a dealer on some really strong stuff, and now that they have me hooked they just want to sell me poor quality and less weight like I'm some slave sucker to thier product. Sadest part is there is probably some great moments in these games and genuine quality but how can I enjoy it when I'm so distracted by massive technical fails and this general philosophy these games companies seem to have now of 'oh we don't need to optimise our code just buy a more powerful pc and horsepower your way through'... no man, just no. I'm not falling for it ok. And no just enabling over 30 fps isnt going to fix the performance or visuals... so don't bother replying and tell me to wait for a over 30fps patch ok? Thats not going to mean anything to me when i get 20 fps in lowest settings on this game on a rig that runs gta 5 at 60+ mostly on high settings, and does this game look better than gta 5... nope.  I know this isn't the place for talking about other games, but this is my review/rant, noone is paying me like others get paid to write favorable reviews... so i will write what i damn well please. Don't like it steam? Ok then delete my reviews like you have done before. It's all about damage control anyway these days with these forums etc, you might think they represent freedom of speech but they don't always if at all. It's freedom of speech until you say something the majority doesn't like, then you must stfu right steam/valve/negative reviewers who are probably mostly teams of devs voting to protect thier poor quality game... yeah well good luck with that guys have fun. /refunded.
10747	Very dissapointed, no 21:9 support, locked at 30 FPS and the graphics looks like they're also from 1968! Shame.  Refund for me...
10748	Wouldn't touch another game made by hanger 13. They ruined a perfectly good franchise by building a great setting and ruining it with run of the mill boring ubi-soft like gameplay. Allmost every mission is a sub par side quest you would ignore in any other title.
10749	Why is this a stealth game? Why does this game look like it came out in 2012, Why does the movement feel so awkward? It's boring with the stealth tactics, Doesnt feel like Mafia II the same animation over and over again knocking people out with your gun yeah yeah. And the AI is horrible this game isn't even finished. Now everyone nowadays is pulling a '' No Man's Sky '' Moral of the story; â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
10750	Really terrible port. Sound glitches, pop in, shader glitches - it's not good. All of this doesn't help the fact that the game has generally poor visuals; another downgrade from an impressive E3 demo. The 30fps isn't even an issue, it's all the other things wrong with this game. DO NOT BUY.
10751	total let down, wouldn't launch after install until i spent 2 hours on the internet looking for problem only to find i had to re-install the .net frameworks, looks like a playstation 2 game, cars pop in about 50 feet away, cut scenes look amazing then when gameplay starts they look like plasticine men, terrible console port with no effort whatsoever made to make it pc quality, the only saving grace is if i paid 55 pound for it on my PS4 i'd be even more hacked off.poor show 2K games poor show, stick to making sports titles where you can handle developing the simple content
10752	The game has a 30 fps lock which sucks but i can live with. if you play with a controller you dont see that much of a difference in game resonsose compared to a mouse. BUT if you use a mouse the game it self feels very slow, and fast mouse movements mean an ugly and unimmersive video.  So just play with a controller right? Wrong... If you play the game with a controller all help screens and tooltips just say something like this:  Press to Accelerate  instead of Press RB to Accesserate  Normaly i could live with that but i was litteraly lock in the first room for 5 min. because I did know how to open the god damn door
10753	Just buy Mafia 2 and enjoy a real Mafia setting. Huge let down, the graphics are sucky even at 1440p on high settings it looked meh. If the game looked like the screenshots and gameplay trailers it would have been a different story but my biggest let down was the graphics. The gameplay was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Mafia 2 but I can't get over the fact that it looks like garbage even on high. Just going to enjoy my Mafia 2 Directors Cut.  *Refund approved*
10754	Watch Dogs in 60s
10755	This game... Been looking out for this game for so long. When its finally here, i cant say anything other then its a big disapointment. 30fps, crashes, frame drops etc.  I hope this will get fixed soon otherwise its just a wasted 50 euros.

10758	Technical mess. Avoid.
10759	COME ON 2K, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! Mafia 3 won't launch or start, it shows logo with 3 characters then it closes to the desktop, I AM RUNNING: AMD 6 CORE PHENOM II BLACK EDITION 1090T I HAVE 2 RADEON 6850 GRAPHIC CARDS RUNNING IN CROSSFIRE 24 GIGS OF RAM THIS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO RUN MOST ANY GAME, IT RUNS MAFIA 2 WITH NO PROBLEMS ALL, I PAID FOR THE GAME AND SEASON PASS AND NOW I'M SCREWED, PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER $200.00+ JUST TO PLAY THIS GAME
10760	a ps1 game has better gfx, gameplay, less bugs...etc
10761	Still have not been able to play as the frame rate is slow and causes the game to run very poorley. was released at 00;00gmt and have not even played the first mission absoulty appalling. i payed for the digital deluxe edition for Â£52.99 i mean there was no problem with my money they happley took that.  There working on a patch no excuse for this mistake in the firsts place also no prelease for review becuse they knew it hurt there profit with the poor perforamce reveiw.  Any there laughing all the way to the bank at us.  POOR GAME RUBBISH
10762	Crashed within an hour of playing it, locked at 30fps, controls are annoying as hell as is the cover system.
10763	You have to do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again, endless times.  drive there kil lhim, drive there and kill another one.  do that much damage in money to someone and kill him in the end, over and over again.  its kinda boring and repetetive, nothing special or anything. worst mafia so far
10764	mafia 3 made my friend quit streaming this game sucks balls
10765	massively disapoointed with this game might as well go back to mafia 2
10766	This is the type of game you would get for 10$ in a used gaming basket at Gamestop, wish there was more to it.
10767	A blurry mess locked at 30fps thats not how 2016 Pc Games should be released.
10768	WARNING!!! - Do not get this game. Its only strong suit is a great story, however it is wrapped around a very ok game. Gameplay wise, it's not that great, and plus a ton of glitches and awful graphics calibration problems.
10769	This game is... disappointingly bad.  All the hype and news about it made it look like such an incredible game, almost on par with GTA. In truth, the game is very limited, badly optimized, with very bad physics. The action is pretty static, the cinematics are boring quickly, the game doesn't feel very interactive, but more like a movie that you cannot alter in any way. The AI is terrible. The trees, grass, the texture is just bad. JUST BAD! The FPS rate is terrible, aka the optimizations are just so bad, my GTX 1080 can barely pull 80 FPS in this game. I run GTA V maxed out (a game which looks way better, even though it's almost 4 years old) at about 120 FPS maxed out, while this doesn't go past 80. What would the other people with low end PC parts do?  This is so lame, anticlimatic and disappointing it hurts.
10770	- The whole game is one huge 'kill - robe - kill' cycle - AI is as stupid as my younger nephew
10771	WARNING!!! - Do not get this game. Its only strong suit is a great story, however it is wrapped around a very ok game. Gameplay wise, it's not that great, and plus a ton of glitches and awful graphics calibration problems.
10772	Outdated graphics, lackluster gameplay, uninspired story.  The graphics are like a really bad painting. The gameplay is so repetitive I thought that I was dying of boredom. The story is cookiecutter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t with a little bit of PTSD strewn in.   There is nothing to do apart from killing and looting people and then going to the next location to kill and loot people. The only interesting people are those you have to kill and I am sad to say that they ruined Vito Scarletta. He was such a badass character in Mafia 2 and even though he 'wakes up' when you recruit him, he remains such a miniscule side character they should have just left him out of this one.  2K games is the new EA games. Every game gets progressively worse. If I didn't have hope that it will improve I would have gladly returned it.  I know that they will include some stuff that might improve upon this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥, like more weapons and outfits and including races and other side stuff, but that is too late. If you try to copy GTA do it well or not at all.

The trees, grass, the texture is just bad. JUST BAD! The FPS rate is terrible, aka the optimizations are just so bad, my GTX 1080 can barely pull 80 FPS in this game. I run GTA V maxed out (a game which looks way better, even though it's almost 4 years old) at about 120 FPS maxed out, while this doesn't go past 80. What would the other people with low end PC parts do?  This is so lame, anticlimatic and disappointing it hurts.
10774	I have tried many times to get into this game but i cant.The story is awful and it runs like Just cause 3.I'm also wondering when the actual 'mafia' come in to play in Mafia 3.The enemy is pretty much a mix of Jamaicans and a few MAYBE Italian guys who cant fight for their life.Just a boring game in general and i think it would be worth it for about 30-40 bucks NOT 80.
10775	Good story, voice acting and facial animations, shame about the rest.  Buy it when its on a sale Â£20 is a steal for this game.
10776	 DECEMBER 18th, 2016 UPDATE:
10777	Quests are really poorly made and boring.Entire game you are just destroying some cars/barrels to make bosses show up and kill them it is like a lame â¥â¥â¥ korean mmo but worse ... Next time if you see a hangar 13 game just stay away really.
10778	If Mafia 2 and GTA 5 had a incest baby then this would be it.  Great story and all but technically it is far from finished.
10779	Do you guys remember the horrible pc port for Batman Arkham Knight... Well Mafia 3 makes it even worse, 30FPS, not even better after the patch and even worse than that... some people like me cant even launch the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game no matter what, than a 'hotfix' came out and do you guys know what it did... IT FIXED BLURRY RENDERING... ARE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KIDDING ME!?!?
10780	I really enjoy the story so far. I wanted to wait till the glitches effect the story and besides missing a couple cut scenes and I only had it happen once. With all glitches a side I think this is a GREAT GAME and if it had a legit PC Port it would get an outstanding positive rating. But they don't give medals to runners that slip before the finish. In closing the PC Port sucks and this is what lets PC gamers play the game...
10781	Quests are really poorly made and boring.Entire game you are just destroying some cars/barrels to make bosses show up and kill them it is like a lame â¥â¥â¥ korean mmo but worse ... Next time if you see a hangar 13 game just stay away really.
10782	30fps i feel sick.. but gameplay wise dont buy â¥â¥â¥â¥
10783	Low resolution, scaled from 720p, 30fps lock. If i wanted all of these, i would have bought a potato console :) FIX it for PC.
10784	Game unplayable on an i7 6700k and a 970 g1 fps stuttering from 3-30fps and game locked at 30fps.
10785	Dear Hangar 13,  Clearly you and I need to sit down and have a serious discussion about what constitutes Â£53 of video game.  See, I'm one of those 'play for the story and gameplay' types, I don't really care that much about fancy graphics and I can't see the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS. That's a category I'd comfortably fit in, given any other situation. However, if I stated I was the kind've person who ate ice cream all the time, you'd sensibly infer to be alive I must also eat other things. In this situation, my former claim must also be taken with an equal pinch of salt and the optical migraine that is this Â£53 pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ is driving me mad. My intention was to file for a refund although since it's taken me 2 hours to play through the introduction of the game, apparently I am no longer eligible to do so. I suppose that would be my own fault for spending so much of it trying to figure out how to make the game playable in the menus.  I paid Â£53 in good faith based on the excellence that was Mafia 2. What you have delivered is a visual downgrade from Mafia 2. Hell, what you delivered is a visual downgrade from GTA: San Andreas! It looks like it belongs on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed PS2. This is not acceptable. To add insult to this injury, every few minutes there's a cutscene reminding me how beautiful the game was in the trailers, the end of which I'm forced to readjust my eyes, feel intense disappointment and continue through the objectives.  I simply cannot enjoy this. It's using none of my computer's capability, it's running at maximum settings yet it has about 20ft of draw distance. Anything less than 5ft away is a textural smear which would constitute a reasonable criticism of a Â£10 indie title.  Now, let's get started on this thing you've coded the camera to do while driving. So, car goes vroom vroom, wheels probably spin and stuff, can't really tell from the graphics, but I digress. You give me, the player, the capacity to make the metal box of vrooms move around. Why is it I'm not given the same capacity to control the camera in order to look where I'm bloody going? Why is it I am given the capacity to move the vehicle, yet I'm considered too irresponsible by your incompetant development team to aim my camera where I mean to look? Was it assumed that I would abuse the system and look around, having an unfair amount of spacial awareness in a singleplayer game or something?  To put this camera situation into perspective, some poor neckbeard in your studio has had to code a coroutine that runs every few seconds to initiate this cancer, then a lerp to move the camera smoothly back where it is of no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed use, plus any other bits and pieces in order to ensure it is as far from being a smooth, sensible or helpful thing as possible. What level of incompetancy do you have to be operating at to pay your employees to make your product worse?  Finally, the gunplay. I blitzed through Mafia 2 before this was released psyching myself up for what I assumed would be a better version. I'm intensely disappointed to encounter a combat system where solo enemies yell loudly to themselves about whether or not they can see me. While engaged in an active firefight, I duck behind a building to reload and by the time I move around the other side of it the enemies are either having discussion with themselves or eachother about how I'm probably not even there anymore. It's like gunfighting the developmentally disabled. I just wanna give these poor mentally challenged Haitans a hug. Perhaps not, I don't like being drooled on.  Next up, this inaccuracy thing needs to go to bed and not wake up. I'm supposedly playing as the most badass man in New Orleans here. If I, in real life, can consistently hit a man sized target 5 metres away with a handgun, why can't he? I would intensely like to gripe about a general lack of damage on certain things that should actually do damage, such as the M14, but I understand that lowering damage is a gameplay choice that perhaps makes gunfighting a little bit more accessible for the casuals. So, I'm not happy about that, I'd like a representative damage model for the guns ideally, but there's no way you can justify the need to empty magazine after magazine to kill a guy 5 metres away. Walking forward out of cover, up to the enemy to shoot him should not be the dominant combat strategy on the hardest difficulty level, which at the moment it very, very much is. (Otherwise you have no ammo and the enemy's still alive.)  So in a little over 2h of play I've been about as disappointed as this one time when I was a small child I left my cuddly cat toy on a plane when I came home from a holiday. That's a hell of a lot of first-world disappointment right there.  Â£53 for this unfinished mess is pretty terrible, but for the disappointment I should be legally entitled to forward you the bill for a professional therapist.
10786	IÂ´ve requested for a refund. 30 FPS cap is a joke. Game runs on 20 FPS in 4K all maxed out (PC: Xeon CPU, GTX 980Ti), so I assume it will be around 40-50 FPS in 1440p - even Batman:AK runs better.
10787	I will start my review by saying, I waited for this game for months, I love what they did with the previous games Mafia 1 and Mafia 2. WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥ ! In 2016 playing games on a $3K pc canât pass the 30fps limitation, not yet have to wait for the patch, few more days. They didnât think about it before the release or they want to make us feel the slanginess and low quality specs of a console? I wonder what makes them do that? I will not change my review even after the patch will fix this unacceptable first day experience with the game and that because is hard to believe is even happening.
10788	Mafia 2 is so much better then this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
10789	its not working it drops at being of game and doesnt install at the moment correctly
10790	Mafia 2 actually had better textures and ran better. And 30 Fps or 144 Fps still would'nt fix the Ps2 textures
10791	I really enjoy the story so far. I wanted to wait till the glitches effect the story and besides missing a couple cut scenes and I only had it happen once. With all glitches a side I think this is a GREAT GAME and if it had a legit PC Port it would get an outstanding positive rating. But they don't give medals to runners that slip before the finish. In closing the PC Port sucks and this is what lets PC gamers play the game...
10792	if your doing a stealth game then the AI is very very stupid in it. at one point i had close to 15 bodies stacked up near me and yet they still send 1 by 1 to get killed
10793	PROS: - First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable. - America's 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux - America's 60s - Soundtrack! - America's 60s - Cars!  CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though.
10794	This review is only here to say that they did fix the incompatibility for older cpus. That said, the game is bland, extremely poorly optimised (i get sub 25fps in the city with low-medium settings on a phenom II x6 and an r9 280 with 16gb ram.) Unless you can get it for $10 (like i did) then its not worth the purchase.
10795	1: Go to objective 2: Kill, interrogate, and/or destroy crates 3: Leave 4: Rinse and repeat until the game is over  The most fun I had was during the introduction; the missions actually felt unique from one another. After that, I can't remember any details of the missions that followed, because they were basically the same as the last one with a small change in scenery and a different cutscene. This game lacks a lot of the variety that Mafia II had. The story itself is pretty interesting, but it starts to become a pain having to force yourself through the same tedious missions to get to the cutscenes. Overall, it's OK. Not great, just OK.  Edit: I've gotten to a point that I can't finish the story. If I have to go to 'X' and kill 'Y' one more time, I'm going to kill myself.
10796	Boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥. DO NOT BUY
10797	don't you think this is quite too buggy for a great sequel o_O?  and lesson learned. after NMS I won't let 2hr policy cought me again.
10798	Final thoughts: Leave this genre to Rockstar please. If you're aiming for mediocre, why even bother making the game? There's only one reason: quick cash grab. This game will be added to the looooong list of forgotten, bland and boring titles that the industry spits out whenever the shareholders needs a quick cash injection.  ***  (1 hour) Good concept, but poorly executed. 5-6/10 so far. Will update.  ***  (10 hours) 5/10. The end. Well almost:  + I like the driving mechanics. It reminds me of GTA IV.  - Weak story - Very repetitive missions and side missions - Poor visuals - Poor physics - Forgettable characters  Unless you're on heavy medication, and like repetition, skip this one.
10799	If you don't feel like reading this entire thing, the long and short of it is that, as a VERY steadfast Mafia fan, this is not only a disservice to the series but to this style of open world game.  Throughout most of my playtime I was planning on keeping the tagline to this review, 'Mafia III isn't a BAD game, but...' However, after I spent more and more time with the game, I can no longer say it isn't a bad game. There are many factors that play into this and it's unfortunate that they are also the factors that comprise roughly ninety percent of the game.  First and foremost, many of the negative reviews on here mention repetition to an extreme degree. They're correct, though I wouldn't say the repetition is what kills it (after all, GTAV is a series of missions to drive a car somewhere and shoot people as well), but the fact that there's so little variation to the main gameplay loop. This consists of driving to a location of roughly a dozen enemies, getting out of your car, and killing them, all while also doing a few tiny extra things like destruction or interrogation. This wouldn't be so bad if they were more substantial or involved, but sadly they all take roughly a minute to do and then you have to drive around and do another exact copy of this same activity. It's extremely grating.  Beyond that, there's the driving. This is hands down, the absolute worst open world driving I've experienced in years. It's really two different parts that combine into a horrible whole. The first is the fact that the cars handle terribly. This is to be expected as it has been with the previous two Mafia games and the cars drive like the vehicles of the period would. But they seem to be worse off and harder to control than the older and lesser vehicles from the past two games. When you add on to this the second and FAR more egregious problem of how the environment handles these cars the experience is incredibly unpleasant. Nearly every object in the game, including bushes and small objects, act like solid concrete blocks that weigh more than your car. A light tap or grazing of anything will INSTANTLY stop your car dead in its tracks. Several smaller objects and the railroad tracks also have the ability to send your car flying literally thirty feet in the air while flipping end over end. This truly is the worst open world driving I've experienced in many, many years.  Another mark against the game is the AI. The previous two titles never had anything resembling good AI, but somehow in this one the NPCs have regressed in both combat and driving ability even further. The combat AI has a habit of either shooting from behind cover endlessly, or blindly charging past your cover. This leads to frustration in that the game was designed as a cover-based shooter and you weren't meant to have bullet-sponge enemies charging past you and shooting you in the back. The traffic AI is worse than usual open world fare, and the cop chases deserve special mention. The cop AI is tenacious and uses a system akin to GTAIV. You have a circle of intrigue where they will chase you and all you need to do is exit this circle to throw them off. Sadly, the game has a habit of spawning police cruisers DIRECTLY in front of you during a chase and have them ram you. This refreshes the circle, heavily damages your vehicle while bringing it to a dead stop, and allows the cars you were outrunning to catch up. They also have sniper-like accuracy while firing from a moving vehicle and routinely destroy your tires which ruins the car's already poor handling. Add to this the aforementioned issue with minor obstacles completely stopping your car and the chases are infinitely frustrating.  Beyond the design flaws are the technical ones. The game has MANY triggers or scripts that are easily and unintentionally broken. In the past five hours I played tonight I had a mission-centric NPC that was following me get locked out of the room we were supposed to enter (which broke a separate script) and left him unable to open doors for me to exit, I punched an NPC through a cage containing our fight which left him orbiting the ring outside unable to continue the fight, and had a mission-centric vehicle not register that I had gotten into it or that I blew it up in an attempt to reset it. The game will often spawn a copy of something inside of itself leading to cars suddenly and randomly exploding fifty feet into the air and a hilarious series of doppelgangers of your main cohorts in the storyline. This is in addition to the DOZENS of crashes I've had to endure while attempting to make progress in the game.  There is some good in this game. The main story, its missions, and the writing, dialog, and voice acting are all first rate and top notch. They're a return to Mafia form and these highlights almost make the game worth suffering through to get to. The visuals are fantastic and the lip syncing and facial expressions are deserving of extra praise. The gunplay feels fairly good though is still a step down from the previous two titles. It's probably the main saving grace of the game considering that the repetitive main gameplay loop relies on so much combat wherever you go. There's also a surprisingly functional stealth system included with the game as well.    The main problem with Mafia III is that the VAST majority of what it gives to you as its core gameplay is the exact same as the boring cleanup activities you'd do in any other open world game when you're working your way to 100%. Instead of being fun main missions or interesting things to do, you're stuck running from place to place to place quickly doing something and moving to the next one. Despite having a wealth of collectibles already in the game, the actual missions the game tasks you with feel like even more collecting, making the overall product a horrible slog that I can't find enough redeeming qualities in to make any sort of recommendation.
10800	  amazing game!!    Before the update i was running 25-30fps  But after the update my game started lagging and it if running at 10-13fps which makes the game unplayable
10801	Pretty big dissapointment for me as a fan of Mafia series. Mafia 1 stands as the best Mafia game in my opinion, followed by Mafia 2. Third installment is easily the worst. Unfortunately... Unstable framerate, bugs, average graphics, awful skybox, shallow and repetitive gameplay. One thing i need to give to Mafia 3 is superb story and outstanding voice-acting/lipsync.   5/10  (Recommendation: Buy it at lower price, if you wanna go through the story yourself. Something like 20/25 â¬)
10802	The game is fun to play, however, i have following concerns  1. FPS is still a problem after update, it comes to 35 - 40 from 60 at any point of time 2. Bikes or Bicycles not available in the game 3. Gameplay is almost same all the time 4. Textures are not sharp and blur is a a problem 5. Story is very confusing  Mafia 2 was much better  
10803	This game is a must buy for people who like boring, repetitive and poorly optimized games!!
10804	I loved mafia 2, but mafia 3 is terrible and a lasy creation  pros: cut scenes and music absolutely fantastic cons: gamplay overly repetitive and boring missions, graphics half ok with the sky from 2001 graphics, Ai do not react well, crappy open world with barely nothing to do, cash can only be spend on guns, fps (35-59) terrible even after patch, hardly mafia related game with no territory to defend, bugs and craches, car flying while driving, unrealistic fight, inaccurate guns,  this game is not worth to buy at full price 
10805	This is the most monotonously game i've ever played it is wasting 60 euros on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, i've never been so dissapointed over a game before in my life.
10806	Boring, repetitiv missions... wouldn't buy it again.
10807	For a story game, this is too fast paced, or maybe I was playing it too fast. The interface is very strange and the game isn't very optimized. I'm not willing to deal with the many problems this game has so I refunded it. Mafia 2 is so much better. I might buy it again at a much better sale price in the future because it is definitely not worth even 30% off
10808	Boring ugly game DONT buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!
10809	 'facepalm'   I expected better from you 2K, SHAME... SHAME.  Day 1/2 Patch - Uncapped FPS from 30fps, but the game is poorly optimized and doesn't even keep 60fps no matter what settings you try..  4 Weeks later - 'Free Outfit DLC and New Patch'   Free Outfits?? Mafia 2 had a good selection of clothing / outfits did you like forget to look at your previous game? Or did you think people wouldn't care to get a game with 'Free Roam' but nothing to do in it at all?...  A lot of people are reporting that the game still performs very poorly with the new patch.  Side Notes -   Missions are very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very repetative  (did you see what I did there? lul)   Game randomly froze for me on the first mission, I had to work around a certain spot on the map to avoid the game crashing on me..   Visually the game is kinda bad for a game launched in 2016..    I normally like to put effort into my reviews, but I am taking a leaf out of this games 'book'.    * boop * 
10810	Get Mafia 2. This game is a disgrace to it's parents.
10811	Should have known is how best to some it up.   Basically we hoped for the best. Got some where just short of mediocre. Every Mission is the same, sometimes even the same part of the map again and again. Story is ok but same over and over.  Needs some thing to mix it up or a better conection with the characters.  Mafia, in its day great game and still one of the better modern/realistic storys around.  Mafia 2 good in its day, shame about the content that was left out in the release, story missions were a bit short but was an ok game to play.   Mafia 3, to me was only saved by the music. For an RPG, there is no way to customise your clothes through the game. Cant customise vehicles. This sort of thing is 'Coming' aparently.   The game is an incomlete mess really. Then why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was it released and not delayed until complete and functional?
10812	Amazing game with a moving story and that feeling of sadness when the story is over. BUT so many bugs. and a few can be game breaking, progress halting, and pulling you away from the fun of the game with a bit of resentment. Most bugs can be fixed with just restarting from your previous checkpoint. BBBBBUUUUUUTTTT another common bug is when you try to go back and use that previous checkpoint, the game will throw you into an endless loading screen. Amazing game. I want everyone to play it. But i wouldnt want my worst enemy to have to endure the bugs that i did.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME ON SALE
10813	First off, the fps lock at this game makes it a bit rough to play when being used to 60+ fps. The game runs pretty smooth but then the game starts to get random blotches that looks like it's in the game but it's a bug that covers appears everywhere.  Second, the lip syncing is awful. I kept losing sound repeattedly and I had to keep restarting the game for the voices to even match up. At one point, the voice sounds were so low, that turning up the speakers to max would only allow you to hear it in the distance.  Third, the game is just too easy. The AI is pretty bad. If there are two people speaking to another, just whistle and one will come to you, take him out and whistle for the other. It was kind of a joke after finding out how bad the AI was. I, even, shot everyone and got wanted. All you have to do is run in the bathroom of the store and the police would eventually call off the search.  I would not recommend this game. The sound doesn't bother me too much but with the game on being too easy, at least make it look good. The game doesn't look good at the same time it feels clunky. FPS locked at 30fps while I'm running 2x Nvidia 980ti.
10814	Mafia 2 is a far better game in almost every regard. Don't buy this unless its 60+% off. Trust me its bad.
10815	A few months ago No Manâs Sky sold like hotcakes despite the game being nothing like it was promised. Now Mafia III is 2Kâs fastest selling game despite being released in a deplorable state and with no fixing patches in sight, proving once again that in this industry everything that is advertised well will sell. Despite its numerous problems, there is a lot to like about this game, but keep in mind that it demands serious compromises to be fully enjoyed. Something must have gone really wrong at some point in the development and it can be seen in the discrepancy in quality of the gameâs content. Iâm no fan of conspiracy theories, but Iâm inclined to believe the rumor that there was some external meddling that tempered with the developerâs creativity. In the end, like the fans of this series, the story of Lincoln Clay deserves a better Mafia game, but I donât regret that Iâve seen this story even if it was part of an extremely flawed game.   Pros: + Good writing and excellent storytelling + Awesome characters + Impeccable voice acting + A great selection of 60s music + Satisfying shooting + Improved driving  Cons: - Missions design is repetitive - Grindy story progression - Average graphics at best - Poor performance - Questionable AI - A ton of bugs and visual glitches  Read the full review at:  http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/11/mafia-iii-review.html 
10816	Cant even load the game! Crashes everytime on start up, looking online, so many other people have had the same problem
10817	So, as of this review I have played 1.8 hours of the game and I must say I am dissapointed.   After reading all the reviews, the possitive and negative, I wanted to see for my self what really is the status of the game, and if any of the negative reviews hold any merrit.   For starters, I had an audio bug that no matter how many restarts, and surround sound checks just seemed to not go away. I checked my audio with other games and no issues but for some reason Mafia III left me unable to either hear none or barely any dialogue. This was dialoge from cut scenes and from driving in cars. (pasenger audio). If I was on foot, I would hear audio when I would look in the vicinity of where the character was speaking, and as I looked away it became a distant quiet whisper and eventually nothing. Same applied to some car sounds, police sirens, and police radios.   I kept pushing through my play having to resort to the subtittles to gleam what was going on in the story which was quite frustrating.   Second from the audio but perhaps the most imersion breaking was that characters/vehicles on certain streets seemed to float one inch off the ground. The people nad the vehicles where like floating on one inch of air. This was quite imersion breaking and was just horrible. Now seemed to be more the brick tiled streets than the asphalt ones.   I did not experience any issues with lag, graphics or any of that. I did experience alot of cliping. It was a total clip fest, and if at any point your character ran into an npc that was on a designated walking path, your character would walk right through them. Verry odd.   The game mechanics of the combat and the shooting seemed fun. I turned off auto aim and that made shooting people in certain parts of their body more entertaining albeit you tend to miss alot more at further away targets as the cross hair circle is huge at anything further than 36 yards.   I might give this game another try after bugs are ironed out and the game is polished or dare I say finished but as of right now this seems like a product that was rushed, released before it was ready just to make it out the door before the bigger tittles coming this season.   Hope this helps those of you on the fence.
10818	Horrible console port. Minimal settings tweaks, textures look horrible. For a series born on the PC, this is completely disappointing. Not to mention, gone are the destructable environments from #2. I am requesting a refund and I will wait a few weeks and get it on GameFly. I had such high hopes for this game.
10819	i cant suport pc bad ports on release, please fix your game and then ill rebuy your game later
10820	One of the dullest games I've played for a long, long time.  There's nothing interesting about this game, it's very much a GTA clone that offers nothing new or exciting. After a promosing intro sequence which actually felt a lot like Mafia, it turns into a constant rinse and repeat cycle of the same missions over and over again.  Nothing about this game reminds me of Mafia 2, other than perhaps Vito being it it as a completely throwaway character, what happened to all the things like fueling your car up? Or changing the plates after being wanted? These quirks are what made Mafia 2 such a good game but they're entirely absent here. Even the option to change your outfit is omitted despite the fact that there are shops that you can walk inside of in the gameworld, essentially they serve no purpose what-so-ever.   I wish I realised how poor this game was before the chance to refund it expired. This is an average and lifeless Grand Theft Auto clone and the worst follow-up I could have envisioned. Save your money until its dirt cheap.
10821	5/10  Low res textures, bad lighting, pop-in and still stutters with unlocked framerates. Mafia II felt great for its time, this does not.  Specs:  i7-5820K GTX 980 16GB Mem
10822	GTA V has a lower requirement yet the game looks 10000000x times better. This game hurts my eyes. Garbage.
10823	game gets better with time but still not worth the price, maybe after a couple updates   i dont think they play tested this game for pc im starting to put this on steam  they continue to let these companies sell games through them that are not pc ready its really starting to be like what sears did in the 80s 'let anyone sell a game who cares if it works. we will offer refunds to people who give up in less then 2 hours. that way all fair' not a real quote  the last three games i bought were console games that were not ready for pc, and two hours is not enough time to tell if rpg sucks.  whats wrong: key binding to non-default will cause a crash, binding anything to B will crash it immediately, other binds will causes problems later.  the 30fps thing that is fix now was just dumb  the aim is terrible, if you play with aim assist on the bullets hit but usally in the body, aim assist off and shot will go where ever. there seems to be very few hit boxes, head shots always hit same spot.  update: after a while there is a lvl-up that increases accuracy of aim. seems kinda dumb when clay was special ops in veitnam.  the ai is just dumb. i know its hard to program, but this is bad cops dont pull you over they just shoot you. there is no progression from smal crime to big crime. it is very easy to evade police.  unlike other mafia games police do not care about traffic infrations.  the story is bad and i think they knew this that is why everything is a flash back, or some asshat having to explain it from the future.  some are proud of the way the racism is used. it seems to be a joke to me. cops call player names as they walk by, but dont pull over a black guy in a corvette.   there is one scene where the player breaks up a drug packing house and all the workers are the same mostly naked woman.   this game may be fun for kids playing on there console, it is not a game for pc players
10824	hi guys my experence with this game it sucked at first as i was getting crashes fps drops everything but i kept my kool and waited for that update unlike some peaple raging with the bad review becuase the game didnt come out as planed  i think they fixed most of the problems becuase i was able to get few the game with only a few minor problems  the strange thing is the game wouldnt even run on my old system with gtx 980 GPU  and 16Gb ram were it should off becuase my old computer is still a great system but it runs fine on my new system that i reccently upgraded to so that was wierd   GAMEPLAY! very very reapetive as alot of peaple are say its fun for the first few hours but gets same old same old the storey i thought was okay it wasnt bad and it wasnt amazing  the end content alfter youv completed the game well theres pretty much nothing else to do untill dlc comes out so that for me will be thought over if i wanna buy the dlc and i have no plans to buy the season pass as theyll proberly realease crappy dlc like some games i like to buy depending on if its worth it i dont like buying dlc that i dont even no what there gunna realease overall id say this game is worth your time but not at full price deffinlty not! it gets you in that feeling of when is the ending gunna come becuase its so same old so for all the bad points and very not much good points im going to give it a thumbs down  hope this can make up you guys minds to whoevers thinking of buying peace!
10825	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   I think thats enough ...
10826	As of right now, do not buy. 30 fps, some mediocre textures, and so far is not like previous mafia games. It's an open world repeat-the-same-activity game.  Edit: 60 fps patch now (although I can't reach 60 fps because of optimazation), but I still have really bad buyer's remorse for purchasing this game due to the lack of diverse missions. I am on the fence as to whether I liked the game or not, because every time I did a copy-paste mission I would think 'What separates this game from every other title that does this?' then right after it plays a beautiful and well-acted cutscene with bits of story in it.   It is as if two or three separate teams developed this game and didn't communicate with each other...
10827	It's a disaster, refund incoming
10828	Game Breaking Bug after 38 hours into the Story, feels bad man!  I guess i wait until the game is patched before i begin my second try of a playthrough. So far i enjoyed this Game a lot and i will play it again for sure, but Mafia 3 has so many different Technical Issues, Bugs, Glitches that i cant recomend this Game in it`s current Version. FIX YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥ ! A big cheer to the Authors who developed the Story and the Characters and a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to the QA

10830	This game was crap right from the beginning, I just couldn't finish it. Same side missions over and over and over again.Crashes too often, system requirements are wtf. Graphics are from 2006, my worst purchase I've ever made.Wish I could remove it from my games list, it's a disgrace to own this game
10831	After 26 hours: meh. It's not bad. It's just not good.   Performance: for me, personally, it's fine. It looks OK; water is very well done, some sunsets / rises look really good, lighting is solid without being anything new or exciting. Excessive glare from some lighting is annoying, but tolerable. The whole 30fps thing was a non-issue for me, so I'll stay out of that debate.   Story: starts well, (actually, started really well); deteriorates quickly until you soon realise you're playing Saints Row San Andreas Assassin's Creed 11: The Quest for More Money. This is a shameless cash grab, that becomes 'Drive to marked point, turn off irritating pop-up 'tip', kill everything conveniently marked in red, drive away' - which is really sad. It lacks innovation, polish and passion; it's just a rehash of every other 'open world' game you've played in the last several years. Frankly, I'm waiting for zombies to arrive: it's that derivative.   Music is really good, if you like 60's / 70's tunes, you'll be in heaven here. GREAT soundtrack. Not enough to redeem it, though, but really goes to show just how good this setting could've been.   It's just so... joyless. It's paint by numbers, without Bob Ross's soothing tones. It's just... bleh.   Case in point: physically wire-tapping a phone box marks enemies, magazines and electronic items on your map. Really? This is the level of design and innovation in AAA games now? Rehashing a mechanic that makes no diegetic sense for the simple sake of convenience.  Grab it on sale. Maybe. If you're bored. Really bored.
10832	30 Fps is this a joke, may as well play on Console. Not Recommend ATM.
10833	Great game, but plenty of gamebreaking bugs and that 30fps debacle...  Wait a few patches or untill its on sale.
10834	I was having fun with Mafia 3 before the patch even though it was locked to 30fps. I thought the patch would be a welcomed update because you could change the fps from 30 to 60 or unlocked but once I installed it I knew that this game had a long way to go. My pc is more than capable of handling this game at 60fps at max settings (I even turn aa to low in this game to reduce the blur) but yet it barely climbs over 35fps. So I changed the Reflection to low and it bumps up to 45-50fps. That 45-50fps isn't consistent either because it jumps all the time, so I changed everything to medium keeping reflection and aa at low and it makes it to 64fps but dips to the low 40s. So I changed everything to LOW. Now you would think the fps would be a very consistent 60. NOPE. the fps goes from the highest i saw 70 fps, to still 45fps. So i decided to lock the fps at 30 and play at ultra turning off aa and reflections to low. But that isn't even the most annoying thing yet. My game crashed twice, first time was from about an 1hr playing time I paused the game and unpaused it froze and crashed. Second time was when I went to shoot a box i clicked to shoot and boom CRASHED the game. I really want to enjoy this game which for the most part i was but then the game just ain't optimised and crashes so for now I'm saying POSITIVE for gameplay when it works and NEGATIVE for poor optimisation and crashes. 2k pls call Ubisoft, they want Assassin's Creed Unity back!
10835	30 FPS ... Enough said. Not playing the game in this fail state with 30 FPS.
10836	This is another great example of a developer releasing an unfinished game, releasing patches the day after launch, announcing DLC on an unfinished game. When will we stop supporting this rediculous practice. Why wont the UK/USA govt pass a law preventing these scammers from ripping us off. This game will never be finished, just like every other game 2K ever released. The story line is cool but the game play is pure trash. Physics are worse than the lego game for babies and the vehicles drive worse than gta 1. Dont buy this game for more than $15, wait for a sale in a year or so, or even better, take your money and spend it on a condom for the next time you get f***ed by a developer
10837	Hello,  personally i dont like this game. I was playing Mafia from the start but this part has nothing to do with the Mafia i know. It is more like a GTA with a Mafia-Mod. The Story doesnt allow you many options and is also not very boring. ' You killed my family, i kill you' Especially with this Racing and Customization Add-On it is nothing more like a cheap GTA copy.  I am really dissapointed and think for thos who loved the other Parts this will be also kinda strange. There is absolutely no Mafia-Feeling at all.  Regards
10838	If you like repetitive gameplay from beginning to end, this is your game! It should have stayed at 2K Czech... Mafia II was a GOTY and an award winning masterpiece compared to this bullsht.
10839	Maybe a good game, but you cannot get a good rating for releasing an unfinished product. Don't preorder from this company anymore.
10840	Tried playing it again after two months. Still runs, looks and plays like sh!t.
10841	I've got to give it to 2K Games, they YEETED the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of us, might've even done a better job than Ubisoft had done with The Division.  YEET/YEET would get YEETED again
10842	This title is very repetitive. You pretty much do the same thing about 20x. However, the story was somewhat good. The track list is amazing. I just wished there were more channels and tracks. I personally encountered two crashes throughout my playthrough. I also seen a few minor graphic bugs and glitches. Botton line as the game stands now. I cannot make a recommendation. For sure get it during a sale but not worth full price.
10843	Another AAA game where the PC (launch) version is a complete mess. I wish I could tell you how the game looks and plays, but I can't even get that far.  I have a 3440x1440 monitor (Acer Predator X34), the game even recognise the resolution, but everything's out of whack.  The initial loading screen is mangled. The 'Set display edges' screen was unworkable; I got through it by [ENTER]-ing blindly a couple of times. Once the start screen is up I go to the options ... options screen shows but there's no mouse cursor and I can't access any of the four options ... AND I CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT SCREEN ... I have to use TaskManager!  I tried to post this review, but I couldn't yet because I hadn't spend the minimum of 5 minutes with the game (fair enough). So I started the game, waited, and quit ... but the game didn't quit ... a hanged black screen ... so even her I needed Taskmanager to quit the 'game'.  Refund it is then.
10844	Today's Review: Mafia 3  Overview: My original thoughts about this game were very clear. First i know this could not match Mafia 1 and even less Mafia 2 (one of the best games i've ever played) but to turn the game into this? first the plot, the story is unconvincing, the gameplay is pretty much ok also the graphics are pretty nice and the soundtrack is amazing, but despite that the game is really shallow and repetitive and overall i'm gonna talk about 2k Shady way of doing bussiness lately.  Story: Mafia 3 sets in a fictional place called New Bordeaux (New Orleans), for Mafia 2 was Empire Bay (New York) and for Mafia 1 was Chicago. You play as Lincoln Clay, a boy raised by the black mob, orphan that at it's adult age joins the vietnam war and recieves the training to be a soldier, acording to the game a really good one, there's a minor spoiler here but everyone knows, after meeting Vito Scaletta (protagonist of Mafia 2) you get betrayed by Marconi and left to die in a fire, the game starts on a journey for revenge upon the man that took the only family Lincoln ever had, now the story itself is 'good' not like mafia good but somehow decent.  Missions: This is where the games gets wrong, missions are repetitive and you will find yourself doing the same stuff over and over again, even killing the bosses is the same, honestly this part is what kills Mafia 3.  Gameplay: Game had several problems at launch and earned most of its bad reviews for having 30 fps look, which today is unnaceptable, after a few patches things got cleared out and the game is working properly now, overall really fluid, cars handling is very good, combat and cover system works and it's fun to play, you also get your friends to help you out providing ammo, weapons, upgrades, etc (for a price)  Soundtrack: Amazing as always, even it was the winner of this year 2016 Golden Joystick Awards for it's amazing soundtrack featuring some of the best songs of the 60 and 70's, gunfire and voice acting is really good, i'll saying extremely good, lipsyncing also is great.  Cutscenes: The best part of the game, this game nails this perfectly by delivering even better dialog and cutscenes that even L.A. Noire, everything is really well made and deserves to be commended by it.  Now you might be thinking 'If i like this game so much, why i'm giving it a bad review', well that's because 2k decided to join other shady companies and start false adversiting the game, claiming that the steam reviews are wrong and Mafia 3 is the fastests best selling games of the last years, even claiming that their games is underdevilered, saying that mafia 3 is one of the best games of all times and everyone that thinks different is wrong, this game have a BIG flaw, it's NOT A MAFIA GAME, missions are repetivie and you find yourself doing the same stuff for the rest of the game, it's fun at first but 60 dollars is a lot of money for something like this, honestly i cannot recommend this game, not now or ever.  Score: 41/100 'decent enough if you wait 1 month and get it for half the price or less, pretty much like battleborn (19.67 dollars 3 months after release at a price that i pay 59.99)'
10845	The graphics literally looks and feels like a xbox 360 game, the driving is awful and lastly the game is 30 fps locked on release??? wtf. I really like the Music, Story-line, Characters, voice acting. I wan't to recommend the game only for those reasons but i can't. I hope they will realise how hard they f***ed over the Pc gamers, and fix their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.   If not, i hope i will be able to refund the game and buy it alot cheaper on â¥â¥â¥. Cuz this is not even worth 30 euros ( My opinion ).
10846	Thanks to Steam for REFUND option!

10848	it was a real disspointment, gameplay is bad, there are not many weapons, the story line is just go here kill everyone over and over again. I was exspecting a decent game but it was a real dissapointment.
10849	needs fixing and ill come back to play. Crappy Ai crappy graphics and capped at 30fps is not on.
10850	buggy with missions gone missing, having invisible buildings and boat for the mission, this game has been released as a mess this is a fail as a pc game.  the story i will say is engaging and the graphics from what i saw are par - sub par, The driving in simulation mode made me feel like i was driving in real life and the gun fights were well made that shooting down enemies felt simple.  however i find this gameplay to be way to boring i was not engaged in combat as much and i felt like it was just doing like the same objective with a different person and item.  i can not recommend this game until it is fixed and even then you will have gameplay feel like a chore  story-10/10 Graphics-6/10 gameplay-3.5/10 that is how i rate this game and the poor gameplay for my experience is why i can not reccomend this game
10851	One of the worst games I've played recently. The ambientation is awfull. The history weird, the coold things from the mafia II, lost. The optimization, horrible, the graphics nasty.  Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it.
10852	It's just not good.
10853	30FPS on a $3,000 PC. Could have got an Xbox for this BS.
10854	Do NOT buy this game if you were a fan of the previous iterations of Mafia. This game drags the franchise through the mud and spits on it. Gameplay is fun for about 15 hours, even though it's repetitive as hell. At first it all sounds logical, you meet your three underbosses assign their first districts and then it starts to sink through. You open the map and see a bunch of districts and you count in your head and then you say to yourself: even though the gun play feels really good and the driving is fun and easy there is simply too little to do in this world. Shops have literally no use other than giving you some extra money. Lincoln is some kind of super human of unmatched strength, because he one-punch knocks-out every pedestrian he comes across. The AI is a complete joke, calling that an AI is an offense.  I've unlocked three additional districts to the first three you have to unlock to get your underbosses. And tbh: I won't finish this game. The gameplay is too repetitive and the story not entertaining enough for me to endure this nonsense any longer.  Mafia 3 is an unfinished product and I regret buying the season pass beforehand and this game in general. I'm really sad and disappointed, I was awaiting a master piecer after 6 years. But what we get is not what we deserve. Shame on you Hangar13, shame on you 2K.
10855	This game was clearly made for consoles and made into a last minute version for pc. Cannot even play due to frequent dips in the fps.
10856	Unplayable for me  - game CTD for no reason - sound fx dissapeap for no reason - graphical glitches - A.I. stupid as f@#k - story .... Well, he seems to have - AND:  Its a very bad console port.  Devs, Besides that is a port, also you are trying sell third-rate product. Did you even played the Mafia 2? Did you saw its possibilities, features? it is the whole world, it is interesting to dive, but not in your game. Mafia 3 is not AAA. Its simplified clone of previos great games.(GTA not Mafia hehahahahah) u kill sitizens in one hit, u can`t buy cops - they always try to kill you, no one even care that i drive 120ml/h, and make car crash every 5 sec. If u put car on top - u can put it on tires in one button, instead of finding another transport... REALLY? Unlogical item map reveal system(am I in watch dog game? is it sixties or i am from future) Why u put markets and other stuff in game, if the one use of it is to came in - onehit owner and use crowbar to stole money from box. why i always smash windows of car to stole - why no silent unlock? WHY? You now, in 2k16 releasing such sh$t is dispespect to players community.   Steam already reject my refund request cause '7 hours of gameplay' but it was '7 hours of pain and tears' trying to find somethig good in this product.  upd: music is great, cutscenes is great but nothing more for me
10857	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This video pretty much sums it up.  Good things about this game: Cutscenes  Bad things about this game: Everything else
10858	I was a huge fan of Mafia II and was really looking forward to the sequel. Sadly it's a huge let down.  The only good things about Mafia III are probably the music, cutscenes and the story. But even following the story, you just get bored from doing the super repetitive missions.  For an open world game it's pretty shallow. There's literally nothing to do except the boring missions (kill that guy, destroy this stuff). I wish there was some customization, minigames and so on.  For the technical side: the game runs really bad, it's sadly not supporting SLI either. (Playing on 1440p with 2x 980 TI, settings on medium, no AA, can't hit above 45fps in the city). The graphics and looks of the game are a huge let down aswell. Textures look bad, really bad. And the weird effect (or filter) is really annoying except for in the cutscenes.
10859	Unplayable for me  - game CTD for no reason - sound fx dissapeap for no reason - graphical glitches - A.I. stupid as f@#k - story ....

10860	Other than the obvious fps problems it looks like someone's smeared vasoline on my screen. It also crashed within 20 min of playing during autosave. Please fix that, seems like a fun game.  + Game has an FOV-slider
10861	  This review is mainly meant for those who have played Mafia II before and want to buy the sequel, Mafia III. Please do keep in mind that I did not come from a blank point of view as I loved Mafia II. Thanks.     TL:DR : Do not waste your money on this game, but buy the prequel Mafia II instead since it features a better storyline, more interaction with the open world and much more eye to detail overall.   Full Review
10862	This game was clearly made for consoles and made into a last minute version for pc. Cannot even play due to frequent dips in the fps.
10863	at the moment it's a meage console port. I had some crashes and the controls are not really good. Poor console port. I'll try the game again when it's fixed... so maybe next year
10864	No.   If you're looking for an empire building game, don't buy Mafia 3. Your wannabe crime syndicate consists of 'partners', which will provide you with some kickback and favors - that's it. No big mansion. No goons. Nothing. Your partners even send you around to do the dirty work for them. Dirty work includes getting trucks, ships, and cars to a racket. Rinse and repeat. Repetition is an enormous flaw of this game. Although the world is pretty big, you'll be visiting the same locations repeatedly. It's just terribly boring.  You don't seem to be able to have a personal car, upgrade your accomodations, change your appearance, etc. Hell, you don't even have a garage.   The cops seem to be blind. You can pass red lights, cause a massive car crash 20 meters infront of them, overtake them with full speed: nothing. Zero â¥â¥â¥â¥s given. But stand next to them for too long, not even looking at them, they'll come crashing down on you.  Stealth/Melee Kills is a joke. You can simply walk around and kill everyone in a single room without getting any heat.   And then there's the collectibles. If you're a completionist like me, you will hate this game so, so much. The collectibles are scattered all over the place - and there are so many. In order to get them, most of the times you'll have to break into buildings, which are totally empty and seem only to exist to make the collectible less accessible. PRO TIP: You can kick down doors. I found out only after half way into the game.   You'll be spending most of your time driving around. Driving is super easy as compared to Mafia 2. I've been driving on simulation mode since the very beginning. What makes driving hard are immovable objects like bushes. Bushes will wreck your car and health bar, it's ridiculous.   Despite all the hate, there are a few good things. Story is great, although I have trouble keeping up with all the different characters. The setting is awesome and it seems that the designers have put alot of effort into building an authentic world. The character animations in the cut scenes are fantastic. The animations are so good, you could actually read their lips and know what they're saying and in what mood. Oh, the soundtrack is great too. But you know what? Just buy the OST, and you'll probably have the best part of the game.   I've been expecting way more from a game with such a considerable price tag. I'll finish the story, but after that it's going straight to the shelf.  Update: Finished the game. Ending was - as the whole game - disappointing. There are three possible endings, which all result from the final choice you get to make. Are you the person who likes to explore all different endings in a game? So am I. But I was so fed up with this game, I didn't even bother making different choices. So, so sad.
10865	Game is, nothing like Mafia 2, they have removed so much detail here is a comparison vid  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0#t=230.648987   2 be honest its 10 hrs of repetative gameplay and after ur done there is no fun in playing anymore, u cant style ur car, u cant visit shops etc list goes on, If i didnt know better I would have tought this game was mafia 1, even mafia 1 was better, there is no blood print of shoes when u walk in blood, there is so much crap about this game, when end credit rolled I alt F4 out and uinstalled, not to be played again
10866	The video is not good enough to require the overhead required to play the game. It looks like a game that was coded for a different platform, and shimmed to PC. (my opinion only, might not be true) I am getting tired of purchasing games that are released unfinished, and let the paying public 'Beta Test' it for them. There are 100's of millions of dollars at stake, and they pawn this crap on us. This is a good enough game for PS4 and XBox, but the graphics are not to contemporary standards for the PC. Let this one slide for a couple of months, and then see how much it is at Xmas time, after they have patched the crap out of it, and your video card company has figured out how to make this garbage code work on their product. AND TO ALL YOU JERKS that had a pre-copy from the company and posted those cool vids on Youtube promoting a game that you knew had issues and didn't say anything,....shame on you,...you sold out the people that keep your sorry site alive. Karma is going to f@#k you good for that one laddie. You will never get out of your Mom's basement by acting like that.
10867	Just like the news media cant trust the big game deveopFukers period.  Every one of them is setting this standard to F*ck the gamer/consumer and release a half finished game and in turn laugh all the way to the bank, there is no such thing as to release a decent product any more.  Save your 60 bucks not worth it. This game is so friggin Buggy, glitched out, in that it crashes a lot, it ruins even wanting to play. Pobabably why you could not get 60 FPS from it, now we have 60 FPS but an unplayable game.  They washed out textures at an attempt to make it look like the 60's but in reality another big corperate wh*re game developer cutting corners and releasing a game before its time.   Npc's repeat the same two/three lines, when walking around in town to the point it ruins emersion and becomes robotic like they are not even real people. NPC's that you do engage with in combat, have little to no AI, and the pathing is not broken,not polished.The game does look better when you implement EMB, but again crashing so much it is not worth playing. EMB or Not. 
10868	Pros: Story Cinematics Music Shoot/cover/stealth mechanic is decent  Cons: Very demanding on hardware, but looks dated Lightning varies from good to horrible Pedestrian reactions to crashes are non existent, flip a civilian car over and he just pops out and goes on his merry way Killed someone in the middle of a party, half people runs, half continues dancing. Mafioso 2 meters away stays facing the other way.  If you can look past the dated visuals, have a beast computer, and don't interact with the world too much it's a decent shooter with a decent story and repetetive missions so far (12 hrs in)  I'd give it a 5/10 mehs.  If they patch the performance and/or visuals i'd add a meh or two.
10869	not a very good game not worth 79.99
10870	I use to own this game, but then I refunded and bought Shadow Warrior 2 instead. A wise decision!   I really had high hopes for Mafia III.. but it felt off and just looked far too dated; plus the 30 FPS issue... this had console port written all over it. It's as if the developers and/or 2K didn't care. Which is a complete shame. The silver king is now that I own SW2 I'll have enough leftover to add onto for Dishonored 2!
10871	PC version is pretty buggy and unrefined - beware of sudden crashes (happens a lot), broken interface if using anything bigger than 1920x1080 and FPS not on par of overall graphics quality. Feels like another bad console port.
10872	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This video pretty much sums it up.  Good things about this game: Cutscenes  Bad things about this game: Everything else
10873	I was a huge fan of Mafia II and was really looking forward to the sequel. Sadly it's a huge let down.  The only good things about Mafia III are probably the music, cutscenes and the story. But even following the story, you just get bored from doing the super repetitive missions.  For an open world game it's pretty shallow. There's literally nothing to do except the boring missions (kill that guy, destroy this stuff). I wish there was some customization, minigames and so on.  For the technical side: the game runs really bad, it's sadly not supporting SLI either. (Playing on 1440p with 2x 980 TI, settings on medium, no AA, can't hit above 45fps in the city). The graphics and looks of the game are a huge let down aswell. Textures look bad, really bad. And the weird effect (or filter) is really annoying except for in the cutscenes.
10874	At first i gave this game thumb up, but the deeper i got into this game, the more i changed my mind. It's in the end a dumbed down version of Mafia 2. Monotonous.  If you are a straight guy or lesbian woman i guess the plus are the Playboy magazines and Vargas paintings?  Story is good and so is the soundtrack.  That's basically it.  Wait for a SALE before buying.
10875	Three weeks in, still no update for cpus missing SSE4.1/4.2. Sadly I can not refund...  Will play it in half a year or so, when new pc is ready.  Early buyers getting punched in the face again and are 'guinea pigs' for an unfinished game, _again_. And then the game companies complain about the shrinking pc market and pirated games. I don't get it. If this game does not turn out nearly as good as Mafia II, when I am able to play it, I have lost faith in yet another publisher/game devloper.
10876	I'm trying really hard to like this title and thats a problem. Its obviouse a lot of work went into it. I would consider it a work of art but I wasn't shopping for art. I'm an ancient gamer being all old and such. The only thing I could compare this title to is Dragons Lair and old movie based arcade title from the 1980's. Yes I am the Gangster Dirk Daring pushing a few buttons in between long tedious cut scenes. They would have been better off making a movie, the story line is very engaging. I'm watching it every week on Cinemax with the series Quary. This title fails to peak the interest of my inner gangster. You see I want to be the gangster not watch someone else do it.
10877	I kept my cool whilst the 60fps-racket was going, I mean they patched it after a short while. The story in itself is alright, but as I progressed through the game I found it increasingly difficult to oversee the obvious shortcomings of this game. My biggest irk, is the length required to complete it. I used 30 hours, and A LOT of this was pure repetition. I feel like Obi Wan yelling angrily to Anakin at the end of ep3, where he was supposed to bring balance! â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥it, I had such high hopes for this after the fallacy of Mafia II. But alas, my hope crumbled. For shame!
10878	If I wanted to play assassins creed syndicate again I would just replay assassins creed syndicate not pay â¥â¥â¥â¥in 500kr for a glitchier, straighter version
10879	My first review on steam I think.  Im a huge fan of the first Mafia game. It is one of those few games I played from the beginning to the end many times. The second Mafia game had a very nice story, but gameplay wise already felt it was missing something the first one did perfect. Still a very enjoyable game though. And then, we got the third version. I tried my best not to watch any trailers or gameplay videos and thankfully succeded in this. Therefore the hype only got to me in the week of release. I have all the gameplatforms at home, so doubted for a long time for which platform I wanted to buy the game. At the one hand, console is easy plug and play, but on the other hand the PC ususally has more graphical options. Then there was the issue of Mafia 2 having problems on the PC. But I decided to take the risk.  First: The PC version is really not good. I have a moderate PC (it was really high end a year or two ago), with two R9 290X cards and a decent i7 processor. This PC runs most games at high or ultra settings on 60 fps, but has problems running Mafia 3 at 30 fps at normal settings. And then it still does not really look nice. There is something with the graphics that makes the game look really....off.... somehow. Next to the peformance issues, I came across quite some bugs with cars driving with open doors, cars sinking through the ground, and other strange things.  The gameplay of mafia 3 is really average. The gunplay is nice, with every weapon feeling a bit different and a nice selection of weapons to pick from. I went with the silent approach in the missions, and the silenced weapons really helped with that. Other than the gunplay, there is really not much to it. Sneaking is quite easy, with really easy enemies, you can pull towards you one by one with a wistle. And if you do happen to screw up, you just shoot your way through the end of the mission with no real penalty.  The driving is decent, but with lack of traffic rules you had in the first two games, there is no real challenge. Where I started the game driving nice with the rest of the traffice, I soon turned to high speed racing throught the city with no concequences. The cool thing about the previous mafia games was that you could get pulled over for speeding or hitting other traffic.   Then the story. This is the one thing where I liked the previous maffia games the best. The story of those games were wonderfull, and I have really good memories to them till this day. I have to say that I like the old italian mafia setting of those games a lot. The setting of mafia 3 did not really apeal to me, except for the music in that era. But, when i started Mafia 3, I really like the way they told the story. It had a really nice movie kind of story telling, with good looking cut scenes and a well thought off plot development. however, halfway of the game this story started to go to the background and the repetative mission structure got the upperhand. They got back to the story to the end of the game, but it never really got to me anymore. Then there is the srange way of putting choises in the story. You conquer districts of the city and have to give these to one of your three luitanents. I tried to keep everyone happy till the end, which I was able to do. So there was not really a lot of options in that area. Then, at the end of the story, they suddenly put in three or so choices which decide the outcome of this story. Somehow, this feels kinda rushed. They developed the main character quite well, you know why he does what he is doing, end then suddenly you have to make the choice of who he is and what he is gonna do. Feels strange.   All in all im dissapointed with this game. The mafia franchise is really dear to me. And this game is just not living up to the series. I enjoyed it, but it is really not a top notch game.   ps: sorry for my English, not my first language.
10880	The game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. The beginning was really promising with awesome cutscenes and story. That's when I decided not to refund even at a 30FPS lock cause the game ran well indoors.  After the prologue the game turns into a repetitive mess with barely any cinematics at all. My i5-6600K @4.6GHz and my GTX 1080 OC'ed can't even run this game at a decent framerate. Indoors it's usually ~30-60 with constant dips to the point of nausea. Outside driving or running around it usually stays at ~30-40 with any combination of settings with the same random framerate dips. It has weird stutters and the game looks nowhere near what the screenshots show even with a pretty well mandatory reshade I'm using.  This game should be set as early access and I'm finding it hard to even keep playing to get my money out of it with how badly it runs and looks. Save yourself some money, buy Mafia 2 and enjoy that instead.
10881	Do not buy this game. graphics are pretty bad, washy looking. sound track is the only thing going for this game, the whole game is about doing the same repetitive stuff, gets boring quick.
10882	I must admit. I was really looking forward to this game. I even preordered it. And when I came out, I didn't even had time to play it the first few days.  And when I finally had the time to play it. Oh boy, was I disappointed.  First of, the game is barely playable at this stage. It crashed every 30 min. or so, and at times, the game can't even start back up, until you do some idiotic unneeded tweaking.  But when that's said. The story is amazing, the graphics is alright, but not top class AAA-title awardable. The atmosphere is exeptionally good. The scenery fits the time period, and driving through the beautiful 60's Bayou is soothing, especially while listening to some old time 60's rock classics.  But even though the game looks and sounds amazing, there's a few flaws which makes me dislike the game more, than I like it. The crashing is one of them. Second is the 30 FPS lock. I got a quite high end computer, and I even got problems running this game full optimized. Got a few lag spikes, graphic glitches and so on.  The lighting in this game is very poorly done. If the sun shines in a specific way on a specific object, all objects around become all white, and the reflections looks like a plastic back with water in it. It's really bad.  I have to lower my ambient oclussion just to make the lighting and reflection look just alittle like normal, but it doesn't help much. Only a tiny bit.  Also the third installment of Mafia (which has absolutely nothing to do which Mafia), is missing some huge key components, which made Mafia 1 and 2 great and much different from other open world games. The fuel-system, has been removed, which was an at times irritating part of the game, but still made the Mafia games different from others.  The cop-system has also been removed. In the first two Mafia games, you would get police tailing you, if you ran a red light, or drove too fast. In Mafia 3, they do not even bother to look at you, when you drive past them at 200mph, while running a red light. I guess that was normal in the 60's.......  And lastly... Knowing this is a 3rd-gen game, you would think that vehicle would deshape, when driving into things... Nope. Cars are hard as rocks apparently. Glass shatter, and the cars burst in flames, when damaged enough. But that's it.  There's absolutely no deformation of the cars, not even a little bump in the car doors. It's ridicously lazy of the developers.  Mafia 3 has been in development for so long, and they come out with a game, that worse than it's 12 year old predecessor.. Really... Hangar 13, you have let this fan, and many others down!  Shame on you. Shame on you for taking your fans money, and giving us this ball of bullcrap. :( I'm dissapointed in you.   TL:DR Pros: Good graphics, amazing soundtrack and music, beautiful scenery, great story. Cons: Crashes, graphical glitches, repetitive missions, and a nerve wrecking 30 FPS lock (even on high-end computers), lots of missing elements (which made the Mafia-games different).
10883	This game has its moments, I dont recomend dowloading it on the pc. i consider the graphics to be terrible for a pc game. very low frame rates with everything on medium running 2 970 in sli. aroud 36fps. story is very repetative. the animations when running, shooting are bad. the voice acting is good. its like a super cheap gta 5 with bad frame rates. ive used inspector, tried every code, tried forcing alternate frame rendering 2. nothing, tried setting v sync to adaptive, nothing. tried using 1 graphics card and stilll bad frame rates. in sli i get about 88 pecent per gpu.
10884	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is all around buttass.
10885	Good charachters and a good sound track do not make up for what is essentialy a game made up of repeating side missions.  It starts off so well but as soon as you are past the initial mission and the resulting betrayal (the basis of the story) its boring. the same missions over, and over and over again. Drive here kill this guy/interogate this guy/steal this map/destroy this crate. That is literaly the variation in 'story chapters' It's a shame really as this game has so much potential. its just let down by lazy repetitive game play.   This game needs more in the way of story missions!  Forgot to mention the dodgy Key Binding options. and which idiot decided it would be a good idea to have the choice between Lethal and Non Lethal take downs be an option in the game settings? It simply doesn't make sense!
10886	Do not buy this game. graphics are pretty bad, washy looking. sound track is the only thing going for this game, the whole game is about doing the same repetitive stuff, gets boring quick.
10887	How to correct a name of this game in 5 steps:  1) Chose a correct name. There is some possibilities:  - Not a Mafia 3  - Bug Life 3  - Meh 3 2) Right click on shorcut of 'Mafia 3' at the desktop and rename it. 3) Copy/write one of the correct names from step 1. 4) Press enter to apply 5) Done.
10888	No... Just no... Got a refund for this crap. Releasing a game with such obvious issues that should have been picked up during quality testing is not ok in 2016. There is no excuse when we are paying almost 4 times the amount of money than compared to a blu ray movie... There is no excuse for releasing unfinished games. And accepting that its ok is going to produce more games with issues in the future. So im taking a hard stance now. To all you developers thinking your product is finished?? Check it again... Cause if you release it and its got a dumb issue that should have been picked up I will refund that crap before you can say 'My game companies going broke'.  I will not be ripped off any longer...
10889	Doesn't perform very well on PC. Disappointing, repetitive, follows the exact same mission template from start to finish. The first 5 hours were really fun, then it all just went down the drain. Interrogate informators, kill minor goons, damage comodities, kill racket boss, repeat, kill district boss, repeat X times until you reach the end (oh, and you don't even get to kill the guy yourself, you get a cutscene middlefinger). ClichÃ© story, zero interesting twists, practically non-existent character development, no car/character customization, graphics are also pretty bad on ultra+poorly optimalized.
10890	I must admit. I was really looking forward to this game. I even preordered it. And when I came out, I didn't even had time to play it the first few days.  And when I finally had the time to play it. Oh boy, was I disappointed.  First of, the game is barely playable at this stage.

Cons: Crashes, graphical glitches, repetitive missions, and a nerve wrecking 30 FPS lock (even on high-end computers), lots of missing elements (which made the Mafia-games different).
10891	I played the first hour of the game so far. The game already hard crash to desktop while loading after a cut-scene. Not a great way to start the game. I still look forward to play the game and its story. But if you are on the fence, you might be better of waiting until they patch the game a few more times. Then again if you donât mind a bug or two, and the unpredictable crash. Go ahead and but it. Just know what you are paying for.
10892	sadly the game dident start,, not on my windows 7 or 10 tryde to start on two diferent computers and still never got to the main menu.... got my money back tho,,,, still want to play the game but when it dont work it dont work no mather how helpfull the steam suport try to help, im still crying :'(
10893	Played 10 hours of the game....Everything was all sorta fun done a couple of missions a couple of side missions. Next thing i know the save data wants to couropt on me and doesnt give me the option to keep the save file it automatically deletes it all my 10 hours of off and on playing it are gone. Im still going to restart and grind threw it and hopefully get there in a day or two but this is rediculous.
10894	It's a great mess. Thats the best way to describe Mafia III. It has an amazing story but bland and repetitive gameplay and an unfinshed feel. The steam controller support for this game is horrendous, and the button prompts don't even show up in game. And I have had many annoying glitches and bugs. I also got quite bored about half way through the story, and overall lost my drive to complete it. Overall, It is a very good story ruined by unimaginative gameplay and terrible optimization  It is a borderline thumbs down.
10895	This game has its moments, I dont recomend dowloading it on the pc. i consider the graphics to be terrible for a pc game. very low frame rates with everything on medium running 2 970 in sli. aroud 36fps. story is very repetative. the animations when running, shooting are bad. the voice acting is good. its like a super cheap gta 5 with bad frame rates. ive used inspector, tried every code, tried forcing alternate frame rendering 2. nothing, tried setting v sync to adaptive, nothing. tried using 1 graphics card and stilll bad frame rates. in sli i get about 88 pecent per gpu.

10897	This game is a buggy unfinished product.  Right from the get go it was clitchy and prone to freezing periodically. Even though my system meets the recomended specs. Honestly it just feels like a half hearted console port.  Pretty much guarentees that I won't ever preorder another 2k game.
10898	Its a good story, may be worth the time too kill some time. But its programed like â¥â¥â¥â¥, a LOT of bugs in the game. I hade something like 10 'chrash too desktop' (wasent yesturday i hade that porblem in a game). And a lot of alternativs in the game that wasent posible to see so you hade too know what to do. So i would say it aint worth the money until they fix it up, it aint finished
10899	there is nothing to do in freeroam, its really empty as f*ck :(
10900	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is all around buttass.
10901	What initially drew me in with the Mafia series was the story. Instead of GTA's cartoonish satire, the original 2002 Mafia had a gripping plot with unseen of levels of characterization for an open-world game. Mafia 2 took eight years to get released and was, perhaps predictably, a letdown. Mafia 3, unfortunately, does not buck the trend.  While the Louisiana-flavored setting of the game is great and the gameplay mechanics are solid, the story and mission design leave a lot to be desired. The first few hours set the scene beautifully and it felt like the ride ahead was going to be great, but Mafia 3 very quickly became a serious grind. The main missions started to resemble throwaway side missions of better games - cut&amp;paste jobs that had exactly the same goals every single time and played exactly the same every time.  I needed to take a lot of breaks while playing because the repetition numbs you very quickly. I stubbornly plowed through the checkpoints in pursuit of the small story nuggets, hoping they'd eventually amount to something bigger, but the only thing that grew was my frustration, blossoming into full-blown boredom towards the end.  It's a real shame, because technically, there's not much to harp about: The game looks very nice. The sound design is great. The soundtrack is great too (although a bit limited). The systems work. But tying the story to the gameplay fails almost completely. Or maybe it's just the wrong kind of story for this kind of game. It feels hollow; soulless. It's a row of checkboxes on a form. A spreadsheet. A story that could only hope to work in a computer game medium, and even there, it doesn't.  Will I recommend the game even though I finished it? No, not really. It's not that the game is bad, it's just painfully mediocre. If you badly need a diversion, Mafia 3 is far from the worst choice you could make. But it's equally far from the best possible choice.
10902	I am not quite sure whether I like or dislike this game. First of all, mafia 3 is neither mafia 1 nor mafia 2, it's more like a gta 5 in a different time, with less features, more ubisoft collect-a-likes and much more stereotypes.   I miss the great story from mafia 1 and the great characters from mafia 2. At least the gameplay and gunplay is really good, but this is definitely not enough!   Usually I would say this game is just medicore at it's best. If you loved the old mafias you will lose your motivation to play on quite fast. Very disapointing I really enjoyed the begin of the game, but the absence of story bothered me to much.   P.S. On top of that, this game is a big party of bugs :D
10903	If I knew how bad MAFIA II -&gt; MAFIA III will be, I didn't even play this game at out of HUMBLE BUNDLE !!! -_- GTX 1070 and this Game still looks like 2005.
10904	In it's current form, I wouldn't recommend Mafia 3. It has the potential but a lot of bugs, especially with the cop spawning and spotting. Light and visual glitches don't effect the gameplay, just annoying but hopefully they can fix it. The Aiming system could use some work as well as the damage to enemies since you have to either headshot them or shoot them 10 times to kill them which is annoying since they'll still shoot you with high accuracy while being shot. Story line is amazing though which is why it can be a great game if they fix the bugs/glitches in it. Hopefully they do this before they release DLC.
10905	Last time I was about to write such a bad review was for No Man's Sky.   I won't say much about gameplay cause I didn't play much of the game since the bugs, glitches, artefacts, stutterings and overall poor performances ruined it. This port is a shame and the developpers don't show much interest in improving it or that's just bad communication. I don't know and I don't care anymore.  
10906	I've only played a few hours and i'm already bored to death of how repetiting this game is
10907	Well, the graphics are really nice/cool. :P
10908	  Although the story to this game is pretty great so far, I can't recommend it until the devs fix the awful performance and bugs
10909	I do like the story line but in all honestly I hate the gameplay.  Damage on cars it seems is non exsistant until the car blows up in your face. e.g. Your going 105 mph and you crash into someone, you lose a tad of heatlh. Rev into a lampost from a standstill, the car ignites into flames. Charecter movement is very wooden and glitchy, when I tell the charecter to take cover, it glicthes between taking cover and running into an object. AI is predictable and largely seems to be on rails. The gameplay is very repetitive and always seems to be the same, Mission structure is basically go to X, kill Z, steal Y. This game doesnt even compare to its predocessor Mafia 2. Really want to enjoy this game, Im forcing myself to play it to the end. Verdict: Disapointing gameplay, really expected more from 2k and Rockstar. In my opinion they could have done alot better. Really enjoying the storyline but i dont know if thats enough merit buying the game.
10910	As most of us, I bought mafia III with visions of shooting gangsters in my head. While the shooting gangsters part was true there where many things left out or unpolished in the experience.  Let's break this down one section at a time.  TL;DR at the end  Missions: Easilly the games weakest point. Now we all expect a game like this to have lots of shooting, that's not the issue. The problem is after playing through one or two rackets the originality of missions is practically gone. The missions break down as follows: Get information from this guy, Steal X, Kill these guys, destroy X, kill/capture this guy. Infact after playing through the entire game I can only remember one mission being somewhat different. There is a stealth option to let you mix things up, more on that later. However I will say that most of the missions never feel like you are diverting from lincols goal. Every missions having a place a long the way to kill Sal.  Side missions: Some of the side missions are where things get more interesting, such as hunting down vito's hitlist. However these missions are just about as bland. The only saving grace being the conversations with the underbosses. These make the characters come to life more and give you a feeling of being closer to them. One of the very few occurances for the underbosses in the game.  Other things to do: There isn't much beyond collectables. You also can't use your money for anything but weapons, supplies and upgrades. So you not only never change your cloths throughout the game but you don't do anything else. No getting yourself a new suit, upgrading your car (all car upgrades are passive to cars in your garage), new paintjob, getting a bite to eat to regen your health. Infact you don't even use your money to bribe anyone. This destroys the whole mafia illusion simply changing the story to a revenge plot with the mafia bit being a side line.  Gameplay: One of the most satisfying things to do in Mafia III is shoot people. Unlike most games they will react to bullets hitting them, their bodies moving from the impact and shear pain of a bullet going through them. Most enemies don't feel like bullet sponges. Now onto the stealth. The game offers a stealth option. I will say that stealth can be good fun but it is still unpolished. For example if one enemy sees you there is a good chance even a bullet in what you think is in time would stop everyone from being alerted. The AI is also rather dumb with stealth. During the game one of your goals is to make enough money to afford taking out Sal. However the only thing you can ever spend this money on is upgrades to lincoln, guns/gun upgrades, car upgrades. The enemies in the game also never get harder which makes most of the guns pointless. You could pick out the two weapons you like using the most and get through the game. I used the silenced m1n1 and the blackburn pistol through the majority of the game with no problems.   The weapon veriaty itself is also lacking. Many weapons only being slightly worse then the next or whole guns being rendered pointless by them being so close there is no point. Infact one of the supposed 'best' pistols the clipper.44 is a reward from burke. This gun is actually worse then one I can buy earlier one and for cheaper (unless the clipper was given to you). Shotguns are also dissapointing. Enemies will get knocked back by them but not only do they fire slowly they also have a much shorter effective range then actual shotguns. Unless you are up close and personal they won't help you.   Story/characters: The game shines it's brightest with it's story and expertly voice acted cut scenes. Through these cutscenes the characters and game come to life in a way gameplay doesn't. Not just story wise but also graphically, which is a bit of a shame, would love to have seen the whole game look as good as the cutscenes. The way the game tells it's story through a documentary style fashion is a nice touch.  The characters themselves are good, except for some cliches such as clay's quest for vengance changing him into more of a two dimensional protagonist.  Setting: It's obvious the devs spent alot of time recreating a 1960's new orleans type feel. Every part of the game feels authentic to the time period, even down to the uncensored racial slurs. This I have to commend them for, making a game with this kind of commitment in a world where people seem to always find something to complain about.  Glitches: In one word, ragdoll. Enemies will sometimes get stuck in a sitting position after death, with nothing holding them up. My favorite is when I pull a freshly knifed enemy to the side to chuck him and he decided being a part of the door/wall is more his style.  I will also mention there was one instance of an enemy in a car seemingly being bullet proof. Turns out when an enemy leans out the window to shoot you his hit boxes stay the same as if he was sitting in the car. Remember, aim for his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, apparently.  In conclusion the game had a very strong start but by the end I was left feeling unaccomplished. If I was able to return the game now, I would. While I still think it's a good game it doesn't deserve 60 dollars. Maybe 20-30 at most.  TL;DR  Good- Solid shooting, great story, fantastic setting  neutral- graphics are a bit sub-par but still looks great, about 20 hours long.  Bad- Some unfortunate glitches, bland repetative missions, weapon veriaty, money only spent on guns/upgrades
10911	 Did Hangar 13 overreach themselves?
10912	Very disapointing to Mafia 2. This game dosn't make you feel like you are part of a Mafia. It just makes you feel like a killer trying to get revenge. Not only is the story guite boring so is the gameplay. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ frame rate and the game crashes a lot.  Don't buy
10913	It's a great mess. Thats the best way to describe Mafia III. It has an amazing story but bland and repetitive gameplay and an unfinshed feel. The steam controller support for this game is horrendous, and the button prompts don't even show up in game. And I have had many annoying glitches and bugs. I also got quite bored about half way through the story, and overall lost my drive to complete it. Overall, It is a very good story ruined by unimaginative gameplay and terrible optimization  It is a borderline thumbs down.
10914	there is nothing to do in freeroam, its really empty as f*ck :(
10915	I am not quite sure whether I like or dislike this game. First of all, mafia 3 is neither mafia 1 nor mafia 2, it's more like a gta 5 in a different time, with less features, more ubisoft collect-a-likes and much more stereotypes.   I miss the great story from mafia 1 and the great characters from mafia 2. At least the gameplay and gunplay is really good, but this is definitely not enough!   Usually I would say this game is just medicore at it's best. If you loved the old mafias you will lose your motivation to play on quite fast. Very disapointing I really enjoyed the begin of the game, but the absence of story bothered me to much.   P.S. On top of that, this game is a big party of bugs :D
10916	  Although the story to this game is pretty great so far, I can't recommend it until the devs fix the awful performance and bugs
10917	I do like the story line but in all honestly I hate the gameplay.  Damage on cars it seems is non exsistant until the car blows up in your face. e.g. Your going 105 mph and you crash into someone, you lose a tad of heatlh. Rev into a lampost from a standstill, the car ignites into flames. Charecter movement is very wooden and glitchy, when I tell the charecter to take cover, it glicthes between taking cover and running into an object. AI is predictable and largely seems to be on rails. The gameplay is very repetitive and always seems to be the same, Mission structure is basically go to X, kill Z, steal Y. This game doesnt even compare to its predocessor Mafia 2. Really want to enjoy this game, Im forcing myself to play it to the end. Verdict: Disapointing gameplay, really expected more from 2k and Rockstar. In my opinion they could have done alot better. Really enjoying the storyline but i dont know if thats enough merit buying the game.
10918	Well, the graphics are really nice/cool. :P
10919	Honestly a great story let down by repeative boring missions.
10920	This Game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥   nuff said  would refund if my son hadn't played it for 3 hours  running a GTX 1080 and it's still awful
10921	Not even close to first game. Even mafia 2 is better than this crap.  Pros:  Soundtrack  Cons:  Everything   2k should give this game to cd projekt, than maybe we can play a nice game.
10922	I was and still am huge fan of Mafia series, started with Mafia and for ages waited Mafia II. And when it was released it was something epic. Unfortunately this time its not the case. The only thing this game keeps to other series is great story. But this time story is just video insert during game, while missions are repetitive and boring 'grab' or 'kill' and even though it has massive map, all of this repeats in each district. Actually if you played DLC jimmy's vendetta on Mafia II- it compares to it very well. But Jimmy's vendetta was only DLC and now it is a game. I know Mafia II had complains about not beeing open world enough, but this time it feels like it was done sacrificing game itself.  Even graphics and physics are not realistic anymore (which for me made Mafia II incredible). This time there are no small nicks and knacks that makes game stand out from other series. For me Mafia was always trumping GTA series. Not this time. It feels like copy of GTA actually. Especially when they show some gang arriving in three cars. the physics. the looks. the moves. everything is different and seems unnatural compared to Mafia II.   So all in all I would say that if you played and enjoyed Mafia series in past- I don't recommend buying it for that. You will be disappointed. BUT if old Mafia series seemed too slow paced for you or you loved GTA series and you prefer action over details - you probably will like this game.
10923	Honestly a great story let down by repeative boring missions.
10924	Gameplay is cut &amp; paste from every generic open-world game that has come out in the last five years. Swap out the gameplay with Mad Max, The Division, or any other mediocre disappointment that's been billed out to useless developers.  Story is decent, but nothing worth your time, and the gameplay isn't related to the events in the cutscenes most of the time. Complete enough fluff to meet the fluff-threshold and then you get a cutscene about how you killed the guy you're about to kill, spoiling it literally minutes before you go to a place where you've just been, to fight guards that have just respawned, to kill the guy like in the cutscene.  Recommendation: Watch the cutscenes on Youtube, you're not missing anything in the gameplay.  Better Recommendation: Save yourself the time of watching all of that. Play the first hour of the game and then return it. When the main charcter goes 'I'm going to kill the bad guy' you've reached the end of the story. It doesn't get any more, or less, complex. Main character decides to kill the bad guy. Main character kills the bad guy. Game over. No twists, no obstacles of note, no betrayal. Everything goes exactly as planned and the bad guy gets killed. The end.  P.S.: I really liked the part where it crashed during the last cutscene. Really built the suspense, having to go through the last mission again, sit through the credits again, and then sit through the credits for a third time before it let me quit.  Score: 9/11
10925	I regret my purchase. Only 5 hours or so in, I didn't find much fun in this, because of the repetitive missions. I couldn't find myself to care much for the characters, because they kept going on-and-on about how Lincoln (the main character) is so bad â¥â¥â¥... and I just roll my eyes when every scene keeps repeating this. The PC controls could use some tweaking, because it always feel like their is a half second delay before performing the action I want.
10926	Im not quite sure if i should give this a positive review or not, i feel like im slighty going towards the negative side.  My game does run smoothly ( apart from the 30 fps ) - and i've played for a reasonable amount of time in these 2 days.   I feel like the game is very dull - clear the rackets - kill the underbosses - kill the boss - repeat. Apart from the little side quest here and there, its very linear. The driving is nothing special, the game is also very easy ( even on the hardest difficulty ) However, the story telling is very well done, as are the cinematics, its one of the few reasons i still play. I did just rage quit because i jumped down a 1 story building thinking i'd survive, i mean, even in real life you wouldnt even sprain anything... but in this game, i died while on full health..so dont jump off anything at all...  So far i had a better time playing The Godfather series....  + Story  + Cinematics  +/- Shooting - Driving - AI  - Grinding ( why do they always have to include so many collectables in every game? Isnt the game long enough? ) - Dying while jumping off a 4 meter tall building  I had high hopes for this game, so far its a let down. I recommend waiting untill its on sale. 
10927	I have loved the mafia games since playing the first one as a kid. So I really want to like this game, despite the porty feel to it, the bad optimization in cities, the awful cqc system compared to mafia 2 and the fps cap that will likely be fixed.   The game looks promising so far , but im stuck on the first mission. I changed my controls so F is my cqc button (standard). This meant that i shuffled q to be my cover button and ctrl to be sneak. Long story short this broke the game.   Now not only can't I kill people with cqc, but the button to close the tips pop up doesn't work so I can't progress. I tried changing it back but it didnt fix it. So yea im stuck unable to progress until they can fix this poor excuse of a port. :/  ***EDIT***  They fixed the keyboard mapping glitch that stopped me from progressing but now I have gotten to the rest of the game, and I understand why they left the 30fps cap. My fps hovers around 20-30 fps on unlimited. Even on high the game still looks like crap. I don't know how this is possible. Why is this game such a downgrade from Mafia 2?   The people in charge of characters and story good job. Everything else is poo. Stealth is stupid easy because the ai is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The missions are really copy paste so far and hard to enjoy when even on the hardest difficulty just dicking around I havent died once in 6 hrs.  Sad day. Wait for a lot of patches.  ***EDIT 2***  I tried to get a refund for the game because I don't see it as playable at this time. Steam denied me because I played 5 hrs 44 min, which is over their 2 hr limit. Most of that time I spent trying to fix this broken game. I have never asked for a refund before but forcing me to pay for a game that doesnt work, that I should have been able to enjoy, is not bright.
10928	 tl;dr Don't buy it at this time.   This is a game I've been waiting for, for a very long time. Ever since Mafia 2 was released, I've been waiting for the next one. Mafia 1 was my favourite game when I was younger. It's what really got me into gaming. After the, in my opinion, somewhat anti-climatic ending of Mafia 2, I was really looking forward to see if 2K could add another great game to the series.  Now it's here. And it's... it's not a Mafia game. It just doesn't feel like Mafia. It feels like the developers have played a little too much GTA, and decided to make a copy of it. I've played a lot of the previous Mafia games, as I'm sure plenty of you have as well. I've completed the first Mafia game 5 times, Mafia 2 once on normal, and then thrice on hard. With Mafia 3, I doubt I'll play it more than once. At the time of writing this, I've played roughly 9 hours. It's been out for 24 hours exactly, and I feel 'meh' about playing more. When Mafia 2 was released, I had completed it two days later. It was just that good. I'll probably finish Mafia 3 this comming weekend, I have enough trust in my inner geek. I just don't really want to play it...  Below is a short list of reason to buy it, as well as a list of reasons not to.   Reason to buy the game:    -The story, so far, is good. It's not on the same levels as the previous Mafia games, but it's solid.    -The music. Just like Mafia 2, the developers have implemented the actual music from this time period, making the game feel more immersive.    -The gun combat. My god. I've played plenty of shooting games. But this games shooting just feels so damn satisfying. Unloading a clip into en enemy, seeing him fall back, or maybe over a railing, while your gun is smoking... it's just so good.    Reasons not to buy the game:   (Note: many of these things are technical, and can be resolved with patches.) -The graphics. This is, disappointingly, quite clearly a console port. The graphics just aren't good. For a PC game in this day and age, the graphics are simply not good enough.    -The driving. What happened here? Compared to Mafia 2, the driving in this game is just strange. It seems Lincoln only know two modes; brake or foot to the floor. You go form sitting at a red light, to trying to take off like a drag racer. Theres also no speed limiter. At first I thought this would be really annoying, seeing how cops enforce the speed limit in this game, just like the previous ones. But I've yet to have any cops chase me for going too quick. To test this i drove past a police car going 100 mph, and they didn't even bother chasing me.    -The AI. While there is games that do this worse, the AI could use some work.    -And ofcourse, what every other review is also stating. The FPS lock... It's not acceptable, and is, for me, reason enough not to buy the game.   While the above are there to help you make a decision about buying the game, there are a few things I would have thought would be nice to know before I bought it.   -Cut scenes, with ingame models, sometimes have strange animations and lighting.-The map is not as big as you might think. Driving from one end to the other takes very little time. It  feels  around the same size as Mafia 2.-It feels more like a GTA game, than it does a Mafia game.  The game is over all pretty okay. It's nothing like the previous games. I think the developers took a little too much inspiration from GTA 5, and forgot they were making a Mafia game.   I, personally, disagree with the time period they chose. Or atleast the way they did it. If we weren't an outsider, taking down the Mafia, maybe it would've worked better. In my opinion, there would have been better periods to depict in a Mafia game.  I've never written a review before, but I hope this helped you make the decision. Whether you end up buying the game or not, I hope I was of some help.
10929	I'm not entirely sure how they're able to get away with selling this game alongside gameplay videos and screenshots that are in no way representative of the end product. It's not just the 30 FPS, the graphics are extremely MUDDY and low resolution. Turning certain graphical features OFF actually makes the graphics improve, which makes me wonder if this is the developers first time working with a PC after a career developing slot machines for the app store. Gameplay so far is a mixed bag too, in trying to make a true open world game this time around, the missions and objectives have less flavour to them. The AI is very clunky and stilted and moves predictably meaning you're rarely in any real danger. I have enjoyed the driving physics so far, the muscle cars in particular drift in a satisfying way, and the in-car combat system works well. I'm hoping further patches will help improve this - not just FPS, but fixing the AA and increasing the texture resolution so that it matches the screen resolution.
10930	Mafia 3 tells the story of Lincoln Clay, an ex-military war veteran who returns home to find his city mixed up in a mess involving major crime organisations.   The game begins with mixed missions but as you go on you realise you are doing the same things repeatedly. When I began the game, I planned to compete the 'story missions' and the 'optional chapters', however, as I continued to play I realised that If i continued this I would be too bored to finished the game so I stuck to story missions.   The graphics in this game are exceptional and impress, the game optimisation on the other hand is another story. Despite having a high-end computer mafia 3 struggles to reach the 50fps mark. At times, it will between 60 and 100 but this is a rear occurrence. However, if you don't mind the low frames the game is very pleasing to look at.   The story involves killing many underbosses before reaching the main boss. It involves taking over districts and then assigning them to your chosen partners. It is safe to say this game is the most repetitive game I've ever played. The only mission type is killing. You are tasked with interrogating, killing, killing to get money and killing to get either drugs or other items.   The game currently lacks basic features which I think should have been incorporated into the game in the beginning. Firstly, there should be much better character optimisation. A choice of about 10 outfits is a poor effort. Secondly, the creators did not incorporate very much vehicle modifications besides the basics (speed upgrade, bulletproof tyres). You are not given a set vehicle; you can call Vito and get a choice of 9 cars every time you need one (for free). As for the money, you collect, it's pointless. Most of the guns once unlocked can be equipped for free making money pointless besides for buying grenades, Molotovâs or for character or vehicle upgrades. The 'adrenaline' is also pointless because most missions have more than one first aid cabinets.   One of the major plusses about this game is the fact that the character development is very good. I felt very engaged with Lincoln Clay's character. Some of the cut scenes are good but some of them are repetitive.  The game would be worth between Â£10 and Â£15 depending on how determined you are to complete the game. Iâve reached 23 hours (at the time of this review) and have killed every underboss. But I donât have the drive to continue.

10932	I don't usually do reviews, and I'd honestly like to play more of this game before I make one, but I legit can't. So far, after 25 minutes of playing, my game has crashed 4 times, yes, 4 times. Not sure how I'm supposed to review a game that can't even last through 6 and a half minutes of play time. Do not buy this game, at least not right now. This is just a terribly done PC port. It doesn't run properly, crashes constantly, and it has a 30fps lock. Wait until 2k actually patches the game and makes it playable before you even consider buying.  UPDATE After 5 hours in, game still crashes, I have had over 20 crashes at this point, haven't even made it 15% into the story mode. Steam won't refiund me. Glad I payed 60 dollars for a crashing simulator.
10933	Can't even get past the 'Main Menu' Screen. After lowering all the setting to their lowest point, and clicking 'Play Now' it goes to a black screen and immediately crashes, This is even after 3 Re-Installs... Paid the full price like everyone else.  As of right now, No.. I do not recommened anybody else paying $60.00 for a non working game.
10934	Most repetitive and overhyped game ever.
10935	 Did Hangar 13 overreach themselves?
10936	Not much of the classic Mafia vibe left, and the new direction doesn't speak to me although I can feel the message about racism they wanted to deliver. For what it's worth the acting seems well done but it can't save it for me. This game's PC release is a perfect example of why pre-ordering is bad. Poor performance even on high-end rigs, massively broken at times (just look it up on YouTube) and essential things like fast-travel for let's say controlled districts are missing from the game. Other 'necessary' options like re-assigning districts are missing too, although a maybe understandable design choice. Even tiniest issues like other-region keyboards being properly supported (on a German keyboard the game will tell me to press Y when it should be Z and vice versa) will not get fixed. No option to disable auto-centering of the camera while driving. Even such long time after release the poor performance and unfixed major bugs make this a horrible game to have bought. Instead of fixes we get skins. Highly doubt the release of more DLC is going to make me reinstall the game again unless some major patches get released as well. (if you made it this far you probably should have read a different review, I'm not good at this and just doing it for the Autumn sale rewards lol)
10937	Mafia III was annouced on July 28, 2015. It is now the release date and there is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 30 FPS cap?! Come on 2K this is BS. I'd recommend you wait until they patch it so we get above the 30 FPS cap... I know this just sounds like a review about the frame rate but not only that my fellow Mafia fans.... THE TEXTURES LOOK LIKE DIRT   Please don't do what I did and waste your birthday money on this..  I was so hyped for this game you don't even know... To be let down like this is just depressing.   If they patch this and fix the cons I'll change my review.  
10938	-Graphics are garbage -30FPS (For now) -People spawning as you move/drive towards them -No expression/change on character (doesn't blink forever and doesn't move face)  -Good Storyline/outline of it -Morgan Freeman is apparently a character -Lincoln is buff as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
10939	Unplayable at the moment. My 6700k and GTX 1070 (latest driver) stutters every few seconds regardless of graphics setting at 1080P and 1440P. In fact, even the opening cinematic stuttered...... game is also installed on an SSD. Will update when patched.
10940	30 fps caps lock. Upscaled horrible textures. Lighting super bad, looks software based. Bad port, fu 2k. Refunding.
10941	This game is a slap on the face for pc players. I was a fool for pre-ordering this game. If I wanted to play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ at 30 fps I would have bought the ps4.  If the game would be locked at 30 fps then it should have been announced before. I wouldn't have bother pre-ordering or buying the game.   Producers are developers, PC is a different plaform. So, don't try to shove down what you make for console onto pc gamers. If you wanna be par across platform just make games for consoles. Don't even bother with PC games.

10947	Game Is not A complete pile of Trash...   But It has allot of problems. First thing is that It tries to much to be a open world map yet It fails as there's nothing to do.. No reason to fix cars or guns and cash become meaningless.. I dont see why they did not just focuse on the action more. And make it in to story scenarios.. Would worked way better.. As getting around the map get's stall really quick.. And the Broken AI and uninteresting world doesn't help it much.. Damm I got more to do in Assassin Creed games.   I don't recommend this game.. And honestly.. The only good thing is that It's satisfying to shoot people, And the story is good.. But you lose interest in to all of it. .As the missions are repedetiv.. you do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ the entire game.. never get anywhere.. you never become a crime boss.. Never gain any power.. you just the guy going around killing people..   And the AI is horrible.. Damm they dont flank.. they dont switch cover.. It feels like a 2013 game.. Except in graphic..Yet it feels like the game downgrade itself betwen cutscenes and actual gameplay.. Like It's trying to cheat on you.   5/10.. Mediocer game.
10948	Basically another GTA. IF you not tired already to drive here and there and do bunch of identical missions in identical buildings..... then go for it. Im 31- maybe im too old..... but GTA took everything out of this genre already. AI intellect also low. Cops are not fun... i don know - this is my first review ever - thats what i think.
10949	10 minutes into playing CRASHES- Are you serious? I don't care about the 30 FPS cap but hot damn 10 minutes and a crash
10950	Nothing To Say At This Point...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0 
10951	10 minutes into playing CRASHES- Are you serious? I don't care about the 30 FPS cap but hot damn 10 minutes and a crash
10952	Nothing To Say At This Point...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0 
10953	I know it was you, 2K. You broke my heart. You broke my heart.
10954	My eyes are getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! 30fps is bs! Story is great btw :) Patch the game and you get a thumbs up. After bioshock remasterd and this i see that 2k only care for that console cash  After patch:  Broken mess! GTX 1080 can barely hold the game above 60 fps at high setting with awefull textures. Turned it down to medium settings and the game crashed seconds after! Stay away from this game until a real fix arrives.
10955	I was so damn hyped for this game, which makes it an even bigger let-down. Not only were there immense technical issues at launch, there's also a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of bugs and missions that do, for some reason, not trigger for me.
10956	Giving this a negative review so as to the fact that the controls are the clunkiest â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever. Like seriously im in the second mission and my sneak button doesnt work. I switched it from x to c and then to left ctrl and thenback to x again and still i am not allowed to sneak. Am i doing something wrong? other than that the game is fine. good story music and all above but graphics wise, eh it can be tweaked a bit higher
10957	Boring and repetitive.  Same mission again and again.  Same dudes everywhere.  Same locations over and over.  At least combat feels nice. Port is bad as well. To few options and graphics suck.
10958	I loved Mafia 1 &amp; 2 but boy is this a disapointment. Should not have been called Mafia 3, has next to nothing to do with the mafia, story/telling which made the other 2 games just plain sucks, graphics are bad, mini map hopeless, stealth kills are poor like the rest of the game. If it had more polish and was called something else then maybe it would be worth a look but a Mafia game this aint.   TLDR, look else where.
10959	Playing the game Lincoln goes to sleep, game crashed took that as a sign, go to sleep wait for a patch
10960	  EDIT: I DID NOT RECIEVE THIS FOR FREE  Bad port.   Shame really because the game has tremendous potential. Yet, the game in its current state is â¥â¥â¥â¥.   The game is a gem sure, but it is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered gem.   Wait to buy this game. It is not worth the full price in its current state.
10961	i dont know what the hell is up with the graphics and the frame cap so far the story is good but everything else about the game is just off. hopefully they fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥ cause im kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that this game looks like this. last gen consoles had better graphics then this game.
10962	Mafia 3 The game is NOT optimized for PC, 30fps cap then now no gpu can do 60fps 1920x1080. The graphics is really bad in-game but the cutscenes are pretty good.  The missons are repetitive doing all the same again and again. Driving is bad if you click 'D' the car will fly away. The gunfights are ok.  The story is really blend but the last 20 min of the game is really good.  4.5/10
10963	Did i ever tell you the definition of insanity? it's doing the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ mission over and over
10964	  Boring gameplay, always repeat same mission. All the building also same. Never buy this game.
10965	Sorry to say (write) this but I regret buying the Mafia 3.  The story and the atmosphere of New Bordeau is cool, the music and voiceacting is top notch but the graphics and the bugs are just too much...  The graphic does not look to good but I do not have a big problem with it unless it's not running smoothly - and this is bad. I have a i5 - 4590 with Asus GTX 970 and 8GB RAM so it's not PC MasterRace but still decent enough. It seems it does not matter do I use a max or min settings - the graphic always does not feel smooth, like it's loosing framerate here and there for a spilt of a second - you cannot say it freezes on you but you still know there is something funny going.  If the game will be patched and like 50% off with all future DLC it's propably worth it but when I paid the whole pirce right now I feel like I tossed my money to the mud and could just go with GTA 5.  I now understand the comments about Mafia 2 being better even after 6 years apart from this Mafia.  In current state it's a 5 out of 10 - average at best.
10966	Wow,  Never thought I'd be so disappointed with a title that I'd feel the need to voice it.   IMHO the game is not ready and unplayable at this moment. It looks like the producer of the game balantly lured people into a typical honey trap - I tried playing on i7-3820@4.2ghz, 32GB Ram, GTX1070 with the game on Intel SSD 750. The game graphic-wise looks worse than old GTA titles and still glitches and smudging/blur on the screen all the time... Very very poor...:(  How do refunds work ? I played the game for a very short time and am not planning to play it again. Is there an option on Steam to do that or do I have to conact the developer/producer ?
10967	It Doesn't Start! Start -&gt; BlackScreen-&gt; Windows -&gt; No error report  I have the latest driver and hardware!
10968	Update: The UI issue seems to only be in the prologue. The frame dips are caused by collision issues, mostly with NPC cars crashing into or through each other and somehow ending up halfway in the floor. The NPCs are extremely buggy, especially civilians and cops driving. I've noticed sometimes, all of the NPCs will randomly just start driving around in circles. When this happens, they all do it, not just one. The GPS is also garbage. It frequently directs you to an inaccessible route, such as through a building you can't break. Cars randomly spawn. I had one car spawn on top of mine. I had a car spawn on a road close enough that if I hadn't been extremely careful in the first place, I probably would have hit it and killed myself. The gameplay is almost decent.On hard, the combat feels almost great. The shooting, for the most part, feels sufficiently brutal, but the melee kills feel lacking. The AI is terrible, making stealth ridiculously easy. Unlike Mafia II, where there was an open world, but nothing to do but the story, Mafia III does a really good job of making the player go around the map and complete open world objectives in the manner they see fit. The game offers a lot of freedom. It seems it's an almost decent game that's completely ruined by a bad PC port.   This game is awful. Forget about the 60 fps patch. This game is a flaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ all around. It looks pretty bad, and heats my PC up even more than GTA V, even though GTA is running at 2048x1152 on relatively high settings, and this was running at 1366x768 on low. It would run perfectly fine, albeit ugly, with a steady 60 fps, then dip into 20 with frame and audio stuttering, like playing games from the early 2000s sometimes do. The keyboard controls are horrendous. No 2 actions can be bound to the same key, my extra mouse buttons are not recognized, and actions like picking up bodies are seperate from interact. Sniper scope is also seperated from the aim key. The UI overlaps, so I was supposed to time pressing e to pry open a door, but the 'sweet spot' which indicates when I'm supposed to press e is hidden underneath a text box. This game looks to be solid, underneath the technical mess that makes it unplayable. I've already refunded my money.
10969	After so many years of waiting it's as though they have applied a Watch Dogs feel to the game. The graphics are nice in places but even now the Illusion engine from Mafia 2 is better. It has gone incredibly towards the arcade side, and not in a good way. Repetative gameplay that for me at least does not immerse me in the game, and I'm incredibly disappointed this was the end product. This is not Mafia and once again a company like this, takes what was a good franchise and goes in reverse.
10970	It's not a Mafia. Dead world, where all NPC, quests etc create with a 'Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V'. Save your money, ignore this 'product'.
10971	Wow,  Never thought I'd be so disappointed with a title that I'd feel the need to voice it.   IMHO the game is not ready and unplayable at this moment.

10972	AD3  I`v finished the game before(I`m assuming it will get patched eventualy) it Was patched, my recomendation wont be changed.  PS. i dont want to be offensive(I beg of you, really please dont take this the wrong way) but black people made gangs, not mafia....game feels more like Get Rich or die trying then The Godfather...   AD2  hotfix 1   game looks ok, big improvemend whitout blur  Still problems whit optimalisation but it`s getting better, if this get`s fixed I`l change my recomendation.  BTW game is really cool, repetative but very cool.  AD1   Fps unlocked but another problem surffed out, game is not optimased   Rear viev mirror should be an option and 99% it`s a preformance killer  Oryginal  I didn`t realize how awfull 30 fps until today... to think that people on consoles play games like this is...well i dont know where to even start(please dont take offence and sry for my english).  I`l change my recomendation once the patch is out and it works fine becouse for now game is unplayable for me.
10973	I shouldnt be called MAFIA III.....it insults the original MAFIA which was a flawed classic, even the boring MAFIA II  It should be called Disorganised Crime '' A poorly executed GTA clone''  That would have been more honest  PS The f*****ng skyboxes man, .... in 2016....
10974	My first review on this game was after 2 hours of gameplay, and I was really excited about it. But, after 53 hours of gameplay (I finished it only because I paid 50â¬ for it, and I didn't want to throw my money away), I really can't recommend this game (maybe on Christmas Sales), because it is unfinished and it's an insult to the Mafia series.  I'm giving you my pros and cons list.  Pros:  - Good music.  - Cool story.  - Well made cutscenes.  - â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! (Playboy magazines)  Cons:  - A lot of graphical bugs (People flying 'The Exorcist' style, vehicles appearing out of nowhere, etc.).  - Really repetitive gameplay. You will get bored after taking over 3 rackets, because it is just hiding and whistling and stabbing over and over again.  - Mentally challenged AI, especially the police officers. Really, New Bordeaux PD must review their recruiting policy, because the stupidest people in the city are becoming cops.  - Big map without life or credibility. The devs haven't exploited the map at all.  - Car physics is abhorrent. You can ram into a tree at 120 mph and you won't even get a scratch on your car.  - No vehicle customization. You can't do things you could do on Mafia II, like open the trunk, fix the engine, and so on.
10975	This game is a monumental disaster zone, just another console ported sack of crap  COMPLAINT UNDER THE SALE OF GOODS ACT THIS GAME WILL BE RETURNED TO STEAM AS FAULTY, NOT FIT FOR USE  ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME***
10976	Pretty disappointed, the whole game felt like a san andreas rip off with its colour coded districts depending on which underboss you give it to. The traffic system that they were talking about where you had to be careful about cops around was complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I speed through red lights left and right while cops are just there looking at me and not doing anything.  Predictable and boring storyline, repetetive gameplay, no customization (upgrades dont count), boring cutscenes and a very small arsenal of guns and cars to choose from.   The game is way too short in my opinion, they tried to make the game feel longer by making you take over the whole map to progress til the end with boring cutscenes to make you feel like you accomplished something.  The only good thing i liked was the atmosphere, voice acting, driving and shooting mechanics.  All in all its a boring, repetitive and does not live up to the little hype it had
10977	Really boring.. Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.

10981	Ugly! Bad optimzed! Crashes! Low content! Boring! There is no good idea in this game! Poor! Doesn't worth its price!

10985	GLITCHES:  https://tdgameclub.com/mafia-3-game-graphical-glitches/   Really worst game ever... What a shame for a big company to produce this to Mafia title.. I have no crashes but only ingame bugs... Graphic is like better GTA 4 be smart and buy GTA 5 instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ (in this state)..
10986	They say don't buy games that aren't out yet but I was sure this would be good, if for nothing else but the story. (I loved the story of Mafia 2) Well I was wrong, what a waste of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money, the AI is the worst I have every seen in a game. The story seems like it would be nice but you have to take such long breaks from it to 'Claim' districts, which gameplay is the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing over and over again. Its just too bad really, the world they crafted is quite good, but the game itself is just lacking in too many departments for 2016. They took a huge step backwards on the customization such as outfits and car modding. Not to mention the cars will be moved from where you park them when you go inside certain buildings and the cars also barely show damage when you hit things. Their is just to much immersion breaking in this game. I will say they did a few things right, such as the soundtrack and when you're moving your character around with a controller the left thumbstick does it all, push slightly forward to walk, more for running, and click in to sprint, no smashing the 'A' button continually like some games. Thats really about it though. Bad game don't buy.
10987	Mediocre and Generic
10988	Like a lot of fans of the Mafia game I was hoping on a third run, so when they announced Mafia 3 I was so happy and could not wait to play the game.  But after running the game I was very disappointed, the game looks like they have not put any effort in at all. It looks like they have taken Mafia 2 and tried to update the graphics and failed. The graphics and sound are what you would expect from a 2006-2010 game release. The car sounds sound cheap and messy, I have no idea what the bang sound is from car and trucks as you brake and accelerate. If I was to score this mess Iout of 5 it would be 2. I would have expected this game to look alot more like GTA 5 graphices as it being a 2016 release.  Im happy I only payed Â£20 for this game and not 35-45 as its not worth that sort of money. If I put a price on it it would be Â£15.  Such a waste of a great game. Mafia 2 look alot better.  I marked as not recommended so you can make your own choice, Its playable and ok if you can look past the messy sound and texture quality,not the best version of the Mafia games.
10989	So where should I start? Nah I shouldnt. Mediocre game with horrible performance on my otherways decent PC and a mediocre storyline. Disappointed me a fair bit as I have been waiting for this release since I finished Mafia 2 back in 2013 :|

10995	Really boring.. Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.
10996	I got bored so quickly. the story is ok, but the repetetiveness of the missions is HIGH!
10997	Yup, this is a boring game.....
10998	Good story, outdated graphics, lots of bugs and repetitive as hell!!!
10999	I liked Mafia, LOVED Mafia II so I was hopeful in the lead up to this game and was let down. I finished the game a month ago... gameplay was broken then, so I just mainlined it for the cutscenes. My recommendation is just watch the cutscenes on Youtube or something. Save your money and your time, its too valuable. There's no reason to play the game for the story, gameplay is just too bad to justify any price.
11000	GO â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOURSELF HANGAR 13, don't ever make a new game.
11001	sky box looks like fermented sh*t 30fps lock on launch repetitive gamplay uninstalled after only 5 hrs but the main menu has all along the watchtower  4/10
11002	Couldnt run the the game well at all, low fps and crashes, dont like the new style of driving, dont like the repetitive game play and was quite disappointed overall, got a refund within a day.
11003	It's not the mafia game we all been waiting for, but it's still playable
11004	Repetitive, unpolished and a disappointment compared to its predecessor.
11005	Probably one of the worst games of 2016! The game has performace issues, tons of bugs and the mission design is sooo repetetive. 3/10
11006	I really wanted to like this game as I had the previous ones. Great music, characters, some good cutscenes......but its just SO BORING. I really wanted to beat it because I thought I cared about the characters.. But I just couldn't handle the boredom.  It's sad how generic Mafia seems now. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPETE WITH GTA DONT EVEN TRY.  Recommended price: $30
11007	Overrated
11008	One word: repetitive.
11009	The first two installments were very much linear games with open world elements. It worked very well for them. And were immensely enjoyable. Mafia III on the other feels like a vastly empty open world with small missions located within it. A third of the time I'm Just driving through an empty world from point a to point b. I really tried to like this game, but 10 hours in, and I regret buying a physical copy of this. It's a really sad goodbye to a favorite franchise. Don't buy it. It feels like a try hard rip-off of GTA. Nothing like the original Mafia games.
11010	Whoever loved Mafia 1 and Mafia 2, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! its nothing but a disappointment...
11011	Even if this wouldnt be called 'Mafia' it still would have been a stale boring repetitive game on its own.   Pros:
11012	A poor game with rinse and repeat gameplay and a generic you were betrayed and left for dead story. I tried to force myself through it because it was decent at first but it is so mind numbingly boring.
11013	are you serious 30 fps wtf!!!  btw this game is really cool but still â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 2k
11014	Shame on you 2K. Betrayal, as it says on your game commercial.
11015	Game will not load. I press start in the launcher, I get black screen for 3 seconds then it crashes to desktop. Please fix, I want to play. I have no playtime, I cant believe steam records game time for crashing simulator.
11016	FOR NOW? HELL NO, 2K fks every PC gamers who gave high hope for this game, We wait it for 6 years, 6 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ years and you dont think pc gamers can handle 60 fps? This is how you treat your customers? 2K FK YOUSELF!
11017	Bad game. Full of bugs, bad graphics with almost no settings, repetitive missions... Compared to Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1, this looks like the first game, not the last one.
11018	FIX THIS GAME FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥S SAKE Performance is still very bad and there are countless bugs, some of them even game breaking..  Without the black protagonist &amp; overall setting (which isn't even that creative nor fitting as a part of the Mafia franchise) this game would probably get publicly bashed for being the second worst title of 2016 after No Mans Sky. However the most annoying things missing are a Free Roam mode at the end (you wouldn't even have to add new missions, just let the players travel around freely in the world and collect those useless collectibles..) and a regular main menu, especially where you can look at your collectibles. And by the way: Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are there hundreds of those electric devices scattered throughout the City if you don't even need half of them? It's basically a complete waste of time to collect all of them. I know that the publisher probably forced this specific release date and the game wasn't truly finished yet, but how long have you worked on it, Mafia 2 came out in 2010, that's six long years.. and all the bad choices of things that are/aren't included in this game can't be explained by this circumstance.  Overall this game truly is a step back from Mafia 2, either they learned nothing from community feedback or simply chose to ignore it. As a fan of the Mafia series it is not recommended to buy this game in it's current state, however it is unlikely that everything gets fixed since many bugs in Mafia 2 also never got fixed and still exist..
11019	I was hoping not to give this game a bad review. But it featuring on the autumn sale gives me little to no choice. This game isn't close to acceptable. I can play it for an hour before getting too annoyed with all the flaws.  We're not talking about some small imperfections, it's glaring and annoying flaws in the game.  Don't buy this game. Just don't.
11020	So sad ,after the amazing mafia 2 this game is probably kill the mafia franchise ):
11021	This game starts out very promising, seeming similar to the linear gameplay that was mafia 2 Straight foward great story with great cut scenes. After the first hour or two the game opens up becoming a sequence of repetitive uninteresting side quests in order to develop the story. The Ai was simplistic and the great police system of Mafia 2 is gone. This game seems to suffer from the we need to open the game up and fill it with â¥â¥â¥â¥ to avoid the negative pre release publicity. It had so much potential but I can not reccomend it at a full price. Yes i got some sort of entertainment from it but would of rather i had waited for a sale
11022	Doesn't have ANY of the stuff that made Mafia 2 great. Not even the small things which could be so easy to make, such as cops ticketing you if you go too fast, trying to arrest you if you were too naughty, etc. Nope, the cops will just kill you if you ram into them like in GTA.   Can't go into various stores and buy something to drink or eat either. Nope, not even the ones that aren't segregated.   Driving physics suck.   Missions are EXTREMELY repetitive and boring. You literally do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.  Terribly optimized. Can't reach 60 FPS (which is a bare â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minimum) on a GTX 1070, i5 6600K. Was even 30 FPS locked at release, that by it self is enough to give this game a red thumbs down.  Play Mafia 2, it even looks just as good as this game and is much better.
11023	it's not even 5 bucks worth....it's a shame. The game runs for an 1hr now and the only thing i've done is watch a cutscene, walk 5 steps, watch another cutscene, drove to a Bank, another cutscene, walk senseless around with nothing to do, watch a cutscene, killed 5 guards, watched another cutscene, walked into the bed, loading screen, watches another cutscene.  GG 2k! i bought a film for 50 bucks. well played....
11024	I nerver post commentary usualy. But this game deserve it. I play 65 min on this game and sorry but it's totaly garbage . No optimization . Low texture . 2K should delay the game on PC. I have a GTX 1070 who can run th witcher 3 full utlra +nvidia gameworks at 60fps in 1080p.  Mafia is again a good example to a bad optimisation title as Batman.  It's totaly not acceptable to sell a game like that.  I will wait few weeks to see if they will patch the game and maybe change my evaluation. Worst case ask for a refund !  But actually I advise people to don't buy it and wait some time.  By the way the story seems really good ! Sad to wait patch to play....  2k move your â¥â¥â¥!
11025	Horribly optimized and very monotonous. Don't be fooled by the two first hours. Afterwards it's just go here, do that, kill these guys, and go back. The only thing that the game really has going for itself is the story and music. But everything else is just mediocore. And well, it's just a hassle to play, no fun at all. Such a let down after Mafia 2!
11026	good story, but you have to play the boring missions to get to the good parts, and after there isn't anything to do apart from getting collectables and juction boxes or whatever. Its alright but mafia 2 is still way better.
11027	Mafia III... let's keep it short since the devs did not take their time with porting the game for PC decently as well!  The Bad - severe fps drops (down to 4-5) all the time - the minimum hardware demands do not make sense since my hardware is right in between min and max demands and I can't run it properly (running everything on low) - the game looks far 'worse' than GTA 5 (it is not ugly, though), but it runs like a rusty bike - highly repetetive missions you need to accomplish to unlock story missions - the underboss system is a hit and miss. Miss: You unlock certain perks/favours from underbosses but have to pay for those anyways. I wouldn't call those a favour then. Also, there is talk of loyalty while there is no indication on how loyal your underbosses are.  [EDIT]- your decision to whom to give a district to is based on an arbitrary skill tree linked to each underboss, so you don't decide on characteristics but on what you want to get out of them. This obviously kills the whole vibe of a possible brawl between underbosses - if an enemy becomes aware of you he is simply a bullet sponge - every main boss is a bullet sponge - alternative open world missions are highly repetetive - story-supporting missions which do not contribute to the main story are all the same: interrogate that thugh to get to the other thug to kill the third thug. All. The. Time. - hard difficulty is a joke - you can just run from so many situations whithout a scratch - the AI (in the open world) is terrible: 'Oh, there is a body... well, probably old age!' Or: 'I heard shots and found three dead guys. Better search for ten seconds, then let it go,... just because'. Yet they know exactly where you are when throwing explosives or shooting through thickest smoke or bushes. What a joke. - enemies have deadly precision over yours - witness system: Doesn't seem to work properly during open world missions. [EDIT]- you can't, like in Mafia 2, replay your missions by choosing them from a menue. Big disappointment right there. [EDIT]- damage model of cars is not as elaborate as in games comparable to this  The Good + story missions (non-open-worlded) work great and are fun (they are linear but they function as they should!) + video clips and actors play together very well + characters are believable + music is great + the problems of racism are adressed and you as the protagonist are to do something about it + the underboss system is a hit and miss. Hit: You can call in certain favours (hit squad, operator phone shut-off, call off police) so you need to decide wisely whom to give a district to. + witness system: when people see a crime they are likely to report you. Adds tension. + different enemy types: sentry, grunt, gunner, sniper + weapons have remarkably different attributes from accuracy over mag capacity to fire rate which actually have an impact on gun fights + gun fights feel amazin due to great sounds and impactful guns, especially shotguns [EDIT]+ elaborate city with a variety of locations and territorially distinguishable landscapes [EDIT]+ I stuck to the main story and it took me about 25-27 hours. Decent.  The Verdict Shame on the developer for dishing out such an unfinished, unpolished PC version of the game. Customers pay good, hard-earned money on your product, that has been out for 21 days now. No  efficient  fix has been issued. You took a franchise which started with a masterpiece, continued with a story-strong and combat-weak Mafia II and ended in this mess. It could've been fun if you did not count so much on open-worlded story supporting mission design, which is bound to be repetetive and if you actually postponed the release for the PC version to dish out an optimized game. You decided to go against your valued customers, take their money and only get around 50% approval rates. Deserved, in my opinion.  I can't recommend this game, especially not for Mafia lovers like me. It is like with the movies - sloppy seconds are bad. Third parts following there are almost always utter garbage.
11028	AAA price for Indie gameplay.
11029	DO NOT BUY. Horrible game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ game on console that was made 10x worse by a crap pc porting. completly unplayable
11030	Bad PC Port despite the first patch. I have a i7-4790K, 32GB Ram, R9 390 Nitro..but the game still looks awful...even Witcher 3 and GTA V looking miles better... all is somewhat angular especialy the figures.. and one thing that really drives me mad: NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way to hard save..
11031	Edit 09/11/16 Patch - Runs even worse than before post patch   Another shoddy AAA port.  980ti 6600k 16GB RAM Installed on an 850 EVO SSD  Can't even sustain 40fps
11032	Bad game. Full of bugs, bad graphics with almost no settings, repetitive missions... Compared to Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1, this looks like the first game, not the last one.
11033	FIX THIS GAME FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥S SAKE Performance is still very bad and there are countless bugs, some of them even game breaking..  Without the black protagonist &amp; overall setting (which isn't even that creative nor fitting as a part of the Mafia franchise) this game would probably get publicly bashed for being the second worst title of 2016 after No Mans Sky. However the most annoying things missing are a Free Roam mode at the end (you wouldn't even have to add new missions, just let the players travel around freely in the world and collect those useless collectibles..) and a regular main menu, especially where you can look at your collectibles. And by the way: Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are there hundreds of those electric devices scattered throughout the City if you don't even need half of them? It's basically a complete waste of time to collect all of them. I know that the publisher probably forced this specific release date and the game wasn't truly finished yet, but how long have you worked on it, Mafia 2 came out in 2010, that's six long years.. and all the bad choices of things that are/aren't included in this game can't be explained by this circumstance.  Overall this game truly is a step back from Mafia 2, either they learned nothing from community feedback or simply chose to ignore it. As a fan of the Mafia series it is not recommended to buy this game in it's current state, however it is unlikely that everything gets fixed since many bugs in Mafia 2 also never got fixed and still exist..
11034	I was hoping not to give this game a bad review. But it featuring on the autumn sale gives me little to no choice. This game isn't close to acceptable. I can play it for an hour before getting too annoyed with all the flaws.  We're not talking about some small imperfections, it's glaring and annoying flaws in the game.  Don't buy this game. Just don't.
11035	So sad ,after the amazing mafia 2 this game is probably kill the mafia franchise ):
11036	Game will not load. I press start in the launcher, I get black screen for 3 seconds then it crashes to desktop. Please fix, I want to play. I have no playtime, I cant believe steam records game time for crashing simulator.
11037	This game is just plain bad. I had so much expectations since I loved its prequels, However this games didnt deliver any of that.  1. The game is overly repetitive. Main missions and side missions are pretty much all the same. All you gotta do is drive to different locations and do the same **** over and over again for endless hours. Level designer should be fired for doing this,  2. Game has a nice storytelling, but the story itself sucks monkey â¥â¥â¥.  3. A.I. of this game is probably one of the worst in recent games. All you need is a pistol w/ silencer and they will have no clue where u are. If you are expecting a gun fight like the ones you see in gang movies, you are badly mistaken. This game is more like assassin's creed style, but 100 times worse.  4. Stupid Bugs- there are tons of minor bugs that ruins game experience. and most of these bugs could be found by simple playthroughs. QA failed big time on this one.
11038	Capped at 60fps - played at 40-50fps. Capped at 30fps - played at 20fps  It looks like a water painting, but I think I insulted water painting. Its was made in MS Paint.
11039	It's not a bad game. The gameplay isn't bad; the story isn't bad. If you took the first 2 or 3 hours, stripped the next bloated 15-20 hours down to just the necessary four or five, and kept the last hour or two as-is, you'd have a downright fantastic game. But as it stands, Mafia III is as repetitive as daily suburban life and it's far, far too stretched out to justify recommending. At its core, it's a ten-hour game that drags on twice as long as it has any right to. It is not engaging enough to warrant the nine separate districts that you have to go through one-by-one doing the exact same boring things until you finally get to the part where you kill the district's captain in an actually interesting mission. Oh, and it does that thing where you're not allowed to turn off tutorial prompts, so it keeps interrupting gameplay to remind you of features that you've been using the whole game, even when you're in free-roam after the ending.
11040	setting all HIGH look very BAD
11041	Sad to see that a game and a Franchise that was so hyped up just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ itself on release day can't believe writing a bad review for this game is what im doing, but the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ right now. Dumb how console players get the full experience and we get dog â¥â¥â¥â¥. Shame.
11042	It'd be great if I could even get the game running but as I've seen on several forums, it's apparently a broken game. I try to launch the game and I get the launcher then try to hit play and Boom. It doesn't launch. HUGE disappointment. I love the Mafia series but the fact that I can't even get it running when it's been out for a whole fricken month is just unacceptable. I've tried every approach that others have recommended, making sure my drivers are properly updated, re-installing the game, restarting my computer, everything that I can think of and everything that's been suggested. This was supposed to be an anniversary gift to me and now it's been crapped on by my inability to even get it started.
11043	after running 30 mins of the game. the game's not working. please fix this issue!
11044	The incompetence of Hanger 13 is truly unprecedented for a AAA title. I played 30+ hours with a few crashes here and there but nothing serious. That all changed with the most recent update - the one from October 14th; it completely tanked my game. Not only can I no longer achieve a stable 60fps, I'm getting blue screen crashes now. Do you know how terrible a game has to be to cause BSOD's? The absolute lack of technical talent involved in this game blows my mind. This franchise deserved so much better. I now have a season pass I'll never be able to use because I can't play the game longer than twenty minutes before my computer crashes into blue screen. The error has to do with an outdated graphics driver - I've reinstalled the most recent Nvidia driver three times. It's definitely on the games side because, again, I played the game for nearly forty hours with only two or three crash to desktops before the most recent patch, all on the same GPU driver. They did something on their side to make the game think the driver is outdated and hard crash to blue screen. It's truly incredible how pathetic Hanger 13 is. They have no idea what they're doing over there.   Even without the hard crashes, the fact that 2K allowed this game to release in the condition it's in is audacious. It's so poorly optimized that my GTX 1070 rarely exceeds 30% usage. Before the October 14th patch, I was able to get a solid 60fps 3/4 of the time with a combination of low/medium settings but, again, the most recent patch screwed the game up so much that, even with all settings on low, I'm getting dips below 30fps now and rarely even touch 60 frames. That never happened before. I don't know who they have working at Hanger 13 but they need to be banned from the industry. It's sad because, creatively, it's not a bad game. While it's certainly redundant, no other game offers this time period and attention to detail. So I have no other game to play to enjoy the 1960's, one of my favorite time periods. I also appreciate the realism and attention to detail. GTA is great and all but some of the cars are so cartoonish and the map is boring. The Mafia franchise has always been grounded in realism appose to other open world games and Mafia 3 lightly carries on that tradition. The Mafia franchise is one of my favorites so for this disgusting studio to have ruined it really chaps my â¥â¥â¥. I wish the guys who made Mafia 2, 2K Czech, had made this game too; they would have done it justice.   There honestly needs to be some type of commission to investigate situations like this. Studio's should be fined when they advertise a working game, only to have it be a piece of dog sh*it upon release. I'm a pretty patience and understanding person - the 30fps lock didn't even bother me too long because Hanger 13 released the patch that unlocked the framerate literally the following day of the games release. So, while it wasn't a big deal, it was an indication of how terrible the game performs. And for them to release a patch that not only makes performance worse but actually tanks your game... I can't even. I'm done. There's just no excuse for this level of incompetence.
11045	horrible graphics looks like it was made 5 years ago , no sli support, crashing, boring ,repetitive (main mission feels like side missions), and the ai is â¥â¥â¥â¥  The only thing that is good about this game is the story videos and the soundtrack Dont buy it just watch walkthrough on youtube and listen to the soundtrack on youtube
11046	A poor game with rinse and repeat gameplay and a generic you were betrayed and left for dead story. I tried to force myself through it because it was decent at first but it is so mind numbingly boring.
11047	after running 30 mins of the game. the game's not working. please fix this issue!

11050	It'd be great if I could even get the game running but as I've seen on several forums, it's apparently a broken game. I try to launch the game and I get the launcher then try to hit play and Boom. It doesn't launch. HUGE disappointment. I love the Mafia series but the fact that I can't even get it running when it's been out for a whole fricken month is just unacceptable.

This was supposed to be an anniversary gift to me and now it's been crapped on by my inability to even get it started.
11051	Bad news is good news when making money, locked 30fps is a marketing tactic to get the word out. For example look how Apple, Nvidia, Sony launch a product they intentionally limit the first batch of a product to half or less so it's immediately sold out, This builds scarcity and value in Sheeples little minds about this product, in other words builds Hype.  However, with software publishers for gaming the marketing tactic trend is to have a broken game at launch.....
11052	What the hell this game isn't even starting up. The little mini menu for the game pops up and I pretty start and it looks like it's about to start and than it goes black screen and than just exits back to the desktop. And for a few seconds in the steam library it says the game is running but than it stops and nothing happens. It isn't working for me. Is anyone else having this problem? if so please tell me. and if you can please tell me how to fix it if it can be fixed.
11053	Shortly, DO NOT BUY for PC. Not up to 2016 standards. Everything maxed out and it just doesn't look good, lots of bugs and the 'open' world is very limited. Combat is very easy and boring even on hard and sneaking is so easy that a knife is the only weapon needed is most 'fights'. Only good thing is the story, but even that is let down by the way too easy combat...
11054	This fell way below expectations   -WORSE PHYSICS THAN OVER 10 YEARS AGO -30 FPS.......  -MAJOR WEATHER GLITCHES....  -ALL AI, movement, driving+shooting physics are EXTREMELY DATED  -POP UP.  REFUND.
11055	Update: So still keeping this negative untill bugs have been fixed that said i by now have a bit better idea of the game  the good thinks: ohh those are a bit hard .. story is pretty well done the same goes for character animations, Cops are pretty hard to evade, Its definitly not a bad game it has its upsite.  the bad thinks: this one is a bit larger, Bugs are one reason, there are several i have encounterd and only once they helped me, else they f**** me over. I had several crashes on the start of a cutscene ( important story thinks i would guess) when i restarted the game i could not see them because the game automaticly jumped over this letting me wonder what just happent and how the hell did i get here. Then well there is the thinks. i expected more from the 3rd game but got way less.. its not to bad since its about the main story of the game and that is good, but its about those small thinks .. i know i could use my turn lights in the old mafia games and needed to fuel my car, you cant do this anymore they basicly removed small but cool thinks and did not realy add any new thinks. There are stores in game but beside robbing there cash register ( the owner does not mind you doing that) you cant do anything in it .. the game does not really feels like a mafia game to me.. maybe its because you are fighting the mafia but still. The worst thinkg though so far.. this game seems to be done with console in mind first not taking anygood care of the pc verions resulting in bad menu controlss ( they are pretty bad really) Car driving is .. well â¥â¥â¥â¥ ( you cant drive with ease anymore like the old games and obay the traffic laws)     Well again the story is pretty well done but controlls are just terrible its clear this is a console port. graphics options are also pretty .. naaa bad. so is it a worth to buy? maybe .. this game is way more worth 60$ than no mans sky is but it has so many downsites right now.If they fix most of the stuff yes. if not then no. Graphics are also not impressing, its clear that this game suffers by being a cheap console port, i suspect thats also the reason why there are so many bugs and cashes right now. again the story is still well done and you have good freedom to do your missions like you like. and i like going stealth and this is pretty good possible =)    So yes you can buy it but be carefully and think this over 2-3 times about what kind of a person you are
11056	excepted much more of this game. the game wasnt ready for release got soo many problems... Graphical Glitches. Game Crashes wayy too often. action buttons on screen shows duplicated. 30 fps ? Are you kidding me ? YOU THINK IM A CONSOLE PEASENT. ALREADY Ashamed i preordered.

11058	Edit 09/11/16 Patch - Runs even worse than before post patch   Another shoddy AAA port.  980ti 6600k 16GB RAM Installed on an 850 EVO SSD  Can't even sustain 40fps
11059	FPS limit?!? horrible graphics, bugs, storyline with thousands of cut scenes which try to cover the go and kill only game.  The first and second Mafias were splendid, but this. not. sorry.  i7 1080
11060	This game is made to run in 30FPS for the console inferiors. If you unlock the 30FPS cap there is no way you are gonna reach the 60FPS in most places because they didnt care to optimize the game.  If you dont mind playing games that run like slideshows than its fine i suppose.
11061	Author's Note: Don't judge this review by the time I've spent on the PC version of this game. I bought it on the PC when it first came out, knowing that it probably wouldn't run on my PC, I was right. So, I decided to get it for the Xbox One. I won't really be able to cover any PC glitches or anything of that nature, but I can give you my opinion on the game. So, here we go.   After playing Mafia II, I had high hopes for this game. I heard that the story was great and that the soundtrack was amazing. Sadly though, it didn't meet my hopes.   The game is set in 1968, in the fictional city in Louisiana called 'New Bordeaux' (Which is basically New Orleans). You play as Lincoln Clay, a man who just got back from the war in Vietnam. All's well in his life until tragedy strikes and Lincoln is out for revenge. Now, I do admit that the story is pretty darn good! It's probably the best thing going for it. If you've played the previous game, you'll also recognize some people. The new characters are also interesting.   After the story, though, things start to get a little average. If you couldn't tell already, this game is a third person shooter, just like the rest of the series. There are a multitude of guns in your arsenal, available to purchase in-game. There's pistols, snipers, shotguns, automatic guns, and more. The shooting in this game isn't anything new, if you've played any third person shooter, you've probably played this one too.   Being that this is an open world game, there is also driving. Now, the cars in this game look pretty sweet, but the driving isn't anything new either. Once again, if you've played an open world game with cars, you've probably played this one too. The one plus with the driving is the radio. The soundtrack has some great hits from the era and do make driving worth it!   Here's where it drops more...the missions. If you've ever read a review on this game, you probably already know this. The missions are all basically the same. You either kill someone or you destroy something...yep. When I first started, I was excited about the missions. I do admit that they're pretty fun, but they get old FAST. It came to the point where I was so lazy that I just got the sniper, drove to a vantage point, parked the car, got out, sniped the target, and drove off. You can stealth-kill targets, which can be fun, but it just gets mundane. Mission after mission of the same thing. Back in Mafia 2, missions felt more unique. Sure, you had your shoot-outs, but there were some great missions! Now, there are some unique missions, but most of your time will be spent doing the same interrogation animation 12 times, killing one fool several times, or smashing up something.   One of the goals of the game is to take over the map, and that is done by completing missions. When this is done, you can assign pieces to your three lieutenants and it's done by holding a meeting. Giving pieces of land and completing missions for any of your lieutenants can give you access to new stuff, such as weapons. Doing the missions though means more of the same stuff. Overall, I thought this system was fairly cool, but it still makes you do the same old missions.   Another thing to note is the graphics. The in-game graphics are pretty good, but sometimes seem a little lack luster. The cut scene graphics though are extremely well done and the whole thing feels like a documentary you'd find on the History Channel. Also, when you're not killing targets or busting up places, there's also collectables to be had, different cars, and clothes to buy. Other than the missions, though, there's not much to do.   In the end, Mafia 3 turned out to be a decent game, due to its story, music, and amazing cut scene graphics. Mafia 3 doesn't do a good job in terms of being the next installment to Mafia 2. If you're looking to buy this, I'd say wait for it to go down to $20, at the very most. $15 dollars would be more ideal though and if you're truly looking for that mafia experience, stick with the first two games.   
11062	Been broken since release, last update made the fps more stable. Recent patch broke it again. Running a i7 6700k and a gtx1070 and still drops down to 47fps!! Run games like gta5, witcher 3 at 100++ fps. And then there is this repetitive story. Meet a new client, do some damage to some people, â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the boss, kill the boss, repeat 6-8 times and the game is done. Story in mafia 2 was great, one of my favourite games. Mafia 3 is horrible. 2k should just leave it, appologise to the fans and start over totally from scratch. Total waste of money.
11063	I finished the game.  Each racket you take down is the same thing. You go around robbing and stealing from the boss' workers and factories, causing damage. Then they get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off, show up to the place you just robbed and you kill them.  The repetitiveness is a pretty huge downside to the game, and for that I'd say keep your money.  I do strongly believe that they did an awesome job on the story telling and cut scenes.. but I'm paying for a game, not a movie.
11064	F*ck me man, this game was a horrible expirience. I dont know about any other game that's this repetitive and so boring to play. I had to force myself to finish this game, and after 24 painfull hours i finally did it.  . . . definetly wasn't worth it
11065	The Bots are dimwitted in This Game . They Look aT You And after I think 100 Year BanG .... They shoot At You ! The Main characters are Soooooooooooo Ugly. ( Except Vito ) â¦You Can't Change Your Clothes . â¦You Can't Fast Travel. â¦You Can't Have Some Fun Becuase There is No Fun in This Game. Just Kill , Drive , Drive , Kill ........ â¦You Can't Eat anythinG , You Can't Drink anythinG ( it's Not Like a Real Life ) â¦Some Pic of Playboy magazine Are From Mafia || .  â¦etc........  But I admit The Music Is Cool and awsome .  
11066	Afther I changed the kaymapping a bit, almost every button stopped working, and I can only sprint around. Some bugs are expected, but a tripple-A game should be playable at launch. Please give me some advise if anyone of you have solved the same problem.
11067	CURRENTLY UNPLAYABLE FOR ME. Player is stuck in starting position stood like a lemon. (See Screen Shot) , Currently trying to fix but at this moment in time its a waste of money.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776391740 
11068	I need to get something off my chest, I cannot believe how some of you fanboys are defending this game. I understand you are trying to justify and defend your purchase but god damn, the amount of hate being thrown at others for simply stating facts that this game is abosolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ in terms of optimizations.  To the people that don't have any issue, just because your game works DOES NOT MEAN IT DOESNT WORK FOR OTHERS.  This game was rushed, it was a â¥â¥â¥â¥ console port and once again PC players get the long â¥â¥â¥â¥ stuck up our â¥â¥â¥.   Now that they released an uncapped framerate in the latest patch the game still can't run at 60 FPS.   I have a 980 and the game can't even run it at 60 FPS at 1080p or 1440p  The graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, low res and blurry.  The game crashes often, I played it for an hour before it crashed on me like 5 times.  The AI is dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥  Glitches out the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥   Just giving some points here the game runs â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible and I still cant believe people take this â¥â¥â¥â¥, REFUND THE GAME and get your money back, its not worth waiting this poorly optimized game to get patched.   I can't believe people are like looking for mods and other ways to get the game run better, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT, the game should be released in great state for us so we can play and mod it later if we want to enhance the experience.  THIS IS A WARNING TO PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE GAME, DO NOT BUY IT IN ITS CURRENT STATE. THE STORY LOOKS GREAT BUT THE GAME RUNS LIKE HORSE â¥â¥â¥â¥.  SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR WALLET, PC PLAYERS DO NOT DESERVE THIS CRAP ANYMORE.
11069	This game sucks. Check the videos comparing it to the mafia 1&amp;2....
11070	So boring after the first few hours.  This isn't mafia.
11071	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disgrace to the Mafia series...
11072	game play is repetive
11073	it feels like im playing a bad console port, there is just no love in this game. its â¥â¥â¥â¥ :'(
11074	So far, first patch weekend after release, I'm expericing more issues than pre-patch. Suddenly getting a lot of hitching on my reasonably high end PC.  Frame rates don't bother me, but I'd rather it ran smoothly at 30 than all over the place at unlimited and hitching at 60.  I am experiencing crashes too, and for a game without quick save that is a pain.  That being said the game is fun. If you liked Mafia II you will like this. The world is bigger, the voice acting is good, and it is a lot of fun to play when it works.  But if performance is valued over all else, wait to buy this. Fingers crossed a few more patches will straighten it out. So for now, I'm leaving a negative review.
11075	Mafia 3 was the game that I was the most exited to play during 2016. From the first trailer I was immediately hooked and having played Mafia 2, I knew this had to be good. Sadly, I am very disappointed at how this game has been released unfinished and broken. Here's a list of problems that are occuring in my game and I assume other's games aswell.  -horrible AI (both enemies and civilians) -very strange looking weather effects -insane amount of pop-in for almost all textures -broken lighting effects which also ties into the weather effects -lagging like crazy even on low settings and after the fps cap patch -crashing if I move the camera around too fast   Now here's another problem that I have been experiencing that I haven't seen many other people have but if the devs so read this review please fix this weird glitch. Now when I began playing the game, everything seemed normal. Nothing odd or unusual (aside from the list above). I was just exploring the river in a boat when I saw a boat at a dock suddenly shoot up into the air. This caused my game to crash and force my computer to have to reset itself. After this I began experiencing the same phenomenon but with cars. Some would crash the game, others would just cause me to go under around 5 fps. After doing some missions while trying to cope with these flying vehicles every so often, I noticed that at most road intersections, there would be a massive line of cars waiting for a destroyed car sitting in the middle of the intersection. Cars would sometimes just slam into these destroyed cars and eventually, blow up. The traffic AI became absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ after I started noticing cars driving in circles going 50 mph defying the laws of physics and glitching through walls and other objects that they weren't supposed to be clipping through and then eventually, blowing up. I am not going to play this game until the devs do something to fix the mess of a game they have on their hands at the moment. As for now, I cannot recomend this game to anyone (at least on PC) until it is fixed.
11076	Ok let me start that the story is great but anything else is stupid.I started the franchise from Mafia one to Mafia 2 and now this.Let me tell you they removed everything we loved from the game and gave us this hunky dory steaming â¥â¥â¥â¥. First lets go for pros and cones  Pros~ -Great story ~Great soundtrack ~Good animation ~good facial expressions  Cons~ ~30fps on launch just why ?You stupid ? patcehes it in but why would you cap it from the first place ? ~Graphics is dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ this is 2016 the excuse that graphics mean nothing is plain idiotic and you're giving them excuses for their lack of trying ~Removed car and clothing customization but putting as a patch but why is it a patch and not implementing it in the game ?6 years this game has been under development and this is what they did ? ~you can't drink or eat anything don't know if thats gonna be in a patch ~â¥â¥â¥â¥ skyboxes,lighting,rendering and textures and I'm on high with a good pc â¥â¥â¥â¥ off you dumb peasants ~driving is mediocre no just NO.WHAT IS WRONG WITH 13 HANGER ?Maybe they shouldn't touch anything that they can't handle remember the first demo they showed us movie like car on car explosions ?They wanted that but removed it but left us with â¥â¥â¥â¥ car handling its just stupid even simulation is stupid ~No need of fuel WHY ?We loved that about the damn game why would you remove that ? ~physics and destruction there is none I was going 80 km/h and rammed a truck head on my car was fine and I lost some health ~AI is beyond stupid trust me they make ubisoft AI look smart  ~No bloody foot prints yep you heard it right I walk on blood nope nothing Mafia 1 has better than this ~No immersion is absolutely DEAD only thing that works is the word nigge r and people looking at you Everything else you can find it here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA    IT'S STILL â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DON'T GET IT AND DOWN WITH HANGER 13
11077	Do not, I repeat do not buy this game. If you like it pirate it, spend some time and enjoy it. Maybe sometime later when it will cost 10 euro it will be worth it. I sadly bought this game not from steam so I am stuck with it. The graphics are horrible, saints row 4 tier. (except for facial animations, those are wonderful) story is good, music is great, gunplay and some gameplay innovations like smart and agressive cops and their tactics are nice but otherall it's a horrible downgrade from mafia 2. Mafia 2 back in its day looked amazing and had an amazing engine which was pushing the boundaries. It wasn't gta IV but it was a totally different beast. More gruesome, more realistic, more... ''mature''. Mafia 3 is just gta V but a lot worse in every possible aspect.
11078	Play Mafia II instead. Or GTA 5. They are far more better games instead of this. Storytelling on Mafia III is excellent. Kinda like the story itself. But, experience from graphics and amount of fun by playing of this game is very limited. So your PC will perform super on MAFIA 2 on max settings. On Mafia 3 will do only the middle settings with far worse visual experience in my opinion. Both games finished on my Y50-70 laptop with i7,16Gb RAM and gtx860m
11079	Disappointing.  Not good, very repetetive, not half the game Mafia 2 was.  I'm actually surprised they managed to â¥â¥â¥â¥ it up this badly.  Most of the time missions are the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again with different paint jobs.  Don't buy it.  
11080	Don't waste your money on this crap.
11081	Dont buy this game ! Poorly optimization.
11082	After 26 hours of play(not continuously obviously) the game blue screened my comp (havent seen one of those for about 10 years!!) When I logged back in I got a corrupt save message. I Oked that assuming it meant the last save. When I restarted the game it had erased everything and I could only start at the beginning again!! Seriously â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. My rig is running fine in every other aspect with other games and tasks etc so this is solely down to Mafia 3!! A total waste of time and effort Dont bother!!
11083	Ok let me start that the story is great but anything else is stupid.I started the franchise from Mafia one to Mafia 2 and now this.Let me tell you they removed everything we loved from the game and gave us this hunky dory steaming â¥â¥â¥â¥.

11084	aaand yet another open world with nothing to do, absolutely no replay value, questionable game mechanics, and just general lack of simulated criminality, just your average shoot em click through.  Only would suggest buying this on sale. like 50% or more, the story line was entertaining.
11085	 Negative:  - Repetitive and boring gameplay. - Low resolution textures. - Fewer gameplay features than Mafia 2. - Performances problems. - Dumb enemy AI. - Annoying cops. - 30 FPS lock on release (patched some days later).   Positive:  + Great soundtrack. + Interesting scenario. + Good weapon feeling.  My biggest gaming disappointment of 2016.
11086	I could wipe my â¥â¥â¥ with this game :(
11087	Good story, Terrible graphics and physics...
11088	The game is like a huge loop. All jobs have the same way of doing, over and over again. Buy it when 75% Discount only!!!!
11089	Review After 12 Hours  A game with loads of potential, squandered by lack of Mission creativity, and lack of overall variety in Mission types.  Pros - Soundtrack is absolutely amazing (Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, CCR) - Story is great! 1960s crime syndicate/city takeover. So great - Driving is fun, especially on simulation mode - Graphics are okay. Not great, not bad, but just 'Okay'  Cons - Missions are repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Break up the racketeering joint. Kill guys. interrogate Boss. Hand over District. Repeat.  (I have put 12 hours into the game, and nothing else has happened besides this. No exaggeration. That's it) - A.I is absolutely terrible. Basic last gen stuff. - Pop in is drastically bad.  - 30FPS until patch (Strange they didn't just launch with 60FPS)  I would not recommend the game at full price. If you could get it at a sale price (60% off or more) I would say try it. Still repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ though.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKioT-DpnyM 
11090	'sneak' up from behind. Slit throut. Repeat.  If you love Mafia 1 and 2. You will hate the game.
11091	If you have an older AMD/Intel processor, do not buy this game yet!   Does not even start on my machine: AMD Phenom X6 1090T R9 290 4GB 12GB of RAM  so when this and the 30FPS lock is fixed, i will write a new review, but for now, for god sake stay away!  UPDATE 1: The 30fps patch has released, and i have some news for you, i still didn't play a second of the game, so i don't care about performance updates!! i want to run mafia on my machine, cause it's no excuse the game does not support bla bla bla, it is the ONLY game out that has this problem!! And if the devs are so lazy to not fix this then DO NOT spend your well earned money on this piece of crap, buy Battlefeld 1 or something else.  UPDATE 2: 5.8 GB of an update, and no phenom fix...yes they focused on new clothes, rather than fixing what is broken, fixes are minor, but i can't tell what they fixed, i still cant run this exuse for a game!!
11092	'sneak' up from behind. Slit throut. Repeat.  If you love Mafia 1 and 2. You will hate the game.
11093	As a mafia 2 fan I feel like they just slab the name 'Mafia 3' on this one to attract old fan, this should just be a new IP, most of the attention to details that exist in Mafia 2 are all gone! Hell you can't even flush the toilet in the game now, you can do that and other small little detail in Mafia 2, which IMO makes the game feel alive and unique.
11094	 Negative:  - Repetitive and boring gameplay. - Low resolution textures. - Fewer gameplay features than Mafia 2. - Performances problems. - Dumb enemy AI. - Annoying cops. - 30 FPS lock on release (patched some days later).   Positive:  + Great soundtrack. + Interesting scenario. + Good weapon feeling.  My biggest gaming disappointment of 2016.
11095	I could wipe my â¥â¥â¥ with this game :(
11096	Poor port, 30 fps lock, bugs in the first minutes...  Refunded, if they fix this game maybe IÂ´ll give them another change but only in the next Steam sale, companies need to learn in some way...
11097	This game does not feel OK.   Do I think that you just play this game? YES. Why not?  It's not because some of us did not like the game that you wouldn't like it either. Give it a try and if you really don't like it. Just ask papa Gaben for a refund.   I only played one hour and watched the rest on YouTube. So here is MY opinion on the game. Disclaimer: My opinion might differ from your opinion.   Graphics: 5/10. (Not the best but who really cares? I'd rahter have a fun game then a good looking game. Mafia II is much better then this game but this game looks better.) Story: 2/10. (Just another boring revenge story. Nothing really suprised me. I could've guessed the ending without even playing it.)  Problems with this game: - Bad port - Boring world with nothing to do really.  - Boring story  This game is NOT worth the price. Play some other games untill this goes on sale.   I hope my 'opinion' was a little helpfull. But don't decide if you should buy this game based on opinions. If you have the money try it and if you don't really like it. Ask for a refund.   If you don't have the money. Don't buy this game. Lot's of more games out there that you will enjoy and maybe get it for less money.   Have a nice day.
11098	Stay away from this game. Frame rate is horrible, it is unoptimized, gameplay is wonky and inconsistant. The only redeming quality of this game is the story and the sad part is you need to suffer for hours just to get to the minor good parts. There are no traditional missions in the game, it relies too heavily on it's psudo-open-world tasks to have the player progress. These tasks are repeated over and over again in each town district of the game. The side missions are also the same open-world tasks. This was a serious disappointment.
11099	Over hyped piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. I wish the developers ruin for daring to release this â¥â¥â¥â¥.  At least â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fix the police AI and the enemy AI before you give us crap DLC or â¥â¥â¥â¥ race car modding / dress-up kits.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ HANGAR 13 and anyone who hyped this game on YOUTUBE.
11100	the game is just plain boring
11101	I just finished the game, and here are my throughts:  1, The story is interesting, and the cutscenes are just excellent; but they are too short and too far from one another. You better just go on youtube and watch the whole damn thing to save both money and time. 2. There are some interesting levels, but then again, they are too few in numbers and too far from one another. 3. They got the balls to include achievements that require two separeate playthroughs? As if one is not more than rnough. Also, no achievement for collecting all the magazines and posters? WTF? 4. Too many collectable TL-19 fuses. To be exact, 246 too many (yes, my OCD kicked-in a bit). What were they thinking about? 5. Graphics are pure garbage and game performance is just bad (I am rocking a GTX 1070+i7-6700 yet I cannot run 2K smooothly at 60FPS on low textures). Unless you have a controller, the inputs and UI elements are going to be terrible as well. 6. Gameplay is just repeatitive as hell; the AIs are dumb as well (I died only 9 times on hard difficulty). To be honest, I wouldn't even finish the game should it came out a few days later (cough cough Battlefield 1 cough cough).   Conclusion: Watch youtube and save both money and time. And please give those who pre-ordered the deluxe edition a moment of silence.
11102	This game does absolutely not match in anyway the screenshots. Its total trash.
11103	It's predecessor (released 2010) had working mirrors that reflected an image of your character, Mafia III doesn't.   Mafia III doesn't give you (graphically) what they showed us in all of the demos at e3, etc. The textures are horrible, lighting is horrible, world is boring and the game becomes very repititive.   Launcher also stays open in background which put me above 2 hours and stopped me from being able to refund ;)
11104	It pains me to leave a not recommend because the game is kind of fun. When missions glitch out though and makes it impossible to progress, I would say the game is broken. If things are patched up then I may change this review, but until my halted progress is fixed I cannot recommend this game at this time.
11105	Buggy,glitchy,ugly and runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥......this is what happens when you put more time,effort and money into making the cutscenes look great!! *edit* Would like to add that there are two things that keep me playing this game,the old American cars and the driving/drifting round corners feel good {at wildly fluctuating FPS though] I would also say the gunplay is good,BUT the dumbest AI I've ever seen kill the fun of that.  I just can't give this a positive review cause the port to PC and AI is so bad,giving it a positve would be like saying its ok to shaft PC players.
11106	DON'T BUY THIS CRAPY BETA, its 30FPS lock which makes it pretty much unplayable and although performance sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ (30fps are not stable and drop down to 20 for me on medium settings with i5 4670k@4ghz and gtx770 2gb), furthermore Graphics are outdated af (not much of an improvement compared to Mafia2 which was 6 years ago)   
11107	I had to force myself to play through this mind numbing experience. Never do you feel absorbed into the story or atmosphere. The story doesn't really make sense, as it portrays you as a mob leader running drugs and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and robin hood at the same time. The voice acting is really good, but the number of cut scenes and fragmented story are just ughhhhss. They rely heavily on the shock value of the racist elements of the story, but it gets stale quick. The news updates on the car radio were about the only thing entertaining for me, and mildly so. Not a fun game, not a dark game. Just another follow the recipe open world GTA clone with bad controls made for the console market with a PC port.
11108	Not for human
11109	I'm gonna start off with saying that this game had so much potential. Lincoln Clay is an absolute badass, and his voice actor suits his hard-boiled personality perfectly. The problem is that this game is plagued with so many issues that it makes it hard to enjoy the creative story and environment.  Let's start off with pros and then proceed to talk about the cons:  Pros:   -As previously stated, this game has a lot of potential to be game of the year. The main character, story, and setting are all top notch, but the execution is awful.  -Even though game runs with 30FPS cap, the 30 FPS was smooth for me. It's definitely playable and wasn't as distracting as I thought it would be since I'm used to playing games in 144 Hertz.  - Story is interesting, I'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far. The characters are nicely designed and voice acted, and most importantly are believable.  -Gameplay is solid. Not necessarily addicting or perfect, but solid. Most guns feel good to shoot, and Melee works well most of the time.  -Sadly the positive aspects of this game are few and far between, but one last thing I want to mention I enjoy is animations and cutscenes. The cutscenes are well acted and look graphically superb to the game. The animations are very brutal and feel good to execute.  Cons:  -Awful 21:9 support. I'm playign this game on an Acer Predator X34, and the image is definitely sub par to other 21:9 games I've played this year.  -Graphics make the game look like an HD PS2 game. It was obviously not properly supported on PC to allow player with powerful hardware to take advantage of it. It feels like a lazy console port, with absolutely no benefit of playing on PC other than the promise of a future patch for 60 FPS and unlimited frame rates. Character model faces are muddy and unclear, textures are muddy, field of view is awful, anti-aliasing has no advanced options like SSAO, MSAA, or even FXAA, just low, medium, high, textures don't even have a settign to control, meaning you're stuck with what look like console textures on a game by a huge Publisher in 2016. Overall graphic options and presentation are absolutely abysmal.  -No keyboard key remapping, meaning I had to use controller since KB&amp;M controls were wonky.  -Visual glitches such as green waves covering Lincoln's face in scenes with dark shadows.  -Game crashing to desktop issue that occured for me twice in one hour, unacceptable.  Conclusion:   Had the potential to be a stellar release, but dropped the ball big time. Rushed PC port with awful visuals, unnacceptable CTD issues, and no 60FPS support at launch.  4/10 - Absolutely below average, and sadly not one of the better games of this year.
11110	the game is broken is rubbish, only thing that works is the story
11111	At this point i 1hr+ into the game and i enjoy it.. but..... it's kinda washed out and the 30 fps is bad....  I dont think i will continue untill i can play it at stalbe 60fps..  My specs are.  I7 6700k Gtx 970 FTW+ 16gb ddr4 2133 mhz
11112	(Oct, 7th) I would wait for the post release update if I were you.  UPDATE (Oct, 8th) Nevermind the patch. It is here, it gives the game 60 frames per second but it won't save Mafia III from being one of the ugliest 'next' gen AAA titles available. Differences between low and high setting are barely visible. And adding insult to injury, this game is BORING!  B-O-R-I-N-G.  I played the same exact gameplay a milion times before! There's absolutely nothing new here and the mission structure plays a hell lot like Assassin's Creed Syndicate (do some missions in this area; unlock the boss of the area; kill the boss; the area is now yours. RINSE AND REPEAT FOREVER!!!) which is NOT good.  Developers promise to bring races, car customizations, costumes and whatnot available (mostly) for free very soon, but, at least for me, it just doesn't make sense to not make those available at launch.
11113	  Great potential but definitely not a game for 2016.  Besides 30 frames lock, the graphics of this game will shock you...i have impression to play a game in year 2000 I love 2K Company for NBA but Mafia 3 is worth 10 eu
11114	THIS GAME IS GARBAGE DONT BUY IT YOULL DO THE SAME THING OVER N OVER I WAS SO STOKED FOR IT AND ITS â¥â¥â¥â¥! GIVE ME MY 80$ BACK IM GOING HOME SCREW OFF I HATE U DEVOLPERS GO HOME.
11115	Lets begin, no widescreen support, random crashes, graphics worse than in mafia 2, just the sound is ok...
11116	Finished the game. Felt like a chore.  SPOILERS AHEAD:  The game is an open world with several districts wich all feel the same and you have to take them all. After you've taken two Districts you'll realize that you just have to do the same thing over and over again (go there, kill/interrogate that guy). Once you've killed/interrogated enough people in a district you can kill the districts boss.  I enjoyed the driving part of the game (on simulation mode) and the shooting is not bad. Music is also good and the city looks great.  Civilians are kinda dumb and policemen are out for you.  Game is super repetitive. I have to say I enjoyed the last mission and the KKK gathering one.  Would not recommend  
11117	This is my review of Generic Open World Game 6:  Technical Stuff: Can't turn off FXAA. Screen is blurred and messy. Randomly crashes (A LOT after the patch, struggling to play with frequent crashes). Bad performance. Glitchy lighting. Terrible muggy textures.  Bad keyboard and mouse controls.  Animations are good. Voice acting is also good.  Police will never attack anybody else other than you. Because 'they're in the mobs pocket', which is just an excuse to say 'we didn't wanna code that'.  As for the story, it really misses the charm of the first two games, which told a pretty serious story with finality and interesting characters. It felt like a story that was taking place within a real world. Mafia 3 seems to have gone away with that in order to accommodate their open world 'take over the districts' gameplay, making it into another generic open world game with padded content. The side characters seem over the top in a way and it just doesn't feel like a good mafia story. It's a shame, I think, because the Mafia games really are unique. I always enjoyed how you were a grunt in the mafia machine and you weren't this force to be reckoned with, with a cliche revenge story, you were just a guy trying to be somebody, and sometimes that meant doing the grunt work. It feels like it's trying to be as appealing a game as possible, instead of the unique games that Mafia 1 and 2 were.  I don't understand how people are saying the story is 'amazing'. It's not a bad story, but it's nothing special, just a overdone revenge plot. Every single plot point in the game is 'but how should we kill them all?'. One dimensional and uninteresting characters. What do we learn about Lincoln Clay throughout the entire game? Nothing really. He's good at killing and that's about it. There's no reprecussion to any of his actions, police don't come after you, the mafia doesn't respond to you in any meaningful way other than saying 'Wow he's disrupting us' in some cutscenes. Yawn.  Got bored after 6 hours, tried to power through to the end, decided it's not worth it.  See this video for more reasons why Mafia 2 is better:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0  Even if the technical problems are corrected, I still wouldn't recommend this game.
11118	Wow, wish a had read the reviews here before buying. I've had lost of crashes so far and I'm playing with all the latest drivers on a win10 computer. The game is impossible to play with the STEAM CONTROLLER, 2K games should be ashamed! I can not recommend this game in its current condition.
11119	Unfortunately a great disappointment and really a 'what could have been' type situation for this game. Not to mention yet another warning not to pre-order games especially on PC. From my small amount of play time (+ lots of youtube vids) the story looked quite solid and the cutscenes with people looked fantastic.   But for an open world game the exterior areas are just not up to scratch for a PC title in 2016. I hope that the textures, draw distance and other performance issues are improved soon and if so I may repurchase it in the future. They have a long way to go though when considering how it looks (compared to GTA V etc) and I could barely get 30 fps on high unlocked at 1440p with an i7-6700k, 32gb ram and 2x 970 GTX, which can run GTA V at 80-100 fps on max.
11120	locked 30fps !!!
11121	There are good games, there are bad games, and then you have garbage.   This game belongs to the third category. It is poorly optimized and glitchy at release, even after patches the bugs persist. Only people who are good at jokes (or those who are a joke themselves) would release a game that's not completed or fully tested - and have the nerve to charge people money for it.  My graphic card gets 45-55fps on games like GTA V on 4K resolution at maxed settings. This game is not even playable at high settings on 1080p. Unless you have a GTX Titan or above, don't bother trying to get a decent framerate out of this game.
11122	60h in and I can't continue playing because every single time I load and try to start one of the main missions it crashes. This game is filled with bugs, wich is a shame because I was really liking it.  EDIT: Ended up finding a way to fix the bug, but still can't fully recommend the game. The story is great, but there are so many bugs in it, you're better of waiting until the game is more stable.
11123	Great story. Which is about the only good thing I have left to say about this game.
11124	OM God! How can they freak it up so bad? This is Mafia man! Do you got any ideas how much does Mafia mean to us? I was dreaming last night that I played Mafia and enjoy it, After I woke up and actually played it? Yay, it was a dream for real
11125	My resolution is 2560x1080 = Lots of Problems. I can not recommend this game in its current condition.
11126	Extremely glitchy, horrible ai, and lazy physics... Generally a bad game
11127	To the guy who came up with the idea to have the game locked at 30 fps in 2016: Hope you get fired, burned alive and get r4p3d by 72 virgin camel d!(ks. People like you deserve a special place in hell.                   jk.
11128	30 FPS lock? NOPE, master race dont forget! crashed now after 2 hours of play, starting to regret to buy this game.
11129	I'm not even bothered about the 30fps cap (especially when considering a fix is in the works) but currently the game crashes as soon as I press start on the launcher.  Edit: Apparently the last update fixed the fps cap, although I don't personally know if it did because it still didn't make the game playable.
11130	Really bad game,when you get the main story objective its awesoem but as soon as you go out to the world its empty and you have to do mini missons all the time where you have to kill the same enemys over and over again....
11131	A solid 4/10 points, mostly beacuase all of the game-breaking bugs wich include but isnÂ´t limited to: Random crashes Some missions fails to start/load All sounds randomly stops working ( Atleast 3 times in my 9hrs of playtime)
11132	Mafia III showed promise leading from a great game that Mafia II was along with it's features including the original Mafia. It seems they have been quite lazy in developing this game although the graphics are good, not the best and the city can be visually good. All they had to do is combine Mafia and Mafia II into Mafia III along with it's features and customisation. The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it's go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I've read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already. Mafia III could have been another great Mafia game but without those little features and a more solid, enjoyable mission to play it just is another game that nobody will really look back on or replay it in a hurry.
11133	Mafia III have membership in an exclusive club, where few games belong. It is one of the worst console game ports I have ever played, where the menues, the graphics and the playability is so corrupted by this bad port that i struggle to even try to complete it.   I mean, the game doesn't even recognize mouse4 and mouse5-buttons when remapping controls.  As this price, I expect a lot more than y2k/hangar 13 has managed to scrape together. It's an insult to their customers.
11134	The storyline is great, and with a reshade installed the game looks good. But the game crashes alot and the memory allocation and optimization of the game is terrible. This is especially prevelant when you look at whats on display in the game. The game shouldn't be taxing our systems like this. I'm running a GTX 1080 and the game isn't stable. The gameplay is actually fun, but its hard to get into because the game crashes every so often. It's pretty bad, and since there hasn't been an update on PC to fix the glaring problems with the game, I can't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money for a game that is actually put together properly by the developer.
11135	Is it a bad game? No. But is it a Mafia game? Again no, all of the mafia game's mechanics have been scrapt leaving an empty shell that defines this game as just another GTA clone. PLZ fix all of those issues listed in these videos and fix the ammunition mechanics i play on hard and do not have any problem with ammunition and how the helldo i get smg ammunition from assault rifles?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0  (I am not the creator of these videos)  So overall i would recomend buying this game once all of the problems are fixed by hangar 13 or mod support fixes them. Finally pleas stop hating on 2K they only published the game they where not the ones to make it blame hanger 13. sorry for bad English.
11136	 The Good
11137	Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a 'peasants' 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I'm done. It will now sit and collect 'dust' until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.
11138	Alright, i don't write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons. (I see why 2k didn't release ANY real review copies, it would of been a flop before release.)  Pros: Story, although even that is a mess, Voice acting (The only thing i have no complaints with.) Cons: Everything else. No. Really.  Engine - Originally locked to 30FPS which made me avoid this title, but once i seen an update for 60 and unlimited FPS i decided i would bite the bullet due to my love of the Mafia Series. This isn't much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn't support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.  Also, there is a disgusting blur effect, even through removing motion blur in the options is covering EVERYTHING. and by everything i mean EVERYTHING. This game also has an abysmal Draw Distance and EVERYTHING and i do mean EVERYTHING 'Pops in' and 'Pops out.' CONSTANTLY.  Of other note also is that the game absolutely HATES you changing ANY of the default keymapping settings resulting in crashes, assigned keys not working.  Textures: This is a major offense, the facial textures in this game are actually very good, and some interior textures also look pretty good but EVERYTHING ELSE in the game looks like something out of 2008, it's not hard nor expensive nowadays to make proper textures. An especially good example of exactly how bad this is being: the skyboxes that look worse than some of the skyboxes from the Nintendo 64 / Playstation Era. It's the laziest excuse for a 'Sky' i have ever seen. Looks more like a zebra skin texture.  Lighting: This is probably the biggest visual blunder of the bunch,and all of the other blunders are just about deal breakers. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, it glitches CONSTANTLY FLICKERING and the shadows in this game are also horrendous, the time it takes shadows to actually update to the lighting system is delayed, the lighting itself also drowns out a LOT of color from the already very sub-par textures.   And during sunset or dawn the sun produces the most blinding, eye hurting form of light i have ever experienced in a game, and i've been gaming now for over 19 years. It's hard to explain exactly how bad it is through a video or image, it really doesn't become apparent how bad it is until you actually play it.  Physics: A little wonky, but i have to say is probably the only thing as far as gameplay that is satisfying. Although the game seems to add unrealistic, extra weight to whatever vehicle you drive. You can crash into an identicle model of car at the exact same speed an NPC is driving and the NPC's car will noticably be much more affected by physics.  Models: Very, very bad models. The hair of characters looks fake, almost plasticy. It'll make you physically say 'WTF' on multiple occasions as you go through the game. Cars and vehicles are also noticably a huge cut below the models in Mafia 2 from 2012, and the damage system for vehicles really is pitiful, the hood of a car can come off, the front and back can get a little dented but the superb glass models and physics from Mafia 2 are completely void, 'Scratches' in the vehicle damage system also seem to not exist. You can just about blow up your car and it looks barely any different if it was in pristine condition.  I remember in Mafia 2 just shooting a glass display out of a shop window and being impressed with the physics and breaking of glass. There isn't a single bit of astonishment here with Mafia 3. In any. Way. It looks miles behind GTA 5 or even indie titles of today. There's also a large lack of variety in enemy faces, textures and clothing.   Weapons: There's a huge lack of variance in weapons, i will say the shotguns are satisfying to use but, in the further sections of my breakdown, anything good about the weapons in this game are completely irrelevant because you WON'T HAVE TO USE THEM 99% OF THE TIME.  Cover system: Noticably again, a major cut below mafia 2's. While it retains all the features of mafia 2, it is noticably more clunky and unrefined. The only positive thing they did here was include 'Blind Fire' but really, you won't be using it much.  Vehicles: Noticably less variety of vehicles from Mafia 2, and this brings me to another shortcoming. There is little to no vehicle customization ( you can buy vehicle customizations from the arms dealer, however it doesn't have any charm, you don't drive into a car shop even although there are dozens scattered across the map and they don't have any visual impact, and very minimal gameplay impact.)  They have removed all of the realistic traffic laws and violations of Mafia 2 that gave the game a sense of being alive. Just don't hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don't hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting 'Hit and Run' violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don't entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i'de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don't mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren't any extra activities, there's no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and 'Fuses' (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed's 'Discovery' system, you need to 'Wiretap' at given positions which costs 3 'Fuses' that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned 'Fuses' which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it 'Gameplay.' Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don't matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don't matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I'm running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There's no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i'm experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i'm essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP     
11139	I just refunded this game after playing 2 hours. It's very VERY poorly optimized and the graphics are terrible. I also received constant crashes while playing. Not sure what the developers were thinking here...
11140	This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They're just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it's impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.
11141	Can't play because game crashes to windows all the time. I have i5, GTX 970, 8 Gb RAM and W10 64bit.
11142	Music playing during the Launcher is really nice. Other than that, game won't start. Launcher crashes back to desktop. This is just really really sad. Still playing and loving Mafia 2 until this day and preordering Mafia 3 was an offer I could not refuse. But I should have just left the preorder store and only taken the Canoli.
11143	This game is absolutely abysmal on PC.
11144	Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I've been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don't have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1. But this isn't even a smooth 30fps, for me. It is very blurry and jittery. Hard to play really. This game needs some major graphic cleaning, what I mean is smooth gameplay. Hopefully this update planned for this weekend will help. For me again, it is hard to play at this moment. Will hopefully recomend in the future, but now, not recomended. ( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can't wait to recomend this game.
11145	had the game for 19 hours and still have not been able to play very dissapointing
11146	  I played it for a bit. everything seems somewhat fine. the game does constantly crash, but not constantly. Its locked at 30 fps. I wouldnt recommend getting it until the problems are fixed.
11147	Waited for the 60 FPS patch so I didn't burn my 2 hours and boy am I glad I made that decision. This port is awful. GTX 1080 at 1080p on the lowest settings and in the city I can barely stay afloat over 30 FPS. I will be refunding this until they fix these issues.
11148	THAT IS ABSOLUTLEY JOKE. After this update, nothing has changed, beacuse i still have drops from 40 to 20 fps. My config is : CPU - Intel Core i5 4690K 3,5GHz, GPU : Nvidia GeForce GTX750 Ti 2gb GDDR5 (i know, it's a quite old card, but anyway that game should works in minimum 45-50fps) and 8GB ram. I tried to change resolution and etc. but still doesn't work. Graphics in this game just looks like low port from consoles. Textures in low quality in medium settings... Guys .. Are you serious ? Actually, I'm feel very dissapointed.  
11149	Just requested my refund I wanted to like this but the graphical issues are just too bad, the washed out upscaled textures, the wierd sun/cloud flashing, the sunglare in general, the stuttering, the storyline is all over the place, jumping from one point in time to another, its completely disjointed, the cars handle like utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the guns and combat are ok, but nothing special.  Even the 60FPS patch didn't make any difference, this game has serious issues, it doesnt just need polish (which it is sorely lacking) it needs to go back into development to be fixed, and then released later when its actually in a state to be played.
11150	WARNNING the entirety of the game play is ALL THE FLIP FLOPING THE SAME!.  It starts out so strong having good memories of older games then it hits a brick wall gooing at what the flipping flip speeds and just recycles the same sheit over and over. 4 hours in i think i realy hope this ends. NOPE 18 hours and still the same damn thing just in a new location mayeb if you get lucky its a new building layout.  Between the repetitive gameplay you get epic cutscenes with great story telling but that doesnt not make this game worth the asking price not by a flopping long shot   i havnet beaten it and i feel like i wasted money. I thought it was a no brainer to preorder... oops... i loved mafia 1 and 2 and the trailers and yes i know trailer rarely show real gameplay i just thought this was going to be a good choice to buy right away looked liek a good damn time.  Sadly i feel ripped off and cheated. and would like my money back... yeah i know i â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my self.   2/10 whata peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥- Dunkey-nmb

11156	Can't play, it stutters too much.
11157	30 fps for PC what a joke
11158	Nothing to do besides following the linear story. You can't customize anything really.  The whole game feels more like an elaborate filmset than an actual living world.
11159	I wouldn't have pre-purchased this game if I knew it's limited to 30 FPS ! If I wanted 30 fps from a PC game I would have not build a gaming pc in the first place.  The game's price is nowhere near the low graphic detail it offers.   This is my review. Buy it is you want. I don't care.
11160	Massive disappointment.....let's hope for a patch. Even the graphics are far away from 2016. The atmosphere however, may safe the game . Wait for a deal to buy this game.
11161	Pre ordered the game and can't even play it.  Crashes everytime when I try to start it, no fix helped.  It's good to know that they earn millions on this game but can't even get the most fundamental things to work (60 FPS i.e.).  What has happend to this industry? Remember a few years ago when you bought a game, had the full content without any DLCs and it actually worked?  ffs fix your game Hangar 13 / 2K...
11162	I mean, I don't know, It just feels boring, I own serveral consoles so the FPS lock isn't an issue even thoe i'd love to use my 144hz monitor to the fullest in Mafia III.  The game is just boring, well, yes the story is pretty solid but the things that made Mafia II so good between the story missions is missing, no character customazation what so ever, you can't really change the visuals of your car, police is a joke, in Mafia II you had to change freaking clothes to get the cop of your â¥â¥â¥, now you can just drive away. The world feels just so empty, i've heard rumors of a 'Free DLC' which would include customization for both Cars and Characters, but I won't belive it 'till I see it.  I would say, wait, let 2K fix their mess-ups (which I really really hope, because they usually fix stuff) then buy the game if they made the game more Mafia like.  Right now I just feel that the game is not really Mafia, it's just a bad 1960's GTA style game.  Really disappointed actually.  -CHP

11170	had the game for 19 hours and still have not been able to play very dissapointing
11171	Before I get into the review, let me say that I love the game, but what the devs did is unforgivable.  I'm not giving this game a positive review to show the devs I don't support these kinds of ports. It's sloppy and lazy. Let me go by naming a few:  -Capped 30FPS (of course I had to say it) -Really low quality textures  -Objects clip into eachother  -The view distance is tiny  -The environment in general seems blurry  -Floating bottles  -1080p is blatantly an upscaled 720p (which is the main cause of many of these problems)  -Stuttering framerate -When the game launches, it doesn't close the launcher, forcing me to go into task manager and close it because it plays music  This is unnacceptable. This shouldn't become the norm for Triple A PC Releases. This is abhorrent and ridiculous. Hangar 13, I know this is your first major game (I could be wrong), but that doesn't mean you can do this to your PC community. You know damn well that a huge amount of PC Players can run this game so much better than you're forcing the entire community to play it at. Fix it, and fix it quick. Once the patch comes out, I'll edit my review depending on what happens.  EDIT: Now that the game has been patched, the game runs better now, but it's noticably poorly optimized. Even with the low quality textures the game has, it only gets like 57 fps. It's ridiculous. Also, the only other thing they changed was the keymapping. There's still no ability to change graphical settings. You can still only change post processing. Still not recommending.  EDIT 2: After playing for over 10 hours, I think I have a rough idea of what this game is. I thought this was going to be a successor to Mafia 2, but looking back at things, Mafia 2 is eons better. This game is watered down with the same rinse and repeat missions. The main story missions are few and far between, since you have to gain control over an entire territory to unlock it. It's frustrating and makes this game burn out fast. This game should have been worked on longer. They should have added more main missions rather than the side missions you're forced to do.  EDIT 3: Well, I beat the game. Can't say I feel accomplished. Story was alright, but way too overrated. I have no interest in playing afterwards. I feel like I wasted my money and I'm never getting it back. Devs released another patch that fixes blurry upscaled resolution, but it did nothing. I'm done with this game, and I'm not buying another game from Hangar 13; they can kiss my â¥â¥â¥.
11172	Crashes every 10 minutes. Struggles to maintain 50FPS on low settings with a GTX 1080.   Don't waste your money.
11173	Until the bugs are fixed don't buy it.
11174	Boring and the same missions are recylced alot
11175	Since this has been repeated over 5,780 times. This game is AWFUL. Running it on a GTx 1080 at 2 resolution and I'm not getting over 40fps. Wtf is this? This is 2016, not 1999. I can't even get a refund since I bought this on an external site. Didn't even bother playing more than 1 hour. Worst game I have ever spent my hard earned cash on. DO NOT BUY
11176	The game itself could be great if it wasn't for some inexcusable flaws. For example my save games were destroyed three times now(and that is without me closing the game while it was saving). I am done with this game. Not worth it.
11177	the most boring reptitive triple A game...a downgrade from mafia 2
11178	 The Good
11179	Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a 'peasants' 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I'm done. It will now sit and collect 'dust' until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.
11180	Alright, i don't write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons. (I see why 2k didn't release ANY real review copies, it would of been a flop before release.)  Pros: Story, although even that is a mess, Voice acting (The only thing i have no complaints with.) Cons: Everything else. No. Really.  Engine - Originally locked to 30FPS which made me avoid this title, but once i seen an update for 60 and unlimited FPS i decided i would bite the bullet due to my love of the Mafia Series. This isn't much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn't support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.  Also, there is a disgusting blur effect, even through removing motion blur in the options is covering EVERYTHING. and by everything i mean EVERYTHING. This game also has an abysmal Draw Distance and EVERYTHING and i do mean EVERYTHING 'Pops in' and 'Pops out.' CONSTANTLY.  Of other note also is that the game absolutely HATES you changing ANY of the default keymapping settings resulting in crashes, assigned keys not working.  Textures: This is a major offense, the facial textures in this game are actually very good, and some interior textures also look pretty good but EVERYTHING ELSE in the game looks like something out of 2008, it's not hard nor expensive nowadays to make proper textures. An especially good example of exactly how bad this is being: the skyboxes that look worse than some of the skyboxes from the Nintendo 64 / Playstation Era. It's the laziest excuse for a 'Sky' i have ever seen. Looks more like a zebra skin texture.  Lighting: This is probably the biggest visual blunder of the bunch,and all of the other blunders are just about deal breakers. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, it glitches CONSTANTLY FLICKERING and the shadows in this game are also horrendous, the time it takes shadows to actually update to the lighting system is delayed, the lighting itself also drowns out a LOT of color from the already very sub-par textures.   And during sunset or dawn the sun produces the most blinding, eye hurting form of light i have ever experienced in a game, and i've been gaming now for over 19 years. It's hard to explain exactly how bad it is through a video or image, it really doesn't become apparent how bad it is until you actually play it.  Physics: A little wonky, but i have to say is probably the only thing as far as gameplay that is satisfying. Although the game seems to add unrealistic, extra weight to whatever vehicle you drive. You can crash into an identicle model of car at the exact same speed an NPC is driving and the NPC's car will noticably be much more affected by physics.  Models: Very, very bad models. The hair of characters looks fake, almost plasticy. It'll make you physically say 'WTF' on multiple occasions as you go through the game. Cars and vehicles are also noticably a huge cut below the models in Mafia 2 from 2012, and the damage system for vehicles really is pitiful, the hood of a car can come off, the front and back can get a little dented but the superb glass models and physics from Mafia 2 are completely void, 'Scratches' in the vehicle damage system also seem to not exist. You can just about blow up your car and it looks barely any different if it was in pristine condition.  I remember in Mafia 2 just shooting a glass display out of a shop window and being impressed with the physics and breaking of glass. There isn't a single bit of astonishment here with Mafia 3. In any. Way. It looks miles behind GTA 5 or even indie titles of today. There's also a large lack of variety in enemy faces, textures and clothing.   Weapons: There's a huge lack of variance in weapons, i will say the shotguns are satisfying to use but, in the further sections of my breakdown, anything good about the weapons in this game are completely irrelevant because you WON'T HAVE TO USE THEM 99% OF THE TIME.  Cover system: Noticably again, a major cut below mafia 2's. While it retains all the features of mafia 2, it is noticably more clunky and unrefined. The only positive thing they did here was include 'Blind Fire' but really, you won't be using it much.  Vehicles: Noticably less variety of vehicles from Mafia 2, and this brings me to another shortcoming. There is little to no vehicle customization ( you can buy vehicle customizations from the arms dealer, however it doesn't have any charm, you don't drive into a car shop even although there are dozens scattered across the map and they don't have any visual impact, and very minimal gameplay impact.)  They have removed all of the realistic traffic laws and violations of Mafia 2 that gave the game a sense of being alive. Just don't hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don't hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting 'Hit and Run' violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don't entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i'de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don't mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren't any extra activities, there's no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and 'Fuses' (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed's 'Discovery' system, you need to 'Wiretap' at given positions which costs 3 'Fuses' that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned 'Fuses' which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it 'Gameplay.' Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don't matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don't matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I'm running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There's no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i'm experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i'm essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP     
11181	I just refunded this game after playing 2 hours. It's very VERY poorly optimized and the graphics are terrible. I also received constant crashes while playing. Not sure what the developers were thinking here...
11182	This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They're just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it's impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.
11183	Can't play because game crashes to windows all the time. I have i5, GTX 970, 8 Gb RAM and W10 64bit.
11184	Music playing during the Launcher is really nice. Other than that, game won't start. Launcher crashes back to desktop. This is just really really sad. Still playing and loving Mafia 2 until this day and preordering Mafia 3 was an offer I could not refuse. But I should have just left the preorder store and only taken the Canoli.
11185	This game is absolutely abysmal on PC.
11186	Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I've been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don't have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1. But this isn't even a smooth 30fps, for me. It is very blurry and jittery. Hard to play really. This game needs some major graphic cleaning, what I mean is smooth gameplay. Hopefully this update planned for this weekend will help. For me again, it is hard to play at this moment. Will hopefully recomend in the future, but now, not recomended. ( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can't wait to recomend this game.
11187	had the game for 19 hours and still have not been able to play very dissapointing
11188	Before I get into the review, let me say that I love the game, but what the devs did is unforgivable.

11189	A solid 4/10 points, mostly beacuase all of the game-breaking bugs wich include but isnÂ´t limited to: Random crashes Some missions fails to start/load All sounds randomly stops working ( Atleast 3 times in my 9hrs of playtime)
11190	Mafia III showed promise leading from a great game that Mafia II was along with it's features including the original Mafia. It seems they have been quite lazy in developing this game although the graphics are good, not the best and the city can be visually good. All they had to do is combine Mafia and Mafia II into Mafia III along with it's features and customisation. The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it's go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I've read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already. Mafia III could have been another great Mafia game but without those little features and a more solid, enjoyable mission to play it just is another game that nobody will really look back on or replay it in a hurry.
11191	Mafia III have membership in an exclusive club, where few games belong. It is one of the worst console game ports I have ever played, where the menues, the graphics and the playability is so corrupted by this bad port that i struggle to even try to complete it.   I mean, the game doesn't even recognize mouse4 and mouse5-buttons when remapping controls.  As this price, I expect a lot more than y2k/hangar 13 has managed to scrape together. It's an insult to their customers.
11192	Really bad game,when you get the main story objective its awesoem but as soon as you go out to the world its empty and you have to do mini missons all the time where you have to kill the same enemys over and over again....
11193	The game is just boring. There is nothing to do there.  Developers just tried to copy GTA but didn't manage that.  The city is boring. AI is dumb. The missions are the same! The game has quite a good start (2 hours) but then.....
11194	side missions are just the same smash that up, kill that guy, get information, kill the boss guy which was in the location off a guy you had to kill earlier with the guys in the same locations. also if you see a mass of enemys and are like huh ill clear that dont bother the second you leave its gonna just fill back up with people because there was a target in there that you didnt kill because you didnt have the side object highleted so â¥â¥â¥â¥ you story is alright but it just feels so repetive it just smash kill info kill over and over and why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am i the one going out on runs when iam basicly the don off the group ??? should it be more oh hey getting a weed delivery send your guys out to go get it and give me my cut ? not hey boss getting a delivery and i cba sending my guys so you go do it and ill give you your cut ?? the combats fun but the second you get a silenced pistol its just to easy even on hard difficulty. location wise its nice and graphicly its pretty good its a shame it just all dulled down by this same 4 things over and over. for a game going for realism though why the hell does it take more shots to kill a slightly fatter guy even in the face it takes 2 or more and even more to kill the boss of a racket i put an entier clip of thompson ammo into a guy while he was trying to get the car started and he didnt even care he just drove off ?? and theres still plenty of texture bugs hell my car has even been floating a few times . basicly if you want a good story and its on sale for maybeeeeee Â£15-20 its kinda like a ubisoft game they would rather make a 20 hour game with 4 hours off amazing fun stuff than a 8 hour game thats just all amazing fun stuff.Also the police are a joke you can go 120mph down the wrong side off the road hit a car and they will be like meh whatever and move on they only do something if you hurt another cop or shoot anyone infront off them and can someone tell me when bushes started being made out of pure steel ?that are impenitrable
11195	So far I like the game but the 30 fps are too noticeable. Moving the view with mouse is not smooth because of low fps. Waiting for patch to see if it gets any better. If not I'm gonna ditch this game. My rig is more than enough to play this game at well over 60fps. That's what I paid for.
11196	-Repetitive gameplay. Basiclly, at every district, there is one capo/lieutenant and two underbosses. Kill them and proceed to next area. -Mediocre story -Characters have depth, but their story is delivered poorly  -Crashed mid story, and when i tried to relaunch the game, it keeps hanging at the launcher. -Locked at 30 fps  -For a AAA game, I expected the graphical options to be more varied. -Mediocre driving  -Good gun play.
11197	WOW no quality control whatsoever. Why even port it to PC if its going to be this bad. Well they got till Monday to fix this crap or its refund time. Its like 2k is purposely screwing this up for pc! WHY?  Edit: Patch was a fail just bad performance all the way around coming from a rig that I can play GTA 5 redux mod near max settings and never goes below 60 fps. Solid 60 fps with modded fallout 4 and many other games.     CPU Intel Core i7 4770K @ 4.20GHz watercooled   RAM 16.0GB DDR3 2100MHz (9-11-10-28)  Motherboard ASUS MAXIMUS VI HERO   Graphics 6gig NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti Gigabyte waterforce  Storage 232GB Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB
11198	Story is super great and really intriguing, but that doesnt make up for the fact that the game is suffering from massive performance issues. 30fps lock and upscaled 720p textures. 10/10 would not recomend until it gets patched.
11199	  I played it for a bit. everything seems somewhat fine. the game does constantly crash, but not constantly. Its locked at 30 fps. I wouldnt recommend getting it until the problems are fixed.
11200	Waited for the 60 FPS patch so I didn't burn my 2 hours and boy am I glad I made that decision. This port is awful. GTX 1080 at 1080p on the lowest settings and in the city I can barely stay afloat over 30 FPS. I will be refunding this until they fix these issues.
11201	THAT IS ABSOLUTLEY JOKE. After this update, nothing has changed, beacuse i still have drops from 40 to 20 fps. My config is : CPU - Intel Core i5 4690K 3,5GHz, GPU : Nvidia GeForce GTX750 Ti 2gb GDDR5 (i know, it's a quite old card, but anyway that game should works in minimum 45-50fps) and 8GB ram. I tried to change resolution and etc. but still doesn't work. Graphics in this game just looks like low port from consoles. Textures in low quality in medium settings... Guys .. Are you serious ? Actually, I'm feel very dissapointed.  
11202	Just requested my refund I wanted to like this but the graphical issues are just too bad, the washed out upscaled textures, the wierd sun/cloud flashing, the sunglare in general, the stuttering, the storyline is all over the place, jumping from one point in time to another, its completely disjointed, the cars handle like utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the guns and combat are ok, but nothing special.  Even the 60FPS patch didn't make any difference, this game has serious issues, it doesnt just need polish (which it is sorely lacking) it needs to go back into development to be fixed, and then released later when its actually in a state to be played.
11203	fun game to play, but the missions seem redundent. same thing all the time. i cant see me playing this game much longer then a few weeks before im burnt out.
11204	The game is ok... Well let's start off with the positives...  Positives -   - Fun!  - Lincoln's facial expressions as well as the other characters are on point.  - THe music is 10/10 with great tracks like 'Fortunate Son' and 'Paint it Black'  - Some of the weather effects like the rain and so on so forth.  - The setting is great! The young african-american man back from four years in Vietnam in a late 60's environment in the south.  Cons -   - The game is extremely repetitive, you essentially go around the city doing the same missions whether it's killing a enforcer or taking out a racket it's the same thing over and over again.  - Lincoln is one-dimensional, he's like a psychopath with no real explanation for why he's killing everybody all that we know is that the mob betrayed him and now he's out for blood. Other then that there's nothing.  - The story repetitive and there's not much to it, it doens't feel like your playing a true Mafia game like the last one.  - The driving mechanics are just horrible they feel extremely arcadie.  After going thorugh all those reasons it's sadly safe to say that I would not recommend Mafia III it's not like Mafia II which was amazing, other then that it's just not as fun nor good. For now I wouldn;t really recommend buying it unless you want to experience the story which is ok...
11205	Dear 2K,  what exactly did you do to this game? I was really excited about Mafia 3 since the story of Mafia 2 left some questions open and was really fun to play. After installing the game and not having seen any gameplay oder having read any review, the first punch in my face was the graphics. Even GTA V on Xbox 360 looked significantly better than Mafia 3 on PC... Though I don't have the best rig I expected something else.  The story may be fine but the game is buggy af and thus not enjoyable. Brightness changing from cloudy winter day to sun burning down the earth to ashes and signs reflecting any lights which don't exist... Man that really cuts off the fun. People don't actually react on anything u do and if they do, themselves or objects they get in contact with glitch around like in paranormal activity. And one more thing, fckn cars and everything detailed just appears like 50 m before you get there which is one of the worst things ever to me.   DON'T BUY THIS until 2K has fixed this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11206	The storyline is great, and with a reshade installed the game looks good. But the game crashes alot and the memory allocation and optimization of the game is terrible. This is especially prevelant when you look at whats on display in the game. The game shouldn't be taxing our systems like this. I'm running a GTX 1080 and the game isn't stable. The gameplay is actually fun, but its hard to get into because the game crashes every so often. It's pretty bad, and since there hasn't been an update on PC to fix the glaring problems with the game, I can't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money for a game that is actually put together properly by the developer.
11207	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game ..... Bugs bugs and bugs , story is better than good , but this game is full of bugns , and another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ , i paid 40euro for this realy , it looks like a studnet project ....
11208	My reasons for giving this a thumbs down are as follows:  - Limited map, it's all a bit samey. - GTA 5 is better in every way. - Main character has less charisma than a potato. - Skirts the issues of the time but unfortunately:  1. Falls into white man bad, minority good syndrome.  2. Ignores or brushes aside important issues such as how veterans were treated after returning from vietnam. - Ridiculous amount of gameplay padding via collectibles.  Honestly, might as well just have played GTA 5 through again, would have enjoyed it more.
11209	I could make some huge, wordy review about the excessively repetetive and boring gameplay, so boring that I cannot bring myself to play any more than I have. I could â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and moan about the rather dumb story. I could complain about a lot of things.  However, I think all that really needs to be said is that this game is a disappointment to anyone that enjoyed the previous games, an okay game at best to newcomers, and that it is not really worth the price tag.
11210	Very disappointing.  Cliche, boring revenge story, artificial main character, a bland open world washed out by way too much post processing with no reason to explore it, and totally repetetive and generic gameplay.   
11211	negatives  Not as good as the first one (doesn't feel like open world). The driving and shooting feels unnatural, even though i turned off all the assitance.  Performance issues, despitethe fact that im using an 8gb GTX1070.  cannot skip cut scenes first time around, I dont wanna listen to a haitian drug dealer telling me about how his family was killed, if you lost your family you should probably kill your self and save me the fake french haitian accent. if you die, you might have to go through mroe cut scenes and loading screens jsut to click retry. The wallet safe system could have been simpler. i hate having to visit the same burned down house again and again just to be careful.  limited vehicules, feels like mafia 1 had 10 times more.  Pros:  better than MAFIA II well, goodgraphics is on every AAA game now adays, so whatever, its pretty yes. good story line in general, good performances from the main actors. good atmospher of post-vietnam war era. descent radia stations. alegators.  I just wanna say that im a big fun of the first one, replayed it twice or trice, but this one. i doubt ill even finish it. I feel that the creators should have stuch to their original style. like GTA series does. and thats why funs of GTA and Saint row fans seem to be very loyal. I in the other hand feel like each MAFIA was so different from the previous. and this time you are not even in the MAFIA, you re just killing them.   First MAFIA was like The godfather 1 for me in style and storytelling. secodn one was like: i dont know, good fellas. this one is like. Im playing Shaft or man on fire or something. completly different from the other two,. 
11212	This game is the biggest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've played in a long time.  1. The textures are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrendous - pop in and out, and the sky looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 64bit game. 2. The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing story missions are literally the same objective over and over again. The locations they're set in are bland as â¥â¥â¥â¥, and not memorable at all. 3. No customization what so ever 4. Car handling and physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ 5. Side missions are terrible, and are the same thing over and over again, just like the main missions. 1/10 (piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worthless â¥â¥â¥â¥)
11213	Fun for 1 hour and then you realise that the game has absolutely no variation what so ever. You will spend hours and hours doing the exact, same, repetitive â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again. 9 districts in the city, talk to Donovan, get 2 people to talk to to start missions that make you interrogate npc, destroy crates and kill enforcers to draw out a 'boss'. After killing the 2 bosses in 1 district you move on to the next. The End.  3/10
11214	Basically a GTA game with a lot less stuff to do, but set in the 1968...  The game had a lot of potential, but was poorly executed. I would reccomend waiting for a Steam sale.  Pros: -60âs timeline is refreshing, not a period covered by many games. -Large map representing New Orleans  -Good soundtrack -Good storyline  Cons: -Verry buggy, has CTD issues (I'm running a i7 6700k / GTX 970) -Not much to do other than the main story, there are no side quest offered by NPC's  -Horrible enemy AI -Gunplay feels sluggish (the aim assist needs a serious overhaul). -Weather effects are by far the worst I have seen, and are poorly scripted. Rain looks horrible. -Bad textures... WTF is up with the sky??? -NPCâs are way too âcut and paste' -NPC dialogue is painfully repetitive, even worse than the 'arrow to the knee' in Skyrim. -Boring selection of weapons with no modifications.  -Your stuck with your vanilla character. No clothing or customization options.
11215	Meet Lincoln Clay a well established vietnam war vet. who cannot improve his aim or accuracy reload speed, health or stamina unless he makes enough money for some underboss and has to pay to do so. The police don't give a fudge if you're speeding, runing red lights, high velocity crashes into traffic or hitting pedestrian ands causing destruction of property, unless you kill someone or bump into the police but oddly when you tail someone theyre aware your every move even if you stop when its green. This game is one big giant fetch quest. Does not come close to mafia 2 massive disapointment. Wish I played mafia 2 again instead of buying this.
11216	Dont know what to say about this 'mafia' game , there is no mafia in this game , if you played mafia 2 and expect this to be a mafia game , you will be dissapointed
11217	Good old open world collectathon. Progression is repetative as all hell.
11218	Unfinished and unpolised and Your LITERALLY do the same missions, except some special missions like, kill a faction ruler, or crimeboss.
11219	meh bit samey after a while.
11220	replaymotivation == 0; repetive quests == MAXINT; story == MAXINT/2; compare to MGS V, Witcher III: no match. would not buy again.  go read all 'bad reviews' or youtube rants ... they're right. totally disappointed.
11221	In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. It's a horrendously optimized buggy game at the moment. Which is a shame because the game itself is actually very good. It is more of a GTA game than a Mafia game though, just set in the 60s with the Mafia being the main enemy.
11222	well i can honestly say i am extremely disapointed with mafia 3, after just completing the game. I absolutely loved mafia 2 the story and clothes shopping to tuning and upgrading cars. but mafia 3 lacks most of those things. i've experienced tons of bugs and glitches that still haven't been fixed since release. constantly lagging and major fps drops on a high end pc. extremely repetitive story and side missions. go there, kill him, go back, talk to that guy then go back to the same place to kill another guy.  i was so hyped for this game before release but seems like Hangar 13 ignored everything from mafia 2.  I do not recommend this game nor do i recommend paying the price for it.
11223	It is disappointing. It is nothing old mafias had, nothing. Dont get me wrong, the storyline is fun, it is a great story. Music is also incorporated very well into the game, its catchy and timely, sounds are surreal. Graphics are beautiful, shiny and expensive.  But it is nothing old mafias were, absolutely nothing. It is extremely repetitive, just duck, whistle and stealth kill. You can not die if you drive like idiot, no need to tank gas, can customize cars at all and there is no need actualy to customize them. Drive from place to place, shoot em up, boss, next objective.......yes and dont forget, duck, whistle, stealth kill. AI is on the verge of existance. Do not spend your money it is not good game at all. watch on youtube all the cinematics and play older mafias. I absolutely loved old mafias, the way it incorporates a player into the world there is a no game like it, you are all the time vulnerable and have to watch on details, plan you strike. In mafia 3, call help and shoot or duck, whistle,stealth kill.  Huge dissapointment on my behalf.
11224	Lot's of issues in the game. Road is up to his neck at times. Building where assassines are supposed to be is not really a building. Better fix these bugs!!
11225	Game is just bad.  Graphics are definitely not good.  Playing is extremely boring: once you finshed in a district, you have the exact same missions in another one. AI is the worst: hearing a whistle : 'I am sure there is something here!'. Killing the guy right in front of his friend, the other one doesn't move but then you whistle again: 'Hmmmm, strange, I must check it out...'.  Nice marketing campaign, they succeed to make a â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking good.
11226	My reasons for giving this a thumbs down are as follows:  - Limited map, it's all a bit samey. - GTA 5 is better in every way. - Main character has less charisma than a potato. - Skirts the issues of the time but unfortunately:  1. Falls into white man bad, minority good syndrome.  2. Ignores or brushes aside important issues such as how veterans were treated after returning from vietnam. - Ridiculous amount of gameplay padding via collectibles.  Honestly, might as well just have played GTA 5 through again, would have enjoyed it more.
11227	Angry Blackman: The Game
11228	Like many people have said, this game felt... akward.  There were NICE moments in the game, like hype for doing a big battle or mission to eliminate a certain person, or how they told the story in many ways, a documentary, released footage of a court case.  But the problem is, well there is a lot of em.  -It felt a bit rushed, a majority of the missions felt like a bad grind and it was more focused when you went to the swamps to only steal cargo of some kind.  -Chances are you and will stick with a certain weapon loadout type, very rarely using other weaponry other then to upgrade said set OR due to a very specific situation.  -I only died like... what 2 times after figuring out how to obliterate easily, one of those times being pinned in a corner due to cops. This was more easier to avoid with a full heal medical kit, and having at least 5 charges for em.  I could go on, but for some odd reason like I said, This game felt rushed somehow. Certain things that could of been in it were missing. If you want a story sure, get it. Game? Eeeeeh.
11229	Great game but just was very boring towards the end had high hopes because of Mafia 2 and it was quite a let down
11230	This game is the biggest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've played in a long time.  1. The textures are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrendous - pop in and out, and the sky looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 64bit game. 2. The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing story missions are literally the same objective over and over again. The locations they're set in are bland as â¥â¥â¥â¥, and not memorable at all. 3.

11233	â¢ Low FPS â¢ Ever lower graphics â¢ Somehow blurry and glitchy â¢ The most â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up optimization ever  This game feels like a beta version or just some PS/XBOX â¥â¥â¥â¥ remastered on PC...  Can I refund this game?  NOMINATION: The worst game of 2016
11234	Meet Lincoln Clay a well established vietnam war vet. who cannot improve his aim or accuracy reload speed, health or stamina unless he makes enough money for some underboss and has to pay to do so.

11235	Good old open world collectathon. Progression is repetative as all hell.
11236	Unfinished and unpolised and Your LITERALLY do the same missions, except some special missions like, kill a faction ruler, or crimeboss.
11237	meh bit samey after a while.
11238	Massive let down. Shame :(
11239	Take Mafia 2. Remove almost 90% of the ability to interact with the world. Make the game look dark and gritty like Batman. Add 600 minutes of cutscenes. Reduce gameplay down to 10 minutes inbetween cutscenes. Add a really terrible shooting setup. Add crashes and bugs. Now wrap it up with terrible driving physics.  Boom, you just made Mafia 3.
11240	The story is great and I am pretty sure it can be tagged as the best storyline of the year. However, MAFIA III is not the sequel we all waited for. The 'missions' are killing the bad guy over and over again and the lacks of content are clearly visible.   I am really dissapointed and I can't believe how such a great game can turn into... garbage.
11241	By far the worst mafia game.  Looks really bad for a 2016 game, plays OK but almost everything besides the world and maybe the story needs work. Has lost alot of features from prevoius games and most missions are very repetetiv. Soundtrack however is a solid 10/10  15-20â¬ game at best. Would not recommend right now
11242	its pretty rough ,,just not enough to keep me playing it .i guess it plays fine ,not worth the 60 dollars for sure ..maybe 29.99 open world games are pretty tough to make . if your not rockstar or ubisoft ..not even worth attempting it ..leave the open world game making to the big dogs ....
11243	  Mafia 3 has been giving me problems for the last couple of days. I cant even get it to run. On the launcher I press start and the game freezes and crashes right after. I dont dont recommened it because I cant even get it to run and I have the minimum requirements
11244	It's just boring, the level on detail isn't good enough. Everything is repeating, you can drive 120 in town without police caring etc.. Play this game and try GTA 5 and you will realise the difference.
11245	So after logging 6 hours I couldn't bear to not share this anymore.   MAFIA III is the most boring game I experienced in a long time and I do not recommend it at all. It destroys one of the greatest legacies of games and it makes me mad. Terrible mad.  Facts: Even though the patch/update now provides 60 fps it is still not what you expect from a game engine nowadays. It is badly made. The interaction with your surrounding is way worse than MAFIA II. It got linear and easy and well - very boring.  Houses are all the same. And yes they really are. It doesn't matter what mission you do but after 3 hours you have done it already twice. Objects look the same and are even placed on the same spots. I could go on but it would just be a review of these many youtube videos out there in which you can see the sad devastating truth. Mafia III doesn't feel good and makes you wish the refund option would be available longer than it is right now.   Overall if you want to enjoy the MAFIA legacy be smart and download the old games. They are just better in everything. I regret paying for this game!  Update: It never got better. stay away and safe your money!
11246	Great game but just was very boring towards the end had high hopes because of Mafia 2 and it was quite a let down

11248	Like many people have said, this game felt... akward.

11249	Not at full price. Game was fun for a while, niceish graphics, ran pretty decent on my computer. THen once you get into it, it's sooooo repetitive. It reminds me of Assassin's Creed, the first one.  I think that's what bothers me so much about this game, it's not the first in the series, it's the 3rd. It shouldn't have been this after 2 previous titles.
11250	When i played Mafia 2 it was a very very good game and when you hear that mafia 3 was coming out you can not wait then it comes out and your left feeling let down and robbed   this game could still get alot better maybe with DLC and that but really for a AA-Game it is not all that mission doing the samething again and again and i really wanted to love this game but i just can not shame on me and getting it with the season pass mafia 4 will never be got off the back of this gamne
11251	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ borring game. Don't buy it.
11252	I do not normally write reveiws but this game let me down so much I needed to share.   Bugs galore: Cars spin in circles, explode, drive randomly into you npc's randomly agro / deagro I can stealth kill someone directly in front of another enemy without him noticing me, but if I walk 50m away they agro.  the list goes on and on and on  Flat story line: No real reason to keep playing, the story is flat and is if anything more annoying than helpful I do not feel at all like I was playing a mafia game, there was little to any mob feeling outside of killing the hierarchy of one enemy.  Mafia 2 had a great story in which you climb the ranks into the mob this doesnt even come close  Horrible shooting / driving / enviornment The reason to play these open world games is driving and exploring the world.  So many seemingly flat hills I couldnt walk up bushes are immovable objects couldnt get out of water areas due to invisible walls for no reason would constantly randomly hit invisible barriers while driving near walls causing serious car crash shooting / combat is a complete joke... hide, pop up, headshot, repeat. I used a silenced pistol for the entire game and completely pwned everything even sniper shots across the map magnet hit heads every time with aim assist off.  Driving in grass made cars slow to a complete crawl, sometimes making it impossible to move the car on a mild slope.   TLDR: DONT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!!
11253	Mafia 3 in my eyes fails to catch the 'mafia' atmosphere-mood.  Sure some of its gameplay is nice, and its called mafia 3 but no 'mafia' vipe :(  Its a one-man army run and gun, do rep. mission shooter, with decent story and for some that fine.  But the feel in Mafia 1 &amp; 2 was completly different, something this title sadly is missing.   And to follow it up it feels rushed even after patching.   (For Me)  Pros.::  - Decent Story so far, and decent open map (should be bigger). - Solid mechanics when shooting and covering. - The Lethal or none-lethal option is good, giving variation to kills. - Really Solid soundtrack. - Cutscreens are nice. - Overlaying old sceens and new one's like a old documentary is nice. - Driving Simulation Mode :)   _______   Cons.::  - Disappointing graphics even on Highest Settings. - NO sense of mafia atmosphere. - Very Horrible optimisation (even after patch). - Some Forgettable characters. - Repetitive missions. - AI : Not Really Any. - The Sky in this game is really ugly and pixelated. - day-night cycle terrible. - No Fast Travel (Even if i feel the map is small, getting rep. missions : get truck, deliver truck.. redo again same spot gets boring driving around then when game running like hell.) - No Real Save Option (random saves).   Small Things bugs or misses.::  - Driving at 90 into wall/house/shop and surviving.. seems legit :| - Disappearing textures, physics bugs. (Same on Low or High Settings). - Rob shop run away, watch shop from afar.. no one calls cops? / cops don't show (they did in mafia 2).  i5-4670k 4,2ghz GTX 1070 16 GB ddr3 2800mhz Samsung 840 pro 256gb SSD win10 64  On a good day i can play 15-25min at a time until i get Random Crash To Desktop (seems no fix yet, and no! turning off v-sync don't do it for me like some says).  And with no real save game option this becomes a real downer. And the constant bad fps / optimisation made me download Mafia 2 again.  SO :)  Sadly i can't recommend this title. In need of even more patching. If you really want to play this game find a REALLY good discount or make sure there's refund on it.  Alternative go get / play Mafia 2 think my laptop can even play that one on high :)
11254	Buy Asus PG348Q and get promotional Mafia III key. Can't play on full screen... Doesn't work even with 3930K@4.2GHz, 32GB RAM and EVGA 1070 FTW@1982MHz on playable FPS. (20 on 3440x1440) and on FHD nearly 60fps.   Bad port - almost reminds me from GTA IV.  I would like to play the game - If you would also - buy it from under 10â¬
11255	Every game has it's ups and downs and Mafia 3 is unfortunately one of them :(  The game itself is enjoyable to play but lacks content and due to that fact the gameplay itself becomes very repetitive , Yes they may be adding racing and more storylines dlc but will that change anything apart from giving the game more driving and shooting to do. So after 98 hrs of repetitive driving and shooting i give the game 5 out of 10 , i may increase if they improve the game more for the players.

11258	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ borring game. Don't buy it.
11259	Early access game for the price of a triple A title. Should have stayed in developement for at least one full year. Get it cheap or don't get it at all.
11260	Can someone help me this game stole 50 dollars and 22 hours of my life
11261	It is disappointing. It is nothing old mafias had, nothing. Dont get me wrong, the storyline is fun, it is a great story.

11263	Last time I saw this many bugs I had to go for an STD test.
11264	Pros: good atmosphere  story is good  Cons: 30fps Graphics are poor due to blur cover system is bad ALT to melee? WOW AI is buggy 2 CTD per hour  Overview: Steer clear till this ones on sale.
11265	A superficially pretty-game without much substance or variety.   The soundtrack is gorgeous. And some of the views of New Orleans are breath-taking. The entire concept of a post-Vietnam war era mob game with a black protagonist in that pre-civil rights era is attractive. But unfortunately, while the presentation, voice-acting and cut-scenes are generally very well-done, the characters and protagonists are as shallow and superficial as the game itself.   The main problem with the game is a persistently lack of variety. After the prologue, the entire game appears to be driving around from location to location taking out minions and named mini-bosses to lure out the district boss so you can take over their racket. It's a concept that's been done before (GTA 3, etc.). It's interesting initially and for a while but after a while you come to realise that the entire game seems to be just more of the same (without some of the other distractions that GTA has to offer).  As a 'shooter' it's fairly generic and not in a good way. The gun-fights and realism aren't particulatly stimulating or gripping. The stealth aspect of the game is interesting initially but lacks polish and variety. Combat in particular suffers from tepid AI - some of the stupidest AI I've seen in a long time.   Port-wise: after the patch (why was a patch even necessary?!!), 60fps and uncapped framerate and re-mapping of keys (with correct prompts) make the game more playable. On a machine that can run GTA 5 on close to ultra settings, the sluggish performance of Mafia 3 sugggests that optimization is not great.   Bugs-wise: have not yet run into any game-breaking bugs yet. some minor glitches but nothing too serious and generally the game works as it is intended to.   That's said, I do regret buying this game. It's not an awful game. But not a good one by any means. I cannot generally recommend this game even if it is on offer for the simple reason that it gets boring very quickly.
11266	Wait for Steam sale .  This game has a good base but it wasnt finished , it feels more like an Early release then a completed product. Overall id still give this game 6/10 even how it is now.  Within the next few weeks we should see Races , Car customization and outfits. currently there is nothing to do in this open world besides pick up posters and wiretap.  So far even at the current patch im seeing lots of issues  +Frame tearing  +Sun glare issues of vechicle paint +Skybox issues. + Vechicle sounds is a diffent issue. Sounds very animated and fake , almost tinny at times. +Missions are extremly repeatative !  +Police do not give tickets for speeding (no speed signs) nothing for going through a Red light or even for doung burnouts right in front of them LOL It lost most of the details from Mafia 2 funny enough.  Lacking Open World Content Cant get a drink at the bar , no snooker , no card games , no illegal gambiling , no clothing stores , no auto shop. Lots of things that could be in the open world that just isnt. im with you Why an Open World then? i dont know haha  basically dont buy untill its actually working
11267	2016 has been the year of disapointments., and Mafia 3 is the case and point. I have written three reviews for this game but just got to frustrated. CTD 7 times, wretched performance, some of the worst looking textures I have seen in years, the most graphical glitches I have ever seen(the sky can be pixelated at times though that is much better from launch, and the reflextions are broken), and cut scenes that are prerendered(so if it was night and raining it becomes day. I have had a NPC in a car in a cut scene totally change cars after the scene stoped. Seriously day time and sunny getting into a red soft top coupe and then outside of scene night, raining, and blue sedan) Simply this is not finished. Arkam Knight ran about the same at launch and that looked a lot better...   Personally I loved Mafia 1, like Mafia 2, but this is unfinished and I find myself trying to like it. Sure the story has an end and is pretty good(NOT great), but this is a game not a book. I run a 4790k/980ti/16gigs ddr3 ram @2400, this is the only game that currently crashes for me and to retain 60fps 90% of the time I have play @1080p on med/high with AA low or low @ 1440p and sweet Fx to enable SMAA because the AA seems to be FXAA x1(low) x2(med) and blurry(High). Theres promise here, but just to many issues right now. You incandecent pc gamers do not defend this bad port or we will get even more bad ports.   Enough ranting, lets get to the graphics. I will attempt not to rant. You play as a not very at all charismatic ex Nam vet Lincoln Clay, a guy out for revenge. Boring. A black guy out for revenge. Still Boring Hanger 13. Oh the cut scenes look great. The animations are all good, but once in game it feels like not that. The animations are stiff, the people look 2010ie and the trees all look the same. The variety here is bad. From Cars/Trucks/boats(no bikes again), to the people you see. You will see them alot. The same guy infront of you maybe the same guy four people away. I feel like naming them I see them so often. Hi Dave, Hi next Dave. You will see them that much at times. Then theres the animals. Ah, the animals. I saw a gator the size of a boat grab a man in the water and he's screaming 'NO! AHHH!!!'; while it does the death roll and has him under water. Good times. Well thats it. No, really that is the only animal and each gator is a copy and paste. I can't remember seeing birds. You can correct me but I think I saw a rat in a mission but have not seen one since. You will hear dogs at times, but there are no dogs to find,(they are in the first game) no cats, no deer, no frogs. Just gators and they all look the same and will just appear when an NPC is in the water or at random and each has the same animations. (The gators are ment to be a mechanic of gameplay to hide bodies, but cops/NPC are so dumb this is useless) The enviroments are empty and are barren of a living enviroment. Textures can look ok at times and other times I stop and just look in displeasure. They don't look finished. Textures can be low res and flat. Even the best ones are equal to Just Cause 3, not anything amazing but would be fine. The reflections look broken with a series of bugs. The cars can reflect fine at times and they attempt to show their period lacquer lead sled paint reflections, but it is the chrome that is the biggest offender. It looks wrong. Just wrong. It does not follow shadows or lighting logic and it is on every car since this is the 60s. The lighting can look good. Night is the most visually pleasing time of day as you don't notice the lack in detail and the lighting is good. Lights all give off a realistic illumination. The sun does not do this. It is overly bright and foggy haze plagues the daytime. It seems to be foggy because the view distances is very low. There are like four types of trees. The trees all look the same, and a cluster of trees is imposible to walk through. Still at times I forget about these issues because it can look good at times, but glitches and poor design are just as glaring as the blinding sun reflecting off the damp street.   Gameplay is another mix up. Seriously the control feels like Saints Row. Infact the whole game is like a serious saints row or Just Cause 3 with more issues, a serious story, and less stupid fun. Car handling is ok on simulation and I just don't flat out care about the arcade setting. It doesn't fit Mafia. In Mafia 1 the not realistic car setting was the automatic trans, what is this nonsense. I want my gears and clutch back! The handling is nothing like reality. Infact the driving is just missing character that big 60s cars have. Drive a 60s Polaris wagon with a 413 Wedgehemi and you will know what I mean.(Handling over 40mph-no, 60-0 breaking-maybe until the drums get heated then nope, speed-YES!) This is like the one thing each Mafia game did well. Sorry, see I'm trying not to rant, but they forgot the manual transmission for Fords sake! G.M. Chrysler would it have been so hard! Anyway. Gameplay is like the Godfather games, so uninspired but it works. The game does have a good selection on guns, but you will only want to use a few of them. The cars that are yours since there is no garage don't add much outside of your first car and two of the preorder cars. The cars were a huge part of the other two in the series. The game is a go here kill him, go there kill them. Pick a gang faction who are really annoying and sloppily done. Dont get me wrong it is fun at times, and is ok. But just ok. NPC are so bad Saints Row/ Just Cause level. All NPC that talk are in threes, and most are either walking or waiting. Where are they walking? To wait of course. Now go shoot 'enemy number xxx' and drive fast take chances. Shooting is compentent, yet feels unfinished. The lever action shotgun has no lever action animation... So you will wait after shooting thinking you are reloaded try to shoot. Don't hit anything with a car because the damage model is horrible as well as the damage taken just seems broken.   The world of Mafia 3 is empty and deviod of things to do, but the sound is good, voice acting is great and the music is alot of my favorites. From CCR, Hendrix to Roger Miller. Very good sound track and the highlight of the game.  The story is good albiet a bit heavy at times, but now that Im done I am starting to forget a bit of it. The problem is the game is so padded that its good place to take a nap.The story is hours between capturing zones so I stopped caring who I was trying to take down. Most of the times I forgot who I was killing because there is no investment in most of the mini bosses. I had no idea who I was killing half the time in Mafia 3, nor did I give a hoot. The story eneded the way I thought, even down to the choices. It is just such a forgetable game. Mafia 1 I have not beaten that game in over ten years but I remember most of the story/missions, Mafia 2 I remember a decent bit as well. I just finished this game I remember more from Mafia 2.(that world atleast had a lot of atmosphere and felt more living) Outside of the racism there is nothing different in Mafia 3. Though I am glad they didn't shy away from racism in the 60s, it does feel over done at times; only that is what they were banking on that as the hook'different.' I have no reason to return to the game outside of dlc. There is nothing to do, and since it runs like a fat kid in the woods with no shoes and look like a 360 port; the visuals don't make me want to return. The cut scenes are done well but the expierence is plagued with averageness inbetween.   I know what your thinking you charming pc users. Hey hot pants, do you recommend it. There is one glarring issue above all others and the reason I say DO NOT RECOMMEND;. It's not the chrome, the same missions all the time, or even the lifeless world. When you finish the game there is nothing to do and I mean nothing, but look at everything wrong with the game sadly.
11268	So, after spending $60 for this game I would say that it is not something that I wish I bought. The game itself was okay. Graphics and performance left something to be desired. Story line was fantastic and I loved the way they moved through it they way they did, no spoilers. However, the missions themselves were all repetative. Basically do the same thing over and over to get the district under your control and then go kill the boss. You can try to be stealthy to add some flare to the game but it does not give you anything if you do. So you may as well go in there guns blazing because you will most likely survive it. There was little to no customizing your character, Lincoln Clay. Mafia 2 at least offered something to the effect of changing your characters clothes, I assumed this would have been added upon. The only way you can get upgrades on your vehicles is through unlocking them by giving your liutenants rackets and upping their income. But there is no changing the color or wheels or plates or such in the like. Side missions pretty much did not exist in my opinion. There were missions that were 'optional' but they all played a part to the overal storyline. The only real side missions were the missions you run as favors for your guys but even then it is pretty much either go here and kill or go here and steal then bring back. Way to simple for that. I expected much more from the game for all the hype that was driven from the previews and I can safely say that I am disappointed. This game is really played for the story I would say. In the end you can chose how it ends essentially 1 of 3 ways. Which were all pretty satisfying actually. I will end it there. If you enjoyed the game, good on you. I would still recommend Mafia 2 over this.
11269	dont buy this it is currently broken on pc ive encountered random crashes and shadow glitches already, and i havent even really gotten started on the intro mission. and 30 fps yeah are you even kidding me this is atkham knight levels of bad. but for anyone from hangar 13 that is reading this you know already so my request wouold be a in game volume adjustment in the menues, and more settings to play with because right now its pretty pitaful. wait for a patch.
11270	This is my new review since the patch to remove the 30 fps cap. The game is fun but there are a heap of bugs still and low resolution textures. The game still crashes often (usually once or twice every hour). The fps cap has been removed but I'm only getting 40-60fps on average but it's usually around 40-50 at 1440p with a i7 3770k at 4.4ghz and an overclocked gtx 1070. It still sometimes drops to 30fps. The game is probably too easy as the AI are just really stupid and walk towards you after you kill one of them. The missions are quite repetitive as well. The cut scenes are good and the soundtrack is awesome. It's just a bad console port and for that reason I would not reccomend buying it. Hopefully the issues will be fixed because it has the potential to be a decent game.
11271	Game is very very buggy and gets very repetivative. Fun at first then just gets frucstating esp with all the crashes. Love mafia 1 and 2 i did like how they kind of tied mafia 2 into the game. But just didnt feel the same.
11272	It runs like my grandma nice and slow and looks like its about to die.
11273	Will agree to most 'not recommended' reviews. Story is lacking and game is very repetitive. Can't complain on graphics or bugs - did not encounter any exept for single crash at first hour of play. However it was strange when after 2 days playing third day found remapped control buttons, most likely by patch, without informing, possibility to go back, etc. so had to learn controls anew. It's worh a try if you find it on sale later at about 20EUR or less, but not at it's current price.
11274	Payed 46 Euros for the Digital Deluxe Edition of this game, still feels like I payed about 20 Euros too much. The graphics look more like 2014 than 2016, the gameplay is very repetetive, there are still many bugs left in the game that are annoying and require you to restart in order to continue playing and there are far too many cutscenes.  All in all this is not a worthy sequel to Mafia II, the ONLY good thing about this game is the Soundtrack.
11275	Graphics are the same on MAX and LOW, check this comparison video below.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjfXZnNCds   Even with a GTX 1080 at 1920x1080P the game hits just over 60fps!
11276	Graphics are not even close to what they show in the trailers. Apparently it's locked at 30 fps and it doesn't even give me an option to tinker with the refresh rate so I don't even know if it's playing in 144hz. I have a $3000 rig and the game randomly just crashed for no reason. The story is really cliche and boring. I have everything in maxed settings and it still looks like a game on the PS3. I'm really not impressed and this game definitely isn't worth $60. The cutscenes are way too long, the melee sequences are extremely repetitive, and even on the hardest difficulty the game is easy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Stealthing seems to just be a waste of time when you can wipe out the entire floor with a machine gun in a millisecond. I wasn't expecting a GTA 5 but god damn this game isn't worth $60. I feel like they focused too hard on the cinematics/storyline that they completely forgot they were making a video game and not a movie. It feels like L.A. Noire all over again. I give it a solid 2/10
11277	30fps, stay away ! This game feels horrible, looking around feels like you will die soon, motion blur everywhere even when turned off. Horrible port, wait for patch impressions, never preorder games from developer again
11278	I was excited for this game. I loved the first two, replayed Mafia 2 a few times, when they announced the third one, I was heavily excited. I was skeptical of course, a brand new studio working on this, despite drawing established people from other studios was still a tough pill to swallow, but I followed the game. The amount of pre-release videos drew me in, normally there was never that much pre-release gameplay shown so I figured the game would be alright. Boy was I wrong   It's obvious from the moment you enter the menus that this is a console port. I was expecting this but what I wasn't expecting was the general lack of care and polish put into the PC version. Options menu is pretty barren with very little options, not even a texture quality selection. Audio options are standard but not a big issue. Controls are where I have an issue. Rebinding is not great, and is one area where it's apparent it's a substandard port. A lot of pc players have mice that have more buttons and yet the game doesn't recognize these, can't rebind anything to them. Can't rebind any actions to clicking the mouse button either. You can always tell if a developer put effort into the pc port by the options menu and it is heavily apparent, they did not.  Now, onto the game. First off, when you change your resolution, it uses upscaling, instead of putting in the effort to make proper options, they went the lazy route. Texture quality is crap and they intentionally hide this via blur effects.Graphics are crap, even on what they consider max settings, changing graphics options does nothing, fairly impressive PCs are struggling to hit 30fps, frakking 30!! That shouldn't happen on a game that looks this bad.  Now the sad part is, this game could be good. The gunplay is satisfying, driving can be fun, and the story is really damn good. But, I don't know whether this was developer laziness or whether the publisher imposed deadlines on them that required corners cut, all I know is that the first game out of Hanger 13 is not great at this point in time.
11279	EVERY. SINGLE. MISSION. IS. THE. SAME. MISSION. IN. A. DIFFERENT. ENVIROMENT!  Oh and the world is so big the driving gets kinda boring, unless you have a fast car.
11280	With this 60 fps patch they released, I am getting 22 fps in the city on low and high. My pc is better than the reccomended specs (check my profile). So they just rushed out a patch without really testing it at all... I haven't been able to play for 5 minutes...
11281	Way to many Frame Drops for me I have to refund it and take my money to xbox one instead atleast i know the games frames won't drop as much there. Great game though wish I could play it right now but the frame drops kill the immersion.
11282	MOTION BLUR SIMULATOR 11/10 WOULD PUKE AGAIN  - 30 FPS Locked at launch - No reflection in the mirror (we're in 2016 remember?) - 2007 Textures - No 21:9 ratio support - Can't change graphics ingame 
11283	AT LAUNCH: - The game is locked to 30fps - Its graphics are pretty terrible compared to other games that I can run on my PC at a solid 60fps. - Key rebinding rebinds the key but doesn't allow you to use the new bind. (I accidentally unbound shoot, so I binded it to Mouse1 again but now I cannot shoot. Which is kinda awful. Also rebound M to map, and I'm now stuck in the Tool Tips thing that you get about maps right after you get Lincolns car. This is why I only have 30 mins playtime.) - No binding of controls to extra mouse buttons such as M4, M5 (side buttons) and no binding availiable for side scrolling buttons either. This is quite frustrating as I do bind almost all of my mouse buttons in most of my games.  VERDICT: - Don't buy it now, it's a broken piece of crap. - Refund it if you have bought it. - (Re)Buy when the FPS cap is fixed and integral parts of the game (such as keybinding) actually work. - The ability to not be able to bind anything to the same key makes the controls for the game a bit clunky but definately not unplayable.
11284	I love the mafia games on pc. The first one was fantastic for pc and even had steering wheel support with force feedback. Then came mafia 2 and it was great, but they got rid of wheel support and seemed like it was made for consoles so they could get more sales. That's fine right? as long as the game is playable and the controls are good, I'm happy with that. Then Mafia 3 is out and I try it going in and I've been waiting long for this being a fan of the series. The game starts and the framerate is very slow, even running on a gtx 1070. I find out that the game is capped at 30hz. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ridiculous. Why would they do that, it looks like the game is running on the hardware of an N64. I try playing the game nontheless and I am driving through town. I'm trying to figure out how to use the car horn so I look in the control settings and it shows the map of controls for an xbox controler. This game is not ready for PC. It's a cheap console port. Unless you want to play with an xbox controller and tollerate a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ framerate then go ahead and purchase this game and you'll be happy. Otherwise wait until they get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together and realize the potential of the pc gaming market.
11285	This game is full of bugs... Not going far through it already had to restart a mission because some objects are flying around.
11286	I do not normally write reveiws but this game let me down so much I needed to share.   Bugs galore: Cars spin in circles, explode, drive randomly into you npc's randomly agro / deagro I can stealth kill someone directly in front of another enemy without him noticing me, but if I walk 50m away they agro.  the list goes on and on and on  Flat story line: No real reason to keep playing, the story is flat and is if anything more annoying than helpful I do not feel at all like I was playing a mafia game, there was little to any mob feeling outside of killing the hierarchy of one enemy.  Mafia 2 had a great story in which you climb the ranks into the mob this doesnt even come close  Horrible shooting / driving / enviornment The reason to play these open world games is driving and exploring the world.  So many seemingly flat hills I couldnt walk up bushes are immovable objects couldnt get out of water areas due to invisible walls for no reason would constantly randomly hit invisible barriers while driving near walls causing serious car crash shooting / combat is a complete joke... hide, pop up, headshot, repeat. I used a silenced pistol for the entire game and completely pwned everything even sniper shots across the map magnet hit heads every time with aim assist off.  Driving in grass made cars slow to a complete crawl, sometimes making it impossible to move the car on a mild slope.   TLDR: DONT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!!
11287	Its a good game. you can have allot off fun playing it the first 10 hours but then its becomes boring. AND THE PRICE !!! they ask too much for what you get!  
11288	Game still crashing and has performance issues, even after the recent 1.2GB patch.  I don't have a weak computer(i7, R9 390, 32GB's of RAM, game is on a SSD).  I got this game for $30 from a pricing-error on Humble Bundle, but if I can't even play the game for more than 30 minutes without it crashing, then it isn't even worth $5.  Game has good gunplay and story though, hopefully 2K/Hangar 13 fixes these issues.
11289	They dropped the ball...
11290	ATTENTION HANGER 13!!!! Over all this sucks. SUPER dissapointed.  I would NOT buy this game yet!!! Its filled with terrible terrible optimization errors. Im playing on a GTX 1080! yeah... i didnt expect my 800$ graphics card to not be able to play this like I imagend. The cut scenes are extremely miss leading and thats what i thought i could have with my $1800 rig. WHY!? why does every area have a layer of haze over the screen?. I thought my tv was broken. It has minimal tweaks not allowing to select HBAO+ or SSAO or MSAAx4 or A DISABLE BLOOM feautre you cant add debris effects or interact with anything except doors and cars and people even turning on a light switch would be nice or grabbing a beer from the fridge or sinks! why is there no interaction. The reflections are crap from mirrors to metal and the skybox is terrible! it all looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥. for a 2016 game... COME ON!!!! seriusly check out Mafia 2 and its ahead of this game it even looks better! AMAZING cut scenes but thats not why i baught the game
11291	I feel the adverts for this game was very misleading.   PROS-  SOUNDTRACK  CONS- EVERYTHING BUT THE SOUNDTRACK.
11292	why cant you just fix these issuse your meant to be profesianals so why can i still not get the game to work it doesnt even open i have reinstalled it twice now but it just crashes
11293	Sucks at everything a game can suck at
11294	locked to 30 FPS, textures are a blurry mess.
11295	30 fps is terrible, would not recommend to anyone until it is fixed. Save your money.

11305	Game doesn't start after 20+ tries. It instantly crashes. So did i pay 70 Euro for a crash and repeat launcher or what? Also the morons making this game have apperantly locked it at 30FPS wich makes me wonder if they are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or their equipment for making games are from the 90's.
11306	So, normally I don't harp on graphics but even at 4k this game looks bad, the animations in particular are total rubbish. The settings revert themselves after starting the game from the launch pad, forcing you to reset them in the game.  The controls are insane, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to make the page down key the weapon quick swap key, are you kidding me? Sure, you can easily remap the keys, but it shows that they overlooked the PC version/wanted you to use a controller to play.   Maybe the patch they are releasing will fix some of the small issues, but right now the game feels unfinished, and I'm not sure I want to wait for it to release to see if I still want a refund.  It is no wonder 2k didn't release any copies of this for review.   TL:DR Hold off for now, it has issues.
11307	Damn, so disappointing about this game. This is nowhere near Mafia or Mafia 2. This is simply just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ spinoff. Ok, there is nice cutscenes, but graphics itself isnt that good looking. I actually reinstalled Mafia 2 and damn, that still looks awesome!   Conns:  - Guns feel like bbguns - Cars damage physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - Police are like in GTA. Always tries to kill you. - Lincoln is clumsy af. Cannot jump or climb up over even a small step. - After couple of hour game play game already started to repeat it self. Kinda reminds me about old 'The Godfather' -game  All summed up, this is really dissappointing game. Wish 2K Czeck would have done this game instead this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Hangar 13.
11308	This is the reason I'm not buying games anymore. Piracy isn't cool but neither is feeling ripped off for a game you are super hyped about that turns out an obnixious thrown together buggy mess. RIP PC gaming if they continue to do junk console ports.
11309	Way to many Frame Drops for me I have to refund it and take my money to xbox one instead atleast i know the games frames won't drop as much there. Great game though wish I could play it right now but the frame drops kill the immersion.
11310	Well, first of all 2K did a fab job of hyping this game, most properly to get their cash back asap, as they knew it was rushed and flawed, i see speed bouts flying past me and i havent had a drink, honest officer!  After a few hours i got the hang of it, controls are crap for PC so i went to the xbox controller, after 10 hours, just 10 HOURS! i was bored sensless, sad as i pre purchased the game, on all the hype, as i said on 2K Utube, never will i ever pre purchase a game ever again. EVER, thanks to 2K.  Now im up to 23 hours+ i just cant be bothered to play anymore, i start the game and once loaded, i quit and its just be bothered to do the same thing over and over again, another rinse and repeat title.  I do wheelspins and donuts in front of the cops, they look and walk offm so i chuck nades at the cops, they chase me, i hide, they leave i do it all again for some action, open world seems dormant, people walk around doing, well nothing? i plough through pedestrians on the pavement, in my shiney car, no damage so i do more and rack up the murder total, I get out shoot them, just because im so bored, so its anther Â£40-Â£50 down the drain.  Shame really, the hype was awesome, shame the game wasnt.
11311	Enough is enough! This game is unplayable. Crashes every 5-10 minutes now and no patch in sight! Also is lacks proper 21:9 support and don't get me started on those missions... This game is a drisgrace and shouldn't even be called Mafia at all!
11312	Im a big fan of mafia. But not this one
11313	Bad game overall at this point.  - 30fps locked. - Maxed out 4K with AA set to 'Low' takes dips to 26fps on GTX 1080. - Textures are looking horrendous. - Doesn't look like a game as it was portrayed from gameplay videos, not even in visuals. - 4K scaling is bad, very very bad. The map and everything else is tiny. - It literally looks like a copy/paste from console version. - It looks decent at night times but not as good as shown in gameplay videos, day time is ugly.  Was eagerly waiting for this game to release, pre-ordered and everything just to find this poop of a product. Will update the review once patch is out, tried looking around in config files and couldn't find any option to unlock framerates but will continue to look further. Such a shame, I had high hopes for it. Will still play it for the storyline and what not, but this is a bummer. I doubt patches will revamp this game to a level one would want to play in 4K, it'll make it better but not turning too serious I'm afraid unless 2K can surprise us.  I'd suggest wait until they fix the game at least.    // EDIT: 5:24 PM Saturday, 8 October 2016 (PT) after Patch 1.01
11314	bad game dont buy it just becouse i have 23h in dont mean I like it. Its repetetiv main missions are like side missions  bad graphics 6/10. If you are fan of the franchise wait for drop in price.
11315	looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and almost fell asleep trying to play it
11316	Same thing over and over and over! Mafia 2 is way better!
11317	Everyone else already listed what's wrong with the game, some better than I'm able to  Strip everything you loved about Mafia 2 out of a Mafia game and add in some generic open world gameplay and you got Mafia 3
11318	Simply bad... after only 4h I realised the game is just way too shallow and just not worth any of my time. Money is better spent on Indie titles these days than overhyped AAA titles that get pushed out way too early. And wtf is up with the skybox?? That looks like super mario on the N64, heck that skybox looked better... Then add the random crashes... enough. Then when you compare with Mafia II it hits you in the face that M2 actually had more depth than this game..   Sad really. The story is good, the cutscenes are good but the rest, well just shallow.
11319	not worth the money. wait until its atleast 50% off then it might be
11320	I wish the game would be playable at its current state, but the lack of higher framerate makes me feel sick when I try to play. This needs to be fixed!
11321	False advertisement 30fps lock in the game looks terrible. Will probably try to get a refund for this one disappointing
11322	This is so infuriating! I can tell that Mafia 3 has a great game hidden under the metric ton of â¥â¥â¥â¥ its been shipped with. The characters are interesting, the style in which the story is being delivered so far is new and captivating.  But yes, there's a multitude of problems that have arrived with its release. The 30fps is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥, sure, but I would be able to look passed that if it was polished elsewhere. However, the texures are abysmal, and the pop-in is horrendous. Even If I dismissed those glaring problems as well, I would still be left disappointed. Due to the 30fps, I'm playing with a controller, as I find the framerate more managable that way. But, I have to put up with the missing button prompts. Not even the 'controller layout' page shows the button mapping.  I know the devs have been working hard to fix this, but until they do, the frustation is not worth it. Wait until you hear of some major patch work before forking out for this game.  Damnit Mafia 3! I really want to play you!  [EDIT]  The patch has been release to unlock the framerate. But the bugs and stability is still a â¥â¥â¥â¥ show. Games seems ok other than those issues.
11323	Still massivley buggy aadn repetive. Wait for a sale. This game needed another six months before release.
11324	I'll start with the good things. Donovan, awesome character, awesome dialogue and awesome even though short, moments with him, especially the credits scene. The atmosphere while sometimes weird due to strange cloud speed and fast weather changes, was pretty good. Soundtrack is sort of a mixed bag, I personally didnt like it that much, but I wont comment much since it depends on each persons music taste. Ok'ish stealth mechanics, i certainly liked going stealthy rather than full on assault, so that was a plus. Now the bad things are pretty much everything thats left, sadly. The story, the characters that arent fleshed out as much as I wanted, such as Vitto( you do find out what happens to Joe though I have a feeling regarding an ending scene that what Vitto revealed might not be the case), the gameplay is horribly boring, lacks excitement, basically the game is the most average game I've played. Its not bad but its not good either. You wont miss anything for not playing the game, hence why Im not recommending it, maybe if it goes on sale under 15$.
11325	If you are a streamer or youtuber and thinking of buying this game to put it on youtube done because it is a nightmare it repeatedly freezes obs and x split nvidia shadowplay does not like it either when you go to edit it you need to move the game sound around as it goes out of sink with there mouths and gun bullets and it is not as good as the last two they have made it to much like gta but they messed the buttons up i am not happy with this game at all
11326	I was excited to get and play Mafia 3. Watching the live E3 footage and getting the tshirt they handed out to the on hands attendees. After playing the game for near 7-8 hours I started noticing mission bugs. Then it just continued on and on and on and on. Now I am stuck in the story line because of these bugs. I am highly upset that I can not return this POS game. From Massives giant F-up with 'The Division' to Edios 'Duex Ex Manking Divied' and now on to this POS game. I am disapointed in the developers and publishers of these games. Yes I am looking at you Ubisoft, 2k and Square Enix. For the love of god fix your QC process NOW.   TLDR: Do not buy this Crappy game. Wait 6 months and get it for 15 bucks. Waste of money and NVMe Space.
11327	Where to start... First off let me say that I am a big fan of the Mafia series and had high hopes for this game.  This game has a VERY rich story, which is something I can't fault it for. That being said almost every other aspect of this game is lacking, HEAVILY.  Performance wise this game is having a hard time being run even by amazing hardware at anything above 1080p. I currently run an i5-4690k clocked at 4.3GHz paired with a 780ti. I currently have no problem running GTA V at pretty much max settings at 2k resolution. This game at 2k resolution unless set to low settings nets me around 30 frames. All of this is if the game decides not to crash itself after 30 minutes or so.   Gameplay is very repetitive as many other reviews will claim, this game is all about claiming territory from Sal Marcano and his criminal enterpise. A district has 2 lieutenants and 1 capo. To find and murder these people you must complete redundant tasks such as interrogating people for information, destroying and taking money from places they run, or simply killing a target. This causes the lieutenant to come out of hiding, then after completing that you do a mission to get the capo out of hiding and kill them. The side missions are one and the same, either kill or fetch tasks that never bring anything new to the table.   Visually the game does not look good at all, I've been told that the textures are all in 720p and then sampled up to your resolution, a telltale sign of a console port.   There are a few things that I want to point out in gameplay and realism that this game did very poorly: #1 AI #2 Physics #3 Realism  As far as AI goes no matter what difficulty you are on all AI will be lumbering idiots that couldn't stop a fly. You can't interact with any non essential characters in the game besides saying hello every once in a while. For the game taking place in the south in the 1960's and for the cops being bought off by Sal Marcano you'd think they'd be a big obstacle for a colored man. The police won't bat an eye unless called. Speed past them through a red light? nothing. Hit a car going 90 miles an hour right in front of them? Nothing. Barely bump their car? They have an apb out on you and shoot to kill. Though for what it is I will say the system of cops not having some sort of internal gps that lets them always know where you are after someone reports a crime is a good step away from the gameplay of GTA where cops know every single time where you are. Also the shotgun toting mafiosos who think they're invinvible is a bit dim.   For physics this game barely has any, Lincoln can jump out of a car completely horizontally no matter what speed he's going and and land exactly next to where his door was when he jumped out. Cars magically hop into the air when being hit.   For realism? Lets talk about how car crashes at 90mph don't kill you, and barely scratch your car, gators are invincible and always are there to eat a body after it falls remotely in a body of water among other things.  In Mafia 2 you could actually shoot enough that the hubcap of the car would come off. Car crashes at even 50 mph could kill you instantly. You can hit any random non hostile npc with one melee and they're instantly knocked out, there are no consequences for robbing a store beides the police might get called, even if you murder someone in there (wheras in mafia 2 you couldn't go back for a while and there was police tape).   Is this review well written and formatted? Probably not. Does it accurately describe the state of this game? I think so.  I had been trying to just accept this game so much, being a fan of the series, I wanted it to be good but the more I took a good look at it I saw what a dissapointment it really was. Even if this game had looked good and ran great across the board I don't think it would be worth it. They took a really engaging story and ruined everything else inbetween. Territory grabbing missions are just pointless things that lead to unlock more bits of the story. You can't customise your character in any way, your cars in any way, have a garage to store them. Little bits of detail like bums, and small npc interactions would make this game feel a lot more real. Overall I wish that the developers of this game hadn't let us down in this way. The opening mission was great, do this, drive here, and then there were different steps to complete to finish. They were all important and drove everything forward. That was how they should have done the whole game, open world but actual missions instead of annoying chore like tasks. Nobody playing a Mafia game wants to run the day to day operations, but to understand and delve deep into what being in the mob actually feels like, the nitty gritty bits, the fighting, the honor code, all that.   I give this game a 5/10, and that may just be me being generous.  
11328	Mafia 1 and 2 are much better games. Mafia 3 is basically objectively bad, you do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ to draw someone out to kill them and rinse repeat until the end. It's tedious and a chore to play. After the first 2 hours you've seen everything the game has to offer and then it just sends you to different regions of the city hitting rackets again until enough damage is inflicted to draw out another enemy to kill.
11329	Don't buy this, at first, I thought the game had a interesting story and i give it an second chance. Very disapointed.
11330	TL;DR The story and the soundtrack is good and that's pretty much it. Wait until there's a sale for the game or buy Mafia II/Mafia I
11331	Mafia III, the follow up to the legendary Mafia and Mafia II video games. I was very hyped for this game and was anticipating an epic game much like Grand Theft Auto V. However, there are a few things that make gameplay a less enjoyable experience.  Let me start off by saying the story is excellent, and while I haven't played through the entire game yet, I will hopefully change this review by the end of all the DLCs and updates. The story is very engaging and unique. There are also plenty of elements that reinforce the notion of racism during this period: such as when police respond slower and the dispatcher uses words like 'maybe' in poorer, black neighborhoods.  However, story aside, the game is hard to love when the physics and graphics are sub-par. While the game does look pretty at times, there are some glaring details I cannot forgive. The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics are wonky at times. The lighting and reflections and wonky and the chrome on the cars looks more like matte plastic with a metallic paint. Sometimes the immediate world also darkens and lightens as if the developers wanted to emulate clouds obscuring the sun intermittently but it comes across as jarring. At night New Bordeaux looks very beautiful though. I think the developer added too many post-process effects that take away from the performance, this should be looked into but I think the only way to fix this is to redo the entire game engine.  As mentioned the physics and overall feel of the game is lacking. Driving feels like the cars are driving with ice wheels. While yes, older American cars had wonky and floaty suspensions, and the game allows them to leans as such, the wheels are like they are made of ice and the cars feel lighter than they look. The physical damage on cars is also dissapointing as I was looking up to GTA V and taking cues from older movies where the sheet metal cars would actually tear themselves apart after a collision. Colliding with people also seems like an unfinished feature. I feel the devs would have had a better time if they used Natural Motion as the people are more like lamp posts with animations coming in late. Sometimes the AI driven cars have erratic driving that is pretty annoying to deal with: they would be spinning around in an 'S' shape right in front of me and would clip through other cars until they are right in front of me, where the game engine decides that they should have collision again.  Another point of contention is general gameplay. I'm currently in the stage where I'm running introductory jobs for Cassandra, Vito, and Burke. But all of these characters have had the same type of missions to regain control of their respective territories: go there, bop that guy until the big boss guy gets anfry and shows his face, go back to the same large wardehouse place you bopped one guy to get the big guy, finished. As stated, I haven't finished the main story yet, but I hope the missions are not going to be monogamous for the rest of the crew again.  Tldr; well told story, everything else is sub-par. Get this game on sale or a few years down the line.
11332	The game crashes after 15 minutes of gameplay! â¬49.99 for this â¥â¥â¥â¥? Fix it! Always we as the paying gamers get screwed by devs!!!!
11333	I've played the game for about 1 hour right after downloading it. It ran fine although with 30 FPS locked. However my GTX 960 4GB usage was quite low - about 55-60% - which is expected for 30 frames. So I hoped everything will be just great when developers release 60 FPS and unlimited FPS patch.  Then after an hour smooth ran (in 30 FPS) game crashed and refused to launch again. I tried eveything I could find to resolve the issue but no luck. The only thing that helped me - rolling back Nvidia drivers to previous version, BUT it was running fine on the latest drivers before that crush, WTF?! Now game runs like a crap - not playable at all.  My PC specs - Intel i5-4690k @3.9 Ghz, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 4GB.  I'm very dissapointed. Would not recommend to buy this game...at least now. Also seriously considering to make refund if the patch doesn't come and fix all this within this weekend. Shame on you developers!
11334	Still massivley buggy aadn repetive. Wait for a sale. This game needed another six months before release.

11336	Realy bad This is not what I expected. Trash Also Look this video which game have more detail ?  Mafia 1 vs Mafia 3 !!! LOL   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI 
11337	I was excited to get and play Mafia 3. Watching the live E3 footage and getting the tshirt they handed out to the on hands attendees.

11339	not worth the money. wait until its atleast 50% off then it might be
11340	Mafia 3 is a pile of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥ compared to Mafia 2. I regret spending 60 dollars on this game because all you do is grind, same boring crap over &amp; over !
11341	Worst game ever on my Steam account.
11342	developer believed this is one of the best thier game because they sold 4.5 million copies within first week , fastest in 2k his i'm disappointed with this game and 2k. loop this all game drive , rob , drive , kill , drive  mafia 2 is better
11343	REFUNDED, Poor graphics for a triple A title. Yet again crap consloe port.
11344	After the update the game is improved and there is now a steady FPS and the textures are no longer blurry and grainy. I love the enviroment and the music of the era, it really is nice to see a little something of what the 70's was like in this game. Even though I love everything about the game I still cannot recommend it for the performance, sure the game is now over 30 FPS and is now at a FPS that bounces between 25 to 60 FPS, mostly 40 though. Funny thing is that I am right with the game recommendations that are listed talking about having a GTX 780 or 8GB of RAM. I don't wanna sound like a freak that wants everything looking 100% but, I can't bring myself to play it with the all the FPS issues, makes me really sick to drive at a solid 25 FPS on a 144Hz monitor...
11345	this game is really baddly made. wasted Â£52 on this garbage. constantly crashing utter â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11346	One word : refund. Where can i get refund about this peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥? ??
11347	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game in its current state. It is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest port to PC I have seen since Arkham Knight. Can maybe pull off 40 FPS with my GTX 780 and i7-4790k on low settings. Awful graphics, awful optimization, awful game right now. I am requesting a refund currently. Maybe if they fix the game at some point I'll give it another try but in its current state it is garbage.
11348	Realy bad This is not what I expected. Trash Also Look this video which game have more detail ?  Mafia 1 vs Mafia 3 !!! LOL   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI

11350	FPS lock is horrible. Atmosphere is great but make sure you use motion blur.  Still, i get headaches after 2 hours. Nice job 2K. :p
11351	Do not buy this crap !
11352	I think basically it's a decent game, with questionable graphics and glitches, though. However, it's not the good old Mafia - which I've loved - anymore. So my feelings about it are ambiguous.
11353	This must be a joke right ?? okay it is quite atmospheric and the story could be cool too but the really BAD graphics make it feel like I am playing GTA 3 though ! The overall impression of the textures and the fine details of the city, people etc. is really horrible because it looks totally bad and for me in 2016 with GTA 5 as a rival that is nothing but a damn bad move from 2K. Btw. I am playing in 4K everything on the highest but it looks like driver I on playstation, okay now I am kidding but for real, when I open Mafia II which is over 6 years old I don't see that much difference for real ! I have hoped for much more actually not to mention 30fps lock haha NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL I am ordering a refund right now...
11354	worth..not..30fps...refund
11355	The game keeps crashing on the prologue even though all my drivers are up to date. I even put all the setting on low and this hasn't solved the issue.
11356	The game crashes after 15 minutes of gameplay! â¬49.99 for this â¥â¥â¥â¥? Fix it! Always we as the paying gamers get screwed by devs!!!!
11357	I've played the game for about 1 hour right after downloading it. It ran fine although with 30 FPS locked.

Would not recommend to buy this game...at least now. Also seriously considering to make refund if the patch doesn't come and fix all this within this weekend. Shame on you developers!
11358	bloody fix the bloddy game its almost been one month couldnt even paly the game until now
11359	Since the update, the game has crashed twice within half an hour. It runs poorly on low settings, at 1440p. I have a GTX 970.  A paraplegic would run better than this.
11360	(Spoilers)I just want to start off by telling you i really enjoyed this game when i was able to play it. After 27 hours in game ive experienced a game breaking bug. My story missions refuse to show on the map. After i killed the hitman sal sent after me the game bugged. After i killed him somehow he was still alive along with his goons.....even after the cutscene. The story missions are not showing on the map anymore and i am angry. Ive spent $80 on this game and believe i deserve a refund since i cant get in touch with a human being to help me with this problem. I reccomend this game if you want to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by hanger 13
11361	I was highly looking forward to this game. However upon launching it was clear the developers had never considered ultrawide monitors (at least for the unusable menus) I was able to look past this somewhat big issue. Even the 30fps cap at first wasn't a total deal breaker for me. What really upset me was loosing a good 5 hours of campaign progress TWICE. Apparently there is an autosave after every mission but 2-3 seprate times the game did not save any progress. I made it up to the part where you clear the brothel each time. Randomly died and was reset all the way back to the swamp mission where you bill the hatian leader. ALL OF MY PROGRESS NEVER SAVED and I wasted a good 10 hours of my life. I tried looking for a solution online but nothing helped there was no data for any of my saves in the game files. Nothing to show for all my hours playing. I'm so dissapointed I'm requesting a refund.
11362	I'm so tired of developers making games for the console then ported to PC.  I'm so tired of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Listen to every negative comment here. They are all right.  Wait till this game is on sale that or never buy this game at all.    
11363	Well - this has to be the worst waste of money ever. Since I purchase3d the game in Oct - I still have not been able to play the game. As soon as I click on start- it crashes, back to my desktop.. Somehow it says that I have played 31 hours of the game. I dont know how... I haven't been able to play it at all. Wen I requesteda refund from Steam - the reason they rejected my request was because of the 31 hours played, it was eithor that or the over 14 days since purchased. Neothor work well for me cause I work out of town for 2 weeks at a time. Every time I come back - I hope that there is some kind of patch for this game, but the developers just seem not to care that they are ruining thier reputation. BY FAR WORST GAME EVER...NOT PLAYED...
11364	Great story.. that's about it... this game is terrible..
11365	Not great... boring, story virtually non-existent... keep away from that title.
11366	In short words,this game is a joke.
11367	Do not buy.  Mafia 2 is infinitely better, play that instead.   Even without the bugs, the game is repetitive and contains none of the little details that made Mafia 2 stand out from GTA. Poor graphics quality, upscaled 720p, poor optimisation, 30fps locked at launch. It's obvious that this is the studios first game. On the surface it looks like a compotent GTA clone set in the 60s, but in reality it has little content and nothing to make it stand out. The cars don't feel like â¥â¥â¥â¥, but not a lot of effort was put into their functionality and mechanics.   Reminds me of Watchdogs.
11368	Summary:  All this game is is the same mission a million times over, and then you get to one unique mission, then back to the same repetitive bullcrap until you get to the next unique mission, and the cycle repeats. Those unique missions are fun, just not worth getting to. Not worth $60.  Pros:  -Good Graphics -Good Driving Mechanics -Fun Combat -Top Notch Voice Acting and Motion Capture -Great Soundtrack -Vito Scaletta  Cons:  -WHY IN HELL IS THE CLASSIC TOMMY GUN DLC?!?!? -2k gave a great franchise in the hand of first time developers -Repetitive and boring -Season Pass -Not enough Vito -Lincoln is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Cassandra is annoying -Terrible skybox  Conclusion:  I preordered this game as soon as I was able to being that I am a huge fan of the franchise, owning both Mafia and Mafia II. Mafia II is one of my favorite games of all time, so when I was able to buy this I went full Fry from Futurama and said 'Shut up and take my money!'. Sadly I failed to realize that this was Hangar 13's first game, and as more and more gameplay was released I saw that the game might be repetitve. I didn't care, however, being the massive fanboy that I am and I preordered the deluxe edition. There is no way that this game is worth $60, so it sure as hell ain't worth $80. This game was a massive failure. Do yourself a favor and buy Mafia II. You'll get your money's worth from that masterpiece.
11369	I purchased the game but I can't even start it,because my AMD CPU doesn't support SSE 4.1/4.2. Beware AMD CPU owners,you need FX family CPU to be able to run the game.I'm tired of this PC upgrading 'lifecycle',I'll be buying XBOX ONE S for christmas.
11370	Glitchy glitchy. Terribly unfinished. Looks like a 2008 game. Shame, cause the plot and voiceacting isnt too bad
11371	 Completed game before Reviewing
11372	Don't waste your time...  Almost as disappointing as No Mans Sky... 
11373	Very poor and repetative game play.
11374	1. Locks down my 144Hz monitor to 60Hz when using fullscreen mode. 2. Absolutely unplayable in stereoscopic 3D. 3. No option for using raw mouse input. 4. Default lock at 30Fps.
11375	Well - this has to be the worst waste of money ever. Since I purchase3d the game in Oct - I still have not been able to play the game.

11377	Since the update, the game has crashed twice within half an hour. It runs poorly on low settings, at 1440p. I have a GTX 970.  A paraplegic would run better than this.
11378	(Spoilers)I just want to start off by telling you i really enjoyed this game when i was able to play it. After 27 hours in game ive experienced a game breaking bug. My story missions refuse to show on the map. After i killed the hitman sal sent after me the game bugged. After i killed him somehow he was still alive along with his goons.....even after the cutscene. The story missions are not showing on the map anymore and i am angry. Ive spent $80 on this game and believe i deserve a refund since i cant get in touch with a human being to help me with this problem. I reccomend this game if you want to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by hanger 13
11379	Great story.. that's about it... this game is terrible..
11380	bloody fix the bloddy game its almost been one month couldnt even paly the game until now
11381	Not great... boring, story virtually non-existent... keep away from that title.
11382	Some people would say No Man's Sky is the most disappointing game of the decade, but that would require you to be dumb enough to think a procedurally generated game can ever be something special.   Mafia lll easily takes that title. It could have and should have been great, but ends up being a POS that looks like it came out in 2008 yet still manages to run like trash even on the most powerfull PCs.
11383	Mafia 2 is much better than this game !
11384	not worth it
11385	I guess the game is solid on story but the technical side of the game is poorly exceuted 4k and sli 980s gave 18fps i had to down scale my resolutin few steps to be able to play on that 30 i dont really care about 60fps or what not my self but even if it would support such fps i could not reach it.  Driving feels really clunky i played the game to the bar in the tutorial sections all the models and graphics are subpar out side cutsecens.   I will now request a refound and wait till the game comes out in next years christmass sale or something, just so i can play the story with discount.
11386	TL;DR review  Pro's * Great artstyle * Mature 1960's setting * Shooting and melee combat feels very good * Badass main character * Great animations * Great voice acting  Con's * Cover system is dissapointing * Occasional hard crash * Awful AI * Repetitive gameplay after around 4 hours * Not much customization options * Story only interresting the first 2 to 3 hours * Performance not very good only getting 55 to 60 fps on unlimited framerate on a 980ti As a side note i think fps is locked at 60 even with the unlimited fps setting since 1080 and 980ti have exactly the same performance * The open world feels empty  Basicly i do not think it is worth the money at the moment, only the first few hours are interresting after that it is repetitive open world gameplay with barely any reward.
11387	Mafia 2 is much better than this game !
11388	Got ripped off because thought it was going to be as good as Mafia 2.  Wasted â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 60 dollars now I want a refund
11389	Boring do not buy it first 10 hours is great and then it's sucks.
11390	It started really nice..  The story is very good, the movies and animations are great! BUT:  It's horribly repetitive! It's alway the same pattern: 1. New city part 2. Talk with someone 3. Kill some groups of enemy boss 4. Boss comes out of his hole 5. Kill boss 6. Give control of city to partner 7. Repeat!  There are certain things that are damn annoying! Like: 1. It's not possible to shoot someone next to a tree.. the object hitboxes are catastrophic. They are at least 0.5m bigger than the object!  2. The cover system is horrible. Most time I only try to hide behind a certain object.. but the model has some other opinions..  3. I had to restart the game at least 100 times because of stuck missions (Game doesn't load animations). And other bugs like: after minimizing the game, mouse pointer keeps appearing.  But still.. the worst part in the end is the repetitive storyline..
11391	30 FPS lock is beatuiful , loving it,
11392	Summary:  All this game is is the same mission a million times over, and then you get to one unique mission, then back to the same repetitive bullcrap until you get to the next unique mission, and the cycle repeats.

11393	It's like running a potato on a CPU on a server on a furnace over ketchup and then waiting for new ingredients monthly with lack of resources.
11394	Some people would say No Man's Sky is the most disappointing game of the decade, but that would require you to be dumb enough to think a procedurally generated game can ever be something special.   Mafia lll easily takes that title. It could have and should have been great, but ends up being a POS that looks like it came out in 2008 yet still manages to run like trash even on the most powerfull PCs.
11395	Horrible optimization, will change my review if they fix it.
11396	Repetitive missions.
11397	Watch Dogs 2 came out early, and surprise! It SUCKS!!!!   the ubisoft open world formula is getting real â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worn out.
11398	First: I got my money back! YAY!  To the game:  It's not worth a 1/10, that for it is a too good game.  Of course, I would also like to give it a 1/10, because it didn't fit with my expectations at all, but this game has very nice parts, like the cutscenes and the story.  Now, the problem is that Mafia III should have focus on the story instead of trying to be a 'GTA'. Even if it then was more linear, I think the game would have been better.  Thinks they messed up:  - AI - Gunfights (unrealistic hit feeling) - Driving - Colisions and car damage - Particles - Repetitive gameplay after the story part (it's like AC and Far cry from the principe) - Bugs and crashes (many) - Releasing with 30 FPS lock (yepp, that was a MESS! In 2016 PC Masterrace plays @ 120 Hz)  Good:  + Story + Setting + Gangstahs + Cutscenes + Characters + Storytelling + Motion capturing and facial expressions  This is a solid game, but nothing for a real mafia fan.  I give it a 5 / 10... not more.
11399	I have played Mafia I, Mafia II and i must say, Mafia III is far from being as good as its ancestors.  Not everything is bad though. Probably the storyline, the cutscenes and how the story is assembled is great i think. I really enjoyed it very much.  But the gameplay doesnt cut it. The whole game is soooo repetitive. They tried doing this GTA style, but it visible they dont know how to do it. the missions are all just the same and it becomes just a grind. And that just really kills the game.  To sum it up: as a Movie, great. As a game, trash.    
11400	Worst Mafia EVER - PERIOD. I played the first two mafia titles and I count them very high in my 'Best PC Games ever' list. But this one is just horrible. Repetitve gameplay from the first mission on hard to do any good storytelling with thoose game mechanics. DO NOT BUY!
11401	Nothing like the other Mafia series which was so good. In this third installment instead of climbing the ranks of the Mafia you are instead tearing down the mafia. Its like a really poorly done Godfather game. There is no enjoyment of the freeplay and the story is pretty tacky the entire time.
11402	I guess the game is solid on story but the technical side of the game is poorly exceuted 4k and sli 980s gave 18fps i had to down scale my resolutin few steps to be able to play on that 30 i dont really care about 60fps or what not my self but even if it would support such fps i could not reach it.

11403	TL;DR review  Pro's * Great artstyle * Mature 1960's setting * Shooting and melee combat feels very good * Badass main character * Great animations * Great voice acting  Con's * Cover system is dissapointing * Occasional hard crash * Awful AI * Repetitive gameplay after around 4 hours * Not much customization options * Story only interresting the first 2 to 3 hours * Performance not very good only getting 55 to 60 fps on unlimited framerate on a 980ti As a side note i think fps is locked at 60 even with the unlimited fps setting since 1080 and 980ti have exactly the same performance * The open world feels empty  Basicly i do not think it is worth the money at the moment, only the first few hours are interresting after that it is repetitive open world gameplay with barely any reward.
11404	I just want to try and keep the review short and simple whats right and what's wrong.  Right - Great music Fun new gameplay for Mafia  Voice acting was on point Portrayed the racism from back then maybe it overdid it but gave us an idea how things have changed from then and now Nice array of scenary from the swamps, to lower class living areas to mid class all the way to upper tier mansions etc Killing district bosses satisfying the missions to them are usually done quite well  The bad - Extremely repetitive by this I mean  Taking over districts never change they're always done in the same fashion i.e. Talk to one person this person will tell you a bunch of vague infromation and name the guy you're targetting after that you will get a bunch of side missions which pop up which will be the following Interregotation, freeing prisoners, killing the professionals in their orginisation then finally destroying their goods/contraband After you've done the damage neccessary you will go back to the same person talk to him he tells you some more stuff about where the guy is which will be in a location you've already likely shot up before sooo... back to the same place shoot everyone up and execute the boss, assign to one of the three underbosses Once that has all been completed you do it all over again ONCE more for the same district I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not you do the same thing over again and once you complete it a second time that is when you get to kill district boss. Then once the district boss is dead you fully assign the district to one of the three.  I knew I said I wouldn't make it long but I thought I had to describe that down so people would see how boring it is.  The other bad to the game is - Side missions are like taking over districts they're extremely repetitive as well No real customisation to vehicles No clothe stores instead wear the same thing for the whole playthrough Shops out in the open have no real use they're just there for nothing instead of holding playboy mags etc No complexity to owning districts Graphics are far from impressive Draw distance in the game isn't good Bugs galore all over the place you'll find weird happenings whilst playing Driving is debatable but I dislike it I feel like the car physics is awful and often found myself dreading having to drive which brings me to the next issue No fast travelling instead you have to travel from A to Z all by yourself very time consuming which would explain why the game lasted as long as it did for me Story was quite bland the one priest blabbing away about Lincoln in the present about Lincoln in the past but nobody really cares it jumps from present to past so often and I feel like they hurt their story by not keeping it in the past telling the story the way they did didn't improve anything it just made things confusing and jumped all over the place they could have easily jumped to a final clip of the priest in his present days at the end of the game that would have been the right touch to finish the story off instead of jumping from cutscenes willy nilly.  That;s all I can think of it was a big let down.  5/10 If I was to score it.
11405	I wouldn't reccomand this game at this point in time as there is an FPS lock, The game dosen't support ultra wide screens, map, blood stains, main menu all at 1080 res... 
11406	PROS:  Excellent hook in the beginning storyline Memorable Characters Sound track is amazing I only crashed twice so far    CONS: You never feel accomplished with missions Feeling 'empowered' or leveling up is few and far between Day and night cycle is strange, I have artifacting everywhere AI is the worst I have seen Driving is a chore The best car you can unlock as delivery has this HIGH pitch whine to it. Makes it unbearable with the sound on. Imagine an electronic whine but at a very noticable level Car physics are strange, when you crash you never total. I've flipped the car over 3 times and kept going in my intended direction The physical fighting is an absolute joke, spam one button to win Game feels way too easy, even on hard difficulty and AA turned off You die to random things all the time Having to restart quests at 7 different spots due to bugs City feels empty and everyone looks the same Pedestrians all say the same thing when you pass them. I had 4 guys say the exact same audio file when I passed by Collecting everything around the city is a job All the quests are the same thing after 2 hours of gameplay Skybox is terrible With a Mafia game I was expecting more brutal ways to kill people, not just the same knife stabbing or butt stroking (butt of the gun)  Verdict: Wait for a Steam Sale
11407	GTA: New Bordeaux 5/10
11408	the graphics is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ , so many glitches
11409	SUMMARY After Mafia 2 this game comes after 6 years of difficult development. I must say I am very disapponted. The first 3 hours are really good, but after that you do the same damn stuff for like 30 hours, which gets boring really quick. I enjoyed few facts ( and few moments ) about the game, but it isn't enough for me to reccomend. Also pay attention to the horrible optimalization of the game.  59/100  PROS - really good radio soundtrack - almost all of the characters are well written, as well as the dialogues - the car models look very realistic and nice - I liked the way the cutscenes were made - the game continues the story the same way Mafia 2 continued Mafia's story - just through few details - Lincoln is not as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ generic character as it seemd from trailers  CONS - on my i5 2500 + gtx 970 the game ran at 50 fps at low details when not moving, it dropped to like 35 when driving - despite the how badly the game runs on most of PCs, the graphics look quite ugly and very blury - developers represent Mafia III as a story-based game, but after finishing I must say is has a very generic story and there aren't many plot twists - for about 30 hours you do the absolutly same thing over and over again, which gets boring after 5 hours ( so then you have 25 hours of boring gameplay ) - sometimes the game tries to a tell a serious story about war, racism and gangter families, but then you go and kill about 30 people in 5 minutes and nobody gives much â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it which kills the serious feeling  - quite a lot of physical and visual bugs, crashes aren't rare at all - for some reason you can not save the game ( it only has autosaves ) and you can have only 1 game save at time  TIP If you really want to play it I would definitely reccomend buying after 6+ months ( so the developers fix various technical problems ) and in sale because the game in my opinion is not worth 50 euros.
11410	The new aspect of the game (taking rackets and making money that way) nowhere near makes up for its unappealing story and lack of diversity. I expected so much more from the game, seeing as you would now be your own boss but it fell flat. The game is worth 30â¬ in my opinion and I would not recommend that you get it for anything above that.
11411	not worth it
11412	the pc port is horrible
11413	The Game Is Crashing on Startup.
11414	I like to consider myself an open world enthusiast. To me a good open world game should have concise and meaningful missions one after the other, with the occasional batch of side missions or a bunch of side activites to do when you don't feel like playing the story. This game however feels the need to make the player grind several repetitive missions before you get to the good story bits. Don't get me wrong, the way Hangar 13 did the story is amazing. I think the voice acting is great and the in game graphics during cutscenes are just awesome. But get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ outta here if you expect me to destroy this, interrogate that, kill him a million â¥â¥â¥â¥ing times BEFORE I get to enjoy your narrative.  Gameplay is fun but we need more mission variety! Also there's literally no customization of cars or your clothes. MAFIA 2 HAD THAT WTF. We need more things other than guns to spend money on. Not done with the game yet. There are things that will keep you in, such as the playboy magazines and especially the story. I'll keep playing, but whoever is thinking about buying it now: Don't. Wait until we see what the 'season pass' has to offer first. They may add â¥â¥â¥â¥ that will make this game worth it.
11415	  game craching what the â¥â¥â¥ screen freez
11416	I have to say i'm dissapointed to this game. The game is unfinished. The streets are very similiar almost anywhere you go. The game doesn't run well even with my geforce 1070 and it just lacks the feeling which I had in Mafia 2. Missions are also repetitive and it gets boring real quick. I had big hopes for this game and I bought it too fast, should have waited to see what others think and I must say, game that comes in 2016 shouldn't have this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking graphics. Don't buy this game, play mafia 2 instead. It is a masterpiece and it works.
11417	I got a refund, and you should to.  Low res texture, upscaled 720p, 30fps cap, choppy animations, bad AI, bland modern UI that is ugly, generic gameplay, repetitive missions...  This game is a sad excuse for a triple A release in 2016. Only good thing about it are the cutscenes and excellent story/setting, with its top-notch voice acting. However, you might as well just watch Goodfellas or The Godfather movie instead of wasting $60 on this crap.
11418	I can't personally recommend this game I played for about 5 hours and I'm hoping i get a refund
11419	The most pisspoor excuse for a Mafia game, I absolutely loved Mafia I and II, but this is horrendous, barely even a Mafia game.  -Average story (which is generic and predictable) -Looks and runs horrible/y -No customization -No interactability with the world -Repetitive missions  The only thing that saves it is the shooting and music.  Buy this game on sale. However for Mafia fans, this is an embarrasment to the series
11420	Another game where the developer give no â¥â¥â¥â¥s for PC players and doesn't optimise their â¥â¥â¥â¥. Trash Graphics, Trash Framerate, Trash AI. Good Story though so far.
11421	While initially entertaining, it quickly becomes a rinse and repeat of go here, stab/shoot these guys and install someone else to run â¥â¥â¥â¥ and pay you a paltry sum. Waste of money. Good music though...
11422	dumb ai locked 30fps crashed during play bad shoting performance and object destroy calculate compared with Mafia II bad optimize ui design ruin this game i even dont know what does game want to express through ui. maybe the guys from ubi soft in this design group have been influenced by their former company. anyway, i choose to refund!!
11423	Make it playable then maybe I'll finish it.
11424	  I cant get it to launch, ive spend hours trying to make it work, â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME
11425	Alright, i've spent little over 7hrs on Mafia III now, and well it took that long for the fanboy in me to go F*** this c*** I've loved the Mafia franchise since the first (well apart from the racing in Mafia 1) but this i can't go along with.  So i wanna start with the good things, because there are some. The story and the way it's told is good. driving mechanics are fairly good (although the render distance with F*** you over a few times) City is a good size (gotta consider the small successes)  And then the bad things. I know not alot of good. Game is/was locked at 30FPS (Console port, FFS) Upscaled 720p textures, but you'd never know, because they are so frggin blurred out. It's comical and sad at the same time.  Render distance is a joke.  Keymapping is a mess, 'E' to open a door, 'F' to enter a car. why not have 'F' or 'E' do it for both?!  The AI, ehm yeah. Walked up to a guard in a hostile zone he spots me, i duck behind cover and just wait for him to come to me, and i do a takedown and all is good. I'm in a hostile zone, meaning restricted area, shoot on sight and that Sh**. oh on the note of AI, the police is worse than the gangsters/mobsters. Civilian just called in the police, i'm making ready for a stand off, police arrives and just sits in the patrol car doesn't shoot or get out.  Mafia III in it's current state, worth 10Euro (maybe) Don't waste your money wait for them to fix their Sh**
11426	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I really wanted to like this game but it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boring. All the missions are the same and that's not an exageration. You will encounter glitches that can force you to restart the game all over again and it will exit itself out. After 18 hours I finally gave up and just looked up the ending.
11427	Awful PC port. Pretty sure they never even tested the game on PC before they released it. Even after they unlocked the 30 fps lock and allowed up to 60 fps or more I'm getting 52 fps in the game menu... the GAME MENU. I have a 980ti and i7-6700k 4.0ghz and I can run Witcher 3 on max graphics in 1440p at 60 fps. Also, the graphics have been downgraded from what they were showing in 2015. Do not reward these developers by buying this game.
11428	This is not mafia. That's all I can say. This is probably the biggest dissapointment of the year
11429	this game has still performance issues despite the update that is 5.8 gb. If this game's name was not mafia 3, 2k suffered a loss. People bought it because the early games of mafia series was brilliant. I will not trust 2k any more because of the mistakes that they have done in mafia 3. If you say that I have a significant gaming computer, there will be another problem for you while you play the game. MAFIA 3's performance repeats itself when you do some quests. AI is bad. Not terrible but still bad. AI can be fixed. I still play the mafia 3 although it has some problems. Because I love gangster's stories even though the story is not based by true events.   Finally; if you are obsessed about performences, I do not recommend you to buy it. If you love the gangsters, you might buy it. Have a nice day gamers....
11430	Pretty boring stale game, always 'kill certain amount/collect certain amount and advance to the mini boss, then repeat' sigh
11431	Crashes within 30 minutes, feels slow because of 30fps. Update is needed badly!
11432	Dude, The game optimization is a joke My PC: i5 6600k with OC  gtx 1080 8 gb of RAM  Mobo : gigabyte gaming 7  AND I can't play this game over 60 fps in 1080p in low setting ? W-T-F
11433	First: I got my money back! YAY!  To the game:  It's not worth a 1/10, that for it is a too good game.  Of course, I would also like to give it a 1/10, because it didn't fit with my expectations at all, but this game has very nice parts, like the cutscenes and the story.  Now, the problem is that Mafia III should have focus on the story instead of trying to be a 'GTA'. Even if it then was more linear, I think the game would have been better.  Thinks they messed up:  - AI - Gunfights (unrealistic hit feeling) - Driving - Colisions and car damage - Particles - Repetitive gameplay after the story part (it's like AC and Far cry from the principe) - Bugs and crashes (many) - Releasing with 30 FPS lock (yepp, that was a MESS! In 2016 PC Masterrace plays @ 120 Hz)  Good:  + Story + Setting + Gangstahs + Cutscenes + Characters + Storytelling + Motion capturing and facial expressions  This is a solid game, but nothing for a real mafia fan.  I give it a 5 / 10... not more.
11434	I have played Mafia I, Mafia II and i must say, Mafia III is far from being as good as its ancestors.  Not everything is bad though. Probably the storyline, the cutscenes and how the story is assembled is great i think. I really enjoyed it very much.  But the gameplay doesnt cut it. The whole game is soooo repetitive. They tried doing this GTA style, but it visible they dont know how to do it. the missions are all just the same and it becomes just a grind. And that just really kills the game.  To sum it up: as a Movie, great. As a game, trash.    
11435	Worst Mafia EVER - PERIOD. I played the first two mafia titles and I count them very high in my 'Best PC Games ever' list. But this one is just horrible. Repetitve gameplay from the first mission on hard to do any good storytelling with thoose game mechanics. DO NOT BUY!
11436	Nothing like the other Mafia series which was so good. In this third installment instead of climbing the ranks of the Mafia you are instead tearing down the mafia. Its like a really poorly done Godfather game. There is no enjoyment of the freeplay and the story is pretty tacky the entire time.
11437	Im not even complaining about the Graphics, i think they are okay...I think the jagged lines on the edge of everything is okay. I can play and enjoy a game with them.....However when an npc is 5 feet away and his face looks like two eyes and some hair is all i can see you know there is a problem....The game is way toooo blurry....It makes me sick playing....The blurryness is more of a problem than the 30fps issue. They say they are going to patch the fps...we will see... however i think the blurryness is an issue they need to address as well.....Food for thought i guess huh.....
11438	i would say no for right now, i would not mind the 30 fps cap since they did say they would update it later. the problem is i run this game at all max settings at 1440p resolution and the game has horrible blurry textures. not even when im high on weed it lets me enjoy the game with this type or resolution. its like they just ported console textures to pc for a place holder until the patch comes. until a mod or patch with hd textures come out i cant really recommend it. it looks like a game that was released for ps3 right now. this review will change if they fix this issue
11439	I played about 40min of this game and I couldn't get past how unoptimized the game was(got a refund), got 30fps with a GTX 970.. Just another console game with a terrible PC port
11440	Graphics are shocking, driving is like an arcade game. And there's no damage physics when you crash you car, it's fine. Or the graphics are that bad I can't notice. Doesn't look anything like the past Mafia games.  A complete shambles, worst PC port I've ever played.   I thought companies went forwards with new games, not three steps backwards. Doubt I'll buy another game in the Mafia franchise.
11441	Really dissapointing pre ordering and after release tell everyone the fps is capped. textures and graphics are pretty average/ blurry.  I am currently enjoying the story but would not recommend buying this game in its currnt state, feels like a really bad console port
11442	So this is what betrayal feels like... 1/10 would want to be betrayed again.   *Paint it black playing on the background*
11443	I liked Mafia II more... much, much more...   *Starting to realize that at least 99.9% of all these new AAA games are all going to suck assssssssss... RIP my video game hobby*
11444	Horrible graphics. Bloom loaded Vaseline basically. Makes your eyes bleed.
11445	This game had so much potential but sadly it just misses that special touch. Graphics are pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, the game is poorly optimized and the missions aren't really that meaningful. I mean it does have story in it, but they streched it out too much.
11446	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET, WAIT FOR A PATCH  Horrible PC port, Locked at 30 FPS, low res textures in places, Visually It's not what you'd expect from a Triple A title in 2016, Overall gameplay feels clunky, The shooting mechanics are poor and feel incredibly inacurate from mid to long range due to a reticule that doesn't focus to a fixed point, The standard driving controls make the car feel as though It's floating on the road (However It's much better if you switch to simulation mode in the options) The game has a fantastic sound track and the cutscenes for the most part are quite good HOWEVER the cutscenes are so long and there's so many of them that you spend more time watching the game than actually playing it. Just as the story started to get really interesting I encountered a loading screen that I couldn't get past, I left it loading for 15 minutes and nothing, At that point I decided it was time to try for a refund.  Pros - Interesting Story - Great Soundtrack - Some of the cutscenes are well done - Good Voice Acting - The Driving Controls Are Better In 'Simulation Mode'  Cons - Ugly low res textures in many places on max graphics - Locked at 30FPS - No Windowed Borderless - Horrible Shooting Mechanics - Default Driving Controls Are Unrealistic And 'Floaty'  - Cutscenes are way too long and there's too many of them - Game Crashes Frequently  My system specs - Nvidia 980TI GPU - Intel i7 4790k 4.7Ghz - 32GB Ram - Windows 10 (Can run most games 60fps max settings no issues)
11447	+ Good story, great voice actors + Cool music  - Very linear - Extremely repetitive, most of the game you do the same four things over and over - Driving feels very arcade-y, and cars don't even deform when you crash - Some cars are impossible to drive, because they bug up and start bouncing - The AI is competely oblivious, making you practically invisible when sneaking - The AI also has no idea how to drive - Buggy, glitchy, poor performance - Everything that was good about Mafia 2 was taken out - For some reason you unlock the ability to steal cars silently -after- you get the ability to just order a better car to be delivered, free of charge - No customization - The map is huge, but mostly empty
11448	Mafia III is an exercise in tedium.  The first couple of hours are decent, then the story grinds to a halt as the player is tasked with taking over different rackets and districts of the city. This makes up the large majority of the game, and involves you driving between repetitive, filler-tier activities that take less time to complete than it does to drive over to them.  It's a shame, because the handful of properly-designed missions that are in the game are fairly decent. The combat is pretty slick, the enemies have good hit reactions to gunfire, and the gunfights can be quite fast-paced with the mouse and keyboard controls. Most of the gunfights in the game will last about thirty seconds to a minute though, considering the repetitive racket-takeover missions make up most of the time.  The game has a fair number of bugs, too. A few times I'd have to restart missions from a checkpoint because it bugged out and I couldn't progress. If you shoot and kill an enemy near a railing, they'll play an animation where they fall over the railing, but they'd often freeze at the point where the canned animation was supposed to transition to ragdoll physics, so they'd end up suspended in mid-air. If you have police chasing you and you call in the favour to get rid of the cops, they'll literally disappear right in front of you.  The optimisation is an issue, also. In my experience, they actually fixed the game up and had it running quite well through post-launch patches, but with the latest update (the one that introduces racing and car customisation), they seem to have reverted all of these optimisations and the game runs like crap again. You can't roll-back to previous builds through Steam either, so the only way to play the game with good performance now is to download a cracked version of the last build, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Overall, on the plus side - the game has a nice soundtrack and world; decent characters and acting; and good combat. On the other hand, there are only a few good missions hidden amongst 30 - 40 hours of absolute tedium; there are bugs; and the latest build screwed up the performance.  Would only recommend this if you can get it super cheap, and you're willing to accept the risk of possibly slipping in to a coma from mind-numbingly boring missions.
11449	Do not buy this game. Story is good cutscreen and a comabt is nice but the FPS is horrible. Game will crash down every time you play (PC).
11450	Tried to swim onto the riverbank, got stuck on an invisible wall.  This game is poorly made, and an insult to the Mafia line. I would not recommend you spend your money on this game. This is one of those games that you want to play but it's not worth the money. Mafia II was an incredible game, and anyone who has played that would obviously have high hopes for this.   Wait for a BIG sale for this game, or pirate it, because it's not worth anything more than $30.
11451	I really dislike this kind of console ports. Every game mechanic just screams: 'CONSOLE!' and it never feels like a real PC game. Additionally they changed the control settings with a patch. Absolutely unprofessional. And as some other reviewers already stated this game is more like a GTA clone but has nothing to do with a Mafia game.
11452	As of right now the game doesn't run; even after restarting Steam 3 times which is the protocol for other games that have issue starting...  Windows 10 x64 with all minimum specs surpassed, and some recommended met or surpassed.
11453	Worst game i played this year ( worse than no man's sky ), 99% features of mafia 2 is not exist , mafia 2 looks better in all ways, you can look at some youtube comparison videos, just a terrible return of mafia franchise, hope Hangar 13 not be working on next mafia game. 5/10 p.s and i will do not say about graphics and perfomance, because they are also insanely bad.
11454	Crappy port with outdated graphics and repetative missions.. Good story tho
11455	0.2 hours.... So i saw some reviews that said its ok but no its not. 1. the framerate is potato (i have an gtx 970) 2. I run on 1080p and looked like 900p 3. Just an awful port  So..... dont buy this game!
11456	side missions are the main missions
11457	This game is trash, only bought it because i wanted to know what happened after Mafia 2, and i didn't get any closure on that either smh.
11458	Holy **** this runs badly it's Arkham Knight all over again.
11459	This game sucks... mafia 1 and 2 was much better. the soundtrack it's amazing and the history it's ok but the gameplay has a lot o bugs and is very repetitive. Such a shame. 
11460	Holy **** this runs badly it's Arkham Knight all over again.
11461	This game sucks... mafia 1 and 2 was much better. the soundtrack it's amazing and the history it's ok but the gameplay has a lot o bugs and is very repetitive. Such a shame. 
11462	I have now completed the game and overall it was alright. It could have actually be great if developers made more focus on the main quest line and would bother to polish the PC port.  Lows: - You need to complete majority of side missions to progress with the story. - No hesists or robberies, just kill-kill-kill. - All side missions are nearly identical: confront (kill or interrogate) someone or destroy stuff. - You get good weapons way too early in the game, meaning you stick with them to the end. - Lock breaking mechanism is overly simplified. - Cannot skip pre-racket dialogues. - Cannot modify cars. - Police does not care of you speeding. - It rains way too often. - Night and day cycle is poorly performed - dawns and sunsets nearly blind you. - I have not experienced any crashes or major bugs, bu there were plenty of small lags for the game of this level. - Same price as GTA-5... that is about as much they have in common.   Highs: + You can actually play stealthy or go full Rembo in most of the missions. + Stealth gameplay is interesting, but nothing even remotely close to Hitman series. + Main story missions (once they get unlocked) are exciting and fun. + Good game if you want to have a casual session. + Main characters are thought through. + Music selection is good. + Cut scene visuals are good - characters actually use their facial muscles. + Clear ending: you are not left wondering of what happens next.
11463	I would love to actually be able to play this game.  Sitting with a GTX 970 + i5 6500 and can't reach 60 FPS on Medium settings.   Yet, I can play Dishonored 2 perfectly fine, Battlefield 1 perfectly fine. I'd love to be able to play it if it works, as I loved the 2nd Mafia.
11464	*Game Start *Colored man gets betrayed by white southerner.. *Colored man gets revenge by murdering half of the southern mafia..  *Colored man kills person who betrayed him. *Game End  That's about it.. :| Game is bland, dosn't stand out too well as 'Edgy' or 'Great' Adding outfits to the game now is just a way to get more people in but the damage is done that a 'So-So' game was made with yet another fail YouTube Hype campagin.. You can pretty much just do everything with a silenced weapon and knife and get away with everything perfectly. Wish I can get a refund for believing yet another hype product.. God I feel dumb, don't make the same mistake I did.
11465	I was excited to buy this game because I absolutely loved Mafia 2. I was somewhat dissapointed that Mafia 3 did not meet the standard of it's predecessor.   Here are a few things that I liked and disliked.   Liked: - The game is enjoyable to play (if you do not compare it to Mafia 2)  - The physics in this game are alright and the shooting part is quite good.   Disliked: - It didn't meet the Mafia 2 standard.  - General interaction with people is louzy - The missions do not vary and repeat themself - No rich backstory - Cops basically ignore everything - Too easy - District conquering system the same as Saints Row - Main character is missing a personality - I didn't see the mafia part - You can't use stores but only rob them - Can't switch clothing or upgrade your weapon much  In a nutshell, this game dissapointed me massivly.  I wouldn't recommend it.  
11466	Boring as hell, dumb AI, weird animations, stupid enemies. All missions looks like the same Worst Mafia of all
11467	great start to the game, but went downhill really quickly. taking out enemies involves the same set of moves (distract and then stab) and all sub-bosses so far are virtually the same. Didn't bother to complete the game it got so boring. shame really.
11468	If you want a modern, scaled down version The Godfather ('06) filled to the rim with bugs, very mentally challenged npc's and a single mission on repeat. Then this game is for you!  Speaking of npc's, 'Patroling' cops, aka the 5 cops that are not stationary by the precinct are the worst of them all, they will literally only react if you point a gun at their face, or if you trigger a witness. So feel free to drive at 120mph on the sidewalk right past them, you got nothing to lose.  Also the 'attempt' to create an intriguing story is laughable.  The best part of the game is the soundtrack, shame that it feels like they only have 10 different songs altogether over the 3 stations.
11469	30 fps and 2012 graphics.
11470	won't start after the most recent patch, i even reinstalled it. still doen't work.. the game is pretty good apart from the glitches.. story is great same as the songs on the radio. the problem is that when you finised the story, there is not a lot to any more in the world. and i know it is not GTA but man i hope there will be a lot more to do in the future..

11473	First of all I'am big Mafia I and II fan but this is the worst game I've played in years !!!! It's a SHAME !
11474	  Worst game released this year (DAT LUK GUD) wont recommend it to nobody..............  Im lucky i got it from when i bought my 1070
11475	This game had the potential to be great, and they failed. Don't get me wrong it is a good game but it is not worth 60 bucks its probably worth half of that. If the devs continue to support the game and add some small things to it, it could become ten times better just with customization or other systems in the game that require your attention. Without those small personality things the game feels super repetative. Even thought GTA 5 is repetative you would have a mission where something unique happens, and that just isnt the case here. The soundtrack is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing AWESOME though. Its essentially a gang killing simulator.   6/10
11476	In short: Just poorly made mix of GTA+Far Cry with almost identical side missions, boring repetative gameplay and without a single remarkable charismatic character.
11477	booring games ever, save your money dude.. !!
11478	Same complaint as with the first Assassin's Creed game, excellent concept ruined with the same mission over and over, it's repetetive and after driving clear across the map for the 20th time for a mission you've completed 39 times it gets boring pretty fast. Cover based shooting too easy, stealth assassinations too easy. Might be worth buying on sale for the story.
11479	 Verdict: You're having a laugh-ia III.   Just another open world check list objective game. Play for 2 hours and you'll realize the next forty or so will just be the same. -Interrogate someone then go to objective A and destroy/take/beat someone -Repeat on objective B -Kill a boss  Performance - I'm getting about 60-80 FPS with everything maxed. That's on a GTX1080 and i7 4790k 16GB RAM. The game is visually pretty bland, the textures aren't very detailed and there's a blurry quality to the whole game. For my playtime the lighting was broken and outside scenes would slightly lighten and darken at random. GTAV looked a lot better and ran better too, this game needs some patchwork before it's recommended.
11480	If this game came out under a different title i would recommend it. The fact that its so far away from even being close to the mafia 3 we all wanted it to be is what ruins it.  If you purchase this game not wanting a mafia game, but something totally different, then its a pretty decent game.   7/10 for overall rating 0/10 for mafia rating   RIP mafia series
11481	Wow. was really excited to play this game...until i played it. It has repetative tasks, its as if there are only 5 major jobs to do throughout the whole game with story missions here and there. AI is terrible, Story was just O.K... I would save your money and not buy this garbage. Super let down by all the hype. Stay away, not worth it.
11482	maybe good if thay finsh it  it is like 50% of a game
11483	Game doesn't run good even though my computer is over reccomended specs, game crash after 20 minutes, graphics aren't good for a 2016 game, FPS lock shouldn't be there in 2016. I want a performance patch ASAP 2K or I'm refunding just like everybody else
11484	Though story is good, there are way to many bugs and game feels really, really unfinished. Missions are also very repetitive. Would only by on a sale.
11485	How to know if you'll like this game:  1. Do you like repeating the same stuff 150+ times? 2. Do you appreciating the art of gaming?  If you chose option 1 you'll enjoy it. If you chose option 2 then good. Because this game is a repetitive pile of crap.
11486	Very blurry graphics. I have it maxed out with gtx 1080. Low framerate. Done buy until fixed.
11487	Not sure what to say, bit frustrated as it's crashed 3 times and lost my saves so have to go back to last mission - ok when it happens once, but 3 times is not fun.  Other than that the game seems good, nice graphics and sounds, the AI is a bit crap at times and when you have many enemies, thery showe up then they dont (when you do the scan mode)   I cannot recommend this game at the moment which is a shame as Mafia II was excellent :/   If they fix the crashes and AI then I will change my rating!  This feels like it was rushed out (like so many games these days)  A few days later and it's still crashing guys, and there is so many little bugs - see my screenshots - I have done many missions but the final objective is missing, its happened 3 times now  I have now asjed for help from 2K as the game shows things like objectives that are not yet ready to do, but the wording is still in the game, so you spend time looking for the object.  2K have responded and their reply is its my computers fault, and it maybe down to DirectX etc - laughable and useless reply!   I am still enjoying playing and the game is good, its just frustrating with the amount of bugs.  The music makes the game worth playing tbh, its got a great soundtrack on a few radio sdtations :)
11488	My computer runs all new games just fine, but this game (tried different graphics settings) comes with ridiculous mini-stutters while driving. This really kills the experience. I am hoping for a patch to solve this ... but no dev should release a game in such a state.
11489	I should have thrown my money out into the street. I would have gotten better satisfaction. Three times I started this game and three times it has crashed. The third time it started from the beginning. What is going on? This is no joke. People work hard for their money and deserve a better product.   The game is working well after the patch. Not finished yet but so far going good. Enjoying it   I just finished the boxing mission and the game crashed. I reset it and it crashed again it the same spot. Unbelievable
11490	Oh boy Mafia 3 is coming out im so excited it will be so good, trailers look good, first gameplays look amazing, AAA game what could go wrong. Well â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is the most repetitive boring game I have ever played. We play the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission from beginning to end in slightly new or sometimes even the same places. It is just not fun, the games only savior is the cutscenes and story which is awesome until your twenty hours in and realize why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am i still playing. All i want is the story to be over so i can stop playing. Another fun point is the shooting and sometimes the graphics. They look good and killing is awesome. But it is just so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring i cant explain this to you anymore it is just sooooo â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring, the only time i would recomend buying this kill simulator is for 15 dollars, that is when it isnt on sale. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you hanger 13 and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 2k for ruining one of my favorite franchises.
11491	Pre-ordered it. I couldn't lunch it at the beginning and they said that they was gonna release an update to fix the issue. Have waited for over two months and they haven't fixed it yet.
11492	The game crashed within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, which is horrible for a AAA game like this, it should not have happened in the first place, not to mention that the game lock the frame rate at 30 fps, I thought game developers are well-acknowleged that they shouldn't lock fps on the pc, this happened in the past as well and act like this pisses a lot of people off. Finally the control is all over the place(I play the game with controller for better experience since mouse and keyboard on this game is horrible), the button placement is not optimized for most people and it takes a long time to get use to. 6/10. Expected more from a game hyped for so long, gotta not recommend this game until everything get patched.

Not finished yet but so far going good. Enjoying it   I just finished the boxing mission and the game crashed. I reset it and it crashed again it the same spot. Unbelievable
11494	I don't reccomend this game at all and here's why:    The first two hours of the game is basically a tutorial teaching you how it works and the first full mission, so by the time you realize you don't want the game anymore it's too late to get a refund    If you like the first full mission then your gonna like this game just as much because the whole thing is a copy and paste of that mission    There's nothing extra like changing clothes, haircut, etc. so you can't do anything other than copy paste missions    I couldn't continue playing because I had to see what else there is to the game so after doing some research I found that it's the same thing 36 times (thanks to angry joe doing the math)    Even if there weren't the uncountable amount of bugs in this game it still doesn't feel finished     Even bigger of a disappointment than watch dogs because at least watch dogs had some variety in the things you can do and at the least different colored outfits    There is absolutely nothing other than guns and ammo to spend your money on, making money almost worthless since there isn't anything actually cool to buy    But you don't actually even have to buy weapons as every mission I have played has been beat using weapons I find on the ground  I'm â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I'm unable to get a refund because by the time I realized that this game was â¥â¥â¥â¥ and actually hurts to play through because of how repetetive it gets, it was already 9 hours because like I said earlier the first two hours isn't an accurate representation of how the game really is. I had more fun in the tutorial than in the real game, but even looking past the dullness of this game you still get a buggy, unfinished, early access game. The positives of this game are that:    It looks pretty good    The first mission is strong    The story was good (until you start getting tired of the game and feel no motivation to continue)  I honestly can't think of any other positives that I would include in this game. EDIT: I ALSO HAVE NO BIAS AS I HAVE NEVER PLAYED PREVIOUS MAFIA GAMES
11495	Muddy texures at max settings and 30fps cap. Good gameplay but I can't stomache the performance issues will wait until they fix it.... if they do.
11496	i just brought this and for some god reason its crashing everytime when im starting up. wow game well played.
11497	Repetative game, lush world with good story and cutscenes, but mundane action and little else.  Missed opertunity to use the open world they created in a more filling way.  An avarage game wait for patches and content pick up on sale.
11498	60's Vehicle driving simulator   In all honesty though, The game is really poor. It starts great with an interesting story and mission. Once you get to a certain point and have to conquer districts you will see yourself going round in circles for the next 20 hours. Without a great storyline which I've been used to in the last Mafia games.  Would rate it 3 out of 10

11503	Same mission over and over :( Mafia 2 was my favourite game... It was gripping the whole way through. Tbh, I'm bored of this already, and seeing as I know how it ends, I can't even be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to finish it
11504	I was so hyped for this game but playing it all it seems to do is stutter. This is game breaking.
11505	  got this game for free with my motherboard, I played it for 2 hours, feel like I wasted my time, the game is pretty bad, the story is decent, but to get to the story missions you need to play this substandart game, so watch on youtube cutscene movie, dont buy the game, just saved u like 20-25 bucks, you should say thank you. the controls are weird and uncomfortable and you will find your self scracthing your head searching for the right key. the graphics are also kinda weird as the game loads so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ you dont need that a gtx 1070 has hard time with this on 1080p. the only good thing about this game is the story litterally, just dont buy this game, watch youtube cutscene movie plz. I got this game for free and I feel like I got robbed.
11506	The game is locked on 30 FPS, fix it fast.
11507	  If you enjoy repeating the same missions through the entire game, then this is for you. You are going to be literally repeating the same mission until the end, this is not a joke
11508	Mafia IIIâ¦where to beginâ¦  Letâs begin with Mafia and Mafia IIâ¦both great games.   Mafia was a masterpiece of storytelling and world creationâ¦atmosphere and player involvement. It was different. It was Mafia!  Mafia II was pretty darned goodâ¦hard to follow such a striking first game but did pretty well IMO; equally good story telling, characters and setting. Thoroughly enjoyable and immersive! Who can forget driving a drunken Joe and Eddie home from burying a corpse with Dean singing Return to Me on the radio and everyone singing along!  If I had a complaint with Mafia II it was that such a great world was pretty sterile off the beaten trackâ¦could have done with more to doâ¦more interactionâ¦more hidden missions if you entered a shop or abandoned buildingâ¦just a bit more imagination in creating a bit more non linear entertainment. Lots of people commented this.   So!... easy peasy lemon squeezy right? Mafia 3â¦ you set it in Vegas in the 60s or something like thatâ¦continue the great Mafia themeâ¦ the guns, the fast cars, the loose women, the story driven immersive gameplay and add a bit more non-linear content a bit more exploration. You maintain the car customization, the choice of clothesâ¦the musicâ¦ you addâ¦.you add a bit moreâ¦you make a classicâ¦  Well, noâ¦you hand the franchise off and say âkill it!â  The devs cut all the customizationâ¦all the clothesâ¦any hope of exploration. You create a huge sterile world and fill it withâ¦dun dun dun! A quest for fuses! You cut the Mafia down to supporting actorâ¦you make the starâ¦ racism!â¦yeah! Political correctness front and bloody centreâ¦YAWN! If I see one more review praising this dirge for âtackling issuesâ Iâm gonna puke. It doesnât even work at doing this by the way. The eponymous hero of our PC tale is only half AA and runs around being handled by a white guy and ends up well entrenched in just the sort of stereotypical lifestyle that youâd have aspirations to avoid coming from a minority background.  The point is you donât make a Mafia game about something other than the Mafia! Itâs not bigâ¦itâs not clever itâs not surprisingâ¦itâs just pants!  No real story telling here eitherâ¦Cut scenes are not story telling! Cut scenes are not a substitute for gameplay! If it needs narration then it has failed to tell the story...this is true of all cinema and all gameplay. In Mafia and Mafia IIâ¦you were the storyâ¦you were the evolutionâ¦you lived it you played it. Here you watch the story as itâs handed out to you and then you play the gapsâ¦terrible!  OMG! The repetition! I have finished the game and I can honestly say itâs 50 hours of rinse and repeat the same couple of missions over and over and over and over andâ¦  Even the Playboy collection is repeated in good part from Mafia IIâ¦the same girls!! Did they think we wouldnât notice?!!  Graphics are hardly better than Mafia II!â¦textures are from ages past. Iâm a firm believer in story first and graphics later. I could forgive the view in the rear view mirror if I was living the Mafia lifeâ¦but it just appals when you arenâtâ¦   I wonât even go near the 30fps cap at launchâ¦I canâtâ¦ I choke up and want to eviscerate my console buying friendsâ¦  Couple of patches later and things have improved somewhatâ¦but even a Titan X (Maxwell) clocked at 1400MHz just runs 60fps at 1440p max settingsâ¦.could this be the new Crysisâ¦just without the visuals or story?  In summaryâ¦this would have been a good 20 hour game if it was called âbored on the bayouâ.  Good points?...I guess the music is still good and some of the gunplay reminds you of Mafia.  Who does this to a game? How does this happen? Itâs so obvious how this should have moved forward itâs hard not to wonder at the mental acuity of Hangar 13 or the lack of s**ts given at 2K over the legacy of the first two chapters of this seriesâ¦  *Sigh*  Buy on sale when itâs seriously fallen in priceâ¦
11509	Very very poor performing game! I am so sick of AAA titles being reliesed in this sort of state. I had waited for the patch so that I could run at a more acceptable frame rate nut now I cant even get 15fps!!  I am running on a GTX 970 SLI configuration and have tried disabling one of the cards but no difference.  I was so looking forward to this game but now....its not worth the hard drive space!   Gutted.  I purchased Mafia 3 via a steam code purchased from a store. This means I cannot get a refund!  
11510	This game is grabage! This isn't even a video game, its a movie! Ten minutes of cut-scenes, followed by 2 minutes of gameplay, rinse and repeat. I have played... Watched this game/movie for 1.2 hours now and I have spend the better hour watching cut-scenes and 20 mins playing the game.   The story is also terrible! It starts of with loads of people talking about this guy linkin clay, then after 15 minutes of cut-scenes, I am then suddenly driving a truck to a bank. I am then robbing the bank then suddenly, I'm driving a guy to a bar to get drunk, I then wake up, feed the homeless, then I'm shooting poor people who live in a swamp. Seriously, this game jumps from one scene to another, like a 12 year old child who has A.D.D. The rest of them clearly seperates black people from white people, it tries to make a statment that white people are evil. Yet all I see in the game is black people commiting crime in a white suburban area, black people killing people of all colours and nationalities, but somehow white people are bad because they use the 'N' word, even though black people are murdering and killing countless people. Double standard, social justice warrior crap to the MAX!  Gamplay is bad. 30 FPS is horrible, its like a blurry GTA game, were your car feels like a supercharged hotrod, with the stopping power of a mac truck hauling a ton of goods. The AI is also bad. In some instances the AI won't respond even when they spot you, while at other times they will spot you through a wall. The rest of the game is very blurry over all and very hard to see where you are going unless its night time.   I wouldn't buy this trash heep of a game. Its that one in the series that destoryed the rest of the series, like what Terminator 3 did to T1 and T2. Save your money, forget this game.
11511	cant even run the game.crashes right after the game shows hanger 13 logo.  this is unexeptable in 2016. should have cancelled my preorder. gonna try to get a refund from my retailer.
11512	Has massive Audio issues when it comes to soundblaster cards. Annoying crackle like spark sound once every seck- 2 seck's Very annoying and ruins entire game feel.   This game should go back to testing before market for sure. SOOO many issues in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is totaly not worth the money. Download and enjoy the story there instead. they screwd ppl over in this mafia game.
11513	Locked at 30fps. Graphics and textures WELL BELOW PAR for 2016. Just look at a wall or the floor in the game. Compare to Witcher 3, GTA V etc...awful.   Feels stuttery.  Good: Shooting decent, driving fun, story excellent and pacing good.   Can't recommend due to technical issues.
11514	!!!SOME MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!  Well, this is how it starts: Lincoln Clay returns from Vietnam, gets back to his family. He helps his father (not real one) to deal with his problems, kills some Haitians, robs a bank for local mafia boss. Then mafia boss kills Lincoln's father and (brother?) with hands of your heist crew members. All these missions are great, you feel that Mafia atmosphere around, lots of details, really good cutscenes and acting. You feel attached to characters. This is great intro, not cliche bullsh*t with revenge for characters you met 5 minutes ago and dont even remember their names. You play this intro for hour or so, but then you realise this was just an intro to the actual game, and the game itself should be even better, right?  Actual game turns out to be cheap grinding openworld sh*t. I realised that when i captured 3rd district in town, and my actions were all the same: 1. You come to guy who can help you to capture district. 2. He tells you where to find a snitch, who you can interrogate. 3. Snitch tells you locations of places you can hit to damage property of local district boss. 4. You come to this places and kill everyone/destroy something. (By the way, interrogation missions are the same as this step). 5. Repeat step 4 until boss of the property comes out, and kill him. Yeah, and boss comes out in a same place you have trashed already, so you have to trash it again. I did 3 districts, no exceptions for that. And yes, you do this step same way as step 4 again.  So after 3 districts I have 6 more to go and I realised that the game is already boring and repetitive. I still dont understand how from these beautiful intro missions game instantly turned into grinding piece of sh*t. You basically do one mission with little variations over and over again and even story missions between this district grinding (which are killings of the district bosses) are pretty much the same.   I knew, that the game will be openworlded, and I know what to expect from this kind of games. I like Shadow of Mordor and Batman: Arkham Something series, and i thought Mafia 3 will be same solid openworld expirience, where you do same things but it is not boring because realization of game mechanics is really good.  Game mechanics in Mafia 3 are not good. The game has dumbest AI I saw in years. Stealth mechanics are pure trash (thanks a lot to AI). You can run around stealthy in crowded place, killing guards one by one scaring the f*ck out of civilians, yet their screams and panic will not alert nearby guards at all. To kill everyone stealthy you need only 2 buttons: D-Pad Left (whistle) and B (takedown). You stand behind cover luring brainless enemies right in your hands and kill them without any trouble. Shooting in this game feels good, but AI is still dumb so they like to leave cover and run to their deaths. I've been playing on Hard difficulty, and i had problems in shootouts only when there were really a lot of enemies. They run to you from different directions, throw molotovs and can kill you in 3-4 hits on Hard, but if their number is less than 6, they are doomed. And yes, I play with a gamepad, so if you play with KB&amp;M you can multiply this number by 10.  And few words about graphics. Lets compare it to GTA. Mafia always had better graphics than GTA of same (+-2) release year. It looked really mature in comparison with 'casual' and not serious GTA. Mafia had a lot of highly detailed interiors, 'movie-like' characters and animation. Mafia 3 looks... meh. Nice enough, but meh. GTA 5 that released 2.5 years ago still looks way better, more detailed and has more fps on max settings (I have i5-3570K, GTX 1070, 16 GB RAM and 2560x1440p monitor). The only graphics part that feels like real step forward is cutscenes. They were great in previous Mafias but in this one they are even better. And you've probably seen videos like Mafia 3 vs Mafia 1 where you see how every little detail that worked in Mafia 1 doesnt exist in Mafia 3, so I will not talk about it in detail.  So, my final rating is 5/10. If you remove title Mafia 3 and Vito from the game you will not find anything remotely close to previous Mafia games. I will continue playing and if by some miracle game will return to missions like in intro, I will be really happy. But I doubt this will happen, and it would be really frustrating anyway to dig through this sh*t missions to play some golden ones. And sorry for my bad english, btw.
11515	When can i â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ costum lincoln? â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ useless rabbish ppl....

11519	A bad port wasn't part of the deal
11520	The Graphics on the game I have to say, At the moment sucks. Real bad! I see alot of talk about it, However I try to give a chance. I preodor it anyways. I hate to say it but its bad! The wourst Ive seen in a new release in a long time. I beleave they will fix it so I want ask for a refund, But what a bad start.. I was so looking forward to this game to. What a let down.
11521	f*ck you 2K , 30fps
11522	This game is pathetic!!! DO NOT BUY!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  Mafia II &gt; Mafia I &gt; Mafia III  I think that sums it up!!!
11523	Very very poor performing game! I am so sick of AAA titles being reliesed in this sort of state. I had waited for the patch so that I could run at a more acceptable frame rate nut now I cant even get 15fps!!

11525	Has massive Audio issues when it comes to soundblaster cards. Annoying crackle like spark sound once every seck- 2 seck's Very annoying and ruins entire game feel.   This game should go back to testing before market for sure. SOOO many issues in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is totaly not worth the money. Download and enjoy the story there instead. they screwd ppl over in this mafia game.
11526	RX 480 NITRO+ OC 8GB   ultra preset ~35 fps with drops to 23  high preset ~35 fps with drops to 23 medium preset ~35 fps with drops to 23 low preset ~35 fps with drops to 23  Worst optimization of the decade? 
11527	This is an incomplete game with too many flaws to give a good recommendation.  Pros: Cuts scenes are well directed and have great voice acting and graphics. Overall story is very interesting and engaging.  Cons: Game is unfinished. I've fallen through the map numerous times. Graphics in between cut scenes are very poor (playstation 2 quality) Game crashes a lot during loading screens.
11528	mafia 2 is better
11529	I guess they released a beta-version of a console port. Runs bad and looks bad. Don't buy this game at this stage.
11530	I bought the game Friday &amp; today (sunday) I decided to give it a go. What a farce the first thing I noticed was that as the game launches the backlighting on my keyboard &amp; mouse turns off. I plugged in my orbweaver after 20 minutes fapping round rebooting and that time the keyboard lights went off but the orby and the backlights on my mouse stayed on. I never had this hassle with any other game before. Anyway after I got into the game for a bit the keyboard lit up in some weird color but better than notheing so I disconnected orby. Keyboard lights work intermittently altho mouse lights now seem OK. Then got into a loop in the tutorial whereby map opened then when that closed went bak to tutorial screen again no way out back &amp; forward btween the screens but no game. Eventually fixed that by connecting up 360 controller - again after much fapping around. Then I got about 15 minutes of gaming (most of which was watching cutscenes - yuk) before big crash to desktop during firefight. What? restart n go thru it all again. This game should never have been shipped in this alpha state there are just too many bugs in it. I played all mafia games (1&amp;2) with KB &amp; M plus all GTA plus the great 'sleeping dogs', none of them required musical controllers which breaks immersion and makes the game a drag.
11531	'family is not who you are born with, but who you die for' is much more true for mafia II than for this poor game that is here to profit of the 'mafia' title
11532	Looks and plays like old console port.   I just played Mafia 2 right through and was ready to go back to back ith this crap. Mafia 2 puts this to shame in every way.  Result = I Refunded it along with the season pass.   I'm sick of the AAA not fit for PC @ launch remember deus ex Mankind must be deluded.  Thank you steam for refund option.  Vote with your wallet people.
11533	Truly a Mafia game, I've been robbed of 50â¬ - game won't even start. Dont buy the game, go to a pub and have a pint, you and your money will be far better off there.
11534	PLEASE DELETE THIS GAME AND RERELEASE WHEN U FIX IT
11535	DO NOT BUY THE GAME. I have just filmed a graphics glith that happens very often. The game is poorly optimizes and has low graphics.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVaUDBsbrwA 
11536	worst mafia game 
11537	Give Me A Cab, Give U A Thumb.
11538	Been playing despite the 30FPS cap. Really cool game bogged down by the technical incompetence/awful port. If they fix the 21:9 menus, remove the cap and improve the AI a little bit, I'll change my thumbs down to a thumbs up.
11539	It was terible, refunded it.  AI behaved like a 1980's game when attacking you, basically just stood there till i killed them.  Graphics are poor for 2016, story and cut scenes are bloody great but again the gameplay is wank. I had 6 enemies coming at me, i used 6 bullets to headshot everyone of them, I just stood there taking my time, they just stood there shooting ala wolfenstien 1980's style, being hit didnt even move my aim point or make my character flinch. Utter balls, game felt like it was make for incompetent gamers.  Truth is its a GTA wannabe and fails miserably, Mafia will never be GTA, it was never meant to be GTA, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT GTA!!  Yet another established game name, killed by sequels.  2/10
11540	Do not reccommend this game at all.  The 30fps cap, while being patched, should not have been in the game upon release. That's just telling us they're rushing out an unfinished product. On top of that the combat just feels completely bland. Its no different than what you'd find out of any mediocre 3rd person shooter and lacks any real complexity.  Comparing this to Mafia 2, they did everything wrong right from the start. The start should have been Lincoln in Vietnam as a tutorial (similar to Vito in WW2 in Mafia 2). Instead you just get a boring drive to a ~30 second shootout.  I had good expectations for this game coming from Mafia 2, but its just very disappointing to me.
11541	Gaming industry nowadays..i can't..i don't know what to say, i'm so dissapointed .. WHY IS SO F****** HARD TO RUN SOME TESTS BEFORE LAUNCHING A GAME? I really don't understand especially if this is your first game..why not making a good impression from the beginning?  For now i say no , very poorly optimised.
11542	After the patch the framerate is higher, but that doesn't get me far when the game suddenly freezes so bad I have to reboot my PC. Great job, devs! How about releasing a finished product from time to time?
11543	Pros: - Will write it once the game is actually playable.  Cons: - 30 FPS lock. What year is this? - Lack of Steam controller support. The game is completely unplayable with a Steam controller since the controller presets are not loaded for some reason, you'll have to bind everything to keyboard buttons. Walking around with the stick and setting the setting the right touchpad to Mouse also won't work, since the character will stop walking every time you move the camera. Same goes for aiming with right trigger and mouse.  In hindsight, it has taught me an important lesson: Do not ever preorder. Ever. 'But it's a major title and it can't go wrong!' Nope, it still can.
11544	yaya blah blah, i just played a couple of minutes BUT no, just no!  don't buy this game at the actual state.  it's another lazy â¥â¥â¥ console port - the keybindings r a joke. u can't change the language after starting a new game, so decide well. (erm, ma bad, u can. just go to default settings in the audio tab and than u can change it) stupid anyway.   some ppl say the 30 fps lock is not that bad - it is THAT bad! it's not a dark world full of crime - it is a blurry world full of blur to hide the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ textures. if u wanna laugh, look at the textures the game is offering. im sure this should have been a xbox 360 game years ago. don't get me wrong, graphics r not everything and the game looks okey, but why the heck does it run like a big pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥?!   maybe this is the new scheme to develop games now days, or maybe pc gamers are just not worth it to get a playable FULL PRICE game...  look at starbreeze, or klei for example - dev teams with just a handfull of ppl, but they give us awesome games! games made with love.  anyway, i can't play mafia 3 at this state and im ashamed to support these lazy punks with their â¥â¥â¥ full of money, alot of ppl and what we r getting? â¥â¥â¥â¥  update: 2 crashes after 1 hour and at the same place.  u want to know some positives about the game? alright; storytelling seems to be really good so far and also the game mechanics feel well done.   i really hope the game is enjoyable after the upcomming patch, cause mafia 3 seems to have a good amount of potential.
11545	At its current state I cannot recommend it. 30 fps as told from developers the day before launch 2016 is an absolute disgrace. Sloppy menus, not much settings, and hard to configure due to bugs. Crashes, in game bugs. Story? I dont know. After barely 25min my mind was sickened from the 'lagging' experience of 30 fps. Whiny? Yes. The mediocre resolution I can deal with, the 30 fps not. Patch in the weekend some say that fixes 30fps. Too little too late I say. Should have been included from the start. Yet another game not finished at launch. Refunded for me. Unfortunately...
11546	Slow in the head developers launch PC title with a 30fps cap and expect a good Steam review. *SIGH* Then they release condescending statement about taking their PC players seriously. Like they didnt have enough time to sort this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out before release. Well played 2k, well played.
11547	Had problems before I even started, black screen and game did not start.  After 45 min playing with 30 fps and crap lag the game crashes!
11548	Mafia Creed 3   What a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, Mafia 2 is way better
11549	1. 30fps locked 2. Everything is blurry except Lincon himself 3. Game randomly crashes  Seriously? I just bought Mafia 2 for the last few weekends and felt quite disappointed about it. And now this?
11550	Can't get past the tutorial level. Found it wierd that I couldn't 'melee' the first tied up person I found and I couldn't pick up the body of the other 'whacked' guard when the game just starts.   I figured it was meant to be like that so you were force to actually continue playing the game/story instead of fooling around.  Stuck at the furnace. Can't preform a 'silent takedown' because for some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reason my controls don't work. Binding them to custom keys or going back to 'vanilla' settings... it doesn't matter. Can't whack the guard.  Not even when plugging in a controller. And I understand that Dualshock 4 controllers might not be fully supported but I'm using software make it work. It works with every other (newly) released game at launch apart this one. Can't see the keybindings and not a single button on my controller does the 'silent takedown'.  And let's not forget the things this game does horribly wrong: rather limited graphical options. Only being able to turn off/or on the 'blur'. A little bit wouldn't mind but putting it on means having completely washed out graphics. FPS locked to 30 and I already notice how terrible it is having to play this on a locked 30 FPS. Specifically chose the PC version because of the previous games being on PC and just having the most 'freedom' to run and tweak the game to your preferences.  Fix the damn game. I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy this if I could properly play it.  1/10 terrible launch 2K/Hangar 13. It seems like you didn't even bother testing.
11551	I Do NOT recommend Mafia 3 !!  They removed so many good functions of mafia 2 !  Why no unique car upgrades ? Why lifetime weapons ? No unique missions after the intro ! Feels like always the same ! So repetitiv..-.- Didnt got any speeding ticket jet. after i passed cops with over 90mph ! Car Damagemodels suck ! No refueling the car ! No washing the car ! Nothing is customizable ! Cant change clothes. ! YOU Only kill .. damge.. and conquer the city... so dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥... DONT BUY !!  The game could be way better with just a little bit of polishing and changing some stuff...  and the worst ...  Crashes without any error messages.... and fps were locked to 30 at relese !!   IÂ´m so dissapointed....:(
11552	They are not taken pc player seriously.
11553	thats my second view of this game, and still disappointed about this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game. The frame rate was unlocked. However gtx970 cant even stable at 60 fps for medium graphic setting, wtf??? and even the graphic looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥?? I can play GTAV for high graphic stable at 60 fps, and those graphic much better than this game. Omg, thats the most unfrendly optimisation geme in this year. i rather playing mafia 2 instead... ::((( (sorry my bad eng)  Furthermore, Maifa 3 has 16.7G for audio file, 10G for CG, so it only has less than 15G for actual gaming content?? well done 2K:)
11554	Starts of with a decent story, great music, great cutscene graphics - but falls completly flat on its stomach after a few hours.  * It's repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ (36 times the same mission) * The story goes from intresting to unrelatable psycho masskilling in no time. * AI is generally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, blind and not up to the task * Aiming with 2-handed weapons, is way off. (no, really) * The same in-game animations are used, over and again. * Badly optimized - can hardly get over 30 fps with 2x970 SLI * Speaking of 30 fps.. That FPS lock at launch was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unacceptable!   The game had potential, it really did. It even starts out great, you really feel pumped - but when the first hour is through, you start to see the cracks in the painting - the repetitiveness, the random cutscene stories from people you never meet or have any relations to, the people you genuinly cared about are gone - and left are some uninteresting charachters and plothole that grows gets deeper by the minute.  I'll show myself out, i just wish i could have asked for a refund and not supported this mess.
11555	what is this ? 30 fps â¥â¥â¥â¥  in 2016 30 fps on pc Â´? cheap console port  
11556	Soundtrack is good, story is ok, graphics are very glitchy and it tends to crash a lot for some users, and really awful AI (You can kill 30 npc's and not one thing is done, Hell, you can use cars and bodies to stop a whole city dead in it's tracks! lol).  Also has a message about racism, NI &amp; Prod hatred and some issues with communism it appears... go figure... apart from all that it can be fun, be it very short fun. (If you don't crash out to desktop, or get bored repeating the same type of missions over &amp; over).  Characters are very forgettable and the world isn't interactable in any way, you can shoot bottles off tables etc. but you can't use a phone, WC, radio, eat, drink, change clothes, fix/modify cars etc.  4/10 - Music 2, Story 2.   Buy it next Easter on the Steam sale for Â£5, it sure isn't worth the Â£40 I paid.
11557	Following a doctors appointment and having my glasses checked by my optician i can only conclude there is nothing wrong with either my sight or my glasses. Therefore i can only conclude that the game looks like s***. I did some settings tweaking and upscaled the rendering, but this only helped a little. The game still looks blurry and the textures look like they received a photoshop smudging treatment. The combat felt stale and un-immersive. I drove on normal and simulated, but this also felt a little off. Before buying this game i did read up on it, after serverely lowering my expectations i was still left unsatisfied. If you want to play a good Mafia game, with good graphics, go buy Mafia II.
11558	This game has a great story and a great depiction of the 1960s that being said the game feels empty outside of the main story it feels like there is a lot of the imersive features that are missing from mafia 2 ( fuel consumption , garage customization , being able to purchase goods and services, fast travel ) alot of what made mafia 2 so fun to play.  there are also graphic issues at times textures look muddy and are not at all what you expect from a AAA title made in 2016 the sky and clouds often looking liek it was from a retextured n64 art style.   despite all that i do enjoy the story but often felt myself pulled out of the immersion of the game due to the repetativeness of objectives or quests and repetative combat style with the Ai and main character.
11559	Not recommended.  Poorly optimisied. Very blurry and stutters constantly.   Save your money and buy something. Don't just take my word for it, look at the thousands of other negative reviews.  Its shocking at this day and age a gaming company can get away with releasing something of this standard.  Massively disappointed as I really enjoyed Mafia 1 &amp; 2.
11560	Terrible, the graphics, the fps lock, the ai is dumb, everything is so damn blurry it looks like play-doh the game just feels like its a beta release to be honest. im refunding.
11561	A dissapointing refund, with amazing cutscenes, and a whole lot of missed potential...
11562	As is I can Not recommend this game to anyone. The fact that i can't keep any kind of steady framerate with my Gtx 970 and i5 4690 even on low settings is embarassing. The game does not have the kind of graphics to need such a powerful pc I can play most games on full settings at 1080p but this game isn't possible to play on full settings unless you have a 20 core processor and a Titan X and even then it probably wouldn't get a steady framerate. Overall the game is an endless loop of the same mission but I can forgive that because the story and gameplay is actually quite fun the stealth works but the AI is totally stupid making it a little too easy.. I would really like to play this game all the way through but in it's current state i'm afraid i can't without severe frustration and agonizing slowdowns I'd say it equivelant to playing a poorly emulated ps2 game  TO 2K or HANGER 13 : OPTIMIZE THIS GAME  Revision - Got the game running stable thanks to a very helpful post that i can't find now but it was basically going into my nvidia control panel and changing the antrioscopic filtering to 8x works good now def playable
11563	Wouldn't even run I got a refund and am getting Mafia 2 instead, wait for a patch and get in the Christmas sales if your thinking about buying.
11564	-repetitive gameplay (maybe 5 out of the several dozen missions aren't) game literally feels like a proof of concept, really tired of these 'speed bump' grind open world games and miss the good ol' days of linear action/adventure based PC titles. -No difficulty progression, the end is just about as hard as the beginning, the funny thing is that the hardest part of the game is the random generated events when Marcano's hitman try to get you. If you are going to make a game that has grinding as a element at least make it so I am grinding towards being able to finish the story, not becoming more invincible. -dumb AI that is most effectively dealt with playing the game stealth, setting the game harder doesn't help, a hail of gunfire from a covered enemy will take you down to the brink of death just making the game more frustrating. Also can AI see through walls? -muddy sub-HD upscaled graphics similar to Quantum Break. -pop in/dithering of objects and textures. -shouldn't take GTX 1080 to run this game smoothly, no effort put into the PC version, feels like a straight port from the Xbox one with remapped controls. -crashing into everything, even bushes, same exagerated crash animation even at low speed. -cant even get out of water at shore. -100 some songs but only 3 radio stations, I feel like I hear the same 3 advertisements and songs over and over again. -poor GPS navigation and a hundred other random small bugs that definately don't belong in a triple A title. -developer provided a 60fps patch pretty quick but were really late to inform everyone about this red flag which would of cancled my pre-order, therefore you get a negative review.  +pretty decent story even though its kind of ridiculous and preachy at times, if you are playing this seriosuly just skip every side mission and just get to the objective as soon as possible you're not missing anything. +loot that is actually interesting, playboy and vargas tasteful nudes.
11565	The Game does not run very well, consistently low FPS (under 30) on a machine that can run other, more demanding games above 60 no problem. Screen tearing is a very slight issue. Performance when on foot isnt too bad but when driving it is awful. Twice the game has crashed from looking back whilst driving at speed.  In terms of mechanics, the driving to me feels worse than Mafia 2, feels more like driving a boat than a car, very swimmy, lots of roll on the cars, lots of wheelspin, braking is ineffective and vehicles just seem to lurch about. Gunplay has been improved, weapons feel heavier and there is more variety and now upgradability to them. However unlike in Mafia 2 you are limited to only 2 at a time, a primary and a sidearm.  My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of veriety in the missions, it's the same thing over and over again until you take control of an area of the city, then you just go and take over another area. It feels like a grind. Compare this to Mafia 2 where every mission was different. Yes, some were better than others but they all had something unique and memorable about them. If I ever get round to finishing Mafia 3 I don't see myself ever wanting to go back and do it again, but I still play Mafia 2 to this day.  On the plus side, the soundtrack is very good.
11566	whole game is pants. so glitchy im stuck on level 2 and cant progress because of a cut scene that will not appear
11567	I have a really nice RIG and I can only run this game on low settings smoothly.. This game is poorly optimized.. I can run GTA 5 on ULTRA with no real issue at all and this game.. not even close.  As for the game its fun and the story is there. Great characters, environment, music and gameplay but I see how the game  is repetative.   My specs.  Geforce GTX 970 driver version 373.06 Intel i7-6700k Skylake 4.00 GHz 31.91 RAM 2560x1440 59Hz ASUS Maximus Hero 8 SSD  If this game gets optimized better then I will give it a positive review.
11568	Not recommended.  Poorly optimisied. Very blurry and stutters constantly.   Save your money and buy something. Don't just take my word for it, look at the thousands of other negative reviews.  Its shocking at this day and age a gaming company can get away with releasing something of this standard.  Massively disappointed as I really enjoyed Mafia 1 &amp; 2.
11569	Terrible, the graphics, the fps lock, the ai is dumb, everything is so damn blurry it looks like play-doh the game just feels like its a beta release to be honest. im refunding.
11570	 Early Access Review
11571	Not sure how I should put this, I payed 5.99 USD and normally it is 11.99, if I am correct, and I don't feel like I got my moneys worth even that low of a price. I respect small Indie Dev's and I don't mean for this to come across harshly, I can understand making a game with small budget or maybe this had a normal sized one, not entierly sure, it felt extremly on the low side with the quality that it was released in. I bought this for a fun cheap horror experience and honestly the scariest part was its unpredictable AI. That sounds like the making of a good game right, unpredictable AI, not knowing what the AI would do next, some prime suspense? Not in this sense, its not unpredictable in a good way. The AI constantly glitch or feel like they're on a set grid to walk or move on, they would stand still and suddenly you would be dead without knowing what happened. Some rooms, notably the Library, when you sit or jump would make the games audio/music raise in pitch of a second. It is pretty funny when you do it really fast, but immersion breaking. I hate leaving bad reviews but I honestly did not enjoy my experience with this game. If you can buy it for less than 1.50 USD then sure get it, why not, that is about as much as a phone game. It makes for some pretty funny glitches that a group of your friends can enjoy watching together.
11572	 Early Access Review
11573	This game does not support inverted mouse controls so made it unplayable for me. To leave out such a fundamental standard control option is an oversight.
11574	Well. It is cheap for a reason. The thought behind it is cool enough, but the game is not good at all. After 20 minutes I had enough. Those infected humans, or what they are, comes running at you naked with a club in their hands, and just look poorly executed, design-wised. Did not need to play a minute more in order to understand that this game is not for me at all. Actually not a game for anyone who has a slight bit of standards when it comes to a game.
11575	i really, really wanted to like this game.  i tried to put off a review until i finished it, just in case the ending might make up for all of the busywork this game puts the player though, but i got to a point where nothing was going to help me feel better about it.  this game features hallways with nothing in them that take minutes to walk through, a puzzle based on sound and direction with poor audio design, and a 20 minute key collectathon where you need a key to unlock a door to get another key---you know, that thing that gamers hate.  the ludum dare version of this game is great, so i think this version is just a product of someone fiddling with their work too much before calling it 'done.' there's a huge emphasis on story in this game, but it becomes far too frustrating than it's worth to uncover an ending with countless 'game overs' in some sections, too-elaborately worded puzzles in others, and more padding than a drag queen's bra.   the artwork in this game is charming, the atmosphere is unsettling, the voice acting is impressive, the story is compelling, but the frustrating gameplay overshadows everything good about this game.  a shame.
11576	Succeeds at being unsettling, but becomes increasingly tedious to get to a punchline. I stopped playing at the party house and its maze of keys. I didn't feel like I spent my time particularly well.  Typos and stylized spellings also took away from the experience.
11577	The entirety of my commentary for  Close Your Eyes  can be boiled down to this: it doesn't make a lot of sense. What's kind of unique about it is that it manages to not make sense in a lot of different ways, some of which are actually to the game's benefit. I was waiting for a moment when it would make sense, followed a guide to see all the endings hoping one of them would shed some light, but no, that moment never came. Yet at the same time, I can't imagine a way that it would.  Beneficial senselessness first: this is a horror game and it is very scary. It is very scary largely because the sound design is as good as it gets for a free horror game, but also because there is no point in the game where you have a clear idea of what to expect. A lot of my time playing it I was on edge for a jump scare, which the dev smartly distributed sparsely throughout the game. This goes as far as the game having kind of distinct 'levels' within it where what is expected of the player is something that they have not encountered. The gameplay has an erratic rhythm, at no point can you expect a set measure of puzzle&gt;story&gt;puzzle&gt;story or some such. The unpredictability of the game, the shifting playstyle and artstyles, with menacing voices whispering veiled threats into your ear; these come together to make for a harrowing, visceral experience.  Now for the problematic senselessness.   One, the puzzles. There are a few notable puzzles the solutions to which are ridiculously designed. One of the earliest puzzles, with the trains, leaves out an important part of the solution in the in game note that tells you how to solve it. The graveyard puzzle, which there is a guide on, and which I almost certainly would have given up on without a guide, is a terrible bunch of lateral thinking riddles smashed together. I would not even call the bizarre text adventure toward the end a puzzle,    where the girl chases you and you have to choose the correct options to kill her   as there's absolutely no indication how effective any of your options might be, leading to just one long trial and error segment. One of the endings requires an incredibly obscure action to be taken, but I'll give that a slide as it's practically a bonus ending, and a homage to Silent Hill.  Two, the plot. I mention Silent Hill and maybe that's the most flattering thing I could compare it to, characters stuck in a hellish purgatory where nothing really makes any sense as punishment for vague crimes. The greatest game of that franchise (2) managed to pull it together and make a story that was cohesive in a metaphorical sense, but I guess I can't really come to expect that of something like this. It is disappointing though, because the game keeps asking you 'Haven't you figured it out yet?' figuratively and literally at times, but as far as I can tell, there's nothing to figure out beyond well, you're in a hellish purgatory where nothing really makes any sense as punishment for vague crimes. The multiple threads that the game holds throughout, each character seemingly punishing the player character for different reasons and the surreal non-choices that the player character makes to lead to whichever ending, come to read as muddled and meaningless.  Honestly... I don't know if this is worth anybody's time. I also don't know that it's not worth anybody's time. It's a weird one and I'm picking thumbs down pretty much on the basis of cons outweighing pros in sheer quantity. The pros are probably more pertinent in some senses though. So I don't know. I have a mixed opinion. I would pick thumbs left or right if I had that option, but it's not there.
11578	Difficult game to figure out on your own. I kind of enjoy it, but I keep getting stuck not knowing what to do next and that ruined it for me.
11579	This game really wasn't scary at all, for me. The low quality and poorly designed puzzles and dialogue spoiled the chance for immersion, which made it less scary than it would have been (which is not very). Puzzels in this game seemed contrived, and tedious, rather than clever. A train w/ 4 doors that open at different stations? that's kinda silly. Plus, the protagonist comments on almost everything being strnage or unual. I never finished the game because I reached a puzzel that was just too tedious, and it was not worth finishing. Overall, I mean I guess it's free. But if your time is worth anything to you, find something better to spend it on.
11580	this game is weird, just weird. it starts off interesting, but i eventually after 96 something minutes just got bored and stopped playing. it worth just trying it out i guess, but i didnt enjoy the game so im going to give it a thumbs down. didnt dislike it, there should be a 'meh' botton, which is what this game is. meh.
11581	There's nothing to it but overly wide spaces you slowly walk through. After the initial story beat, there's just... emptiness.   Nothing interesting to do, nothing interesting to look at or speculate about, and nothing interesting to read or listen to.  Every line of text pretends the game is more than it is.  Which, y'know. That wouldn't be the end of the world?   Except what it -is- is a massive waste of your free time! Oh nooooooooo~! Because what the area designs boil down to is:  'Ooooh this place is DARK! I bet you're AFRAID of the darkness BUT ALSO CHILDRENS' DRAWINGS, OOoooOOoOOooOO. Spooky! ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH TO FLIP THE LIGHT SWITCH.   Now listen to this song! I mean, try to. If you can deal with the audio quality. The lyrics are probably important, but they're inaudible and (thank god) not a puzzle, so really, just keep walking.  Keeeeeep walking.   Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep waaaaaaaaaaaalkiiiiiiiiiiiiiing........' ________  Cards on the table, here.  If you're looking for a -good- free, story-heavy RPGMaker horror game that actually has anything to it, you could always try Ib, Witch's House or Pocket Mirror.  Maybe Yume Nikki or .flow, if you like vague stuff.  Don't bother with this, really. It just takes bits that other games have done better, but uses them worse. Just don't even waste your time!

11583	  the story was really only shock-value and didnt offer much in terms of depth. the style is great though, and the voice acting is surprisingly good. just cant get past how tedious everything is and the lack of meaningful story. there's no reason to care about anything. the narration blows its load a few seconds in and becomes redundant thereafter. i mean, not bad for free. if you like the style and puzzles and creepy gameplay, go for it. just dont expect a story with any meaningful depth.
11584	PROS: -You'll never need keys again - The intro is a really good hook - Story seems like a good idea - Audio ambience was great  CONS: - KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR, KEY, DOOR.... - Voice acting not very good - Story told in awkward fits and bursts   Keys. So many keys. The triangle key, the square key, rectangle, circle, star, heart, annulus, blabis, just-- It's a key chain search at this point. The beginning was interesting, but once I got to the manor and it became Key Quest Extraordinaire, I was frustrated and bored (so bored). And then sneaking past the tornado/bedsheet thing (which I believe I know what it is but eh, spoilers) was just ridiculous. It's too fast. I decided that my interest wasn't strong enough to try to get past a walking bedsheet.  In more balanced review, the start hooked me. The weird visuals, the odd music (or tones, not really music at times) was fascinating. There was quite a lot of 'this path is blocked, go get the thing to unblock it' as the game continued until it was just ridiculous. There had to be at least a dozen or more keys.   The voice acting... well, it could definitely use a re-do. The Announcer was too close to the microphone during the 'angry' recordings and all that stood out was the weird sound of lips hitting each other. It was almost overwhelming. There wasn't a consistent tone or attitude-- it really felt like it was a random voice alternately praising you and growling to close your eyes. I GET IT. EYES SHOULD BE CLOSED. The growling wasn't even consistent, and it sounded way too forced, like the person recording still had a smile on, trying to be supah spoopy, gotta scurr the kiddos, not 'oh god please I don't want to die.' The woman who sung the songs had either a mediocre voice with poor timing, or a bad song to record and tried her best. I couldn't tell. Either way, it was annoying.
11585	If you enjoyed those old visual novels with branching paths all leading to your death or non-standard game-overs, well, this one here is free!  If you don't mind not being able to skip a cutscene into a trial-and-error section which kills you should you not react in half a second or make a wrong decision, this game won't bug you.  If not, your time will be better spent elsewhere. May I recommend you Ib, if you really need to play an indie horror made in RPG Maker?
11586	It's both a murdering simulator and key-finding simulator My ears are bleeding too! great game 
11587	The story is like a fifth grader wrote it, also the voice acting is so bad.
11588	something spooked me so i closed the game. who wins now 
11589	something spooked me so i closed the game. who wins now 
11590	  My brother and I tried playing and just got stuck on a road, couldn't figure a way off. I watched a walkthrough and I guess you're not supposed to end up on the road at all so that's fantastic, idk what happened.  I watched videos of this game instead of finishing it, because honestly I couldn't figure it out. Maybe it's not that complicated and I'm just bad at these kinds, though.  Still have no idea what happened plot wise. Love the trash-announcer though, he's the perfect flavor of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-bag npc.  No screamers that I saw, but a few sudden pictures of very cartoonish gore (eyes, not bloody, just eyes in places like eggs/the moon/a guy's nose).  Everyone seems to love it but it's just not my cup of tea.
11591	Well, I failed to input the convoluted train puzzle so many times. It's ridiculous. Rest of game is spoopy noises and ya can't see anything. Not a good experience, not rewarding to play as a horror fan nor as a puzzle fan. Then again, I've never liked RPGMaker games. This may be a game for you if    You're not into intense horror experiences    You  are  into RPGMaker games     You... Read... Creepypastas...? (maybe)   Bottom line: Definitely worth the asking price, did not like personally.
11592	I actually had pretty high expectations of this game, since it was so good rated and looked really interesting, but to be honest, for me the game was a big disappointment. The graphics were messy and the plot really confusing, and most of the time you just had no idea what to do, which made the gaming experiment pretty fast boring and frustrating. Also the game music was pretty much just a really short part of singing (or a simple short melody) looping all over again, quickly getting really annoying.
11593	The game was made in 76 hours (source: the credits) and it shows.   Sound: When you're not grimacing at the pops, clicks, wistles, and hisses during the voice acting, you're either bored by the soundtrack or having a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu, but not in a good way. Stock sounds + completely borrowed/ripped off tracks minus the sappy as hell ending song. There was about two recordings that added to the atmosphere.   Gameplay: Nothing special here, typical RPG maker top-down, and there's nothing wrong with that. The puzzles here were either so easy you get bored, have absolutely no direction, or are borrowed from other games (7 deadly sins puzzle, I'm looking at you). You have to hug the wall because the lighting is too dark, it doesn't add to the atmosphere it just makes the game irritating to navigate.   Everything else: The writing is the best part of this game, I have to admit I was really creeped out. I disliked the art direction and the original music, but that's my own personal bias.
11594	I looked at the reviews for this game and I was like wow this game must be amazing, I'll give it shot, what's to lose it's free anyways... Well let me tell you!  The puzzels were very difficult so the challenge was interesting and there were a couple I had to look up, however finding the answer was more difficult then the challenge itself. Some of the challenges answers didn't make sense even after looking up the answer but that can be forgiveable.  The best parts of this game was the voice acting and dialogue. It was different then usual games and I think they did a good job making you uneasy whilst you play.  So what's the problem? It doesn't make any sense, when I finished the game I was unsatisfied confused I had no explaination the storyline was chopped and I was hoping that whilst I played the story would unfold and would make sense. However, I couldn't work out why I was there, who the girls in the story were, who the narrator was? It was extremely unsatisfying. My boyfriend watched me play and he was just as stumped and confused why this game had received so many positive reviews.  Though the atmosphere is dark and unsettling it there was never a time I wanted to stop playing due to fear (though I wanted to stop for other reasons). It didn't quite manage to get that horror feeling that amnesia and other horror games manage.
11595	IT'S FREE! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.    Summary Pros: +Atmosphere +Music +Unsettling Cons: -Endless fetch quest section &lt;-- This gets really bad -Things felt like they were put into the game just because and lacked real importance to the story -Lots of running through pointless corridors -Predictable ending   I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the music, and the voice acting for a free-to-play game and I appreciate the effort the creator put into making this. The best way to describe this game would be 'unsettling' as you explore the characters history, there won't be many jumpscares or monster encounters. Play it for the atmosphere.   However, I agree with some of the other reviewers who were critical about the party scene. Having to search an incredibly confusing maze house to find a ton of keys got boring, redundant, and very frustrating. There were many times that I thought I was done but then had to go back into the maze and search for more keys. If it ended after you left the party house that would have been sufficient. But having to fetch keys over and over again while the story progressed felt suffocating. It took away from the feelings of uneasiness because they were replaced by frustration and irritation.   Some of the motifs and symbolism in the game were great but not used to their fullest potential.  Overall, I was left disappointed by the ending (heard there's more then one..?) and my overall playthrough. I yearned for more density in the game.
11596	I've never been so bored by a horror game in my life.
11597	Terrible, terrible game. Play Ao Oni or Witch's House instead of you want RPGMaker Horror.
11598	The narration was WAY TOO LOUD considering I generally keep volume low. Then, 'must of', seriously?  I'm assuming this singing is bad on purpose. Speaking of which, if you swap casettes the song should stop immediately, not fade out.  I just tried to talk to a character and went right through it, I'm going to assume that's intentional for now.  The egg question is unfair, as it depends on the situation. Devilled eggs are awesome, but not for breakfast, and the GOAT egg option, basted, wasn't even there.  The skull puzzle is missing something. 'Maybe there's a clue' but I examined everything and found nothing for clues. Eventually randomly found the correct way by trying every direction.  I understand going to the TV is supposed to be game over, but whatever flashes on-screen is too quick to see. Why?  Ugh, the manor keyhunt got boring fast. Maybe I'll finish it another day but for now I'm done.
11599	Gets boring with overextended puzzles and pancakes
11600	drags on way too long. story has no meaning. 0/10
11601	This game is so pretentious I got a film school degree.
11602	on the first screen i knew  this is like the free â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-psycho-horror genre's ET  it plays like a cheap trick and looks worse  into the 'incest/murder/2spooky/:^)' bin it goes
11603	Can't figure out the security lock passcode... so I can't give a proper review. lmao
11604	There are sevn endings, supposedly, so you can play this multiple times.. although I don't know why you would want to. It's actually a decent game, but it moves too slow. The last thing you want from an atmospheric horror is to get bored. Close my eyes? Only because these repetitive puzzles are putting me to sleep! Ahaha!  Pros: Storyline Sound Atmosphere General creepiness  Cons: Repetive Poor pacing  Meh: Graphics BGM
11605	One sentence review: It's an RPG Maker version of a wanna-be Silent Hill 3 that fell quite short for me but others might enjoy it.  It is NOT bad. Dev put serious effort into it. But I wouldn't recommend it to my friends, and so I really can't recommend it to any stranger reading this.  'Close Your Eyes' bites a lot of the Silent Hill series and probably should have used a different engine than RPG Maker. Some of the elements are nearly plagerized such as the 'red light chasing you' as well as the writing from the one puzzle from SIlent Hill 3 that has a morbid consumption clue.   While some of the artwork works well -- blinking away so the gimpse is temporary -- the atmosphere falls short. Making the protagonist some marshmallow guy really detracts from things as does a general lack of detail in the area. The writing has some good bits but is mostly overshadowed by really bad bits and one puzzle with a solution that even given the horror setting will irritate some people and downright offend others.  But the biggest flaw of the game is that it drags. Your protagonist can't move very quickly and most of the game is a matter of finding the key, unlocking the door. Considering the lack of combat or meaningful interaction, why bother with using RPG Maker at all? There's lots of other more suitable game making software that would have done the job better (Construct 2 for example)  The second critical part I find is the writing. It really does feel like a fan-game version of Silent Hill 3 (with some aspects borrowing from 2) right down to the hidden Alien ending.   And here's where I really debated giving it a negative review. All in all, is it truly a bad game? I've played much worse and seen worse writing from the Triple A game industry. There are some good, although rather ham-fisted puzzles.  ** EDIT: 11-23-2016 To be honest, no. It's NOT bad. But just because something isn't bad, or even is decent, doesn't mean I'm going to recommend it. There's a difference between 'This is bad' and 'This isn't recommended'. The dev put some serious work into it.   Ultimately though, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends, and that's why it's a thumbs-down. **  Well, while it was a distraction and there was some serious effort put into the game, the critical problem is the game doesn't understand why other games put in the elements that they did, so it puts things in because other horror games did. It doesn't understand horror beyond bog-standard 'disturbing looking monsters and slowed down deep voices'. Worst of all, it bites too hard on Silent Hill. Compare this to 'Lone Survivor' which did understand the elements applied to Silent Hill 2 and did its own thing with it.  If the developers see this review and want to hear some suggestions on how to improve it, here's what I can suggest: - Decide if you want to sympathize or be horrified by the protagonist. If the player is to sympathize, make the crimes committed more abstract and beyond a simple one-word-response. If the player is to be horrified, then the crime needs to be more explicit, interactive and have an impact on the story. - Use symbolism. It should begin in an extremely subtle way and then become more and more obvious as the game progresses. Silent Hill was HUGE on symbolism, even in the symbollically-very-watered-down Silent Hill 3. - Don't use a marshmallow guy. He just doesn't work; not cute enough to be ironic, too cute to be a believable threat, and doesn't really fit with the background. - Don't use so much black, or if you do stick to the light-source method. It just looks lazy otherwise. - Allow the player to run. If stealth is to be an option then give a player a reason to take things slow. - Clearly mark doors. - Detail levels vary greatly. The graveyard cares about positioning but most of the rest of the game doesn't. Be consistent. - Watch Jacob's Ladder, it was the key source material for Silent Hill.
11606	Wasn't that scary or fun...It didn't really set the mood...
11607	You get cancer playing this game.  The game has a resolution of 540 pixels or something, if it's in fullscreen. And if that's not enough, in some parts of the game, you can only see 1/16th of the screen. So you need to guess where to go. And if THAT's not enough, you have to run and get keys all over the map, and then run back and remember where which door is, where every door has a similar key name.
11608	A hypnotist with psychic talents is drawn into a criminal case with bizarre implications in this thriller from Great Britain. Dr. Michael Strother (Goran Visnjic) is a psychologist and hypnotherapist who has relocated from the United States to England after an ugly incident in which a boy under Strother's care died while swimming, possibly due to a mistakenly triggered hypnotic suggestion. Strother sometimes sees visions which he believes are images from the minds of his patients, and while hypnotizing Janet Losey (Shirley Henderson), a police detective who is trying to give up cigarettes, he sees a terrifying vision of a girl trapped beneath the surface of a stream. Strother learns that the girl in his vision is Heather, a teenager who has recently disappeared; when found, she's disoriented, unable to speak, and has strange new tattoos on her arms. Despite the pleas of his wife Clara (Miranda Otto) to keep his distance, Strother becomes involved in the case, and with the help of Elliot (Paddy Considine), a dealer in fantasy games, he learns that the bizarre gibberish Heather has been spouting are part of the rituals of an outmoded religious rite. As Strother and Losey dig deeper into the bizarre crime, they're led into a twisted web of intrigue, violence, and religious fanaticism.
11609	Not scarry. Not interesting. Has some easy puzzlees.   
11610	If you are the type of person who would enjoy wandering through rock tunnel without flash to get to Lavender town then you'll like this game. There is a lot of darkness, a lot of wall hugging, and puzzles that may be hard enough that you'll have to look up the answers.  If you're the type of person who would prefer to see where you're going and solve no brainer puzzles, then this game will frustrate you. Sometimes I found myself really wanting the game to be over so I could have closure and move on with my life. Take from that what you will.   I can't knock it too much since it is free though. Worth the experience, worst that could happen is you delete it.
11611	hated it
11612	'Can't see â¥â¥â¥â¥, captain' - the game.
11613	Just another Yume Nikki wannabe. This game doesn't sound good or look good, and I don't think I even got far enough to see any bit of compelling story, but there doesn't appear to be one. You could argue that you've got nothing to lose if you really want to experience it for yourself since it's free, but for me it was nothing more than an utter waste of time.
11614	a little scary but not realy fun :\
11615	Not sure how the reviews are so good on this game. Not a horror. Crap graphics. More of like a puzzle game.
11616	Who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ approves this kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Steam?
11617	Its just as good as the thousands of freeware RPG Maker 'Ao Oni' clones out there. Crappy MS Paint graphics and cringeworthy blood text on the walls.
11618	I had hopes, I didn't watch anything on the videos or look at screenshots. 'It's a free to play RPG game? What could go wrong?'   He said, not realizing that â¥â¥â¥â¥ all could go wrong.   Hit download, steam froze for about 2 minutes, game downloaded, went to play it, okay, doesn't look TOO bad at the title. I changed the resolution to.. Ahem. 'Full screen' As in it stretches the window out but doesn't actually go full screen. I played the game, okay, good start. Then I actually got into the gameplay. It was one of those moments where I went 'Holy sh*t..' The graphics look like they've been drawn by a mentally disturbed 7 year old, (Which, in all likelyhood, was probably MADE by a 7 year old, judging from the graphics of cringeworthy 'Blood' spills on the walls, and a main charecter looking like one of those like mask guys from mario on drugs) and the so called 'creepy' song where you have to find the lady with a key (HOW ORIGINAL!   not  ) The song itself sounds like some girl tried to go on stage and sing some song out of a creepypasta but failed horribly at trying to sound good and actually keep some kind of beat, and by that point the graphics had made my eyes hurt so much that I'd just decided to quit.    So, close your eyes and pretend you're playing a better game. 
11619	Close your eyes.....Good.  Now, pretend you're playing a better game.  edgy/10
11620	This game was too intense for me. I could not finish it

11625	Edit: Review update (04.12.2016). Game has now more content than ever before &amp; you can actually play it have some entertainment from it. There are 2 maps with variety day &amp; night making it total 4 maps to choose. Now there is also achievements &amp; trading cards. You can play multiplayer DM or TDM, but at the moment there are no players, so I couldn't test it, but I guess you can play it with friends. There is also single player survival mode. This needs more balancing, but I did like the weapon and enemy models, especially zombie with big belly, when you shoot him it explodes and all the spiders come out of him! I really hope, that developer continues his work and make this game better, because there is again light in the tunnel to make good game.   Edit: Review update after 6 months (08.05.2016). This game had some rough time from players, but it is nice to see, that developer just goes on and is still busy experimenting, updating the game (last update 01.05.2016).  In meantime I have also tried some other builds from the game other than first two builds and I thought, that game was on the right track. But trying to play the latest build I'm not sure what to think anymore. Sure carater animations &amp; some special effects are nice, but all the other environments, singleplayer play styles are gone, what I have seen in the game so far, only one (empty) city map remains (for now). In single player are some impossible accurate dudes, which is not fun at all. Multiplayer is same map &amp; you need a friend to test it out because server is empty. Game also needs lot of optimations, struggling to keep the constant framerate. Sure, it is hard to review work in progress, but right now I don't recomand this game.   Now when I had chance to play latest version (v1.7) I can see where the game wants to go or what to be. It have goals, powerups and enemies to stop you. But right now there is very long way to go. There is only one map (other 3 are missing) and one character to select (other 2 are locked), poor enemies AI, some missing textures, no multiplayer, no way to change controls, graphics settings (only resolution and Vsync) etc.  Edit: You can change graphics settings in the menu Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful &amp; Fantastic.  There is definitely something unique about the game. I don't think it will be great game like Killing Floor or Left for Dead are, but there is a change it will be very cool game anyway, will see I may change my review to positive in the future.   Edit: 01.11.2015 Developer have fixed the issue.  Sadly I can't say much for the game, because I only have early DRM-Free release of the game (v1.4), but it looks promising. Right now it is not possible to install game from steam. No size is shown during the install process and after 'successful' install there are only empty folder in steam game directory. Verifying the game files has no effect. Developer response to the problem 'Hello,pls try to access ur steam account in other pc just for test undeads download,i ave test game build and work done.Maybe ur steam game folder are wrong?' Well I have almost 2K games installed to my PC and this is only game I have that problem.

11634	  Stupid idiot game : worst programming ever !!  Impossible to apply adequate graphics option (totaly useless anyway : this is not a game you would play for graphics).  Impossible to rebound keypad touches so it's stuck in â¥â¥â¥â¥ing qwerty  No indication of controls or whatsoever : after 10 minutes, never been able to found the reload command.   Save your money and go away :o
11635	I should have got this game during the xmas sale.
11636	In a nutshell, it's a sub-par ripoff of Thing Thing Arena flash games. There's no way to figure out or set controls, therefore I have no idea how to use grenades. There are only like two enemies I have encountered and you can only blow their heads off to which, for whatever reason, a ram's jaw bone falls down with a splatter of blood in the same animation for each enemy killed. It's pretty boring, but it was bought for me so I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
11637	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te4ogUHaiqA   Enjoyed it for about 10 minutes, if that. Can't say I won't play it again though. Wasn't bad, but felt limited. Thing Thing comparisons are pretty accurate, which I found out later and now feel less favorable to this title. Also, you get the rocket launcher, you're a god, removing much of the strategy that existed prior to unleashing that beast in the arsenal.  Appreciate the hand drawn artwork, really dig the music/score, ideas are good but purchasing/equipping could use with one less click of the keyboard, and I gotta say I'd probably like it more if it were a twin stick shooter than mouse and keyboard. Wouldn't mind bigger levels (these three are just too enclosed), and wouldn't mind on-line co-op or arena-style matches in the future.  Only thing I can say (and didn't notice when recording the above video) is the main character looks like he's just short of holding a watermelon with how close to early racist drawing or statues I've seen in antique shops, though it's probably more an accident than anything.   Side note: Achievements don't seem to want to unlock at the time of posting this review.
11638	The game is very cheap, but probably not even worth it at this price. There are 4 types of enemies, 7 weapons and 5 levels. There are no options other than mute or unmute sound. The game plays exactly the same as the Madness and Thing Thing series of flash games, but is less polished and has less depth. Rather than playing this game, you'd be better off playing one of those games.  You can do all the achievements in about 10 minutes though if you just buy the Rocket Launcher ASAP.
11639	After getting all achievements in this game in the short time I played it for, I cannot recommend it.  For a start, it is short, there's not much point to it but survive. The game progresses so fast that there is no point in buying any weapon but the strongest (which you get fairly quick). The graphics are nice, but quickly become bland and boring. There are 4 enemy types, each with different 'abilities', and different damage required to kill (Unless the saw gun, everything is 1 shot kill). The main issue I had with this game is how it lags, each enemy produces a blood splat when killed (up to the demon enemy, which is lots of blood and an explosion), the problem with this is, if you kill too many enemies in succession (which it rapidly spawns) in a small area, the game laggs up and becomes unplayable.  All in all it's not bad for a flash game, where it should be, but by far from being a good one. Save your money and play a flash game instead, it will probably keep you occupied for longer.
11640	not bad for 15 minute game not recomended at full price need multiplayer/local co-op 5/10
11641	I regret buying this game its buggy and barely works, the *ahem* 'art style' is made in what looks like ms paint. This is a game you make for a test in school or to get better not something you give away for money.
11642	In a nutshell:  1 - Buy the game (on a hardcore sale if you can) 2 - Play the game 3 - Get all the achievements in less than 2 hours 4 - Refund 5 - ??? 6 - Profit!
11643	Bland, tedious, repetitive.
11644	At least at this stage the game is really not worth buying. While I believe the developer did a good job with music and atmosphere, the overall impression is very negative. While the fact that the game is very short (15-20 mins top) would be acceptable, the game lacks pretty much in everything. The english translation is terrible and in many places simply doesn't make any sense. The story, specially the endings, could have been better as well, as of now it looks incomplete and flawed. The coding needs polishing (for example, the character will comment things like 'that's my wife's tomb' both when entering and when exiting the crypt, breaking immersion) and there are plenty of graphic glitches and just incomplete/imperfect assets, the messages written on the walls look like bad photoshop result. Flashlight needs tweaking (in some places, if you turn it off, you will be in complete darkness, while if you turn it on you end up blinded) and an ingame tip to use it if needed (if I haven't checked the controls before starting the game, I wouldn't even have known you had a flashlight). Overall, skip it. This game still needs lots of work.
11645	Pros - They said the game was short. It was short. +for Honesty  Cons -Key system, find a key to everything -I found 1 enemy, and he just stood there. I even walked up to him, and he did not do anything. -Again it was short. -I'm out of thins to say, because there was not much to go on. ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
11646	I'm actually quite sad to be giving this a thumbs down because it contained at least two minutes of genuine, well manufactured tension but, uh... well: 'I loved him better than all, I did not expect that he will go crazy and kill me with an axe. But I love it all smooth.' Could you possibly take the drugs AFTER you write the script next time, please? Bemusement and mild terror for your viewing pleasure:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G08wVn-qE2I 
11647	I can't believe i paid for this. It's not a game, it's not a story, it's .... pseudophilosopher on heavy drugs.... Worst thing ever, you should be ashamed selling this...  Not worth money, not worth time. And story is baaaaad, really, really bad.
11648	This game was very short. I believe that I cloched about 10 minutes for my playthrough. There was a period of about 2 minutes of solid tension that could have been excellent, but the rest of the game was pretty rough.    Pros -  developers were honest about length 20% of the time played was pretty excellent in its tension building  Cons- Too short for any sort of purchase Grammer was terrible....and WAY too much exposition. There was actually an arrow on the wall of an ancient church that directed you in the correct path.    This game is going to be murdered on youtube.  
11649	For a game this short, I was hoping it would at least be high quality or scary. No and no.
11650	 Reasonably well packed pile of nothing
11651	Game is complete dog â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Wouldn't even play for free. BEWARE. do NOT purchase this. 
11652	The Atmosphere and the feel are just right and well done. Unfortunately I ran into some glitchy bugs that really slowed me down. This isn't a bad game concept, I'd love to see more story about the family and what happened, and areas besides the few in the game. I grabbed this up to do a Let's Play   which can be found here  , I dont think this game was a failure, in fact I think it was a promising look at what could be better games in the future. I can't recommend it because of the shortness, the issues with the doors and monsters, and the immense amount of key hunting, but I can recommend that people use this as an example of the kind of story and the kind of game that could be the next big thing if done right!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGuY2bHaYSA 
11653	It's extremely short (I finished it in 17 minutes). Lacks basic english grammar (come on dude, learn some basics or at least find someone who can help you with english). Whenever I come close to any of the corpses and close in on a checkpoint fps drops to a lovely 15. The story contradicts itself. During the intro it's explained that the guy was possed and didn't know what he did but during the game and at the end it's stated that he's in hell for what he did and he somehow is okay with it although he had no control over what he did.  Needs volume controls (the dungeon part got very loud). Only good thing about this game is the decent atmosphere.
11654	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing SERIOUSLY. I mean...SERIOUSLY. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not...MOTHER. â¥â¥â¥â¥ING. SERIOUSLY.    I mean, are we not even going to PRETEND that we put any effort into something before we slap it up on Steam these days, even for a measly two bucks? Even if it was FREE, this would barely be worth the effort. Oh, and to save all you pedantic â¥â¥â¥â¥ers the time it would take to type one sentence...the reason it says I only played this for 0.3 hours is because THAT'S HOW â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LONG IT TOOK ME TO PLAY IT. TO THE END. Maybe even reduce that to 0.2 hours once you take into account navigating menus and what-not...   Not that such a thing would necessarily completely and utterly appal me, were those fifteen minutes comprised of almost non-stop 'sheer awesome'. A handful of keys to go through a handful of doors and gates is not, however, my definition of particularly awesome, even if there was one short bit in the game which actually terrified the LIVING â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me. But alas, I believe it was all bark and no bite, as I never got to see the monster supposedly stalking me.    The game also sports an admittedly unusual and genuinely interesting art style, and the sound is impressively oppressive, but other than that...SHEER AND UNMITIGATED â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I won't even bother to mention the quality of the English translations, as frankly, they're far from the worst thing on display here...though suffice it to say, 'I did not expect that he will go crazy' isn't really a sentence.   This, however, IS a sentence: â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU, MR MAMEDOV. I've been silly enough to buy TWO of your â¥â¥â¥â¥-arse games now. Do us a favour and spend some TIME on the next one, eh? You're not completely talentless, that's clear enough, but my you are one lazy, lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥er. Make your games LONGER, and BETTER. Or failing that, if you're still at the stage where you're learning the ropes, please don't ask people to PAY MONEY for your half-finished 'experiments'.    Better yet, team up with some like-minded people, as good games are rarely made by just one person, least of all some dude named Yuri who still lives in his mother's basement. Surely the guy who made 'Houston, We Have a Problem' lives just up the road from you - and I can't help but notice that his entire catalogue of 'games' has mysteriously vanished from the Steam store altogether - so if you put your heads together you might manage something half-way acceptable.    Hell, I'm a bit of a Hot Chocolate fan...everyone sing along...'I believe in miracles...'  Verdict: 3.5/10.
11655	Not a good game.
11656	Key to door simulator.  There isnt any sort of story here really....or at least, it's indistinct due to what I assume is a terrible translation. The actual game looked and sounded cool. There is a monster, but it does nothing. It offers you a morality choice for no apparent reason.  Basically, you just wander around finding keys to unlock doors while reading some terribly translated notes and taking in the admittedly cool looking grisly scenery...and then the game ends by letting you know that you are either cool with being in hell or have escaped hell by being given a second chance, although the game is also not really clear on what you really did. Presumably you killed your family, but one of the notes suggests that your wife actually killed you despite the fact that you killed her (and this is a great example of what a terrible translation can do to your story, lol). Why you would be given a second chance is indistinct. Also, there is a note that states that a monster is sealed in the church crypt with somebody acting as the watcher, and tells the watcher to flee if the monster escapes, lol. Anyway, the story wasnt really something that made any sort of sense. The common thread between the stuff you find was either left out or wasnt thought out well enough to include in the first place.  This actually had the potential to be a pretty cool and creepy game, but in practice, it failed miserably. After 10 or 15 minutes, you will have finished the game and will be left wondering what you had just been doing. You will definitely feel zero compulsion to bother playing a second time to witness the other ending (you have a generic good and bad ending available).  Also, the game is laggy as hell.  I wouldnt really bother unless you are bored and cant decide what to play. Definitely dont pay more than 10 or 20 cents for this one.  9 failed expectations out of 10 (do the math for my rating).
11657	So I bought this game because it was 2 dollars and was really board. The guy said the game was going to be short but I did not expect it to be 10 MINITUES LONG but what should we expect for 2 bucks. Also the monster is stupider than a bag of lemons    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex50nQuF4O0 
11658	I didn't want to give this game a bad review, I took it with a grain of salt that I shouldn't expect a masterpiece for what, $2? However I'm extremely disappointed in the very brief amount of time I bothered with this game. If I can run Fallout New Vegas smoothly on a high setting then I should have no trouble playing a game with graphics that look like it was made for a ps1 console. I absolutely struggled to do ANYTHING even on the lowest setting. The game was so laggy, so slowly paced and even from the second I pushed play I knew I would be highly unsatisfied when I began to read the nonsensical scrolling text that had not even been proofread or spelled correctly.  Even if it is a low budget Indie game I would expect that for a minimal amount of money the creators would not skimp out on grammar.  I want to say more about it but I can't because I couldn't bring myself to even try to get further in the game. Maybe I'll give it another attempt, it IS only supposedly 20 minutes long, but as far as my initial thoughts on my playthrough? I can't recommend this to anybody.
11659	  ALERT! Devs of this game are buying fake reviews! 
11660	I just finished this game, and while I'm not a professional critic I am a critical consumer. Having said this I wanted to voice my opinion to aid anyone interested in this title. This game's style in terms of overall concept and creativity is quite good and unique. However I cannot recommend anyone to purchase it. 'My Bones' is incredibly short even for a narrative. I completed it with both alternate conclusions in sixteen minutes. There are many bugs, grammatical errors, and it feels like a student project. (And likely is.)   Again from an artistic stand point I can appreciate what the developer was trying to achieve, but this alone doesn't justify a price tag of any kind. This should be offered as a free experience for the casual and curious. I paid ninety nine cents for this download, and while this amount is inconsequential, it is unmerited.   -A short review, for a short title-
11661	Basically a man killed his own family with an axe and wakes up in a weird place he thinks is hell: you'll take control of him and decide his fate by simply opening gates and doors with the keys you find nearby before being faced with a choice between 'dark' and 'light'. That's pretty much all, the actual game is nothing more than a few areas where you get a key, open a gate/door and move to the next area: it's dull, suffers from low production values and is extremely short.   PROS:   -the few music and audio effects aren't too bad   CONS:   -very little story, nonsensical 'choices' (do you want to leave hell and have a second chance or just stay in it?)  -stumbling English  -poor graphics overall, textures are quite bad even from a medium distance  -dull gameplay, navigate a couple corridors ---&gt; find key ---&gt; open door ---&gt; repeat  -no real horror or tension, it's just empty areas/ corridors with some 'scary' sound effects thrown in every now and then  -annoying loading screens to each area are also preceded by framerate drops  -a bit buggy, in my first playthrough an invisible wall'd persist for a few seconds in front of opened gates: the last area also suffers from graphical glitches  -extremely short, my first playthrough was 10 minutes, the second was 5: no replay value at all   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652237858   My Bones is simply lacking as a game, in fact there's not really much of a 'game' here. You walk around, look at uninteresting words/ phrases artificially pasted on walls, find a key and open a door to the next area: sure there's a 'beast' appearing briefly a couple times but it does nothing, it simply stares at you for two seconds and disappears...it also looks rather funny and not menacing at all.  I'd forgive shallow gameplay and pretend this is just a walking simulator if the story was at least interesting but sadly this isn't the case. What's there is either cliched, hard to understand due to the terrible translation or simply makes little sense: it's just vague words accusing you of your deeds or explaining once again you're in hell. When you consider it all the whole plot makes little sense and isn't gripping or surreal enough to engage you in any way. The two endings aren't explained either, why am I given two choices after navigating a few areas? Why'd I even choose the 'bad' one? No idea, no closure, no explanation to anything. The fact this 'ending' happens after 10 to 5 minutes you started playing is also embarassing, I understand this is a 2$ game but that doesn't excuse the sudden and poor way it ends, as if they ran out of ideas or funds and had to wrap things up quickly.  My Bones fails to deliver any interesting gameplay or story nor has any decent content going for it. I can't recommend it at any price nor is it really worth an install if you got it from a bundle like me (unless you want to sell the trading cards).
11662	This game is laggy, boring and overall not a game. Even as a joke game to play with your friends, you won't find any fun in this. WHO PUTS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KEY LITERALLY 3 FEET FROM A LOCKED GATE!? WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT?!
11663	Stay away from this badly put together 'game'. I took 15 minutes to beat it, and I still feel it was a huge waste of time.   Pros  - Some cool sound effects (nothing amazing) - the idea for the story is good  Cons  - Broken text, the guy does not even now how separate the words between commas (using the spacebar) - Terrible 'English' - Gameplay consists of getting keys to unlock doors, reading terrible notes and waiting for the next level to load - Choices are a joke
11664	It took just under half an hour to complete and that was with taking time to speak to a friend while playing.  The grammatical errors and spelling mistakes had me in stitches though.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=505958934 
11665	My Bones is incredibly short indie horror experience. The game can be completed under seven minutes. Unfornately, this horror title is more of a walking simulator. The atmosphere is almost praiseworthy. The soundtrack needs more work; the soundtrack of a video game is an integral aspect of the experience.   Whilst it is highly recommended to avoid purchasing this game, if one were tempted to buy it wait for a sale on the game. It is undoubtedly not worth the full price.   A brillant alternative to this game is Kholat; Kholat is story rich, good horror atmosphere and stunning detail.
11666	Check my playtime.......yes, it is that short  Coding is horrible, lighting is messed up, the english is a hilarious travesty and the selection of game-engine to operate the game was horrible. There is only one positive thing about it and that is the dungeon section with the pentagram. The choral music there is siiiiick and reminded me of Georgy Ligeti's music. That section was also quite fair  Seriously, i know in my heart by both experience and analysis..........that indie debuts can be thousand times better So you, the creator of this game, please remember im only attacking the game here, not you as a person. Peace!
11667	Just poor. Which is a shame as the screenshots and premise intrigued me. I wanted to enjoy this but the term 'budget' is an insult to every other budget game out there. The game just seems so rushed. It's like they started with some great ideas and then ran out of time and stitched the fragments together. Special note has to be given to the most gamebreaking translation work I've ever seen. It was somewhat more forgivable when it was scrolling text detailing the protagonists thoughts but when it's your dead family's scrawled notes on the wall it just becomes laughable.  I encountered no enemies in the game, though I did notice in another review that there apparently is one somewhere. Though given the main character's glacial plod and lack of attack move, I'm not sure what I could have done if I had.  The game was exceptionally short (about a dozen minutes, start to end, without rushing), though given the quality it was a small mercy. There was some amount of potential showing in the underground level where tension was starting to be built. Then all of a sudden, it stops, there's no payoff and the game ham-fistedly bungles you into the ending.  Avoid.
11668	scariest part about the game is the grammar i swear, it sounds like it was written by a 6 year old in vietnam. check my play time. that's 2 full play throughs, first time exploring everything and giving it a chance, the second time a speed run just so i could see what the other ending was.  seriously, don't bother, really laggy, mildly 3spoopy5me sounds/music, no plot to speak of, no character development, no difficulty whatsoever, really linear. you can even technically make it through without using all the keys.  they keep mentioning some beast being on the loose, and if you look through its cage you can see a fuzzy picture of what appears to be a butchered pig for a second or less. much scared, so intrigued.  would be better if there was actually something to run from, or if the developer hired someone to proofread, seriously. how do you expect to have a story driven game that is just unreadable.  oh, and no trading cards.
11669	Find a key here, open a door, find a key there, open a door, lots and lots of keys. The sound effects are ok I suppose but everything else is somewhere between boring and just god awful. Then for no reason the game ends after 15 mins or so and I just don't know what it was all about. Paid 30p in the sale. Save your money and give it to the homeless instead.
11670	Positives:  - 'It is a short but very interesting horror' + for honest developer (completed this game in 15 minutes)  Negatives:  - So ridiculously short it's not even funny - Terrible grammar - 'Very intresting horror'. No, no, no, no, no.... (read further down) - FPS drops down whenever I walk up to a corpse or a checkpoint for some reason - 100% key quests - No creativity or originality at all   Story:  'Very intresting horror'. I found some text in a couple of tombes and found one note with zero character development. That's it. Not to mention it's a clichÃ© 'I killed my family, now I have to go through hell for it' type of story, and you call that 'very intresting'?  Gameplay:  100% key quests, basic gameplay mechanics and zero replay value. Some scary moments, but besides that, the gameplay is nothing worth mentioning.   Conclusion:  I completed this game in 15 minutes, so at least I'm giving the developer a plus for honesty, but besides that, this game is not worth your money. It's a demo you have to pay for basically with no creativity whatsoever.  2/10 - Very bad, would demand a refund again
11671	Pros: +Some parts are genuinely creepy. The scenery is interesting and there's some decent use of lighting in places.  Cons: -Extremely short length (10-15 mins for a playthrough) -Very poor use of written English that breaks immersion -There's a flashlight, but the game feels creepier without using it. Unfortunately the flashlight is very bright, and is needed to find some things in the dark -The 'evil' ending is a bit nonsensical. The protagonist recognizes his own grave, and then his car won't start. Thus, he is in hell. -A subplot seems to have been abandoned (there is no monster in the underground hallways) -Main gameplay consists of walking around and finding a handful of keys to unlock doors. No interaction with other characters or objects
11672	- 15 minutes long - no action what so ever - terrible graphic - bad story telling - lots of commas - unbelievable long loading screens  no fun or scares experienced, dont buy this game.
11673	 My Bones  plays with a very interesting notion of choosing between the eternal bliss of forgiveness, or the burden of repeated purgatory. However, the game itself has no substance, and doesn't allow players to fully become immersed to the threatening ambiance.   The gameplay is slow, linear, and extremely choppy that at times I thought my PC was about to crash. It is also laughably short and riddled with grammatical errors in the very little text provided. The only real positive note within  My Bones  is the moody sounds that kept me interested for the 10 minutes it took me to finish the game twice (for the sake of both endings).  The only reason anyone should ever check out this game is to maybe have a friend who is not a gamer and scares easy try it out. But there's better options to do that with other .50 titles on Steam already, so...pass.
11674	Okay, so, seeing as I only spent 2$ on this game I wasn't expecting much...and that's what I got, not much.   The only part of this game that even came close to becoming a horror genre was the audio for me, it gets a little intense in a single part of the game then it ends. It's very short but that is a given, but, man, is it SHORT. I finished both routes in less than 40 minutes and that is only most likely because I spent some time looking at the surroundings.   It's straight forward and the hidden objects (only keys) are very easily found. I was expecting a bit more information on the storyline, but you get simple short scripts at the beginning and end while you are left to piece together the rest. Not to mention you can tell it wasn't a native english speaker who pieced together the words for you to read. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but I feel this should have been cared for a little better in a game that really all you should expect from is a short story. However, low budget is low budget.  Now, while I was disappointed, I was a bit surprised at the surroundings and honestly the textures and graphics aren't even too terrible.   Breakdown: I wouldn't buy it again, but if you feel like playing a VERY short totally unintersting (to me, at least) game with decent graphics...go for it.
11675	This game needs some damn autocorrect.
11676	You can say what you want about this game but it offers a lot of value when it comes to commas. Never,have,I ever,seen,so many, incorrectly,used,commas. At Â£2, there's probably a good comma/4p, which is a very high rate. I bought it in a bundle so I'm laughing all the way to the bank.  If you don't care about commas though, there's not much here. It has a decent atmosphere, although the sounds are very low quality. The graphics are circa early 2000. The game took me 10 minutes to complete, but some of it was a little rushed, with exploration probably another 5 minutes. The gramma (as slightly touched upon) and spelling is bad. The story is confusing, after walking around a graveyard, your transported to a few abstract scenes, which involve more walking.  Can recommend if you're into: High comma/value ratio. Like walking with heavily compressed sound and bad graphics. Want a 10 minute horror game about a dude who was dead but now is not dead but is still dead.  Can't recommend if you're into: Not spending money on short games. Like the horror genre. Have,a,strong distaste for,bad gramma,and spelling.
11677	I love it all smooth too.
11678	As George Thorogood would have said: Bad to the bone Bad to the bone B-B-B-B-Bad B-B-B-B-Bad B-B-B-B-Bad Bad to the bone(s)
11679	Uh...okay, this is probably the most uninteresting, uninspired, amateurishly slapped together 'game' I have ever 'played'.   Seriously. 'My Bones' feels like it has been clicked together by a 13-year old using some level construction kit. There are only 3 environments (Graveyard, Basement, Exit), possible interactions with your surroundings merely consist of crawling around gathering keys (while walking speed is incredibly slow) and using your flashlight... But hey, you can jump, too! But you only need to do so one or two times in the whole game (which can be completed in 15min if you take your time looking at stuff) So, let me sum the plot up for you:   #SPOILERS! (lol....)  -Wake up at graveyard, collect keys, go to church, walk up to some trapdoor, then -SHAZAM!- you are in the basement. -Walk around in basement, collect keys, open door then -SHAZAM!- little intersection with nonsense text (it doesn't deserve being called 'story', really...) -Walk forward -SHAZAM!- you are at the exit. -THE END.  Alright, I use the term 'SHAZAM' for a reason.  You basically just walk up to an invisible event trigger, then without notice the game starts preloading some assets for new surroundings (which takes up so many resources that the game starts stuttering, even on high-end hardware) and you are magically warped into a new environment. Shazam...  The whole game is flooded with spelling errors. I hate that. It just underlines how poorly done it is...   To be fair, audio is okay! At least with no headphones on...  Don't be fooled by the affordable price, 'My Bones' is not even close to being an Indie title (except you define 'Indie' as 'Puking on the keyboard and publishing the resulting code on Steam'), it's not even a Demo. It's just a joke I can't laugh at. Sorry. I just feel ripped off when I'm asked to pay real money for stuff that even I could have done better than the one who created it.  (I know I'm being a real meanie here, but I'm sick and tired of this kind of crappy products polluting the Steam market and degrading the 'Indie' genre. At least have your mum spellcheck your games if you really have to throw them at people!)  Sigh....
11680	Awful. I really love indie horror, but this was appalling. The grammar and spelling was terrible, the gameplay was jerky, the story line was incomplete and cliche. Only enjoyable moment was turning around to find that the empty room I had been in was now full of corpses.
11681	It took me roughly 25 minutes to beat this game twice, to see both endings and all the little touches in between. The rest of the time was waiting for card drops. It's a decent enough short story that really didn't translate into game too well. It feels like there were a lot of details in the creator's head that made cameos in the game and never actually got to exist. 'The Beast' at least gets to beat on a door for a second before the game clumsily suggests that you are the most evil thing in the room. Or you're the beast. Not sure, since all it does is make bodies appear when you stand near its cage. Also, the game suffers heavily from the author's non-fluent-English as the entire game is story-driven and all in written text.
11682	  So what can i say... I finished this game after 15 minutes so its pretty short for a game.  - The gameplay is ok. - With headphones this game can be really creepy and mindfck u.  I give this game a 7/10.
11683	I have played a lot of games in my life but i can safely say this is the WORST GAME I have EVER played. you can literally finish the game in 5 minutes. I don't need to say no more. 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MINUTES. the rest of my playtime is for trading cards.
11684	Bad grammar, glitches, and poor story telling. Nothing about this is good
11685	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV9BvqjiwTA  My Bones is a short indie horror game brought to us by publisher/developer Infernal Dream, the same company that has provided such titles as VERGE:lost chapter, White Mirror, and Lost Souls. Sticking with its trademark, My Bones is made in Game Guru, and features overly-long loading screens when transitioning from one area to the next.  Sticking with the format of the other games from the developer's library, this title also features extremely poor optimization and horrid framerates. Even on my mid-high end rig, I saw no better rates than 44 FPS, and as little as 14 in some points. There is zero direction, and absolutely nothing that tells you about the control scheme of the game; with the exception of pressing E to pick up keys and open doors.  Yes, My Bones is a key finding simulator... a very short, horrendously optimized one. I spent most of the game wandering around in the dark because I had no idea that you apparently have a flashlight. There's supposedly an evil piggie in the second level, but I'd only heard it oink once, and it was no threat at all; therefore I don't believe that you can actually die. There are two endings, one good and one evil, but I'm uncertain as to why you would put yourself through the pain of this game more than once, just to see an alternate, mostly text-based ending.  I could also point out the poorly written aspect of this game, but I really hate doing that to developers who obviously do not have English as a first language. Yes, the grammar and punctuation is bad, but I will say at least the developer tried. I've seen many other developers stop trying to translate their games into English because of this type of criticism. A better proof reader, or translator, would help a lot in this scenario, but the plot points still come across just fine.  It confuses me as to how My Bones has a Very Positive and Mostly Positive rating on Steam, and how there are so few negative reviews on this game. Have people become so willfully accepting of badly optimized, poorly written, key finding simulators masquerading as horror games? This title is nothing short of horrible, and I would go as far to say as it's worse than VERGE:lost chapter, just with fewer loading screens... because it's significantly shorter. I got this title on sale for $0.65 CAD, and I honestly regret it. Stay away, even when it's on sale. Play Fingerbones instead... not only is it a hundred times better than this game, it's also free.   Rating:  0.5/5.0  - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.
11686	'My Bones' is an interesting, very short, atmospheric narrative - nothing more.  =====  CONS:   - Lack of story: There's a story here, but, its not fleshed out enough. It's cliched and lacks any engaging hook to pull the player in.   - Lack of puzzles/challenges/obstacles: Find a key, open a door. ...That's the difficulty level. It wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but it really feels like its only here to slow the pace and pad the game, so as to give the illusion of more gameplay. I would consider that a negative.  - General lack of content: Just as stated. There's really not much, at all, to do.  - Abrupt ending(s): Just as stated. They just kind of... end.   - Broken English: I feel this game would have faired better had it been released in either the developer's native tongue only, or with the option to play in a (broken) English mode. Its understandable if one's main dialect is used in a game, as they want to share, but it really detracts from the overall experience having it solely in a language that is clearly not a primary one. Its not terrible, but it helps to break immersion, and some word choices are so wrong that they completely muddle the intended meaning.  - Transitions: They are abrupt, and just 'bonk' you into a new area. There's no real transition. Example: Walking through a dungeon-like area, go through a door into a hallway; loading screen -&gt; Now you're outside in a field, somehow. Very confusing... not even a portal or two to explain the jump?    NEUTRAL  -/+: Very short: The game itself takes less than 10 minutes to play through. That's not necessarily a positive, nor is it a negative. Games like 'The Graveyard' are nice, short titles that give a feeling, and deliver it very well. Other times, however, short can mean 'lacking content'. This kind of falls into the middle, as further highlighted in my 'PROS' section.    PROS:  + Very atmospheric: The atmosphere is very unsettling. The developer knew what they wanted to share as far as mood, and really made it clear.   + Visuals: The lighting, and overall ambiance of the game was just fine. It looked good, was detailed enough to prove that they put time into design, and was obviously planned, as opposed to slapped together like in some indie titles. Good job on that front~  + Audio: The audio files used were well placed, and fit the game very well. There were no tacky noises, nor were there any overly used ones either; they didn't milk them. They were well placed and added to the overall 'setting' that was in place.    =====  Would I recommend 'My Bones'? Well.. sadly, not.   ..Not for money, anyways.  As a free to play game, I would definitely recommend one to give it a go for interests sake.  I am a strong advocate for Indie developers making games and trying to tell a story.   This game, however... doesn't feel finished.  It feels... weak, with a promise that doesn't deliver.  And now, I think I'll go and rest my own bones for the night~ Pass.
11687	I mean you could buy this game you might even be able to play it for free one day  but here's a thought...  just dont...  I mean it.  you dont have to do this to yourself... i'm here for you... put the mouse down,  and just dont.  
11688	About as amatuer as it gets.  The graphics were ok, but the story is weak and the English translations are poor. They missed out on some jump scare opportunities and the game is very short for its price tag.  Only good on super sale as a cheap stocking stuffer.
11689	Feels like someone's school project, in a way.
11690	GameGuru Error 3005 Sound volume value illegal at line 60838. No help from the devs. Game looks nice tho, will watch it on youtube.
11691	So bad I refunded my 50 cents.
11692	A very intresting looking game let down by small map sizes and even smaller play time.
11693	 https://youtu.be/8yPBbbxMILo   From the start it's clear that this game was not made by native english speakers which unfortunately greatly diminished the game's ability to make an impact on the player. Any tension or suspense is drained from the game due to hilariously poor writing.  Mechanically this narrative exploration game is too short to give players time to care about the characters being described. From a technical standpoint the long load times and poor frame rate further diminish the experience.
11694	The walking seemed increadly slow, which i feel was done to simply make this short game a few extra minutes longer. The jumping mechanic was useless, but kind of comical with how little you move. It was jarring whenever the game would throw you into a loading screen and into a new area after you were justr walking around more graveyard or what seemed like another halway, this just destroyed any bit of atmosphere the game had treid to create. There was no horror, nothing was scary, just annoying, like when the sounds that were supposed to make you uneasy were just droning on and way louder than the rest of the game sounds. I had no problem with the graphics, except when the terrain decided to start flashing any time i turned like an epileptic nightmare. This was kind of a mess.
11695	Well it's more like a walking a simulator. There are some pretty basic puzzles, like find 3-4 keys which are in obvious locations, then you finish the game.   It all took 15 minutes.   Also I didn't understand the story. The only positive point is the creepy music in the dungeon, that reminds you of a horror game, other than that I'm glad I didn't pay for it :).  It should be free to play...
11696	This is trash. And don't immediately think I failed to understand what it was trying to do. It just did it very poorly.
11697	This is one of those games where I looked at all the negative reviews and decided to just play it for myself, which turned out to be a mistake. Although I only spent 50 cents on this, I still kind of regret that purchase, and that should tell you something.   Now, let's talk about the game itself. First thing I should say is that this game ran like complete trash for me. I was barely hitting 30fps and this game is no graphical showpiece. Also, the last graveyard sequence completely broke for me and I couldn't see anything unless I crouched walked because it seemed my head was clipping through some invisble ceiling 6 feet off the ground. For the story, you wake up in a dark cementary and for the next 20 minutes spend your time looking for keys to doors. The translation is pretty rough, which you'll notice pretty fast in the unskippable scrolling text intro sequence. The story is kind of meh and there are two endings(good &amp; bad), which aren't very dramatic.   Pros:
11698	**sigh** more litter on the Steam horror tag. Visually the first place you find yourself in is pretty cool. After that it's a bunch of random nonsense with the minimum amount of story to push you along, and even that doesn't really make sense. There was clearly no proofreader on hand, or if so they were dumb as hell, because the few notes around were absolutely atrocious, they made my brain hurt.  This game amounts to nothing more than a key hunt. That's it. You can beat it in like five minutes with ease.
11699	The game was even shorter than I expected. Points for atmosphere but not much else. The broken English was incredibly frustrating, as well. Definitely would not recommend.
11700	Could be better. Story could be interesting but the game is unfinished. Moving is hard and can cause dizzyness... If it was free it could be a good 15 mins. But 2,00 $ is way too costly...
11701	really short i mean REALLY short horror game i didnt see a monster in the game once and it took me 20 min to finish it
11702	Fun concept and good controls with a lot of personality but the shooting gets boring really fast and there's not enough variety to the gameplay to keep met interested. You just shoot the same enemies over and over and the guns mostly feel the same with only a few exceptions.
11703	This brand-spanking-new horror game was apparently made on some program called GameGuru ('the easy game maker'). It proudly tells me this on the menu screen. And I have to say, on the strength of this product, should I ever decide to join the glut of people currently making cheap-arsed, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ horror product in their bedrooms...I might make it a point to avoid GameGuru like the plague. I also might not opt to make and release a game, especially for money, until I confirm that I: a. Have some actual talent making games, and b. Have some remotely worthwhile ideas to fill said game with. Luckily for all of us, Mamedov Yuriy has no such hesitations. He/she/they have made a game, and while it starts promisingly enough in the first few minutes - in which you run down a dirt track through some admittedly lovely scenery - it's all pretty much downhill once you actually reach a large, spooky, asylum-like building and step inside.    In VERGE:Lost chapter - that's precisely how it's written, so for reasons of aesthetic purity, I shall keep it that way - you play a small, kangaroo-like creature (a wallaby, perhaps?) who hops along the corridors of said spooky building, goes through lots of doors, and triggers an excruciatingly long load screen approximately once every thirty-seven seconds. That's when you are not enduring excruciatingly long text screens which, in addition to scrolling by at the speed of darkness, CANNOT BE SKIPPED, at least as best as I can tell. Oh, and did I mention that you CANNOT SAVE at any point of the game, be it manually or by way of predetermined checkpoints...in spite of the fact that you'll basically be requiring a 'primal scream break' every ten minutes or so, lest you put a FIST THROUGH YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN?!    Now, none of this is to say that there's absolutely NO redeeming features to this game. Some of the sound is actually rather effective - emphasis on the word SOME - and some - again, SOME - of the graphics aren't too bad (well, some of the outdoor graphics anyway; the interiors are pretty much uniformly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥). Other than that, the painfully slow and vertigo-inducing movement basically led me to pack this one in before I'd even so much as laid eyes on a monster, though a quick glance at the trailer on the Store page assures me that I didn't miss out on much.    Y'know, when I was a young'un, I wasted an awful lot of my time and money watching almost every â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, low-budget horror movie I could lay my hands on. Nowadays, I'm relieved to report that I only waste similar amounts of time and money playing every â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, low-budget horror GAME I can lay my hands on. Hey...waitaminute...th-that's not any kind of PROGRESS, is it? God preserve me...WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!  Verdict: 2.5/10.
11704	Played it twice. Game only has 2 different places to make a path choice. You game length will be less than 15 minutes or around a half hour. The only thing you do in this entire game is press E to open doors, pick up keys, and unlock doors. You will also press F somtimes to see in dark places and read messages on the walls. That is all you do. The story is very vague and has a lame ending. Save youself the cash.
11705	I'm advising people straight up not to buy this game. It's slow and clunky; ugly graphics with awful loading times and not to mention dialogue riddled with grammar problems and typos. There's nothing scary about this. It's just slowly meandering down one bland 'scary' set piece to the next with no goal or focus. I couldn't even finish the game since the door I was supposed to go through at one point ended up being an invisible wall. There wasn't even a way to save.
11706	Scariest thing ever. 3spooky5me.  For real though, horrifying load time, cheap â¥â¥â¥ graphics and sound effects. Can't run or jump... looking for keys? Looking for keys in an atomospheric horror game?! What the heck were you thinking man? I swear on me mum, I want my two dollars back. I got stuck because I clipped through a wall to find your stupid key...
11707	Could have been a LOT better.Loading screens.....lack of content......VERY short.Got what I paid for though.
11708	I just finished this game, and while I'm not a professional critic I am a critical consumer. Having said this I wanted to voice my opinion to aid anyone interested in this title. I cannot recommend anyone to purchase it. 'VERGE' is incredibly short just as the previous game 'My Bones' I played from this developer. I completed it with both alternate conclusions in maybe fifteen minutes. Although there are not as many bugs and grammatical errors. The 'Demon' does actually work in this game.  Again from an artistic stand point I can appreciate what the developer was trying to achieve, but this alone doesn't justify a price tag of any kind. This should be offered as a free experience for the casual and curious. I paid ninety nine cents for this download, and while this amount is inconsequential, it is unmerited. A basic 'Copy &amp; Paste' review for this dev's second game. Though I do wish them luck with future projects as they continue to learn.  -A short review, for a short title-
11709	Features:   -Multiple endings (best ending is idling to get your card drops) -High quality graphics (A sight to see) -Tense atmosphere of fear (If you fear boredom then yes... this game will be quite frightening) -No cheap jump scares (Not anything really) -High quality audio support. (Deaf people rejoice) -Simple but enjoyable gameplay. (No gameplay that's enjoyable)  One of those games that even if they paid you to play would be considered a horrible waste of time.
11710	Your truck breaks down on a rural road, what seems to be in the middle of no where. Heavy rain starts to pour down and you find yourself seeking shelter. This is how VERGE:Lost chapter, the second title from indie developer M. Yuriy, opens. Let it be said now that if you intend on playing this game, prepare for some incredibly long loading screens that happen quite often. One complete playthrough for me had 8 load screens, which lasted between 30-60 seconds each.  The game starts off with a truly laughable rain effect that does anything but set the mood for terror. It's simply a couple of transparent JPG images looped to create the appearance of rain. The rest of the graphics are decent enough, though if you want to get the better experience remember to press ESC and go into the settings to set them to high; the game automatically runs on medium by default, which is much less impressive. There are only a couple of areas that have any real tension to them, but they last so briefly that it's all over before it actually began.  Whatever scare factor and terror potential that VERGE: Lost chapter houses is completely obliterated by the unreasonable load times. There's nothing quite like sitting around, picking your nails for upwards of a minute every 2-3 minutes. Just as a rough estimate of how often this occurs, I beat the game in 30 minutes; during that time I experienced 8 load screens. That means on average, every 3.75 minutes I came to a standstill at a load screen, and out of the time I spent playing the game, roughly 5-6 minutes was dedicated to load times. That, ladies and gentlemen, is worse than the Playstation 1 era.  Overall, VERGE: Lost chapter isn't anything special. You can choose from two different endings, but neither of them are anything to write home about. The 'good' ending even has a massive plot hole in it. It's definitely not worth sitting through the loading screens again to go back for the other ending, either; just YouTube it. Without these awful sequences, the game might've stood a fair chance, but since they won't be getting patched out or fixed up, completely avoid this mess.   Rating:  0.5/5.0  - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.
11711	All these positive reviews......Did we play the same game?  The game ultimately, is what it is!........It's a walking simulator. And an over-priced one at that!  This should be a Free to Play. Even $2 is to much for this Title.   Is this game finished? Or maybe this is Apha/Beta? If it is still in development, then it may be worth $2?
11712	VERGE:LOST CHAPTER is hideous. Hideously written, hideously designed, hideous to the core of its being. The developer's previous game MY BONES might have suffered from amusing translation issues but at least there were a few moments of genuine atmosphere in there. This is just a disjointed collection of stage designs stapled on top of one another in GameGuru and flung out on the storefront for a pittance. Find twenty-six skulls! Battle through two empty mazes of storage tanks! Flee from a bald woman! Go to clown prison! If that sounds fun in even a tastelessly terrible way then I have failed to save you from VERGE's budget clutches and that will rest forever on my head.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjeZcLE7o1Y 
11713	Absolutely horrible.  Tons of painful loading times. Even to load â¥â¥â¥â¥ like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hallway. Several very slow scrolling dialogue cutscenes that are unskippable. Laggy, clunky, choppy. You have the ability to jump, but you go about one inch off the ground and it is never used for anything. It kinda just looks like your screen is slightly glitching.  The 'puzzles' were lame, not engaging, and were NOT fun. There is one where you collect skulls in a massive field, and a giant â¥â¥â¥â¥ing maze that has the most repititious and unimaginative scenery I have ever seen. Apart from that all you really do is run through a ton of rooms (that look exactly the same) to find one key. And then you continue to run through hallways that look exactly the same. To end up at a place that looks exactly the same. The endings were complete garbage and uninspired.  This game sucked and I would not recommend buying it, even if it's on sale.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT*** The 'good' ending was so bad that my brother and I laughed about it. The game starts off with the premise that your car is broken down and you need to seek help before nightfall. During the 'good' ending you just run back to your car and drive home. So â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad.
11714	what a load of junk dont buy this game if this is what steam are calling it its not worth my or your time even if it was free its still aload of garbage i can not belive steam are letting games like this on the system
11715	  Instead of the free version of fps creator the dev decide to use the software 'GameGuru' which is the new version of fps/ version that cost 10 bucks.. Unfortunately the game is terrible. All you do is find keys and open doors. Graphics are bad and you cant RUN and jump is about an inch high! Most of the ingame stuff are paid assets. Developer clearly doesnt know how to make a game after his 3rd try.  Pros Steam trading cards puzzles 2 different endings  Cons Gameplay is short about an hour for both playthroughs puzzles are lame Unskippable dialogue cutscenes  Cant run All you do is find keys Graphics bad Laggy gameplay
11716	This is not a horror game.  There are no enemy(well.. there is 1), no puzzle, no coherant plot nothing works for this game at all. It's a gameguru game and graphic setting are defaulted very high and may cause you to have some frame rate drops.   Half of the game are either loading screen or really slow text that's try to drag it self up.   You walking around in a dreamlike nightmare state feels exactly like My Bones except this time it doesn't feel scary at all. Just massive repetitve copy and paste to try to make the game feel larger and longer.  2/10 avoid this one at all cost.. it will be the worst 30 minutes you spent of your life.
11717	This game it's a waste of time , don't recomande it . You can pres F - for Flashlight , And E - For open a door , pick a key. I finished the game in 39 minutes. And was the worst 39 minutes in my life. The game haved just a jumpscare , and that don't even scared me..
11718	  Not worth money at all. Would be understandable if it was some dude's college project. But this is a sad excuse of a horror game. Textures did not load correctly, framerate dropped like crazy, and the loading times were slow.
11719	Unsightly graphics and gameplay is typical of a cheap indie horror title. The game can occasionally build a subpar form of tension, but then the overall gameplay and graphics take away from any real horror experience. The game is short like most horror indie games.   This game is not worth any consideration.
11720	2/10  Being a fan of horror games and someone who likes to support small developers - and also keeping in mind this game was made with GameGuru -, I really wanted to come here and recommend this game.  Unfortunately, I can't.  The rain sound effect right at the beginning loops in such a way that you can tell when it loops, as there's a fraction of a second where the sound pauses. The loading screens take WAY too long to load and it completely breaks the game's immersion.  But the game's biggest flaw is that it just... Lacks content. It's incredibly short and it really has nothing to it. No compelling story, no challenge level, no puzzles, nothing. You really just find keys to doors, avoid some few and incredibly easy to avoid hazards and that's it. Also, your actions don't affect the ending, because you literally get to a part where it says 'choose your end'.  Here's the story on how I saw both endings the game has in less than an hour, and I'll keep it spoiler-free: I started the game, got to a part where you have to choose three paths (one of which leads to a locked door). I picked the left path, got stuck in a place that seemed to be a labyrinth of some sort. Couldn't find anything else or no exit so I started over and picked the path forward. After the door I went through on that path, the game gave me more story, so that seemed to be the 'correct path'. After that I was in place where I had to get a key, then get past a hazard, then get to a place where I had to get another key. After I opened the door with that key, for some reason I had to constantly jump towards the open door because the game wouldn't let me in. Then I got to the 'choose your end' part and once more I had to constantly jump through the open door of the ending I chose. Saw the ending, played the game again, didn't get stuck in the doors this time, chose the other ending, got to another area with a hazard to avoid, saw the other ending and done.  And none of the endings explain anything about the story.  I'm not going to say the developer of this game doesn't deserve your money - everyone has to start somewhere and I believe people can learn from their mistakes. However, other than supporting a small developer, I really cannot see any other reason to buy this game at all. Even for the incredibly low price the game has.
11721	After opening the first key locked door, there was a bug and I couldn't continue. Anyway, too many visual bugs, poor design. Terrible.
11722	Game took me about 20 min, 10 of which was looking for a key in an area with the same hallway and rooms copy and pasted 20 times over. Then I found another key and then the game was over. Didn't go to or see any of the other areas in the game. Don't know if I missed much story, because there was literally none, besides this guy ending up in an old asylum, then escaping in 5 min and driving to the cabin he was planning on going to. There was 1 semi scare and thats about it. It was just over so fast and there was literally nothing to it. 3.5/10.
11723	its garbage, the whole bundle of games...they all crashed for me. every one of them. it was a waste of what little money i paid for them! do not recommend buying this.
11724	Terrible. Just terrible. There are no redeeming factors here whatsoever, let alone any horror. I should have known after playing My Bones that this would be terrible but I seem to be a glutton for punishment. I thought maybe, just maybe the developer would have built on the initial game which showed some promise under the layers of terrible design choices. At least this time round, whilst still terrible, the text in the notes lying around is at least on a par with a 12 year old text messages, as opposed to the gobbledegook of My Bones. Good luck trying to find all of it. For some reason the developer thought it would be a good idea to put the writing literally on the walls, only the walls were white and the text was a slightly brighter shade of white. But no matter as it's not worth hunting down, the story makes absolutely no sense. Something about an asylum and an experiment involving children and how one of them becomes superpowered and then rages out of control Then there are clowns for some reason. Technical flaws are abundant. The game lags so hard and is so badly optimised, yet still looks like absolute crap for this day and age. Then there's the door issue, which is seemingly the only thing you can interact with in this game. You open the door, it swings wide open, but you can't cross the threshold until the door has completed its opening animation which takes several seconds too long. Absolutely ridiculous, and the developer thought the best way to draw attention to this was to throw a few doors in during the game's only chase sequence. It's beyond laughable. Then there's an odd 'choose your ending' thing at the very end for some bizarre reason, which was basically about making a choice between a cozy bed or an electric chair watched over by an ominous looking clown. None of this game made any sense whatsoever. And at the end, spoiler alert, and this seemed like the developer was actually just trying to insult your intelligence, as if playing the game wasn't enough of a torture, but in the ending epilgoue text, it talks about how after you escape from the asylum you run to your car and drive away as fast as possible. The only reason you wandered into the asylum in the first place was because your car broke down!!! Avoid like the plague.
11725	Do you like balls? If you do, you should probably buy this game. If you, like quality this is probably not your go to stuff. This game is the worst. This game is why they stopped making the two dollar bill, there's just simply no point. It's a waste. Save your money and go throw it in the street. I opened a door, the game crashed. I opened another door the game crashed. I looked for a key, the game, take a guess? It crashed. Stop wasting your money and go invest in something worth your time. This game is absolute garbage. But hey, if you like garbage, go ahead and purchase this lump.
11726	â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit.. so much â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't buy. Full of glitches/bugs and huge fps drops. #NotWorth
11727	Incredibly slow load screens, coupled with loading every 15 seconds, makes for an unplayable game. Add to that invisible barriers (open gate but can't go through the center), seemingly no way to save, a forced introduction/story crawl screen... it was an unpleasant experience.
11728	Horrid 'horror' game with terrible loading times and crude graphics which actually flash erratically on high and medium settings! This aside I thought I'd give it a chance. I walked down the first path, dead end, then took the other path and opened a gate which I had trouble even just to walk through! A few more linear 'corridor' sections then I was thrown into a maze which, to me, seems completely impossible to navigate! So, I tried again the next day (no save game so I was back to the start!) and found myself walking around a dull maze again for minute after minute then I quit the game and wrote this! I got it in a bundle but would probably still feel ripped off even at the price here on Steam!
11729	DONT YOU DARE RELEASE A GAME LIKE THIS AGAIN!!!!!!! THANK YOU . â  {CONS: OPEN DOORS SIMULATOR ð¾ THAT'S MORE SCARY THAN YOUR GAME  {PROS: IT WAS FAST [NOT BECAUSE IT WAS ENJOYABLE] {  It will be the worst 30 minutes you spent of your life.

11731	not good,or im just stupid and cant find out how to get out of the first hallway
11732	this game had me on the verge of   killing   myself from it being unplayable cause of graphic bugs  RIP the $0.49 I spent on this broken 'gay'me

11734	horrible... guess l need a better computer whit a great graphic card cant even move =(... and the loading screen take for ever guess a 2 dollars game if for rich people whit a $5000 computer machine...guess my $3000 not enough
11735	When i go to open the game, i here sound but there is no picture 
11736	Loading Screen: The Game  After every few steps you are faced with a minute long loading screen.  ItÂ´s nice that there are things like game guru, game maker and rpg maker but in no way shouls steam allow people to sell those games.  If you want to make a game for yourself or your friends go ahead, but selling this stuff on steam should be forbidden.

11738	My God, I have never experienced such a confusing game. Although this work of art is s.hit, the main focus I'm going to delve into here is that it is an all over the place screwed up game guru piece, that literally changes from an aslym for which theres seems to be no purpose, to traversing in a hole being given a crappy piece on context making no sense, followed by a skull gathering activity. Then back to the asylm randomly into a checmial field that will appear after going through some doors. My god this is one of the most astounding things i have ever played, and i've had the pleasure of playing a number of turd games such as Slaughtering grounds, dead effect and coma motuary. I am literally speechless  Other then that perfectly fine, well made for a game guru virus
11739	DreadOut: Keepers of the Dark originally was meant as a DLC for the original DreadOut game, but eventually surfaced as a standalone title.  Unfortunately, Keepers of the Dark does not have much to offer in its own right - you start in a mirror world of sorts that acts as a travel hub. From there, you can delve into eight different worlds, most of which will seem eerily similiar - not to the least because the better part of the terrain is copied from previous DreadOut levels!  The new ghosts presented in Keepers of the Dark are interesting in their own right - there's anything from haunted dolls to spectral horsemen (or horsewomen, rather) to insane canibals. Sadly, the piecemeal type of presentation which KotD uses means that each of these ghosts only has a minimal story behind it, and what little information the entries of the 'Ghostpedia' offer usually are presented in semi-broken English.  In truth, I think KotD makes one fatal mistake: Horror games, in general, rely on their atmosphere. You never know what's going to hit you, when it's going to hit you, and if it's going to hit you at all. Sadly, KotD does hardly build up any atmosphere at all - if you've played the original game, you already know most of the levels, and the new ghosts introduced in this spinoff only are scary until you understand the basic tactic needed to banish them. To be entirely honest, the ghosthunt gets tedious rather quickly, not to the least because you know that you need to banish a certain number of ghosts per level.  Coupled with the rather short playtime (aprox. 3-5 hours), DreadOut: Keepers of the Dark may perhaps be worth its relatively low price, but not necessarily your time - there are many better horror games to spend your time with.
11740	I really wanted to like this one. The first DreadOut isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it's a lo-fi game with lots of souls to it, and I truly enjoyed it, enough to 100%. Sure enough, I wasted no time in getting KotD and... well, it doesn't measure up to a bar that was kinda low to begin with.  KotD is pretty much just a Boss Rush type thing, with eight different areas, each with one or two bosses, and an item fetch puzzle or two to deal with; problem is, combat certainly wasn't the first game's strong suit, and pretty much all you'll get here is more combat. The boss designs are truly nice and show the creative capabilities of the devs, but that's about all the praise I can give. Pretty much all but one of them boil down to 'back away while taking pictures' and even that isn't particularly fun, as bosses tend to have movesets wildly incompatible with your slow character and stunlock you with annoying frequency.  All but two of the stages are recycled from the base game (with small changes at times, yeah, but still the same areas), so even exploring is off the table. The game has some nice set pieces, but even then they're badly executed - having a ghost girl count down to chasing you is legitimately spooky at first... and not very much on the fourth or fifth time it happens. The story is pretty much nonexistent and/or vague to the point of meaning nothing at all. Seriously, if there was any useful plot to be gleaned, I have no idea what it is.  To sum, good bosses with bad combat, barely any new areas to see, annoying gimmicks and backtracking and just about no development of the story. Not AWFUL for the price, but it's something I wish I had watched on Youtube instead. I'll be waiting for a new game from these devs, though, as I still have faith in them.
11741	Good thing - Keepers of the Dark at least tries to be a good game, unlike the original DreadOut. Bad thing is - it usually fails miserably at it.  It tries to not be a linear spoop-fest of jumpscares, like the original game was, instead trying to focus on the whatever basic mechanics the game has and trying to get the most of them. As such, it now instead consists of a hub-world and several short maps-levels, which can be visited and revisited in any order, with each of them trying to have a good interesting gimmick and main puzzle or puzzles to it.  With mechanics as basic as before, it's amazing just how much more varied and creative the game feels, with each ghost and each world trying to be something unique.  They are not, of course. And not just because all but 3 maps are from the original game, and new maps are terrible. Simply because most cases still simply devolve into stupid unbalanced glitchy damage races, with some things working incorrectly or not working, and some things being just pure bs in terms of what they demand of the player. Oh and all the story and tone things are still complete nonsense. At least, more visually interesting thing were created this time.  In the end, Keepers is both an example that perhaps someday these developers could do something good. And that, 'that some day' will not be anytime soon.
11742	Having downvoted the original DreadOut i was hoping for a better experience with the second game but sadly it wasn't...  I tried to play the game normally and seriously at first but straight from the start i got screwed over by a bug, normally the game starts as if you died and you have to go to the light, i didn't know that when starting and for some reason i didn't get that part and went straight to the hall with all the doors.. Doesn't sound like a big deal but none of the doors brought me to another level, they just opened and i could walk into the little rooms with red walls doing nothing. Already thinking that this was a 'puzzle' i got really annoyed and wanted to stop playing.  Figuring out that it was a bug i went on and gave it another chance, i did the doors in order starting with room 101 where i got greeted with a small stage with little amount of enemies and a boss to finish it off, annoying part 1, the boss got me stun locked in my hit animation for a couple of times which made me die in a frustrating way (the plus side of this game is when you respawn damage dealt stays so you can just keep on going). Door 102, i see mannequins and they trigger my glitch in the camera but it doesn't do anything so i stopped bothering with them not expecting that one of them is a bit different and triggers a chase, instead i find a pretty lady on the second floor that i couldn't kill.. again, annoying because i lacked the information knowing what to do, comparable to the first game. These annoyances gave me a sick feeling and i couldn't play anymore it was anything but enjoyable.   Couple of hours later i decided to take it less seriously 'cause i wanted to finish the game, i bought it and really wanted to play it so i'll make the most of it. I started playing again, took a guide with me to make everything faster and enjoyable and had a stream on my other monitor so i have something enjoyable to follow as well.   Knowing what to do and not wondering if enemies are immortal or not kept me in a flow to get through each room while sometimes even enjoying the game, there are a couple of enemies which are like sidequests were you need to collect items to make them weaker or collect parts of a picture to help a harmless boy. The variety in bosses is enjoyable were for example one of them is music related where you can't fight but you have to dodge the enemies untill the song ends (i read many complaints about this one being hard but i got it first try..) but beware of getting hit and stun locked for 3 hits in a row. Another boss only appears when you collect certain bodyparts shattered around the map where there's a hide and seek mission with a little girl and one of the coolest bosses is optional and the one i talked about before, the pretty lady in room 106, easier to beat if you collect needles found in stages and while fighting her she transforms and gets uglier.   Those are the things i liked but they don't make this game a recommendation for me, the fighting is messed up because you keep on falling down when hit which causes situations where you get stuck for 3-4 hits, the story itself isn't that interesting except for the small backstories of the enemies. Some enemies take a bit too long to take down and aren't challenging either which causes a small feeling of being a 'grind'.  It's a short game (3+ hours) for a low price but i needed a guide and distractions to enjoy it for a decent amount and that's not thumbs up worthy for me. I am aware that using a guide is a bit lame but i'd rather use it and finish the game and respect it for what it is than just dropping it and not giving it a proper chance.
11743	You have made the gameplay very difficult for people to enjoy, you cant run worth a damn, the bosses just knock you down over and over without a chance to even move. Even after dying you come back standing right beside the boss not even able to move without getting knocked down then having to wait forever for the girl to stand back up just to be knocked back down again. I like the concept of the game and the design of your creatures, however it is to frustrating to enjoy the scare when all thats happening is you getting knocked down and over powered at every second without even having a chance. Therefore i have given this game a bad review and probably will not continue to play it and will recommend people to stay scarce from it aswell. Please make this game more enjoyable to play then maybe ill give it another go. thanks alot for the crap game.
11744	This game isn't scary at all. Honestly its the same things over and over and boring.
11745	It runs badly, is written terribly, is voice-acted still worse than that, has awful PS2-era textures and animations, and noticibly repetative audio looping. Worst of all, all aspects of it are explained so poorly that I had to look up most of how to play online, and even then it didn't make any sense. I don't just mean the lore (Why would a ghost be afraid of a camera phone?), but the characters and their motivations were also gibberish. The thirtieth time an old woman ghost attacks with the same animation and shrill noise, it isn't scary. It's annoying. When you resume the game from the death area, and within a second you're already attacked again while trapped in a corner, it's bad pacing. I have genuinely zero ideas how this isn't getting savaged by reviews. It's truly abysmal in every way.
11746	No story whatsoever No interesting characters No real game mechanics asides from using a camera  Pretty much relying on jump scares and scary environments.... so basically most horror games
11747	Well, I was expecting that they will somehow make the game look better or improve the mechanics from the first but apparently they did not put that effort in.   Since I did not bother to finish the first, I'm not sure that I will finish the second neither for the simple reasons that it is not that scary, bad fight mechanics, lack of creativity (this is like a cheap rip-off of fatal frame), lack of storyline, bad graphics, etc.  Seriously I don't mind paying a premium if the game is well done but nonetheless it is another dissapointing sequel.
11748	No sorry, not a good game.  Everyone that gave this game a good review must be new to video gaming, this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.  First 'realm / room / whatever'  You donÂ´t know what to do in this Boss fight, die instantly, wait for a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minute until the girl stands up that you can control her, run along a â¥â¥â¥â¥ white light road, stand infront of the boss again ... die instantly .... repeat.  This is not a game, this is a piece of crap.
11749	The game is not my cup of tea. Seems kinda weird.  Gameplay With Commentary:  https://youtu.be/BBmRMLX07Oc   But, after playing a little more, the game has made my heart sink here and there. In one instance I had a little puppet girl following me and that scared me pretty good and am pretty happy with how it did. So the game seems like a puzzle game, you use a camera to kill some ghost and have to find ways to bypass the others. I think after the intro of the game is done and you play for a little it does get better.  For the price I would say it's an okay game. But still would not recommend the game to friends, unless they liked Fatal Frame.  My rating for this game is 6/10
11750	A promising aspiration of the horror genre that ultimately ends in hair-ripping frustration due to oversights in puzzle design. This game surprised me for its hilarious, loveable dialogue, cute characters and well thought-out puzzles up until the timed puzzle, which I'll get into later.  You play Gwen, who describes herself as a tomboy, who is in love with another girl called Flora. But this game isn't your typical love story or yuri, as the amusing ArKun villain is introduced, sets the tone for the rest of the game. You're now on a journey to save your girlfriend by going through very creative areas, set pieces, changes of pace and atmosphere at the click of a finger, and puzzle designs that took me back to the days of the old PlayStation 2 survival horror games such as Silent Hill 2, 3 and 4. The puzzle involving the animal heads was genuinely well-made, perhaps one of the best puzzles I've experienced in a horror game since Silent Hill 4.  The hand-drawn art is awesome, it fits the aesthetics of the game and is always a pleasure to look at. However, I would have preferred better transition effects from sprite-to-artwork, such as screen fades or something. Also, the scene near the beginning of the game where Flora is looking out over the cliff could have been enhanced with her hair blowing in the wind, to give it a dramatic effect. This also ties in with how much this game feels like a JRPG despite it being made by an American. As mentioned, the dialogue is surprisingly filled with comedic value - which doesn't detract from the game's enjoyment - but adds to it as it supports the style the game is aiming to achieve. You have lots of different characters, whom I all love, some have their own artwork which gives them even more character through visual narrative.  For a free game this is amazing, there is so much variety in this short-packed adventure, such as the Sloppy Joes, dark atmosphere of the underground crypts, to your everyday Highschool life. However, and this is where I can't recommend this game, is one of the final puzzles in this game. It is the segment that you dive into a lava pit with a timer and have to escape by solving the chemical puzzle, then traversing through the maze-like structure to avoid the lava, then become swarmed by double digit Sloppy Joes (who are the enemies in this game). This is incredibly frustrating, it feels too forced and pressuring to have this come out of nowhere, and it will try your patience as a human being. You either don't have enough time to finish this segment, don't have enough health to beat it due to forced damage, either too many Sloppy Joes swarm you at once, or the horribly unforgiving checkpoint system will make you want to jump our your window. A recent patch was deployed which was suppose to alleviate this infuriating design; but changed little to nothing. So if you're reading this and want to play this, be warned this puzzle will test you.  That said, for owners of Yai Gamesworks' previous game: Close Your Eyes, there is an awesome throwback moment to it, which I really loved and found funny. I won't spoil, but you'll get a giggle out of it for sure.  I can't recommend this game, however, because the instant rise of difficulty killed the game's tone, pacing and comedy value it had going for it. This kind of frustration and experimental puzzle design doesn't always work, and when it does it's usually added in a type of game that has this kind of trial and error persistent in its design. The Souls games, for example, is a mainstream series that glorifies this structured gameplay style. But in an adventure game such as this, where its value comes from the story and puzzles, stopping the player from continuing due to its own design is this game's only downfall. The developer clearly knows what they are doing in this game and, can for a fact, make good puzzles and atmospheric set pieces, but experimenting on abnormal design tradition to further the progression of what is a light comedy, adventurous game is not a mix that bodes well together. Perhaps a future patch can fix this, but I'm not willing to put up with furious design choices out of nowhere, especially after the disaster of a game that is NightCry. But with Take the Dream IX, there is clearly hope and light at the end of the tunnel that Yai Gameworks knows how to make great games.  And no, there is no Take the Dream I-VIII.
11751	I'll try to make this short.  It's about a girl, Gwen, who has a girlfriend, Flora, but one day she's kidnapped. You play as Gwen and you try to save your girlfriend. However, you will find some things about yourself while you travel.   Graphics:  They're OK. Its environments are cute especially those of the town, however, they're just like your typical based RPGMaker game. Some assets in some stages don't fit very well but I think this is the intention, so I don't have any complain about it.  Difficulty and puzzles:  You better have a paper on hand, but you will pass them without problems. Some stages have a time limit, some others make you play hide-and-seek.  Length:  Quite short, but it isn't a problem. If you want to play a short game as a form of relax, this one works.  Replay value:  There isn't.  Story and characters:  No opinion, I'm not the kind of person who ponders over about it: I like it or I don't, that's it. Basically I don't have any complain about it, but I can't say it is my favourite thing either. I can't *see* all about the story and characters though, because this reason I'll explain later on.  Price:  It's free.  So far, I would recommend it -particularly because it is free- but I've reported an error two weeks ago and I didn't receive any response, then, basically, it breaks the game and it doesn't let you to continue, thus I can't finish this game. Logically, I can't recommend a game I can't finish even less when it is a russian roulette, you either get this error or not. Once I'm able to finish this game, I'll change my review (or I don't, depending if I end liking this game or not).
11752	I would not recomend this game as-is, but I really hope the game designer continues to work on it; there is potential here.  For a game about how desperately one may cling to love, this game as it is now feels simply devoid of heart and meaning. Its silly use of tropes and unprofessional sounds/voices really take you out of the story. I hope the designer keeps trying, because there is a balance between meaningful and fun that can be struck here, and I think some more editing, tweaking, re-scripting the lines, and re-recording the voices would help make this an unforgettable jaunty adventure with a dark twist.
11753	4/10 The presentation was solid; many of the graphical choices added to the creepy atmosphere and overall the sound design was solid. The puzzles and challenges are fun but are too few. The story really holds the game back, I appreciate what the developer was trying to accomplish, making attempts to mess with the player's head. But mind-bending games only work if the early-game confusion is balanced out either by endgame understanding, or a very clear theme and message. This game offers neither, and when I finished I felt the game was too short and did not work hard enough to explain what was happening.
11754	the dev had made better game 'close your eyes' but the atmosphere in this game is inconsistent...
11755	  Honestly, I was really excited to see another game from the creator/producer of 'Close your eyes'.  In the beginning of the game the idea of mixing different story lines was amazing and the dark and creepy atmosfere was perfect. However, the main story and the developing of the characters was horribly awful and sloppy. I wasn't given the chance to really see the relationship between Gwen and all the other four characters presented to us (Kayto, Vera, Luna and I don't even remember the last one). So all the dialogue between them end up being pointless melodrama that only got in the way to the game.  Nothing was really explained at the end. Also, what was the point of starting the game with the story of a Goddess and a Demon King and a bunch of magic stones if this will be barely used in the game? Really, it was really annoying.  ----SPOILER ALERT---- Also, finishing with 'it was only a dream' made me feel like that were some 2 wasted hours that I could have used to something more fun and productive.   ---END OF SPOILER ALERT---  The game would be ok, if it wasn't for this horribly lazy storytelling
11756	the concept of jumping around within ones mind (i'm assuming only played first few min) is original however the puzzles are a bit touph i couldn't get past the ghost in the cabin in first few min of the game witch took all the fun out of it . best of luck but this game isn't for me i need a game i can actually win
11757	Another RPGMaker game. I feel like all of them are almost the same. BUT! This one is different - free, using other kind of sprites, which dialogues that person saying is marked with 'text background' color. Some puzzles, not actual fighting.  But still the way how this kind of games works pisses me off - because it's all making game slow. You want to switch position of something? You need to skip 3 texts, then choose one of 4 options. Great. Then make it couple times, cause you have couple things to change. It ain't fun. It's funnier when you step from one side and it turns into other. But no... that's definitely too hard to make. Ugh...  I tried to like this game.
11758	 I think there is a bug where you are in that purple map after the palace scene, and you go down the hallway and nothing happened, I've walked down the hallway for more than 10 times.   Solved:  go down the hallway then go up for 1 to 2 times.  At the beginning the story was fine but when you go deep the story get awkward and messy. The music and the demon king's voice were annoying.
11759	a what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, would recommend only if you have time to waste but there are too much childish dialogues for me, im going to finish it one day maybe when internet disruption will appear
11760	Bored after 10 minutes. A massive amount of pointless text amongst some fairly entertaining mini games. But incredibly slow and borederline painful.
11761	Complete and utter crap. Feels like it was made by a 12 year old and I REALLY want those 3 hours of my life back.
11762	um it sucks and i hate it
11763	boring
11764	Pitiful berry gathering simulator where the first night unleashes a plague of undead who you will spend the rest of the game fruitlessly trying to outrun while waving lumps of wood around in front of your face, attempting to build a wall.   No base that you construct will ever be as effective at stopping the zombies as clambering up one of the game's many pre-built lookout posts or just hiding inside one of the houses while the terrible AI pathing runs thirty of the idiots directly at whatever wall you're facing.  Don't.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbDe0gr113o 
11765	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN9-0JfRIR0&amp;feature=youtu.be   This is just a pixelated map thrown together with collectibles and randomly spanning enemies.  The game obviously tries to imitate superior games such as Minecraft or The Forest, but is plagued by technical issues and offers nothing original in return.  Here are some issues I have with this game:  - There's no tutorial: the game only tells you to press 'F' to pick up items -- everything else is up to you to figure out.  - Rudimentary crafting mechanics: the game boils down to picking up items from the floor (water bottles, wood, stone),  and clicking a button to create something. There's no sense of mining the environment or crafting the components,  beyond a cookie-cutter mechanism.  - Enemy model: the enemy is supposed to be a zombie, but it looks like a playable character, apart from making generic zombie sounds that get old really fast. More annoying than scary or interesting.  - Elementary AI: The enemies just follow you around, sometimes in a single-file, and get stuck in the environment.  - Fatigue system: You can run indefinitely, easily escaping the enemies until there are 300 of them after a few minutes.  - Technical issues: I've fallen through the border of the map, gone through objects, gotten hurt by enemies hitting me through walls. Could keep roaming around the map after dying. Haven't been able to put up a single wall (after creating a wall, the game only allows me to hit enemies with the wall).  - Overwhelming number of enemies: Enemies spawn all the time, leaving no room to enjoy the 'crafting experience'. I experience lag when I had 20 guys chasing me.  - Uninteresting map: The forest map is very small, has some houses, towers, trees, and collectibles. Nothing to harvest or explore.  - Costs $6.  Yes, all of that happened, as you can see from my video.  My playthrough consisted mostly of looking for bottles of watter, trying to figure out how to play the game, and running into issues.
11766	I'll make this short and sweet.  Simply put, this is just another lazy cashgrab in a long line of lazy cashgrabs by this developer. The Lost Souls is a 'sequel' to White Mirror - except it's practically the same game with a different color palette. Same setting, same 'walk-up-to-statue-and-hit-keys-in-a-certain-order' puzzles, same underwater switch flipping, same monster, same, same, SAME.  Game is completable within 20 minutes, assuming it doesn't crash. (It's worth noting, the game didn't crash for me like it apparently did for others) The 'puzzles' are literally just typing words backwards in order to open locked doors. Unfulfilling, dull, senseless tripe. I'm sure the same will be said about the next game this developer uploads about 3 months from now, per his schedule.  In summary, terrible.
11767	about 20 minutes of playtime and about 20 crashes...nuff said  its a 50/50 chance it will crash when you enter a new zone  its a 50/50 chance it will crash when you try to save game because you are afraid to that the game will crash and you will be in the previous zone  its a 50/50 chance it will crash when you try to load game, because you have crashed already but managed to save your game  10/10 would crash again
11768	I don't know where this bloody influx of FPS Creator titles has come from and, frankly, it doesn't matter so long as we can assemble a team to burn it to the ground but, in the meantime, I sure hope you like your stages like an eight year old girl likes her bowling lanes: separated by GIANT CRASH BARRIERS.  Without fail, every area transition (of which there are only a merciful four) sent me hurtling back to the desktop with the gratingly familiar  'FPSC has stopped working'  taunt that is becoming far more familiar in my gaming pursuits than is acceptable. Occasionally you get a 'root system error' when you try to save as well which I guess is the closest thing this abomination is going to get to variety.   The Lost Souls  is atrociously written, horrendously translated and is honestly about throwing seven switches over fifteen minutes. Never buy it. Never play it. This would be considered an abuse of human rights by the government in a George Orwell novel.  Sheer garbage awaits your eyes below:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obRqRrv6y9U 
11769	The game crashes a LOT. The graphics, except for the water, are sub-par and the story negates any fear of dying as you are already dead. That said it's slightly better than most low budget horrors that stumble onto steam, but this is not hard to achieve. The puzzles are hilariously simple and the game has NO options menu whatsoever. The occasional environment can look okay, but the textures elsewhere bring the game down.   Would only recommend if you're already dead IRL and need a reason to be glad about it.  For my full review with screenshots:  https://koolthingsforkoolkids.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/why-did-i-play-the-lost-souls/     
11770	This game kinda felt like a recycled White Mirror, which is another game this developer made. I'm very easily scared, but this game really didn't do it for me. I only played it for about 15 minutes so far, but its very remeniscent of the first game the developer made, which I thought was very dull. Still, its a VAST improvement over that game. I didn't experience any crashing, as other reviews point out, so I guess that's a plus. I wouldn't recommend this game, as it just lacks excitement for me.  Here is a few minutes of gameplay if you want to check it out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRqGsq_DyfI 
11771	The graphics are decent but it starts quite slow. i havnt gotten all the way through yet but its a very basic horror game.     http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=664197119 
11772	I was intrigued by the theme of this game and knew it had a significant number of bad reviews. I went ahead and got it anyway assuming other players were exaggerating. I found out that they were not exaggerating. It is a very short game which is generally empty in spite of the screenshots. The few monsters this game has are programmed in a way that they do not react to you, but merely follow a predefined path. The English is extremely bad and I would have expected the developer to let this game be reviewed by someone else more proficient in it. The story is only half a story. The puzzles are too trivial to even be in the game. You have to keep using the SHIFT button to move a little bit faster as without it, you would be bypassed by snails if they were in the game. The game has a replay value of 0. You can probably finish it in 20 - 50 minutes and will then never 'play' it again. As far as I am concerned most demos are more polished than this game. It really could have become something with a LOT of effort, but the developer apparently did not feel the need to do so and apparently chooses to keep selling empty games like this one in different formats. Unfortunate. The game does have a clever marketing strategy to draw players in, but that is all it has. In all fairness the game does have scary moments and they are not badly done, but they are very scarce and at some point you just know the full extent of what the game does and does not do and the surprises then end there. I just expected a lot more and a lot better.  In this case it was not a case of whether the game was good enough to play. No, it was a matter of whether the game was good enough to be in my library. I did not consider this game worthy to remain in my library and thus permanently removed it from my library.
11773	This game can be completed in 20 minutes, but still got 3 hours left or more to completed the card drops. Sigh, it is so short.  As a horror walking simulator games, this game failed to scare me but give me a little frustating in chapter which player must collect 3 artifacts because of bug. Sometimes the artifacts doesn't spawn in the area, even reloading the area. I'd try to quit the games, load the chapter and got only 2 of artifacts. It means, I must save and quit the game. Come back and load the area, and the last artifact spawn. The 2nd bug is in the first chapter. If player go to left in the starting area, that can made the first puzzle can't be triggered and completed. So just quit &amp; exit the game, start a new game and go foward in the starting area. These bugs is really annoying.  Sound effect in this game is dull, sometimes you can hear footsteps of the character but in the other chapter don't. However atmosphere is good. This game had a good graphic for a cheap budget games and has cinematic photography experience because of widescreen-like movie. It is not a good games nor bad games, but I can't recommended it because the games end too fast before I've starting to like it.
11774	Awful, only 10 minutes in the game and 6 crashes before I gave up on this. Not worth it, even at 75 percent off. Here is my video on it if you are so curious  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMyzJVubWI 
11775	Awful, only 10 minutes in the game and 6 crashes before I gave up on this. Not worth it, even at 75 percent off. Here is my video on it if you are so curious  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMyzJVubWI 
11776	2/10  ... I have NO idea how, but this game managed to be worse than its predecessor. Which is quite surprising, given how the predecessor is by far not a good game.  The Lost Souls is the sequel to White Mirror. Supposedly, this time you're playing with a different character, since the one from the first game seemingly managed to escape. Once again, the one good thing about the game is that it looks good. Everything else is just as bad: barely any challenge, barely any story, barely any sense, barely... Anything.  The puzzles in this game managed to be even WORSE than they were before. How? In this case, you don't read documents that give you clues. No, the game just straight out describes the puzzle for you on the screen. I'm not kidding - in the first puzzle the game just shows a sequence of 6,5,4,3,2,1 and tells you to type it backwards, so you type 1,2,3,4,5,6 and the 'secret door' (which is NOT secret, it's LITERALLY out in the open, right behind you) opens. And every other puzzle in the game? Just type words. The game shows you backwards words like 'nepo pu' and you type 'openup'. THAT'S IT.  Oh and if you somehow mistype one of the solutions - if you accidentally type another letter (which isn't hard to do, considering you use WASD to walk), for instance? You're locked out of the puzzle. I'm not even kidding. You can't retry the puzzle. You have to load a previously saved game or restart everything.  And the ending?   THE MIRROR IS BROKEN AND YOU'RE STUCK IN HELL. THAT'S IT. I'M NOT EVEN JOKING. You have no idea why the character from the first game went to that house in the first place, then you're playing with this character who's actually in hell trying to find the so called 'mirror' only to find it's BROKEN and because of that, there's no escape. It's honestly one of the worst endings I've EVER seen in games.    And last, but not least - the game crashes. A lot. I had to retry chapter 3 three times because the game would just constantly crash.  Now, I really, REALLY want to support small devs. I know there's time and effort invested into doing games and it's often not easy doing it alone or with a small team. And these games (The Lost Souls, White Mirror, Verge: Lost Chapter, My Bones) are super cheap, so I wanted to say that at least they're worth the price for a short experience. But despite all of these, I cannot recommend these games (except for My Bones which I haven't played yet). They're just bad and it's not like there aren't any good options I could recommend instead - for instance, Black Rose, which is FREE.  If I could send a message to this dev, I'd suggest that he stop making all these incredibly short games and instead just invest time into making one that's longer and better. Create a story that makes sense and explains things. Make creative puzzles that make the player have to think for at least a short while. Create some level of challenge rather than just putting monsters that are incredibly easy to avoid. Don't overdo cheap jump scares and constant sounds/voices that come from nothing, create a creepy atmosphere instead (which isn't actually too hard - a dark atmosphere with just the occasional disturbing moment would be more than enough). Find someone to correct your english. Find people to test your game and make suggestions. And only THEN put it up for sale. Or, alternatively, do the same that was done with Black Rose - make a good game and release for free, then make an even better game and then sell that one.
11777	Wow, this game is crap. Besides the crashing, it is incredibly short and dull. The puzzles are not puzzles and there really isn't a story. The graphics actually aren't too bad though. But not worth $1.99.
11778	  Another fpf creator that should be a free to play game. Better than white mirror but still bad! Monster ai pathing is pretty bad. Almost to the point where they move in straight line and they dont change its pathing. The story you dont get the entire story probably half the story. Just avoid the game!  Pros Steam trading cards Music Couple of good jump scares  cons Crashes  you get half of the story Monster ai pathing is terrible walking is too slow and shifting is still slow but not faster
11779	WASTE OF TIME SIMULATOR
11780	Is this white mirror??? really?? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN ON SALE!!!
11781	Scenery is cool. I don't know if it's bugged or what but it wouldn't let me past the OPEN UP part... which is like 2 minutes into the game.
11782	Crash crash crash, Am I the only Lost Soul this is happening to?
11783	.
11784	The developer describes this version as 'entirely kinetic,' which I can only suppose is an extremely vague way of saying there is no gameplay whatsoever - I mean there aren't even the choices you would normally encounter in a visual novel/adventure game. You're just in this to read the noninteractive story, which clocked in at just over 10 minutes for me, and is horrendously written and erratic, with an equally abrupt and nonsensical ending. The developer advertises a newly added save/load feature - for what, exactly? This is a ridiculous scam of a product, and I am thankful for Steam's refund policy.
11785	I can't figure out why I wanted to try this. I was expecting something that wasn't so genuinely terrible as this perhaps? I feel like this is a cruddy source engine horror map converted to a visual novel. You can't save boring and inane writing by making it the focal point.
11786	I liked The Last Dogma, I like the idea of making a visual novel game for the Genesis &amp; wanted to play that; but this, this is at best a rather mediocre horror Tumblr. 
11787	So I played this 'game' for ten minutes and the urge to kill myself rose to a very dangerous level.   When you start this 'game' a window opens that is smaller than my phone, so I had to use a magnifying glass to see what was going on. Then you don't even get a real introduction and before you know it you are in another dimension (about 1 minute into the so called 'game'). At that point I lost interest in the game, the story was neither interesting nor entertaining, so I skipped all of the text. It took me ten minutes to finish the 'game' and these ten minutes were so wasted, that killing myself yould have been a better use of these ten minutes.  Now to the part where I explain why it is not a game.  You only click through text and get bored pretty easily, it is more like a visual novel but that title would be a compliment to this lump of â¥â¥â¥â¥. I hope you don't do the same mistake as me and my friends and buy it for each other for secret santa (it is really not worth it. REALLY!!)  Conclusion:  I'd rather take a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and rub my face in it, it is really worth less than a lump of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Have a nice day
11788	  This is a visual novel where all you do is click to go foward. There are no choices, no scares, and the writing is like sub-parr creepypasta. The game is all tell, no show, and even though it tell you everything, it still is a convoluted mess. And the graphics are just... something.   Despite the game's lack of gameplay, the game still has a bug in it. If you're playing the game in steam's onlline mode, the game will occasionally close steam in the background, somehow. It's annoying if you're trying to show it to your friends via steam brodcast.  This game took about 30 minutes to play, so if you really want to subject yourself to this for whatever reason, you'll be well within the time limit it takes to refun it.

11828	I find it hard to complain about this game given the price (just under 2CAD at time of purchase) and the new and interesting horror premise, but I have to say it was immensely frustrating overall. Maybe I was missing something, but I gave it almost an hour before I lost interest.  First of all, the core mechanic of deep web exploration is NOT fun. Here's why: - You are clicking links 99% of the time to check if sites are up (they are never up), and every time you navigate to a new page (no matter how, be it through a link or a browser action) it 'loads' the page for at least a second. Furthermore, trying to navigate to another page during this time does nothing. This is not acceptable. If the game wants me to click back and forth between pages a lot to find out which ones are up at what time, it can't make it this slow and tedious to do so. I get why it's like that, but come on. - The above problem is compounded by the fact that certain links appear to be cosmetic (some randomized link names in between playthroughs indicate this, although I can't be certain), so I'm never sure if I'm wasting my time checking a particular link. This may have been the intention, but even so it is a mistake. - The few sites you are able to access at any given time are shallow and/or hopelessly obscure in their intent. I don't know about others, but I personally have not gotten more than a single layer deep into the links from the home wiki. I managed to get a single piece of the URL to the red room, and that was by clicking on ONE conspicuous link on a site linked directly from the wiki. It didn't lead me down an intriguing rabbit hole where I could track down clues, the four digits just appeared above the link after I clicked it. I'm assuming I didn't see the best the game could offer, but seriously? - In general, I have absolutely no idea how to proceed. I guess I'm supposed to spend many in-game days slowly building up my notes until I can navigate the deep web with ease, but this plan of action is frustrated by the other big problem with this game:  The secondary mechanic of counterhacking is NOT fun. Here's why: - If you fail and get hacked, you might lose all your notes. YES, THIS CAN HAPPEN. The virtual notepad, what I thought was surely just a substitute for a real note-taking surface (which I assume most players could easily procure if needed, thus making the virtual one a mere courtesy), is actually a trap, and you're a sucker for using it. This actually baffles me a bit because it means whoever made this game thought people wouldn't immediately pick up a piece of paper and start using that instead. Again, I see the intent behind the design, I just don't care. This is just a mean trick. - One of the minigames is literally a typing test. Yes, a typing test. I won't say that it doesn't fit the theme of the game or that it couldn't have been done in a better way, but the current implementation sucks balls. You just have to write out what's written on the screen, so the only challenge is dexterity. And the challenge level has been balanced poorly; I'm a relatively fast typer so I never feel any tension during this minigame, but I can easily imagine the finger-pecking typists having lots of trouble with the parens and unconventional phrasing. I'd probably be sweating bullets if I had to find every symbol on the keyboard by looking at it I guess. That or throwing my laptop out the window in frustration. - The other one is just plain hard. Again, maybe I'm missing something (because I don't care enough to get good) but it seems like if I set just one of the turnable arrows wrong, the hack either hits an empty grid cell and starts again or hits the edge of the grid (completing the hack, which means I lose) simply based on luck. I guess I should be more careful, but the timer means that I'm frantically looking for the one correct configuration that will stop the hack WHILE the hack is progressing. It feels like too many things can go wrong here.  If you can't tell from how much I had to say about this game, I do like it and care about it. It's an interesting idea and the presentation is solid, but there are non-trivial problems with the gameplay that need to be addressed if it's going to reach its potential. If this is supposed to be a finished product... dev/s, did you playtest this at all, or...?
11829	Interesting concept. Unfortunately, it's just not fun. There's potential here, though.   Lessen the random dead links. Lessen the load time for dead links. Lessen the frequency of the 'hacker'.  So far, I've not really made any progress, because I am just getting constant dead links, or hackers, and it is feeling more like boring work, rather than playing a game.   There's potential here. And the game is cheap, so might be worth picking up anyway.  But in general, ignoring price, I can't recommend this game presently.
11830	4 hours in. Strategy down. Checking the area after every link. Stopping the lights for 1 full minute for every noise and for a minute and a half when my location services come on the laptop.   Start a New Game. Day 1.... not even 2:30 am... just wrote down my 6th out of 8 keys, getting super lucky with them being in my regular spots, this is the run, no way I lose 75% done into night one. Do my normal check around the room after clicking the link and writing my key, all normal. Hear the window open right as I go back to browser. Immediately turn off lights and give it the 1 minute of silence. No footsteps or talking or anything, figure its too early for that anyways. Go back to computer, click on next link, ripped away from screen and kidnapped.  There seriously needs to be more balance to make this not impossible. Getting caught on night one after only 4 hours of in game time passing is ridiculous. And epecially when you check the window after EVERY link and turn the lights out for a full minute after EVERY noise and you don't get a SINGLE notification (aka the location icon the game doesnt even tell you about - coming on, footsteps, talking etc... you know, only way to know hes there). Thats crazy and unfair. Not to mention there are too many dead/useless links, long load times for sites (super annoying with so many dead links) and there should be an option for a save point.  Good concept. Great price. But ultimately a poor game if its nearly impossible to beat after following the games every given instruction (to the extreme) as well as its not given ones, leanring and following mechanics the game doesnt even tell you (like hey look for the location service icon on your screen, or about the noise that reveals hidden links on the screen, or the fact that even if the plain site is visible the secret link that has the key may not work at the that specific time so try again later instead of assuming thats a bad site). That makes it not fun and therefore not good.   TL;DR: Balance game to make more possible, actually teach/explain mechanics, what to look for, and how to play, maybe remove a link or two, reduce (maybe half) load times (at least on dead sites) and add save points.
11831	Welcome to the Game is an interesting attempt at combining horror and hacking, but it feels unfinished and doesn't do either very well.  The mechanics of the game, while grounded in gameplay balance, seem arbitrary and unjustified. A 30-day time limit is revealed early on in the game, but why a time limit, and why 30 days?  The core of the game is visiting random websites and simply seeing what you can find, eventually hoping to find fragments of the URL to the Red Room website. Most of the links at any given time are dead, and are apparently only operational during certain hours of the day. Why this is the case is never explained. Most of the game for me consisted of trial and error in trying one link, finding a 404 page in the vast majority of cases, and then going back and trying the next one.  At random, hackers will try to 'hack' you, and you have to complete one of two minigames to resist. The minigames themselves are challenging and infrequent enough to be servicable, but why do hackers care enough about you to bother in the first place?  You have the ability to step away from your computer and look around the room you're in, which you will need for the kidnapper mechanic. When you start a new game, a russian guy starts creeping around in an attempt to kidnap you, which results in a game over. To prevent him from finding you, when you hear noises from around you that sound especially kidnappy, you turn round in your chair and turn off your room lights and wait an indetermininant amount of time before flicking them back on and continuing to play the game. I'm not kidding. Why someone would want to kidnap you specifically is unexplained, so I guess he was so busy kidnapping everyone in the world who starts using the deep web, he didn't have time to buy a flashlight.  I can see the potential of kidnapper mechanic, but it quickly becomes more annoying than scary and feels more like an arbitrary interruption to playing the game than part of it.  The writing in a lot of the websites kept my interest, but in the end the biggest flaw this game has is that at it's core it's more tedious than it's worth. When clicking a link you have to wait a few seconds for it to load, and the trial-and-error nature of the links and puzzles results in you waiting for that loading bar at the top of your browser again and again.  This game was less than $2 for me on steam, so it's not exactly a purchase I regret but for all the potential it has, it feels incomplete. They should have spent 2.5 times the effort developing the game and sold it for $5, and I hope they do just that should they ever make a sequel.  At it's price it won't really be a waste of your money, but it will be a waste of your time. 
11832	Pretty boring honestly. Not really sure what I expected, but it was much more than this. More that half the websites won't load, and the excuse is that they will 'only load at a certain time on the night'. Well since it takes 15 seconds to load ANY page, it took me an hour to even look at all the pages, let alone visit them at certain parts of the night. Not to mention the fact that every webpage is just that: a single page. None of the links on any given website will go anywhere. Oh, they're clickable, but every single one leads to a DNS error. Even with all that, there's no excuse for the constant annoying 'hacking' that goes on. Sometimes it'll happen 4 times in a minute. Each time you need to type 5 lines of code to continue playing. It's not hard or scary, it's just annoying.  Really dissapointed that I spent time on this. It was a waste of my morning and my money.
11833	The mechanics are dull. Spending the entire game searching for pieces of code through a bunch of links (most of them always offline or up only at random periods of time) while trying to avoid being hacked through 'minigames' (I don't know how the stores can make profit with his clients trying to be hacked with logical games and writing contests every time they click the 'buy' button) and BEST OF ALL, while being chased by a kidnapper who can track you down in fifteen minutes since you start surfing the dark web (why??) but can't know where you are if you turn off the room lights.  This was the most boring scavenge I've done, and the only thrilling part was hiding from the kidnapper moth who came from Russia to your backyard in 15 minutes but can't chase you if you turn off the lights.  This could habe been a lot better if it was designed as a clue hunting through the websites, cracking codes on the pages and following links and traces to open new features or to dig deeper, not just 'click, see what's online, write down the code and then put it all together'.  The idea is great and I hope they make more games based in this concept. Unfortunately the game itself wasn't so great at all.
11834	I bought this game after watching many people on Youtube enjoy it. For the price, it can definitely be considered cheap enough for the lack of content.  My issues with the game:  TL;DR: Has lots of problems, glitches, bugs, and needs a desperate slate wipe and reboot to be considered enjoyable.  1.You get kidnapped more than you get hacked, which sort of defeats the purpose of this being called a hacking game. 2. The puzzles are random and have no pattern which you need to find, often causing you to become frustrated and lose interest. 3. Turning of the light does absolutely nothing. You may think 'Oh, if I turn the light off, then maybe the kidnapper will stop bothering me', but no, it basically has no effect on you or him what so ever.  4. The loading between the webpages. I understand that they were trying to put a bit of realism in the game, but personally I really hate the page loading, as it isn't like most peoples PC are underspecced to run this game. I would just like an option to toggle this loading. 5. The FPS when not looking at the monitor are terrible. It says it drops down to about 45 FPS (I even tested this game on my friends rig which has a i7 and a GTX 1070 in it, and it still dropped, regardless of the settings), but it is more realistically about 20 FPS. 6. The killer is basically a real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you turn off the light to hide from the kidnapper, the killer can still ring. Not a bad feature when you think about it, but the fact that your phone isn't on silent when the lights are off is stupid. You will instantly get kidnapped, and have to restart the game. 7. Nothing really happens. It takes so long for anything to happen that you just get bored and quit.   I really wanted to enjoy this game as I love this sort of genre, combining Thriller/Horror with puzzles and mystery. However, I just can't considering the issues above and many more in this game. The pricing is fine (Although paying to unlock a new difficulty is a bit stupid TBH), but I still feel ripped of with the lack of gameplay and features this game has to offer.  Developer/s, please improve this game, as right now it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ fest.

11836	Boring and tedious.  It's a dead link simulator on the worlds â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest browser. Click on dead link after dead link hoping to get a page. Some pages are intersting and have stuff to do. Some have tedious puzzles that reset if you mis-click. Every few minutes you get 'hacked' and it plays an annoying animation and forces you to do a one of 2 dumb puzzles: click to complete the path and type random code to match the code in the box.   the problems with this game come from how much waiting there is. Every link has a load time even when you back. The pages can have nearly nothing or be dead links but it still has a long loading time of about 4 seconds. then after spending about two of five minutes waiting for non-existant page to load you get hacked. Failing the hack can set you back by deleting your notes which are 100% needed since your browser can't have bookmarks.  Speaking of the browser it is the most unrealistic browser in the world. It has no functionality. The OS you use in the game also has no functionality either. It all distracts from the realism that they obviously want and makes it hard to get into the universe. No immersion no horror.  So remove the load time or make it really short. Make the browser feel more real; add settings, bookmarks, tabs. Make the OS feel more real for example allow us to save notes and pictures we find, give us a terminal, give us settings in game like mouse sensitivity.  I can't reccomend this game but I do like the idea. Go on the deep web and listen to some creepypastas while you do it. You'll get allot more than you will here.
11837	I loved the game at first. Finding codes, hunting the deep web. Amazing. Got kidnapped, started over, but it happens. But then one time I saw the tracking icon in the top right of the screen. I waited an HOUR and I could still here the kidnapper. That's a whole HOUR of NOTHING. Got kidnapped, lost everything. Not sure if this was a bug that made it take so long but if it was then please fix it devs because it's an amazing game otherwise. Due to this I honestly wouldn't pay Â£1.59 or about $2. (I'm British) I would request a refund but I've played over two hours which is too long for a refund. If this is fixed I would pay Â£5 for the game. I just can't reccomend it now.
11838	Okay, this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying.    You're supposed to click on links to random webpages and look for codes.    I was on every page of the first wiki: no codes. I checked all of them numerous times to check which ones open up at certain hours and which ones are fake.   Then I tried the Choosen Awake puzzle, and by Thor's hammer, that might be the worst 'puzzle' I have ever seen. You need to scroll down the page and click at things. If you click the wrong one, you need to do it all over again. There's no pattern. Just do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ dozens of times and hope that you will get lucky. The last part of this  *hack*  'puzzle' requires you to hover your cursor slowly over tiny circles and hope that one of these is clickable. And of course, there will be more than one to make you scroll all the way back to the same point and try again. Then it gives you a link to the second wiki, where you will be doing the same thing as before. Oh, and remember to f*cking write it down, because if you accidentaly click the home button, it will take you back to the first wiki and you will have to enter the link again. Oh, and if you didn't write it down, then do the same  *barf*  'puzzle' all over again - but this time it's different, so have fun wasting your time on this turd.   Secondly, the enemies. You know how you just want to do something important on your PC and everyone keeps bothering you? Well, this is the perfect simulator for you. You will have to turn off your lights or pick up the phone and run to the door like every 3 minutes. Or not, everyone loves starting everything over! Did I mention that the code locations are random so if you die you need to waste even more time? Oh, and the hackers. They suck monkey â¥â¥â¥â¥. They can strike 3 times in one minute, and their minigames are just... God.     First there's the typing one. If you don't want to lose your snail porn collection, you need to type long strings on complicated commands in limited time. F*ck you slow typers! This is not the game for you!  Then the arrow one. It starts instantly and gives you no time to figure out where to go. Boom. Hacked. Say bye to hardcore Gardevoir x Meloetta hentais!  And the cloud one. It's just a huge joke. You add something so simple in a 2.0 update?    'B-b-b-b-b-but dude, you can reset the modem and it will stop the hackers!!!!!!1!!!!!!'   Yeah, leave the computer screen, click the modem and hold it for f*cking forever, and after it finally f*cking resets you only get like 2 minutes of peace. Thank you for this amazing feature developer! Another annoyance that just slows me down and distracts me fron potential killers!    Bonus: do you want to search through funny and random xD confessions like 'I have a small â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' or craaaaawliiiing iiiin my skiiiiiin ones like 'I wanna â¥â¥â¥â¥ my entire family' hoping that RNG Jeebus will give you a code? Then you're in for a treat.        And the most important part: what's even the point of playing anymore? Everyone saw their favourite screaming manchild beat the game. Everyone knows the ending and what's behind sites like 'Grandma's Fantasy' or 'The Dollmaker'. Playing this is just not rewarding anymore.   I don't know why I wasted my money on this.    Avoid at all costs and just watch it on Youtube.
11839	Well, the 1st 20 minutes or so were pretty scary. After that it became an exercise in clicking every link on a given web page to find the one that might reveal a code. This is interspersed with having to deal with hacking attempts that require you to type out a bunch of text within a certain time frame. The whole thing felt like an easter egg hunt that kept getting interrupted by a stenography mini-game.  Good: -Scary for a bit -Cheap  Bad: -Tedious  It may be worth a couple of bucks just to be startled..
11840	  Not a fun game. It's just clicking on website links that take about 3 seconds to load and the website being offline 80% of the time and then clicking back to try more links. There's no puzzle to it; there's no clever logic to deciding or figuring out what time certain sites should be accessed. The only possible satisfaction you could get from the game is the little bit of shock value that some of the more disturbing sites display, but there's not really any since it's incredibly hard to forget this is a game because the browser is terrible at imitating an actual browser.
11841	Doesn't work. When I press 'New Game', the loading screen appears and suddenly freezes.
11842	I'm pretty honest and nice to games. I have A LOT of patience when it comes to playing them, butI gave this game a good amount of time for just nothing to happen but get hacked twice a minute, I didn't even get kidnapped. Also, I did what the game tells you to do which is to wait at different times for the websites to work andmost of the time I was in the game I was trying different times for different sites, and NOTHING was working; not even the side links on the sites to reach different areas of that one specific site. This game is honestly a waste of money and as you can see I DO NOT recommend this game.
11843	First off, I hate this fad of games that expect you do perform with the threat of instant and random death coming at any time, so if you actually like these kinds of games, you can stop reading this review.  I played this game for an hour and tried to enjoy it. I honestly did. This has been the first time I've ever asked for a refund on steam.  What really did it in for me was the puzzle required to get to the second page of the deep web. There are several rows of clickable objects, and you have to guess each one through trial or error to advance, and it resets the whole puzzle if you click the wrong thing.  This would not normally be a problem, however when you reload the page (or come back in a new game) the puzzle is reconfigured in a random way. This means that every time you start over you have to overcome a random, trial-and-error puzzle that has no logic to it. There is no way to speed through it. You just guess anywhere from 5 to 10 times per row, and then move on to the next row, having to start over if you guess incorrectly.  Frankly, puzzles of this sort shouldn't exist. There is no feeling of being rewarded for correctly guessing a random thing. The puzzle does nothing more than waste your time, to pad your playtime with another 2-4 minute bit of tedious and meaningless clicks before letting you into the rest of the game.  Again, this wouldn't be a problem if this puzzle had a static solution that could be quickly cleared on later playthroughs, but instead we're hit with a trite puzzle that cannot be solved through any other means besides pure and repetitive guesswork.  I might have actually enjoyed this had I not had to repeat that same puzzle so many times. Instead, I got angry and quit playing.
11844	Please fix this problem, eveytime I try to play the game I get to where it show the meaning of the red room. Then it crashes. Someone please help me,
11845	At first I couldn't really tell if this was supposed to be an unfunny parody game or just a really boring/cringey/tedious genuine attempt at horror. I'm still unsure, though it's probably the latter.  The 'hacking' looks like a mixture of the worst parts of Bioshock and Independece day and the script kiddie names are just too embarassing. At least the code looks like some kind of real code, though it seems to be Visual C++ even though Linux kernel (the computer is clearly running Gnome3) is written in the C11/gnu11 flavour of C. It doesn't help that due to the random nature of the puzzles some were virtually (or even literally) impossible. The web sites aren't much better either. After the first couple times, the limitations of the theme became pretty apparent.  we get it, you â¥â¥â¥â¥   The on-screen half of game veriy quickly devolved into boring pixel hunt for clickables and an excercise at scanning pages for keys. The lack of a context menu or consistent text selection only makes things worse, as you often find yourself forced to type in long base16 strings manually. As for the off-screen part - once you start to see the pattern most of the tension evaporates. The game is simply not scary after the first maybe 20 minutes.
11846	Best broken link simulator ever. Its just like the real deep web, minus the content!
11847	Game sucked. Very repetitive, not shocking, and not scary. Refunded it.
11848	Boring, not really creative, repetitive. Get the tor-browser and start searching stuff yourselves, you'll have more fun with that.   Unable to connect 2/10
11849	Good concept, poor execution  I want to like this game, I really do. I put a ton of hours into Uplink (a greta old-school-ish hacking game), so I thought this would be an interesting game. And it would be, but the mechanics the developer put in are just grating.  You're given a list of links off of a psuedo-wiki page to go find 8 pieces of the link to the infamous Red Room. Some work absolutly never (you can kind of determine this if they sound like porn sites or something), but you have no way of knowing if they're permanently broken links or if they tie into the other mechanic in that certain links only work at certain hours. A link that's up from 10-11pm may not work at 3am, and vice versa.  There's one page with a puzzle that leads to a second page of wiki links just like the first. If you lose your notes, then you have to redo the puzzle. Which is randomized. And a trial and error puzzle.  So basically you're going through different links at different times trying to see what works. Nothing hints at which links work at which times, so you're completely in the dark. But lets say you finally find a page. Now you're hunting for a link, except now you've got 20 different buttons you can click on, all leading to dead ends. But you have to click on every one, because nothing determines whether it's a dead end or a piece of the puzzle. Sometimes clicking them gets you hacked. The hacking games are actually easy enough with a little practice, but the punishments of days lost (you have 30 days before you run out of time) and whether or not you lose your in-game notes is randomized.  Finally there's the kidnapper mechanic, which is never explained except for 'There will be a kidnapper soon. Turn your lights off if he's around'. How long do you turn your lights off for? What noises are actually him creeping up on you and which are ambient? Why in some cases can you openly ignore loud banging footsteps with no consequences and other times have to listen for the tiniest sound and immediatly stop what you're doing to halt his progress?  My big issues is that the fun is in searching through the dark web and looking for the links. But there's sooooooo much that pulls you away from your primary task. It's like if Five Nights at Freddy's required you to play Skyrim at the same time, but you had to pause the game to make sure the animatronics weren't at your doorstep.
11850	Mh, the game is tricky. Im not saying thats necassarily a bad thing. The game has a lot of bugs. Its barely known, and most of the DOS puzzles I get kidnapped on. I rate this game a 3/10
11851	Welcome to the Game is a survival game about your internet search for a red room on the Deep Web. I feel like this game had a lot of potenial. The game has you exploring the Deep Web, looking for 8 hidden keys to gain access to the red room.   One big problem I had with this game was that a great percent of the websites are dead links. I feel like there are way too many of websites that did not work in this game. Some links are only available at certain times at the night, which was a small issue, but it makes sense. A handful of the sites in this game are really unsettling. The one I found most chilling was 'The Doll Maker' by far. The text displayed was very disturbing and the music box song was a nice creepy touch.   One thing I loved about this game was the music. The music played on certain websites were very chilling.   Another problem I had was with the 'turning off the lights' feature. This doesn't really make much sense to me. I don't undestand how turning the lights off would prevent any danger.  Probably one of my bigger problems with the game was the ending. In my opinion, I found the ending really anti-climatic. It was a very short ending and I do not feel it was worth finishing.   One of the main gameplay mechanics is blocking hacks. The DOS attacks can be really unfair in some scenarios. If you make a small mistake in the beginning, it could cost you. If this happens, you'll be lucky to recover. The kernel attacks involve you typing out a code given to you. These aren't too bad, unless you are a slow typer. Overall, the hack-blocking could have been improved greatly.   Overall, Welcome to the Game had great ideas, and revolves around a very original concept, but was not executed good enough. If you want to buy this game, I won't stop you. For the price of the game, I'd say it might be worth it. But don't go into it expecting much.
11852	take one of the most annoying things about video games (load screens/load times) and make that the whole game  a game where the most exciting thing that happens is you get to play a rip off of the bioshock hacking puzzle. the rest of the game is possibly the most uninteresting and tedious things i have ever done in any video game. it blows my mind that someone would want to play a game where you click on broken links for an hour waiting for â¥â¥â¥â¥ to happen.   tl;dr, its a game about having really slow/no internet.
11853	I start the game up and it's fine, click new game and as it loads in the computer has a white box in the top right and the phone just keeps ringing. I can't click anything or pause the game. This has happened for at least 2 days now. I was excited to play this but there seems to be some sort of bug or something. Sorta giving up on it now. (watch it magically work now I said I'm giving up on it).  From what I see it's a good game, fun and very hands on BUT for this reason I'm gonna have to give it a no till it's fixed or something. Sorry budd.
11854	The game looks good in videos but sadly I am stuck with a problem where the in-game monitor is completely blank. I can't recommend the game due to this issue, and the 'discussions' section is so barren that it may take hours to even get a response like 'oh yeah dude, I have the same problem'  The issue isn't Windows 10, by the way, as I went on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier computer and the only problem there was the immense amount of lag.  Update: The developer of this game is completely unhelpful. Contacting him proves useless as no response ever comes, and the discussions page is filled with clueless players who definitely don't have an answer to any of the problems people have. Don't waste your time if the game doesn't work for you; just get a refund.
11855	It was a kinda good game but it isn't worth the money. I think i played it 30 minutes and then it was already getting repetitive.
11856	It was a kinda good game but it isn't worth the money. I think i played it 30 minutes and then it was already getting repetitive.
11857	*click* *wait for page to load* *cant connect* repeat x432
11858	You objectivce is to find 8 codes in the websites to get access to red room  You are told a kidnnapper will come and hunt you down as you progress. You are not scared and start with excitement browsing the pages and looking for the codes. And you see...  &lt;&lt;Spoiler Alert&gt;&gt; Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect Unable to connect   Sometimes you are going to be hacked, you fend the hackers off either by typing lengthy commands or solving braindead puzzles.  Then there is a man's voice. You turn right. Oh, the mighty kidnapper is here. You are dead.  Isn't it fun? It isn't even scary. Maybe I missed out something.  I asked for refund and it is granted.
11859	i REALLY want to like it but i cant play due to the some of the minigames difficulty i feel like the dev should have an opition to turn off the mini game or have diffilculty levels. i know i have to 'get gud' but typing that fast is an extreme challeng for me
11860	Gameplay is slow, repetitive and tedious. Trying waaay too hard to be edgy.
11861	I was SO excited for this game. I've been pumped for it since I've seen some Youtubers playing it.   Now... now I'm everything BUT excited. Played the game for about 45 minutes, TOTALLY ignored the noises, didn't leave the screen and didn't turn off the switch, still nothing happened. Either I broke the game, or the mechanics are just poorly made and the developer just assumes the player will turn the lights off.   Secondly, it's really frustrating to search through the pages, when 90% of the pages I got went offline. I literally spent 45 minutes waiting for some of them to be available, and I got NOTHING.  All the pages I got had NO NUMBERS for me to point down, which misses the WHOLE purpose of the game. Not saying you should make it easy, but you should at least give 1 number at a webpage in the beginning to keep the player going.  The idea of the game is AMAZING and it has SUCH amazing potential. For real, this can be a FNAF type of game, even though I find FNAF repetitive. You have the chance to bring something really well thought here, but there are so many things that have to be worked on.  On the other hand, 2$ ain't nothing. Hope you at least had some fun developing the game.
11862	I would really like to play this game. I downloaded it today and started, but everytime I go to get out of the computer (right click) I get a black screen and my crosshair in the middle someone please help! 
11863	Trash game. It's repetitive, uninteresting, the jumpscares get boring very quickly.  The mechanic that makes it so you can't access certain websites at certain times is more hindering than mysterious or anything good. It just serves as a means to slow your progression. It doesn't make the game any less bad. The graphisms are trash, the webpages are very obviously just facades -- you can only get to the very first page of the few websites that are actually reachable -- and the rest are simply fake. You can never connect to them. The hacking mechanic is just as bad. Basically, every one in twenty seconds, you will get to do a coin flip. If you get the typing puzzle, you're golden. You get about five times as much time to type simple sentences as you would need typing with only your pinky finger. If you get the arrows puzzle, though, you're basically screwed.
11864	Good sound to it, very big on atomsphere and theres a lot in the way of paranoia, but this was a tremendously boring game. Slow load to start up, clunky controls and a lot of '*click.... nothing' repeat until it is something and that something was really blah. I'm sure this game is for someone--payers of attention under some tension, lovers of typing classes in middle school, finders of 404 errors--it just isn't for me. If you're into that kind of game, give it a try but only if there's a big sale on. I'm going to read a book now.
11865	This game is quite boring and just downright uninteresting. It desperately needs a better tutorial with an explanation on how/where to find codes on webpages. The note system is terrible, considering you cannot directly edit notes you create, (Which surprises me, because it's a simple feature.) Finally, Welcome to The Game has a pointless and rushed overall concept. When I purchased it, I assumed that it would be a fun and entertaining short game, but I wouldn't play this game even if someone paid me for it. 0/10 not even worth $0.02, let alone $2.00.
11866	i went into the game but as soon as the tutorial menu popped up i was kinapped mfl!
11867	I open the game file, click new game, loading screen, skull flashing on bottom of loading screen stops flashing, game crashes. Every time I try to play, this happens, what do I do?
11868	:FOR MAC USERS!: I was really excited to buy it at first, since i love horror games. Then, When i start it up, Its just. Freezing. You cant pause the game for one, Nor continue the game. So you have to start a new game everytime. Its also VERY slow.  Besides that it was sorta pretty good. Good hacking times for me. But overall just watchout for this. 
11869	intresting concept for the game, only thing keeping me from getting a thumbs up is that it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t at times. you'll get kidnapped with out warning 90% of the time and the hacking is slow.    but the ending was alright   
11870	This game is outright boring. It's trial-and-error: the game.   There are dozens of dozens of links to click on, and 9 times out of 10, it's an empty page that will never even open no matter what time it is. And it takes a good 5-6 seconds to check each link, forcing you to spend minutes upon minutes checking every link. The UI is horrible, the two windows you can control are frustrating to manuever and clunky. The voice acting is horrendous. The animation of walking to the light is absolutely silly. There are two minigames, one which is an aggrivating Bioshock pipe game ripoff, and the other is simply just typing a few lines of code it gives you, which is, again, boring and frustrating.   This game could have been decent if it wasn't for the cheap FNAF ripoff mechanic. The whole kidnapping concept is silly and exists solely to give people a jumpscare, which I was expecting much better out of this game than resorting to something so petty.   And what's the payoff? Nothing. A cheap, twenty second cutscene where absolutely nothing happens.   People were describing this game as an accurate and terrifying portrayal of the deep web, but it's more tame and far more boring than FNAF. You know what would have made this game a LOT better? Not taking the easy way out by making everything PG-13. Don't want to emotionally horrify people by putting violent mutilation at the end? Don't make a game with the main goal being the access to watch a violent mutilation.  You advertise the Red Room concept so much, making it the game's Steam banner, title screen, description focus, as well as describing it in the loading screen, then when you FINALLY get to the Red Room, it lasts twenty seconds, and you see less violence than the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest of student films. Even the jumpscare is tame and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Would not recommend unless you have an insane attention span, are masochistic, don't care about payoffs, and/or like the worst parts of the FNAF series.
11871	Boring as all heck, just click around a bunch, the hacker defense puzzle things aren't engaging in the least, just not fun.
11872	Welcome to the game is a perfect example of how easily one can ruin a great experiance. See, it  should  be tons of high-tension fun, with neat-o puzzles and the ability to scare the %^#@ out of me with stressfull hacker-attackers, despite the game's high level of cheese. But sadly, constant distractions from sppoky dooky kidnappers interrupt you so you can't ever get anything done. I would recommend this game ONLY to someone with god-like patience.
11873	very tedious
11874	I can not recommend this game. The main reason, I exceed all the recommended specs for it and yet it still crashes everytime I try to play it everytime I hit new game it loads lets me in the game for a couple seconds then freezes and crashes.
11875	Game Constantly crashes on windows 10. NEEDs to be fixed asap.
11876	What you expect: - a horror game with puzzles and jumpscares  What you get: -a point and click trial by error game that inconveniences you occasionally with having to start all over again.
11877	Jumpscares. From one word alone you know whether or not you're going to buy this game. This is a sort of FNAF clone where the jumpscare only happen if you die, but the cues for when you die are, as usual, virtually non-existent. ...and when you die, you lose all progress. I played through the tutorial and then I closed the game and watched an LP instead. I regret absolutely nothing. ...but if you're a 15 year old kid who loves Markiplier and PewDiePie, then you'll probably love this game.
11878	Manâ¦ this is a game I wanted to have enjoyed.  The game consists on a list of links related , in 90% of the time, to extremely boring stuff - and that might have been quite a challenge, taking in consideration the virtually infinite diversity of material in the real thing. Butâ¦ nothing is compared to the lame hacking thing we are obliged to do all the time. Itâs so tedious, and so absolutely pointless, that I canât even describe my frustration. Developers, please, understand this: a game is supposed to be an enjoyable thing (even if by difficult challenges and puzzles)â¦ and you manage to fail a hundred percent on this. The hacking thing is just a lame, boring, tedious, mechanic work. Everytime it starts, I think/feel: âoh, noâ¦ that crap againââ¦ and this is the very last feeling/thought a developer must seek and rise on their players. After about 20 times I just got bored to my limit and stopped playing.  Technically, the game is full of bugs. The so-called notepad never worked after my first entry. When I pause the game, sometimes itâs just impossible to get back, as the game virtual mouse gets frozen. The virtual shutt off button (to quit the game) sometimes works, sometimes doesnât - in this cases I have to just kill the game, without any saving (which is not a problem, as I wouldnât open it again).  Sadly, this is my very first negative review. About a game I really wanted to like. Maybe the developers can rebuild (and re-think) the whole concept. Take the annoying hacking thing away, find interesting challenges, not only repetitive and meaningless mechanical work. After all, itâs suppose to be fun, right?
11879	I'm afraid I have to agree with a lot of the other (more elegant than my own) reviews here. I obviously don't have much time into this game yet, but I just can't bring myself to open it back up and play it through again after two kidnappings. I really find this game to be an endless time waster that yields no adrenaline or feeling of success or progress.  - Websites being open at completely random times means you spend most of your time just looking for a website that's open, and taking notes when you find the right hour that the website's open.  - When you do find a website, there's about a 90% chance that it's utterly pointless and you'll spend 5-10 minutes clicking dead links and waiting for the 'page not available' screen to load. With most websites having 5-20 links, this gets depressing real fast.  - The biggest failure though, is that once you're kidnapped (which can happen in the blink of an eye if you miss even the smallest of a hint that he's coming) it's game over. And the next game you start, ALL the websites, codes, code locations, etc. are completely different. What this means is that you can't build onto your existing knowledge and move forward. You completely start over from the beginning without knowing anything.  Some may enjoy staring at the dark and waiting for pages to load only to eventually wind up starting over from the beginning with no sense of achievement or progress, but I do not. I'll be refunding the game, not because $2 matters much, but because I would like the developer to realize the flaws in his game and work on them.
11880	I try my best to love this game but i can't love a game that i can't play each time i start it up it just freezes in the information thing about the Red Room. I don't know why i can't play it and each time i step stepout of the game and then backm min it freezes again.
11881	Needs heavy optimization.
11882	They should remove the user tag 'hacking' from this game as it has nothing to do with hacking. I've played many simulation games (Uplink, Onlink, Hacker Evolution, HackNet, etc) and they are loads more fun. What i dislike about this game is that there is nothing to do 90% of the time.   You buddy gives you a list of links to the Deep Web for you to explore and find the Red Room. 80% of them dont work at any given point. So you just click a link. Site is down. Click a different link. Site is down. Click a different link. Site is down. Click a different link. Site is down. Click a different link. Site is down...... After a few min you might get a link that works, and if you're lucky it will have a code written on the page with a portion of the web address to the Red Room. You need to collect all 8 portions to be able to access the Red Room.  There are some sprinkling of someone hacking the computer you're using but its childs play mostly. The pics of those two mini games are shown on the Store Page. One is a DOS blocker in which you have to redirect traffic to an exit node. (basically click the empty boxes to get the arrow to go in the right direction). The other is a kernal compiler in which text is displayed on screen and you have to copy what is written. Note that each test is timed and if you fail a test your computer has been traced and a kidnapper will come and grab you in a few days.   Oh yes, at ramdom points you may notice that your computer is being traced or you hear footsteps outside/inside. Your only defence? Run and turn off the lights and wait for them to go away. There are other spooks and noises that the game will throw at you to put you on edge.   And that's it for content. I wish there was more.   The things i did like about the game are: 1. When you do get a site that works, the content on that site is intriguing and interesting. I like the recreation of famous Deep Web sites like CottonRoad. (even though it's only a single page and you can't browse through it) 2. The game does a decent job with creating atmosphere from the low humming base and creaks of the floor boards and tapping on walls. It really puts you in the atmosphere of being home alone and searching through creepy content on the Deep Web with that feeling of someone watching you.  TLDR: Perform the same mundane minigames until you find all 8 codes to get to the Red Room while hiding from Russian kidnappers.
11883	Do not buy if you are a mac user at this time, crashes on start up, or freezes on startup and forced to force quit.
11884	It is fun for a little while but then you realize that you are in for the long haul, it starts to get boring from all the clicking and finding nothing. I admit it was pretty interesting and different style of game play.
11885	the killer never showed up
11886	I cannot past the laoding screen. The skull will suddenly stop blinking and it would just start lagging 
11887	Absolute garbage. You get 'hacked' about once every ten seconds, forcing you to play some lame minigame, and 90% of the pages only work at certain times of the in game day. Not even worth $2.
11888	sorry but i didnt like this game at all... VERY BORING... click links ...  stupid easy arrow game ...  click stuff again and again ...  type text 'game' i dont call that a game... run for the light... repeat... russian guy... you dead and then you make it and it was all worth it ... NOT.
11889	Played 10 minutes before i got bored when i was about to actual get somewhere some russian â¥â¥â¥â¥ is in my bloody living room.  10/10 would get kidnapped again.
11890	The cringe level in this game is so high. I don't even know what to say. 
11891	Umm... where to start this ?  what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ have i been doing with my 17 minutes of playthrough: 10 minutes of 'tutorial' on how to work a computer.. 'facepalm'  2 minutes on how to 'solve' hack attacks 5 minutes of what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this â¥â¥â¥â¥?  i got this game for 1-2 dollars, it was presented as a 'scary' type of game.. the only thing scary would be to waste another minute playing this game!
11892	No, because you tell me to get up and look at the door BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT! AND THERES NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CONTROL OPTION
11893	No, because you tell me to get up and look at the door BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT! AND THERES NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CONTROL OPTION
11894	Kind of a boring game. Too many hack attacks for you to get into the websites. Didn't enjoy it.
11895	its a shame i liked the idea of the game but You have to a pro at typing so don`t buy if you can`t type like a pro
11896	I don't know how anyone could have given this game a thumbs up. It's boring. Every other link is dead. Every click causes a 5 second wait for the 'page to load' even when clicking back. You can't go down the rabbit hole of the deep web as every page has a few links but every link is dead. So you either waste 3 minutes per page clicking every link to find out they're all dead, or you do it a few times and just assume they're all dead. Other sites are only open during certain hours, but you can't open multiple tabs, so good luck trying to remember which ones. Also, people will try to kidnap you, so you have to get up, run across the room and turn the lights off because kidnappers are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or something.  Ps&amp;Cs: + Very pretty + Neat idea - Basically just a clever twist on 5NAF - Everything else ...ok, for reals... - Tedious gameplay - Sites are boring - 90% of the game is waiting for pages to load...to nothing 75% of the time  tl;dr: F this game right in the ear.
11897	At first i though this would be a great game... but no... The hack attacks happen way to often and are way too hard typing all the text out. You cant turn around fully to turn the light off without making your character seem like he is having a seizure if your lucky that is. Dead url pages happen to often and there is no ditermined time when they will be back up. if this game had some updates to fix theses problems i might play again but i highly recomend you dont play this game unless you like being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and having a stroke.
11898	game is very poor quality clicking simulator 2017 everybody make sure u grease up ur fingers before you play.
11899	even though this game is very cheap, its not worht the money, you literally do nothing in the game and could have put more effort in the game and making the 'clickable' page accessible. If you dont get hacked, the game gets even more boring.  This game suck, could have spent your time making a better game.
11900	Pretty fun for about an hour. Then it actually is just Dead Link Simulator 2016.
11901	this is the most terrible and boring game iv everplayed this the gameplay (click click click click oh no im being hacked type some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ crap lick click oh no im being hacked click on arrows click click im being hacked again get hacked because you need to type some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ paragraph in 5 seconds quits game and questions life
11902	I couldn't even play this damn game, because when I got into the loading screen, it froze and I was unable to play the game. Even when I tried to read up on the game, and I asked my friends, no one had an answer that helped me. Turning off the mic option? Nope. Changing the resolution and screen size? Nada. I would've probably liked this game, but I guess we'll never know.  Oh, and looking up advice? With a title like 'Welcome to the  Game,'  I found no results for what I wanted. Good luck trying to play this god forsaken game.
11903	I CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT ! â¥â¥â¥â¥ IT ! â¥â¥â¥â¥ STEAM !  http://i.imgur.com/BPmIzs3.png 
11904	Should not be considered Horror.
11905	It works super badly on my Macbook Air, with the mouse disappearing when I pause and stuff and I can't even get past the loading screen on my PC. I think this game would be great if only I was able to actually play it.
11906	My playtime may show 11 minutes, but I haven't gotten to do anything past the tutorial. Everytime I try to load one of the in-game webpages, the right hand side of every page is cut off, making it impossible to play. I've tried messing with my resolution settings, and it just made it worse. This is a huge shame, because for $2, this seemed like a pretty fun little game. Read the community posts before you buy, a lot of people have major problems with bugs. I put that I do not recommend this game, but that's only if they don't start fixing some of the issues that pop up.
11907	I really wish that I could refund this, its been 5 months already since i bought the game. so anyone can help me how to refund this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game on steam?
11908	I would love to know if the game was fun but everytime I open the game it crashes. No matter what I do it's fine at the title screen but when I hit new game it crashes. If you ask me it's not worth 1.99. I'm asking for a refund for sure.
11909	Boring and the ending isn't that good.
11910	The computer screen is almost entirely black most of the time, and the developer does not put much effort to fix it, making the game almost completely unplayable.
11911	i went in the game, i clicked 1000 times on a link unaible to connect. that was my whole exprecience.
11912	Hecc.  First I spend 4 dollars, excited and happy to play this game.  Only to find out it's always lagging out on me and never getting into the actual game.  Now when I tried to move it onto my background-place it stopped working all together and now it won't let me pay.   Rest in peace 4 good dollars.
11913	at the starting you are at a computer and the call is ringing, i click the computer and it goes to a black screen where you hear the phone ring and it just stays there
11914	Red Rooms are in the Dark Web, not the Deep Web. I don't recommend it for this false information.
11915	sucks
11916	I think this game might have legitimately given me aids. Only realistic thing about it is the 'Unable to connect' message, which are the sad remainder of most tornet sites these days. Still cannot figure out how including studio.cpp into whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ that was could stop someone from elitehakering me, or how someone who's making a onion-based web browser can care so little about security I can apparantly get ddosed, there's multiple apparantly very known exploits in the browser that allows people to, from my understanding remove two lines of code at a time, and compile it, requiring me to rewrite in and recompile it on a now broken computer.   I legit want to not live in the same world as whoever made this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game anymore. Thank you developers.
11917	Its boring to hard
11918	what the hell it doesnt even work
11919	A russian guy jump scared me. Deleted the game, refunded to scary for me!
11920	Unable to connect
11921	It's not fun at all! You ask me why? --Meh i don't know why it's just boring.
11922	DOES NOT WORK. CRASHES EVERY TIME THE GAME STARTS
11923	Game is straight butt and it's boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11924	This is quite a difficult and lengthy game which required great patience to complete which unfortunately is a virtue i do not possess! It is fun if you enjoy puzzle type games yet very little happens until later in the game when the tensity rises.
11925	Here we have a very tedious web page clicker broken up with uninspired mini games and the threat of being kidnapped :/   https://youtu.be/aMpKyROrrwk 
11926	You get to spend hours clicking on links that lead to a error 404 page. Then your ears get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every 5 minutes.  For a better experience, just download TOR and click on all the dead links you want. Spend the $2 on low quality vodka to forget the fact that Let's Players actually LIKE games as awful as this.
11927	I want my money back there is to much lag and I have a really good cumputer!
11928	One time I went onto the deep web and I accidentally hired a hitman on myself. Thank goodness I am a military trained kung-fu professional and I beat him easily and then the hitman guild hired me to be their best guy. But then I said 'no' becuase I was too powerful for them now.
11929	The hacking minigame of typing is to hard. I love the atmosphere of the game and the lore of the deep web pages but the kernal minigame is to hard for me so I can't reccomend the game unless you're an expert typer
11930	Poorly designed tutorial. Unclear interface. Rude developer.
11931	straight garbage
11932	Boring
11933	I click on the web links one bye one but none of them work. The haker is just annoying. Good concept but not for me.
11934	Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ to be completely honest.
11935	0/10 can't type that fast yo, was looking forward to the game but I couldn't get past the tutorial.
11936	Its so boring,and scary
11937	Do I actually want to win? (The reward is a video of a guy being tortured).  Maybe not.
11938	This is just about the stupidest game ever on multiple levels. From the ridiculous movement controls, to the outlandish premise behind the 'deep web' to the awful graphics, unrealistic hacks and everything else in between. It's a complete bore and time waster. Glad it didn't cost much. Even happier I can get a refund. Don't waste your time nothing to see here.
11939	DO NOT BUY. The only person hacked is you! THIS IS A SCAM  I want my $2.00!  There are no codes ever found and all URL's in the game remain dead even after waiting the so-called '2 hours'. It's a good representation of how to rip off people with software and that's about it. Yes, you get hacked in the game and in real life.
11940	THIS GAME WILL ACTUALLY HACK YOU. WHEN I FAILED TO BLOCK THE HACK IT SENT ME OFFLINE IRL... I DONT KNOW ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING PART THOUGH!! DONT PLAY THIS GAME IT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE!!!
11941	im just going to say if you like to type a lot and get scared in the process then this game is for you. i hate this game because i suck at typing out sh!t. its fun but i cant recommend it, check out the vid to see me suck at the game  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=704512911 
11942	  very boring yung penut dont like this gay waste of â¥â¥â¥â¥ ;)
11943	this game is the worst i've ever played, you have no talent as a games designer
11944	Slow internet browsing simulator 2016.  It seems like everything in this game was made specifically to annoy the player. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ where they thinking????  This game is simply not fun. Its not even mildly amusing. Requested a refund.
11945	tbh i watched lots of people play the game (haha) but tbh it dosent deserve the $2 price tag. i do admit it seams like a lot of work went into the game but its VERY boring. if it was cheaper and was made a bit more interesting. then i would consider rebuying and playing the game
11946	I really suggest some fixing for this because I bought the game and ive seen many good reviews and I get to trying it for the first time today and it gets really rediculous for a person with high patience. I waited for an hour for the game to come up and when the hour hit, I just clicked like crazy to get out of the game. And ive seen some fun gameplay of this game and willing to give it a try.. I also done the technique with the mic being off and also my own little things to help my gameplay and nothing worked. Its a great game it seems, but I cant properly make a review for a game I only get to the menu screen on. And if this does get fixed and it gets better on it then I will make a positive suggestion for the game, till then.. Its a no.
11947	Overall I agree with everyone else in the comments: the concept of this game is gold. Its thrilling even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. After watching and hearing about this game online I really wanted to buy and try it.   After getting into the game though, my idea of it changed.  The game is 85% just clicking links and hoping they don't fail. another 10% dealing with the hacks that happen to you and the other 5% with the lights turned off hoping that you don't get killed.  Im a Computer Science major and have experience in programming, so I had no problem with the Kernal hacks, but like 7/10 of the DOS attacks just seemed too hard. Maybe they weren't explained well enough or maybe I didn't pay enough attention (what are the spaces with the multi-arrow symbol?) but I failed most of them.  After two hours of playing it I got too bored to click the back button anymore. I really wanted to like this game but I didn't and I cant recommend it. The developer needs to make more progress happen more often. I understand that the 8 (10? I can't really remember now) key system should work. But I played 2 HOURS and got two of them. The rest of it I was horribly bored and the excitement of getting kidnapped and hacked wears off quickly. Add more things that happen between pages. Make it getting 1 character at a time and don't make us write it down, make it fill in automatically. Then make us get more characters and make them fill in MUCH MORE OFTEN.  Like I said, I love the idea, but the execution is just a boring mess.
11948	It crashes every time I try to play it, even after downloading again and restarting my computer.
11949	WTTG.exe is not responding.
11950	When I start the game up and it's fine, then I click new game and as it loads, the computer has a white box in the top right corner of the screen and the phone just keeps ringing. I can't click anything or pause the game. This has been happening for a while now. I was really excited to play this game but I can't because there seems to be some sort of bug or something. Please help to fix this isuue I know it's not an expensive game but I still payed for it and would like to recieve my money's worth.
11951	I like the idea, don't get me wrong, but I've played this for a couple hours now, and in that time (which has consisted of several separate attempts) I've probably found a cumulative total of 5 keys. I've even used a few guides and videos to see if I was missing something, and even after that I got no further to getting to the elusive 'Red room'.  My time is spent on clicking links - most of them turn out to be dead, some are just confusing or useless, and the odd one might be helpful - hearing a strange noise, waiting for the kidnapper to jog on back to Russia, then repeating this process after another couple of minutes.  I just find the game as it is to be incredibly annoying and after a while, boring.   Maybe I am doing something wrong and missing a few things, but if that's the case then I'm sure that lots of other people might have the same experience as me.  But for Â£1.59 I guess I can't complain........but I'm British so it's pretty much a law that I have to complain given the opportunity.
11952	Would love to play but still facing issues as far as loading for many users it seems. Will open up for me but crashes during the load sequence. Perhaps one day I'll be able to play...
11953	While the mechanics and gameplay are alright and good in concept (except for the cheap jumpscares you get for losing the game), it fails in actually executing that idea in a well put together game.   The main place this game fails is it's writing and the design of the web pages you browse. I tried to look past the 'le spooky deepweb O: DXX' meme it perpetrates and just let my suspension of disbelief do it's thing, but the poor design of the websites just made it very hard to put yourself into the game. Most of the websites looked like they were designed in Microsoft Powerpoint or soemthing similar, and the writing in them ranged from simplistic to just awful. For example, (Spoilers, if you care) there's a website that had some sort of service made that made 'Human Dolls' by doing some sort of surgical mumbo-jumbo. What was supposed to send chills up your spine just left me laughing from the poor writing and just how comically evil what they were describing was. At the same time I was reading this, some sort of stock twinkly music-box tune was playing in the backround, making the experience all the more ridiculous. I've read better creepy-pastas, most of which are more believeable than what was written on that page (End Spoilers).  Ultimately, even though I wanted to like this game, I can't reccomend it to anyone other than maybe someone who is very easily spooked by the cheesiest of horror movies. That said, I still enjoyed the concept and mechanics, so I will be keeping up with the developer to see if the ever revamp to concept into something that is more polished. Or just wait and see if anyone else take the concept up and make something out of it.
11954	Going to be quick. This game changed, and I no longer enjoy it. The developer, Adam, for one thing is a bit of an â¥â¥â¥. You see here is what he did: he removed the location tracker from the game as a sort of secret change in the latest patch. You see, what this did was it gave people, like me, a way of visually seeing when the kidnapper is tracking you. This was the only way I could play the game. Now Adam secretly removed it, forcing you to listen to the minute sounds that play in the background, sounds so quiet I had to boost the audio post recording to even hear it, just to avoid a kidnapper that already doesn't make sense as a gameplay mechanic. I'm sorry, I changed my review to a possitive one when I learned of the tracker, but now that it's gone, I cannot recommend it. If the dev changes it back, I'll also change back my review, but till then, don't buy it, it's just agravating.
11955	Well its annoying knowing you payed for a game and theres a black screen with a white box on my PC in-game. Its unplayable and i have looked everywhere on google, youtube and many more websites such as the forums where there was no help to my problem. I'm soory but i do NOT reccomend it you will get a buggy game.
11956	would be nice if game would work with linux
11957	I brought welcome to the game and got a bit of the way through the tutorial and it crashed. Wont let me play it at all now, will just freeze on the loading screen to play the game. My computer is brand new so that isn't the problem. Very upset.
11958	Buddy and I tried playing it. Made no sense. We seemed to get stuck in a loop with the plot not developing at all. Might be missing something.
11959	This game is prettier to look at than a large number of Steam indie horror games.  It also seems to run very smoothly, when it decides to run. I had numerous crashes at random times, but nothing that like, locked up my PC.  My main gripe with this game is that it seems like such a good game... but why didn't the Dev take the time to get someone who actually reads and writes English to edit the games text?   I think I can safely say that this is a big issue with a lot of smaller, over-seas dev-teams. Grammar and spelling are very important because if not, then your audience disconnects from immersion in the story, and that's exactly what a game should avoid doing! Make it a priority!!! Oh and your buddy who 'kinda speaks English' is not what I mean when I say find a copy editor. Get on some forums and find an native English speaker to help you out! There are a ton of people out there just itching to help with something like this!!  So there's quite a bit of real potential as a short experience for this title, it just needs a little love in the Copy Editing department, and maybe some more optimization so that the game is a bit more stable.  If these things are changed, I'm definitely switching my recommendation for this game!
11960	It's Games like these that give early access a bad name. The core gameplay of wooden house consists of bumming around in a house for 20 minutes and picking up keys; you also have to run away from one zombie whose animations are incredibly jagged and spastic. This is an early access game but there is really no where else for it to go from here, you have the house, you have the zombie, you have the keys, and the one puzzle at the last door. I played through it twice. Don't waste your time. This isn't an early access game it's a bad faith cash grab.          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Let's Play Wooden House&nbsp;
11961	Character movement is like carrying a 500lbs man on your back, as when the game prompts you to run, there literally is no run.  Being chased by the monster is as exciting as listening to an old woman talk about knitting.  For a game which relies so heavily on text, someone with a proper command of the english language should have been involved with the input in this game. Trying to understand the notes made it very difficult to feel any sort of immersion to the story.  Puzzles were poor and the game mechanics added to the frustration.  Only good point was the audio. It was atmospheric and would have been a great addition if the rest of the experience had of been up to par.
11962	Translation is poor, controls are bad, puzzle instructions don't make sense.
11963	Too short. I finished in less than 18 mins.....
11964	Every game in this package crashes at the loading screens and corrupt the save files while doing so. DonÂ´t bother with this games.
11965	Why do 'devs' publish the â¥â¥â¥â¥ created learning the engine
11966	Want a badly translated rip-off of Phobia 1.5 that isn't free, has saving and respawn issues and that will most likely crash on loading screens? Then this is the game for you.  Play Phobia 1.5 instead.          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Wooden House | Terrible Indie Horror Game Let's Play | 60fps Full Gameplay Walkthrough&nbsp;
11967	Buy literally anything else with you money. Walking is too slow, you can't run, the entire lack of UI is awful, you can't change the controls. Even the menu screen is awful. I guess you're supposed to be able to click on the controls menu, but it only stays up if you hold the mouse button down. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯  There is not a single proper English sentence in the first 5 minutes in the game. Prompts are so badly translated that it's difficult to follow instructions, let alone follow any story this game might be telling. I usually don't refund things, but this game sure takes the cake.
11968	 Seriously, don't bother with this one, it's not worth your time.
11969	This is a game, with a ton of potential, is not worth your 3 dollars.  First of all, the frame rate is extremely unstable, with considerable lag spikes. Easily Visible because I was recording my game play.  It would've been a wise investment to have a native English speaker to spellcheck their dialog, because the grammar is an atrocity within itself.  As for scares? You're not going to get any with this game, the monster chase animations are sub-par, and it moves at such a slow pace, and tendency to glitch through doors. The music associated with the jump scares were redundant and disappointing.  The one thing that I loved were the graphics, if you look beyond the poor English and jump scares, there really is a very pretty game under it all.   Overall, if you have $3, you can probably get a cheap laugh out of the game, you might even enjoy it, who knows? I know my time recording it wasn't truly awful.

11970	No 30 Mins OF CONTENT not enough 30 or less
11971	crashes and forces me to restart everytime. too many glitches.
11972	I haven't been this dissapointed in a long time..
11973	Horrible. Don't play this.
11974	Poor english subtitles pretty boring finished in 20 minutes not realy scary at all
11975	  Their is no way this is considered a game! Everything about the game is bad. This is your typical fpsc indie game
11976	THe game lasts a total of five minutes, is incomplete and not even of decent quality. It starts off promising, if you can ignore the slaughtering of the English language. (Truely the only scary thing in the whole game.) You are in the house for one night, then you run outside after having a nightmare. That's it. Don't waste your money on a incomplete game. Totally not worth it.
11977	Between the crippling grammar errors and horrible gameplay, there is not very much to call a game. The STIFFs were quite nice though. And the dead peoples. If you know what I mean, I hope you don't.  Do not purchase this game.
11978	To be honest i purchase this game for trading card and after playing this â¥â¥â¥â¥ i don't know how to get these cards i finish this game within 30 min stupid game and waste of money but if we see as a indie dev.. this game is not too bad but i purchase this game and you guys wasted my money so fu((k you
11979	I play alot of indie horror games, and some of the worst one's I've played have actually been alot of fun. However, 90% of the time, those same bad games are FREE. If you expect someone to pay 3 bucks for your game, you should understand that the players will also expect your game to be WORTH 3 bucks. This game is hardly worth 20 cents. I would have beaten the game in about 5 minutes, if I had not been laughing so hard at the bad english. (For the record, bad english does not bother me, but bad games do).   DO NOT BUY! Go watch letsplayers like myself suffer through this crappile for you. If you feel tempted to buy this game yourself, you can take 3 dollar bills and go wipe your a** with it, cause it's essentially the same thing.   Make it free, and you will get a positive review from me, because it actually made me laugh. Now I'm off to get a refund. Good day.
11980	Picked this up on a whim, I rather enjoy indie horror (especially first person). Couldn't help feeling disappointed, however.   Firstly I'm assuming English isn't the first language of the developers. Nothing wrong with that, but please get someone to proof read your text.   Secondly, I was given confusing instructions at the start ie. get the front door key from a basket in the basement. No basket, no key.  Thirdy, there's very little to actually do other than wander through the (rather empty) rooms reading a few notes and picking up keys. There's two 'scary' moments, somewhat ruined by the word RUN appearing in the middle of the screen in bold red font (Yeah, there's a zombie after me, I can figure that out for myself, thanks) after which the game throws out its only puzzle before abruptly ending.  I'm not expecting a horror epic for Â£2 from an indie dev, but please try to put a little effort in. It was very generic with little to recommend about it.
11981	There is a house. It has doors. Lots of wooden doors. Most are inexplicably locked, although you own said house. Apparently, the real estate agent forgot to give you all the keys.   There are sounds. Horrible sounds. Not good horrible. Just terrible horrible. Also horrible is the English.   You will take a nap. You will drink some wine. It will sound like you have just had Liquid Plumber to drink, but rest assured, this is just apparently the way you sound when you drink wine. You won't die. Yet.   If you are good at running, you won't die at all. I am apparently bad at running, so I died 5 times. In the time it took me to die 5 times, my husband finished the game (we were playing simultaneously). He did not know he was finished. Oh, it also took me so long because EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I. DIED. THE. GAME. CRASHED.   In fact, he had to find someone playing the game on YouTube to confirm he was finished.   I decided I did not care enough to outrun the skeleton zombie creature thing only to have to spend some time connecting wires to wind up on a blank screen. I am done. This was terrible. Save your money.
11982	  Nice 10 mins.. Could do a lot better...
11983	BAD GAME EVER! If you dont play this game...please dont play this indie walksimulator! 10/10 badgames.
11984	The English is atrocious, but the sound design is even worse. I finished it in 32 minutes. Meh.
11985	Even though the game is currently going for $1.79 from $1.99, I cannot in good faith recommend something so broken. It has the standard Game Guru interface, with that annoying heartbeat when you take any amount of damage. There are many weapons in the game including pistols, hatchets, axes, and rifles, but when you try to pick them up a message appears that says 'I'm a peaceful person.' and you're only allowed to use the knife. It really doesn't matter too much, as enemies die in one to two hits. The 'zombie' enemy has the worst AI I have ever seen, and I have played many Unity and Game Guru asset flips and broken cash-grabs, but this is one of the worst. Enemies give up, walk continuously into walls, and do not seem to interact with the enviornment at all. When you take any damage, be prepared for the never-ending heartbeat and the screen to light up bright red. The sad thing is that it actually helps with visability since the game is too dark, and the flashlight is your standard Steam Greenlight horror game quality type. There was nothing good or enjoyable about this game....absolutely nothing. Would not recommend.          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Aztecalypse...Gets Toasty&nbsp;
11986	Single map (I hesitate to refer to these as open world) GameGuru games haven't really been good, Father's Island is the best example; this could be a good example but it really lacks any objectives, the only real puzzle is getting a note which isn't identified by the game which makes a bridge appear &amp; the rest of the time you are basically running around zombies in a too dark area with poor path guidance. It could turn out okay, I have yet to see a GameGuru game get truly fixed (save for I guess Alone K.W. which launched with a bug where most of the walls were missing) but if more objectives &amp; notes are added &amp; the lighting completely overhauled then it could be passable (for GameGuru games on Steam).  Basically more detailed ramblings of the above points: - Too dark, because it is too dark, you wander off the path frequently &amp; either get jagged in geometry or slide into instant kill water. So it needs better path design. - The ambient sound isn't cutting it, there is music in the trailer; at this stage there are too many zombie GameGuru games out there to have the players hearing the same groaning effects. - The 1 note that I did pick up, didn't have any interact text pop-up in front of that green skull statue; I just luckily noticed there was a bridge over the chasm. - There doesn't seem to be a reason to do anything, I've critiscised GameGuru games for just being 'you pick up the keys' before but this doesn't even have that; for all the 'you are there to solve the mystery', that seemed to just involve finding random corpses or walking over areas where there'd be a text pop-up like '???' &amp; then run past zombies. - Zombies can't animate fast enough to be of any point, you can just run past them (this is a problem with all the GameGuru zombie games not just this one). 
11987	Ugh. I knew better when I spent the $1.79 on this game right after it launched, but I was hoping that somehow, someway the game would provide enough fun to make it worth the low asking price.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is my overly patient 'First Play on Launch Day' Impressions and Review Video:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Aztecalypse - First Play on Launch Day! My Lowest Scoring Game Ever Reviewed!&nbsp;
11988	I've wanted Surgeon Sim for VR ever since I got my Vive, but now that it's here, it's a bit of a disappointment to be honest. It feels like an early access title with very little content and lots of bugs.   It's WAY too easy for your virtual hands to get stuck because the game thinks you're trying to clip through something. The collision is really, really stingy and it makes the whole experience feel very clunky.  I also don't like the grip mechanics here... In the original game, it made sense to have full control of all your fingers, but here, it only gets in the way. The trigger should be used to grip with the thumb+index finger and the thumb pad should be used to close the rest of the hand. Having to hold the grip buttons to keep your hands closed is tiring and annoying.  I'm also having some pretty weird performance issues. My framerate keeps dropping even though my computer is MORE than capable of running much more visually impressive games in VR than this (I have a GTX 1070).  Cannot recommend right now. Wait for some patches and more content.
11989	I thoroughly enjoyed the original Surgeon Simulator 2013, and the VR TF2 'demo' was loads of fun. Without reading a single review, I purchased this. I regret it.  The original SS was frustrating in a goofy and fun sort of way. It was part of the charm. The control scheme on the Vive, relying heavily on the side grips, is infuriating. And not in a fun sort of way. A simple improvement might be to simply make the side grip a toggle, allowing you to readily manipulate the index and thumb but easily keeping the other fingers out of the way. As is, it's too annoying to bother with.
11990	I was super excited for this game ever since i tried, Surgeon Simulator: Meet The Medic. It was really funa and the controls were good too. But on this one the controls are horrible and its immposible to pick stuff up. Also the most annoying part is when you pick something up and the game thinks your trying to put your hand through the persons bobdy and shows a skeleton hand and you cant do anything. I would not get this if i were you. Unless if they fix it or if its on sale for $2. Thats how bad it is.
11991	I have almost finished the game, but I want a refund. The reason being is that you pay so much for a game you already own, just in VR. To be fair it's so much fun, but way too easy. It's so easy you could beat the game in 45 minutes. 45 minutes to finish the game unacceptable for a VR game and charging full price! Instead this should be a DLC for the original game or at least get a discount if you own the previous non-vr game. The game is what you expect it to be, except there are no extra content which made it very disappointing. If I do get a refund, and this game gets big free DLCs... I will definitely pick it up again.
11992	I enjoyed the Meet the Medic VR demo so I thought I would enjoy this, however this 20$ game manages to be way worse than the free Meet the Medic VR demo.  Cons: -The lobby is copy-pasted from the origional Surgeon Simulator. -No new gamemodes. -Hands go in to skeleton mode all the time. -When you complete a surgery it doesn't show you your grade, this is something that even Meet the Medic VR did. -Many of the tools are completely broken, for example the mechanical saw doesn't do anything when held agains bones.  Pros: -Although all surgeries are recycled from the origional Surgeon Simulator, it will take about you about 5 hours to complete all the surgeries. -If you've played the game for less than 2 hours and you bought the game less than 2 weeks ago you can get a refound here:  https://help.steampowered.com 
11993	Sounds like a great idea. Do abunch of crazy stuff to your make believe patient. So far this has been a waste of money. The controls are the poorest I've seen in VR. If you just want to be really annoyed then this is the product for you.
11994	The teeth levels really cause my PC to chug with definite frame rate drops on lowest settings. I have a GTX 970.   The first five levels are pretty fun, but so far the rest of the levels seem to be different envrionments which somewhat saturates the fun in the game. I was hoping for a game a bit more in depth than the Meet the Medic Demo, but that is really representative of the final product.
11995	It wasn't like the original SS. Instead with so many glitches and bugs that make the gun not fun. Don't buy it! Not yet at least!
11996	How the hell does this game get a mostly positive? The game is broken. Fix it because it is your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing job. If i dont do my job i dont have one. You should be ashamed to charge money. So â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ right now.]
11997	DON`T BUY IT&lt; IT DOESN`T LOAD 
11998	0.7 hours and already beat the game. I dont mind a short game but... only when its not boring as all hell
11999	Why would you steal an armless persons â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? 0/10 disablity abuse
12000	Scared the crap out of me. Refunded. 
12001	Don't bother buying this, it's a waste of your time. This creator publishes a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game like this every couple of months, doesn't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and asks money for it, and moves on to a new â¥â¥â¥â¥ game to ask money for. Same puzzles, same things, different â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
12002	This game tries to create a spooky atmosphere, but the unpolished exterior takes you completely out of the experience. The English translations of dialogue is laughable, with tons of grammar mistakes and confusing lines. The length of the game is also too short, taking me just an hour to beat (and half of that time was restarting after my game had crashed).  If this game has some updates to fix the many bugs I am open to recommend, but in this state it comes off as a beta.
12003	No. Don't get this game. Save your money, half an hour of your time and most importantly your sanity. It's not worth the disappointment and frustration this joke of a game will give you.          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Autumn Dream | Terrible Indie Horror Game Let's Play | PC Gameplay | Full Walkthrough&nbsp;
12004	I normal don't give bad reviews but this is one of them. The game has potential but it seems like they didn't take the time to translate language or make the textures and graphics better. It seems they were excited to get it out so they rushed it.         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Autumn Dream Gameplay | Complete | Don't look at her!&nbsp;
12005	Seems like a good game and the story is cool but the loading screens I get can last for up to 5 minutes and the game dosnt respond every 5 minutes and when I try to get to the bit after the house bit the game straight up crashes on the loading screen...
12006	This game is just another example of low effort garbage getting shoveled onto steam. It's a bunch of assets slapped together in a linear fashion with no real sense. Can you spend the night in the spooky cabin? Now eat a banana! Now Briskly walk away from these unenthusiastic monsters! Look a bath-tub/stargate?! Now connect some wires in this half-functioning puzzle! Also the translation and grammar is a travesty.

12007	 Early Access Review
12008	To feel the VR experience this was an ok attempt and I liked the gun torch light otherwise darkness horror element, but I found the aiming and accuracy quite poor compared to other games like Arizona Sunshine and Raw Data. Probably not a fair comparison given the price of this compared to them but was enough of an issue that kind of ruined the experience.
12009	My specs: GTX 1070/16Gigs RAM/FX 8320/HTC VIVE  I can not give this a thumbs up. Why? Developers need to look at games that already came out the last several months and not simply copy or use the same ideas as other wave shooters. This game is in no way innovative and it is not 'more fun' than any of the other ones. You are on the same level shooting the same zombies wave after wave. The progression is kind and that is the only thing I do like about it. The assets used are not original ones so it is like deja vu. If you want something that is more fun than this I would say Smell of Death for a more adventure shooter experience (free roam) and definately Containment Initiative if you want a thoughtful wave shooter with gun upgrades and maps to choose. My conscience can not recommend this game but if you just have to have every VR game out the price is cheap but you will get what you pay for. Sorry developers but if you had something new and different to add to the wave shooter VR experience I would have surely thumbed you up. I won't refund this game though just in case you do add something worthy. New game modes? A campaign? A change of maps each wave? Original enemies? Free roaming through a city,suburbs and/or subway? I will change my review if the devs innovate and make this much much better than it is now with new ideas and not just a repeat of others .....

12017	This game is just as bad as it looks. For those curious about it, imagine you are in a cloud level of Mario that scrolls the screen, but you have no way of falling off the edge. The enemies will spawn on either side of you, but the money (or potatoes) that they drop will still roll off, making it hard to collect them all. The story feels nonexistant and feels as though it was inspired by 2010 9gag comics based on how it was written. At no point should anyone consider buying this game, unless it is as a horrible gift for someone that you hate.

12024	Locked in VR isn't awful, but as much as I love escape games it's hard to really give it a glowing recommendation. The better escape games are full of things for you to move around and explore, but the enviroment in this game is mostly plastic, with a majority of the objects in the room being a part of the scenery that can't be touched. It makes it difficult to tell what you're actually supposed to grab, and what's just clutter that you shouldn't bother trying to reach. It's interesting that this game actually gives you a time limit of one hour like real escape rooms, but the time limit just ends up being frustrating for the wrong reasons because some of the puzzles are so poorly implemented that you'll end up spending way too long trying to get them to work and run out of time and have to start over.   The flashlight in the game operates on batteries for some strange reason, and there are a limited amount of extra batteries in the room, but the flashlight doesn't tell you that and the batteries don't look anything like batteries so there's a high chance that you'll end up just stumbling in the dark half of the room trying to use your crowbar on the extremely finnicky and poorly implemented board puzzle that isn't even very easy to do when you can see it because of the weird delay between your hands' movement and the in-game hands. Since you have to hold the flashlight a significant amount of the time, but you can't teleport if both of your hands are full, you end up having to pick things up and toss them a few feet over and over until you reach the other side of the room you're trying to get to, hoping that the item doesn't get stuck somewhere along the way. And finally, one of the puzzles just doesn't seem to work at the moment, so I still haven't completely finished the game. The voice acting is also somewhat poor, and as much as I feel bad for faulting someone for their accent I really couldn't tell what the character was saying about half the time between the accent and the low volume, so I have no idea if he was giving hints or just commenting about the weather. Locked in VR has a pretty decent atmosphere, but there are just too many problems with it for me to actively recommend it. I'd only try it out if you've played the other better titles available.
12025	  Controls don't work and I'm unable to play the game.
