583	1	a	I rate it 9/11 its a solid game some glitches here and there and crashes but putting that aside, Got it for free, Gave it a try and it was pretty interesting, I mean if you want a short game thats pretty wack and some what fun its a game to get.
2627	0	a	While I enjoy the story of this game I cannot overlook the constant crashes and bugs that abound in this poorly ported title, especially given the $25 USD price tag.   My game freezes about 5-10% of the time when checking side quests. Random freezing during loading screens. Performance issues on a beefy rig when running windowed. Unable to interact with required doors/objects during certian missions.  Issues while driving that cause my tires to sink into the road bringing my car to a sudden stop.   Also, this game is locked to 720p which can be fixed with the dpfix mod but installing that brought about an issue where the game freezes when I tab out.   If my friend did not want to watch me stream this game I would have already deleted it within the first hour of gameplay.   TL;DR : Great story, amusing characters in this Twin Peaks inspired game but bugs and crashes make the game nearly unplayable. Not worth the price. 3/10

It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.

1714	1	a	Really good story I have to say. I played it through and I enjoyed. Join to journey and play Penumbra Overture :).
339	1	a	i love this game because it combines my two loves the first being puzzles and the second being satan. the game has a unique atmosphere and perspective, i love any game that lets you be the bad guy. i enjoy this game for the same reason i enyoy TTT in garys mod except i like this more because it forces you to be more intelligent and it means i don't have to deal with other people. i can't right a review on this game without mentioning that i broke it, there are stones that appear on the grass in the garden which you use in a puzzle late in the game, under no circumstances should you pick them up until you need them. a particularly like the things little things in this game like the crow that sits on the tree staring at you. i also need to point out that upside down crosses are not satanic. this game has one of my favourite depictions of satan in it because it is the spiting image of someone i know.
1506	1	a	such scurry, much fright, wow.
720	1	a	It got an interesting premise since it is like the unofficial video game adaptation of The Omen. That being the premise and the fact it comes from an indie studio are the only reasons why i can consider it an OK game and understand why some people love the game.  The only things that really bothered me about the game is that still has glitches considering how many updates it has had and that is very poorly optimized. It also got some really annoying achievements that force you to waste your time just for the sake of it. You can still manage to get them all in 15 hours like i did. If you don't care about the achievements, it can easily be finished in 10 hours or less. It may say in my profile or this review that i played this game for 40 hrs or more, Hell no, i just left it running to get 2 achievements that require it.  Hell yes that you may like it. Liking The Omen movie is a big requirement though.   In my case, I did liked it. However, I also got it for 1 dollar, so, that helped its case too.  [ Nominated it for a steam award ]

1264	0	a	The game is kinda fun but the biggest weakness is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing driving, which makes up about... all of the game. The only reason this game is so bad for me is that every 10~ seconds of holding down the button to turn left or right the car will randomly say 'hey i see you wanna turn in that direction, welp â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.'  Seriously in what world does a driving game not listen to the directions you give it. I mean the shooting is ok and so is the whole gun and repair mechanic but the fact you cant drive three feet without your car suddenly not listening to you is impossible.

1384	1	a	I think I mentioned this in my Overture review but this game blows Amnesia: The Dark Descent away in terms of its plot and actually being a proper horror game. That being said it relies a pretty good amount on you playing the game properly and not just sprinting through it as fast as possible.  Anyone that played Overture (you should play Overture first) will be glad to know that there's less chase sequences in Black Plague. Some of them I couldn't tell if I was actually being chased or not, I wasn't gonna risk it so I hurried anyways. No hordes of spiders chasing you through small tunnels at any rate.  This game is kind of similar to A Machine For Pigs oddly enough in how it handles the plot, I suspect Chinese Room took a lot of inspiration from Black Plague in how they designed AMFP. Though don't get me wrong there's a plethora of ways to die in Black Plague, unlike AMFP which you basically had to try to get something to attack you.  If you enjoyed either of the Amnesia games you'll enjoy Penumbra as well, you just have to keep in mind that it's an older title running on an older engine.

1914	1	a	Pretty decent game here. Survival horror game where you use your brain to think of ways to progress through the levels/areas opposed to the mindless shooting crap with a gun while running around type of horror games out there. Not very much intense action involved in this game, which makes you slow down and concentrate and look for things while being creeped out by the strange atmospheric sounds and visual surroundings. This game is best played in the dark with sound up, all makes the experience much better. The game is rather short, beat in in about 4 or 5 hour, but for what you pay to get this game makes it all worth it. A title I suggest my friends to pick up if you dont mind getting spooked.  Raiting: 7/10

232	1	a	Very fun horror game. There are no jump scares or neither will this game make you â¥â¥â¥â¥ your pants.  But it is indeed horrofic, full gore, blood, and brain tissue. This is the story of a seven year old boy who bruttally murders anyone in his path, using most of the time stealth and satanic powers by making his victims look like a suicide/accident death. Example (Lucius will be): Locking someone in a freezer, forcing someone to put their head in a lawnmower, dropping icicles on people, or taking control of someone and making them jump off a roof. There are about 17 deaths and each are horrific. The map is beautiful and heavily detailed and the sidequest are fun and usefull. The story is captivating. I reccomend this only to people who can think outside the box and can solve puzzles without rage quitting. You can cheat if you get stuck using community guides, because the game is worth the story, but do not abuse it too much otherwise you are not immersed into the world of Lucius Wagner.    The game is a little pricy if you do not find beautiful graphics with great detail a bonus. So this game is a must have in your wishlist to wait fo it to go on sale. I picked up the game for 5$ very much worth it....a little too worth it.

1681	1	a	Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.  Penumbra: Overture is the 1st game in the series. It's decent, but has some rough edges and doesn't quite come together fully.
786	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tare0EnzWTA  Note : Recommended if it's going for a cheap price...   Lucius didn't have much chance of leading a normal life, right from the get go, he's the subject of a summoning ritual while in the womb, and if that wasn't bad enough, at age 6 Satan decides it's time he became a contract killer.  Though don't get your hopes up that this is childhood assassin's creed, there's no combat, or planning out your custom method for taking out the designated target. Instead each 'level' is; you wander around until the camera zooms over to your designated target, then you look at what's around that the game wants you to use to kill them. Sometimes the game helps you out and zooms in on your implementations of death too. Some of these kills get quite creative, others are pretty dumb and sadly others are obscure to the point of frustration. Speaking of which, there's also a night time stealth mission, which is probably the lowest point of the game.  As the body-count increases Satan comes more impressed with your ability and grants you additional powers. The most useful is telekinesis, allowing you to interact with things from a distance. Sadly the remaining powers are pretty limited in their uses; Mind Control does exactly that, but its a case of knowing when the game expects you to use it, who to use it on, and what specifically they are supposed to interact with, which really destroys the potential for experimentation. There's also fire, which serves as pretty much your only form of direct offense.  While the premise is pretty dumb, and working out what the game wants you to do can be laborious, the game does have some pretty interesting puzzles on offer, and what's more just the idea itself more than makes up for the lack of sparkle in the execution.  Sure, there isn't much to the world (it all takes place in a pretty large house) and it doesn't look great; the character models are serviceable, but the animations are really quite poor, and the voice acting (while there's lots of it) is pretty forgettable (except one of the maids and the terrible attempt at an accent). Oh and in the credits they list out all the free sound effects and music that was used in the game...  But for as idiotic as the plot is, it's pulled off so well! The progression from working your way up from the lower tiers of the household and the increased violence that accompanies keeps the game chugging along at a decent pace and leaving you wondering what could possibly be up Lucius' sleeve next.  The storytelling is actually pretty amazing, and the game manages to maintain the dark mood almost the entirety of it (a few of the kills are pretty dumb). An investigator chalking the initial deaths as accidental, the belief that the house is cursed, the idea that there's some kind of coverup, how the blame shifts from one character to another... It a really interesting tale. Sure the actual script isn't on point 100% of the time, but the idea stands up and shines through despite the shortcomings of the game.  Lucius, from a gameplay perspective, is not a delight to play, everything about the implementation is incredibly average to below average... But it is saved by it's plot, which is memorable and something that I've actually discussed with friends, even if only to talk about how messed up some parts are... Which is something that I haven't done with games that have far more polish. It may be asking a lot to overlook the aesthetics, but if you're willing to, you'll uncover one of gaming's better told stories.
1162	1	a	Finnaly can have guns on my car without having the risk of falling out of the car
237	1	a	Devilishly good and entertaining gameplay.
1201	0	a	Visually cluttered to the extent that I couldn't see the track clearly enough to drive round it competitively, so either the game is too fast paced, or the track needs to be more clearly defined.  Gave up before realising that I'd driven the same race several times and that I was supposed to select the next one. It's not the worst game on Steam, but it didn't draw me in as an intuitive and fun experience. It's rough around the edges, but atleast it's cheap and works.
2056	1	a	I haven't gotten too far in the game but thus far I am intrigued by the writing and the story; I would suggest reading a guide here on Steam called something like Beginner's Guide to Inquisitor, which provides a brief walkthrough of the very first part of the game and some other helpful information, some of which is not covered anywhere in the game itself or otherwise implied in a conspicuous manner.  The gameplay seems ok, except I wish it was less action-oriented, but that is just a personal preference which I can overlook considering I also enjoy games like Diablo. What I enjoy most about the game is the lore and premise of the story, there is a lot of reading to do, so if you don't like to read you probably shouldn't get the game. What I enjoy most is the part of the game that doesn't involve fighting and the combat. I still don't mind it too much, but I dislike some aspects of the gameplay and the game doesn't help you along enough with certain information about it, along with other aspects of the game, most of which I can disregard.  I am eager to play this game more but personally am not that crazy about the style of combat and gameplay associated with that; my dislike of the combat might be explained by the fact that I haven't gotten very far in the game and it is more punishing at first, but rewarding later. I think it's a special game and deserves significant recognition for its writing and the unique universe the developers created, which I would like to explore more of, not only because of the writing though but also because of the overall atmosphere of the game. The music is great also, and the game doesn't look too bad and is fine at higher resolutions. Inquisitor has that classic RPG thing going, but not just for the sake of it being classic or old, it just works out that way.
1253	0	a	not really that great of a games. So many better options out there. Design is really lacking. Doesnt create a desire to keep playing.
2187	1	a	One of the most memorable video games you'll ever play. The gameplay won't blow you away, but it has a great story, a ton of characters, and quite a lot of fun side missions and stuff to do.  You might be better off getting the PS3 or 360 version of the game, since the PC port is notorious, but there's a guide:  http://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut  that can help with the most common issues. Just remember to save often.
1937	1	a	Terror lurks behind every corner...in the form of dogs and spiders. Seriously, the only enemies in this game are dogs and spiders. The puzzles and story are okay, but really, this game is only worth playing so you can get the first part of the story to the amazing Penumber Black Plague.
1030	1	a	Awesome game!!! Sometimes, it reminds me of Land of the Dead meets Death Race! Lovely blood gore gameplay with tons of achievements to unlock. Graphics is also good. No need of high end gaming rig to run it smoothly. If you like to play zombie killer games with set of wheels, this is the perfect game to choose from. I'll rate this game 10/10. Highly recommended during Sale.
2563	1	a	How much to like this game is determined by one question: How much do you like Twin Peaks?  Because if you love David Lynch's show, then you will love everything about Deadly Premontion: Memorable and abstract characters, set in a small town in Washington with gameplay that feels like it was conceived in the Resident Evil 4 era. If you like a good weird experience, you will find it with York and Zach.   HOWEVER...!  Be warned that this is HORRIBLE PC port of an already pretty technically flawed game and it tends to crash. A lot. Your experience might be even worse than mine because I almost completed the main game, but got stuck when the last patch made it pretty much unplayable for me.

1483	1	a	Totally Amazing Game. I loved it from start to end, Black Plague is seriously more scary than Overture (which had its moments) and action that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Although this game isn't as scary as 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent' it still made my heart race and made me jump a few times. If you have some spare money, or in the mood for a nice horror/thriller game. This is the one for you.  Gameplay 8/10  Scare Factor 6.5/10  Story 7.5/10  Action 9/10  Overall 8/10   p.s. if you haven't finished Overture before playing... prepare for spoilers ;)

1016	1	a	I have mixed feeling about this game, overall it's good but not very well done, I'm reviewing it with all dlc available. Edit: I have beat the main story so I think I should update this review   pro : - good music - stunning graphics - ram all zombies and blood everywhere - good game without thinking much  con: - there are not much content in this game so the game feel very much repetitive, I played until the very end of the game and the last 2 levels are very predictable - the survivors that looks like asian has russian accent :D ( I think it was on mission 28 or 29) - feels like mobile game with controller support, i don't know why, but it just feel that way - the plot is kinda stupid, till the endm why a taxi driver do everything and army sit behind desk. I meant the story is pretty much predictable - I hate the zombie that can throw things, i just don't make sense at all, I keep thinking when playing where they get throwable things and able to throw like 50 meters away -- and when there are too many of them and you don't pay attention you will die almost instantly from them  other: - GPU intensive, my notebook was overheated while playing it for hours :D - CPU intensive too starting on mission 25++ - The apocalypse DLC ruins the game because new player like me didn't know anything about the game and we could pick truck monster that was overpowerful for early level.  -   stupid ending, doesn't explain anything    final score 7/10 (it was 6.5) give 0.5 because at least they put something new for the last mission

1519	1	a	If you like being scared crapless and feeling helpless this is the game for you. Fighting 99% of the time is not a option so out smarting your enemy and using stealth is a must. If you like feeling like a super soldier and plowing through your enemies this game will make you feel like a 5 year old school boy sitting in a cold dark tunnel crying for your mommy as a pack of rabid dogs or nut job miner gets ready to tear you apart. This game is probably best played with friends or else your going to be so paronoid and freaked out that youll be afraid to turn the lights off.   Basically if you want to know my experience of the game i spent most of my time huddled in a corner flicking my lighter or flashlight on and off to afraid to go around the next corner because i could sense i was about to be brutally slaughtered by some unknown force.

Another thing I'd like to add is that the game really benefits from a PC port, the graphics don't magically turn perfect but they are better on PC. Also a stable framerate is a gift of god.

Swery is a tortured genius, and his artistic soul -- tender and tormented -- is laid bare, raw and awesome. It would be a folly comparable to the fall of man to not partake in the seductive madness and ensnaring purity that is Deadly Premonition. If you do just one thing with your life that you can look back on with pride and say, 'I did it perfectly' when on your deathbed, let buying and playing this game be that one thing.

Try to do anything, you die, until you die enough times to feel out what specific actions you need to take to not die so quickly. Granted, I played on the hardest difficulty so it probably would have been quite a bit more manageable on lower difficulties, but the lack of direction killed it for me. Not on a macro story level, but on a micro encounter level.   For example, hopefully without spoilers, one level immediately drops you into an encounter where the character states, in subtitles, that they need to seal 'that door' whilst looking at a door that obviously can't be the target of the statement. You are then in a large room with somewhat of a gauntlet arrayed before you, and if you take more than half a second to look around, even to get your bearings for the first time, you are dead. It took me at least a couple dozen attempts to coincidentally use that half second in the right spot facing the right direction to realize there was a button. Then I died again. And that was just the first leg of the gauntlet. There were at least two of these situations, together probably representing half of the time I put into this short game. Half the time the game decides to ignore its own mechanics, such as an enemy completely ignoring a distraction that should have worked, and had worked on previous occassions, for no discernable reason. There were also several cases where I would be hiding behind cover, such as a box or around a corner, waiting for the chance to sneak by, and the dog I was hiding from would suddenly start growling and teleport right next to me to rip my throat out. This game made me feel as though there were some hidden timer, and I weren't allowed to go more than a half-minute without dying, usually for no fault of my own.  The controls aren't very intuitive when it comes to the use of tools. I often found myself swinging short or my goal, or in a different manner than I wanted, which in itself got me killed quite often. There wasn't much story, nor was I particularly captivated, but this is only the first chapter in a trilogy. I did like the character Red very much however, in both his voice acting and portrayal. I will also admit that even with all these things, once the credits rolled I was surprised to find how small the crew was, and for the team size I think the game was pretty good.  Context aside though, as the game itself stands I don't find myself compelled to recommend it.

1121	1	a	Zombie Driver doesn't sound like much on paper, but it's actually a very addictive game once you've given it a chance. The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.  If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0

1548	1	a	Fun enough to play through a few times..at most. For it's release date, nobody should expect it to play super well or look great. Go into it expecting to enjoy the suspense and the story, and you'll be satisfied. Yes, its scary at some points; in your first playthrough, you get to realize you can't do anything to defend yourself except run and hide, making the game all that more terrifying.   The Other game that comes with BP, called 'Requiem' has absolutely no enemies, scary moments, or plot; It's a series of repetitive puzzles.   7.5/10 for Black Plague 1/10 for Requiem

1463	1	a	The scariest and best overall Penumbra title. It abandons the complex gameplay of Overture to deliver a more linear and horror-focused narrative, which in my mind is a good thing. Weapons have been stripped out, leaving you defenseless against the horrors that lurk within the Research facility. Light sources such as glowsticks have been nerfed, and enemies are far more deadly. Puzzles are excellent, and Penumbra's overarching plot never fails to grip and intrigue.
1673	1	a	Amazing! mind boggling puzzles with good mechanics make this game so special. The atmosphere in the game can also crush a persons mind very fast.
1489	1	a	An Amazing title. Pioneering on a single concept of hand gesture gaming this game showcases great talent of a small independant studio. The game immerses you in a dark story of discovery on an abandoned facility. the gestures work great and the game is, for a lack of better words, Scary. you should pick up the whole series.   8/10

1754	0	a	This is one of those cases where Steam needs a 'Maybe' button, but since binary is the only option (and my experience of the game is bent slightly towards the negative) i'll have to go with 'No' and then proceed to explain why.  You play as some dude trapped in a mine underneath the freezing cold of Greenland. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: You arrive to an 'area' of the mine, which consists of a few rooms connected by halls patrolled by monsters. You can see the map of the area in numerous locations in the halls (some are almost next to each other... was it so hard to have the protagonist carry the map around and view it with a simple button?). You visit the rooms, find clues, closed doors, broken machines, etc. and must then proceed to solve these puzzles in order to progress to the next area. You cannot visit previous areas nor move on until you completely clear the current one.  You get some makeshift weapons, though you're not supposed to use them and instead sneak by the enemies by crouching and moving carefully in the darkness (BOOORING! it was slightly exciting the first time but seriously, there's some parts which you must navigate back and forth, and having to sneak carefully EVERY SINGLE TIME? c'mon), though i ended up developing a strategy to kill all the monsters so i could then move freely about  What i disliked the most was the story to game length ratio. The whole plot is summarised in two sentences at the beginning of the next game, and it really feels overstretched at some points (a lot of times i was like 'ugh, can something happen please? i'm just here solving all these puzzles and nothing happens story-wise')  Audio, video and ambience are OK, but definitely not scary (and i always played with headphones and at night with all lights off). I really hope they didn't intend the locations to be frightening or disturbing, because if they did they fell very short of it.  Finally the puzzles can be divided in two categories: traditional and physics-based. Traditional puzzles are like 'this machine is broken, find the parts, place them in the correct spots and start the machine with a specific sequence of steps ambiguously described in this text' and they always feel too easy. Physics-based puzzles are like 'an electric fence is blocking the way' and you must move things around (boxes, planks) to get through. Now i don't have anything against pysics-based puzzles, but most of the time there's no indication whatsoever that you're facing one of these, so you can spend some time wandering around an entire area until you realise that in the room in the complete opposite side of the mine has some stuff that MIGHT be the physics puzzle that you need to move on.  tl;dr more annoying than innovative, and definitely not scary at all.

983	1	a	Zombie Driver HD as the title says is a game about driving. And the problem of driving game is that most of the time they gets boring real fast. I like that game, the music is good, the graphics are pleasant enough but there are lacks of variety. You just spent 90% of your time to go pick some guys up or to destroy something. That's the main problem of the game. Another problem is the scrolling speed. When you pick a fast car and if you use turbo it is going too fast and you don't see well what you're doing and where you're going.  However, I still find this game fun. It's a no brainer, that's why and I like the idea of blasting away zombies with a mounted minigun, laser, rocket on a taxi,bus,limousine etc. But one thing I don't recommend is to buy it full price.

This review is getting a thumps down, based on the fact that it doesn't work, and you cannot even get it to the game.  I had to leave it for 5 minutes in a windows saying that the exe had crashed, in order to write this.
2340	1	a	A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC! Play it on console!  I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue. Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied 'Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize' .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.  ..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.  Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.  The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.  Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 - get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...

The graphics, combat system and narrative seem cheap and slightly broken at first and you'll be amused in an ironic sort of way. Quickly this disappears to be replaced by genuine affection for the characters, the town and even the things that you previously considered broken. I wouldn't change a thing.

2198	1	a	Okay here's the deal with this game.  You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage. Framerate is atrocious, freezes and drops are frequent and completely random. Like, I had to play the game on two separate machines in order to get to the end. Driving is the worst you've ever seen, shooting is clunky and shooting sections are tedious. This game is a technical turd.  BUT, there is a good reason why Deadly Premonition is a cult hit.  The cast of characters, story, atmosphere, and the central mystery will make you chew through the issues if you're into Twin Peaks, can handle Lynchian, as well as general japanese weirdness, and non-linear storytelling. It's almost like this game has no right to be any good, but it has so much soul, and leaves you with such heartfelt goodbye, that you won't be able to anything but recommend it. Plus, it deals with some really heavy themes like child abuse, â¥â¥â¥â¥, transsexualism, and it can get very rough and creative when it comes to violence, down to straight up shocking. It goes beyond what most games try.  The great moments in this game shine so brightly, that you'll wave off the jank.

I dunno if I would get this for a $10 but its worth buying the game at whatever price you feel comfortable with. Game is loaded with driveable vehicles and you can upgrade things nicely.

It is a top down driver shooter, where the camera will constantly swing around as you turn however it is great fun if you don't mind gta 1 type top down driving, had the game on the xbox when it first come out glad it's on steam now.  playtime might not appear like ive played it much but just was trying it out to see if its changed much since i last played it and nope im still a little bit dizzy but i'd still recommend the game for sure!
2079	0	a	They call it hardcore RPG. I've played most of the CRPGs in the last decade, and i can tell you for sure that this game is not hardcore, it's just broken. It takes 2-3 minutes to kill the weakest enemy you can find, because both of you have a 90% miss chance. To recover you have to wait for eternity or buy potions which cost awfully a lot. I tried a trainer and maxed all my stats, i am still not able to win a 1 vs 2 fight with a god character. BROKEN.  Besides that, the game has a nice frame, interesting dialogues and quests, truly rpg. But it's all ruined by the combat system. It would be a gem but it's just too painful and frustrating to fight.   Buy it only on sale &lt;0,40$  Story/Quest/Visuals: 8/10 Combat System: 2,5/10

So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10

951	1	a	  Playing as the six year old son of the Devil (like in The Omen) was really fun. Similar to Hitman: Blood Money, the levels are big and the objective is to find ways to kill your target. Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.  The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.

(Mom walking in place at a door when the door is locked) -It is very linear in most aspects, ie: you can't do certain things unless you check your journal first, even if the update in the journal is a conversation you are in the middle of having.  -And a minute problem, I think the 'Devil' could have looked better. Although it's many issues, I do still like the game. I'm wondering what else may be coming out from the developers.

A survival horror game that requires a lot of forethought and skill to actually survive. Very unique experience with great puzzles and a story that continues straight into the sequel, Black Plague. If you're looking for something to scare your pants off for a few evenings then this and it's sequels are worth getting.
860	1	a	Oh Lucius, with his blank expression and dead eyes.   Overall a pretty fun and wellmade game, although a bit aÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶hÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶ anticlimactic by the time the credits roll. Stepping into the tiny shoes of Lucius you get the sense and feel of what made the Hitman games so inventive although once you scratch that surface, the goals are much more linear and there's really only one true solution to wiping out each member of the household. Sure you can experiment and have fun, but this will always lead back to a 'game over' screen. This doesn't make each chapter any less fun.   Honestly, I had a great time running aroung a confusingly constructed house, observing many of the twisted occupants, and then gleefully offering them to that Lucifer fella. There's a lot of fun little detail (shine your flashlight on Lucifer,) so many gruesome deaths, a bunch of chores to do, and math class.   Definitely worth the price of admission.
767	1	a	Childhood. Birthday cake. Playground. Friends. Family. Schooling. Presents. Horsing around. Dead bodies aplenty. Huh? Now, most people would never equate dead bodies with their childhood but you will when you play as the son of the devil. Lucius is the a gem of a game beacause it flourishes with what so many fps video games refuse to admit to: that we don't need a reason to kill anyone. Okay, in Lucius 'dad' wants more souls so we have to kill people for that reason. However, like every other gamer whom has played this game the joy of Lucius lies in the simple question 'whom should I kill today?'. As I played I thought of a song from a little known heavy metal band from detroit called Meliah Rage. That song was 'Kill To Survive'. As people died before my eyes in all matter of gore I sang to myself, 'I kill for killing, cause killing is my life..... I kill to survive'. That's as much as I can remember but this game delivers that devilsih joy of just killing people. Of course if I had made Lucius it would get ban every where on Earth because there are levels of depraivity, narcisism, and homicidal intention that people in the real world sink into without remorse. I would have given the gamer not just mind control but several options to make those dummies do something disgusting. Hopefully the secong game of Lucius will set our murderous selves free and let the gates of hell consume the world. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Thumbs up.

477	0	a	Unlike real games, Lucius gives you almost no hints. It's a 3rd person game where you use your powers to murder people as you play as the son of the devil. More people you kill, the more your power grows in the story. The first time is a tutorial and basically tells you how to kill the first person and you're told each and every new target you get a hint in the jurnal. The hint is invisible to me or doesn't give me much of a suggestion. I was meant to kill some guy who smoked, ok. I realised damaging the gas on the cooker would be the point, however I had no idea how to make him go into the kitchen and light up.  A very interesting idea, but it falls flat and the arm animation on the characters seem a little...off.

He's right because dp.exe has stopped working. My 50 minutes of play reflects how much I enjoyed this game though for the money, I wouldn't have minded finding out what happens after they discover the cut up lady in the tree. I tried several claimed fixes including the PhysX upgrade through nVidia GeForce Experience panel (which is a later version than what was supplied with this game so prevents further attemps of the so-called 'repair' fix that didn't change the crash experience for me, anyway). Nothing seemed to help. It's not as though my system is so old or incompatible (ASUS i7 notebook with 8GB RAM &amp; GeForece 610M with 2GB RAM running Win7)

31	1	a	Remember that horror flick titled The Omen? I know it was released in the '70s but it had some sequels (and a remake in the 2000s) and it was a unique film so you probably remember it.  Lucius, in essence, is the video game version of Omen. You take control of a 6-year old boy who, wait-for-it, is the son of The Devil. Now, the goal here is to eliminate people one by one in the household where Lucius lives. This is quite the manor as daddy is some famous politician who is preparing for the upcoming elections. So, the house is full of maids and other servants - offed one by one without anybody having a clue.  And that is the point here. We cause accidents. Pick up items, combine these items and get rid of the evidences or make sure those point to another person. I like how the breadwinner of the family and his wife slowly go mad as they have no idea how these people died or for what reason. Between the almost 20 chapters we get to see many cutscenes with some decent voice acting. A detective gets involved and decides to really find out what goes on with the family.  Anyway, I do not want to spoil it. The game has very nice graphics and memorable music. I like how the effects change to indicate a different time of the day or different season. This is good as it brings us change and running around in the same house does not get boring. Different rooms / areas of the house get into focus in each chapter and it is not uncommon that the season itself has a role.  Later on the game starts granting us abilities such as telekinesis or mind control. To be honest setting people on fire was a bit too much - after all this is an adventure game. I think they should have just stuck with the stealth / adventure approach but for some reason they added this spell to spice up the gameplay a bit. In fact, the ending sees two ways of solving the game: there is an action as well as a puzzle-oriented solution.  The game has some flaws, though. For instance, in some cases I really could not find out as to what I needed to do. Lucius does hint at the next task (you have a journal which regularly gets updated with his notes) but they are not always very helpful. Oh well, just grab some guides then and complete the game like in the old days with the point-and-click adventures, am I right?  I am a bit perplexed to see many negative reviews stating this game is mediocre at best. I think this is a nice little game and a must-have for the adventure game fans or those who like the idea of playing an homage to Omen.

So there is only one way to go through the game (only in the last mission you will have a choice to go for action or puzzle solving). But all in all the story is quite nice and it's all about finding the right keys and clues to do the murder. It's just fu*king great!

2823	0	a	The game itself is great, but playing the PC port was one of the worst gaming experiences I've my life. THIS GAME IS BROKEN DO NOT BUY IT.  Right off the bat the game had problems. It would crash upon starting, and had to be trouble shooted to even work. Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash. At its worst point, I had to download a save file from someone else that was past a crash point just to continue the game.  Here are some of the fun things I did during the course of this game -download a fan made patch to 'fix' things -Run the game in older windows compatability modes to get past crashes -switch the game to windowed mode to get past crashes -lower the resolution to get past crashes -download save files that are past crash points -dig through the game files and repair files in hopes it stops crashes -turn off steam overlay to stop crashes -ask on forums how to get past crashes at specific points  I couldn't even finish the game. I someone made it all the way to the epilogue and hit another crash wall. At this point I couldn't take it anymore and just watched the ending on Youtube.  I tweeted the creator of the game, and he replied that he had nothing to do with the PC port and that its the PC development company's fault. I tweeted the development company and they told me there is nothing they can do because they don't have a development team for Deadly Premonition anymore.  It sucks because the actual game itself is great &amp; unique. Do yourself a favor and get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead.

I can tolerate an awful PC port; that's what I did for Saints Row 2 and I loved that game (except for the port part, of course). What I can't tolerate is a PC 'port' that does not work at all. Shame on Rising Star for releasing a game that is literally unplayable.

806	0	a	Lucius thrives on the suspenseful build-up and gruesome pay-off of its high body count, but not much else. The delectable killings seesaw between immersion shattering hilarity and visceral jolts of brutality. The game rapidly falls apart towards the end, as all charm that was present is thoroughly eradicated. Don't go in expecting anything of substance that demands multiple playthroughs.  An intriguing concept tarnished by a shoddy delivery.  5/10

599	0	a	I'm playing this, because it's an adventure game. But I've never played a game so full of bugs. Clipping issues, falling through the floor constantly in one climactic scene, etc. I'm honestly surprised they came out with a sequel considering they haven't even worked the bugs out of the first one yet.  The concept is ok and while it's working properly it's pretty fun, but when it isn't you want to have an exorcism performed on your PC.  However, there isn't much actual story. You get assigned someone to kill, you kill them (and have exactly one way to do so), and then it fades to black and the next 'mission' starts. I was really expecting more of a sandbox.   If you are patient with bugs and like the idea of basically being the kid from the Omen, then this could be recommended. For everyone else, spend your money on a telltale game or something.

1005	1	a	HD version of the original with quite a few improvements. They've basically fixed everything, and improved the quality of the effects. I noticed slight graphical improvement with the environment, but not much. The dialogue was barely fixed. There were still parts where I was like 'Skip...Skip...Skip...COME ON!' I want to *hick* run this *hick* game into a *hick* wall sometimes...... *hick* Seriously. Drunk people don't do that or sound like that. STOP IT!  Missions were improved, and I don't remember the original having the huge boss fights which can actually be challenging towards the middle of it. I also got the DLC with the car and the truck. The truck helps a lot, but you'll also have to upgrade the dlc car if you want to beat those timed missions with... *hick* time to spare. *hick*  One of the things people wanted was multiplayer, and I'm really hoping to see that in a possible sequel.

1641	1	a	Penumbra Overture is an absolutly incredible game. This is the first installment to the Penumbra series and it's one of the best (right next to Black Plauge of course :P)   Rich in story: This game just makes you keep wanting to play it just to find out how the story pans out!  Scary and Heart Pounding: The Atmosphere is amazing, it's dark, creepy and mysterious. The game is also super heart pounding. When you're finally hidden from an enemy you just wish you never have to leave the hiding spot you're in to run from the terrifying creature chasing after you!  The feeling of isolation: The only contact you'll make with someone is through a radio to a character known as 'Red'. You'll never see another person, but you'll have the knowledge that someone else is in the same facility as you, and to get to that person is your final goal. It feels lonely walking around the facility, even with that final goal in mind...  I could go on and on but we'll leave it at that.  I give this game a 10/10 - my third favorite horror game and maybe even one of my favorite games in general!

Scroll all the way down until you find 'PhysX_SystemSoftware' right click it -&gt; Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch! ______  Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.  Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!  Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit. At least that's what I saw in my coffee..

1708	1	a	Started playing the game with some nicely done exposition about a strange mine in Greenland or something? The bugger I was playing as was stupid enough to go there alone and I ended up trapped in that same mine. Spooky ghosts were making noises and whispering into my ears.  Then I found a doggy in the mines and it tried eating me and at that very moment I broke my ALT and F4 keys.  11/10.
2082	1	a	The game is good, if you like reading. It is like diablo but with not so great combat(enemies are really OP even in easy). It's worth it if you like Old School RPGs and want to do something with your laptop what is about 6 years old

2978	0	a	Hey now, don't be confused by all the hype you've heard. This game plays poorly, really poorly. It's unstable and has poor FPS. Mechanically, it's a mess. It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).  The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.
2562	1	a	This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those 'gameplay is king' people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.

38	1	a	As a fan of The Omen movies, I immediately bought this game desipite the so-so reviews.   Yes, as a quality game it fails in some ways. The graphics are pretty bad and I thought I was looking at a Halflife 2-era game because it looked like something off the Source engine.   There also isn't a lot of freedom to trap setting because once you find the solution that's it. It's basically an adventure game.   Now that the bad is out of the way, the concept is so awesome and the deaths are so unbelievably cruel and gruesome that it's a memorable experience. I would wait until it goes on sale, however.

2518	1	a	For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning:   The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.  Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)  The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.  TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.  In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.

1586	1	a	Penumbra: Overture had rabid dogs sprinting towards you at high speeds in dark, musty mine shafts; Black Plague has plodding naked people with giant heads wandering around fairly bright environments and this annoying virus ghost thing that never shuts up instead of good old Red. Aside from several nice setpieces I wouldn't consider it a scary or tense game compared to its predecessor (the slower enemies and better-lit stages make running past them a viable option in places where stealth was intended), but as a first-person adventure game it is a fairly solid, good-looking experience that's aged well and worth playing since it's bundled with Overture.

1076	1	a	Very good game! Played it for hours and hours!
32	1	a	Quite possibly the most evil game ever created.  Bravo for another Indie developer.   This game is something else even though it's a familiar genre. As you play you may recall such movies as The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist and Final Destination, among others. Also, if you like Hitman and Death to Spies series, then this game is definitely for you.   Anyways, I believe that Shiver Games is onto something here. This could easily be made into a movie. You play as the son of devil who wants you to harvest souls for him by killing people, or by rather making it look like freak, deus ex kind of accidents. You live in a huge manor along with a congressman (your fake father), his family and about a dozen of staff.   You play through 18 chapters (even though four separate chapters are molded into two missions, so it's essentially 16 chapters).The game may take you at least 6 hours to beat if you don't use any help online (which I quite often did).   This game requires your utmost attention, there are no abstract objectives as to what you are supposed to be doing. You have to read between the lines. You have to use your Ouija board and your notebook to try to figure out who is the next target. It may take you a long time to figure out which tool to use and on whom. After the sixth mission or so, you get access to the rest of the manor and you can pick up items that you are going to need for the rest of the game, making the job easier later on.   You also get to do around 7 menial chores to increase your behavior level in order to get three presents from your parents. As far as the killings go, well some of them are absolutely atrocious and were it not for the somewhat mediocre engine, they could look even more gruesome. The ambiance is awesome, the soundtrack is outstanding, the voice over decent enough (by male actors mostly, I found female voice acting weak).   One thing that bugs me is that Lucius doesn't speak, although they admit to that in the game itself.......There are also numerous crosses spread throughout the house that are nailed to the walls. These crosses take away your abilities of which there are 4 (telekinesis, pyro-control, mind control and forgetfulness spell). So you have to turn them upside down to be able to do your black magic tricks.   The story and the pacing of the game are amazingly well put together, the 'freak accidents' get more and more, well, freaky, and the detective investigating the murders narrates the entire story with a small preamble before each mission. Your parents also start getting suspicious to the point of them being scared of you, so every murder has an effect in the game. This kind of story telling sucks you in to say the least.   The last buggy mission coupled with some graphical glitches like (people warping ahead or you getting stuck in doors) was slightly annoying but it wasn't anything game breaking. In the end, I feel that this game needed slightly more polish. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is definitely an adult game, made by a confident studio. If the religious Right had GTA in their cross-hairs for all these years, then I would not be surprised if this game got the same treatment. That would be awesome so the game could get more publicity resulting in more sales. So please don't forget to support this new and bold Indie Developer, this IS a PC-exclusive after all.

533	1	a	Killing people as 6 year old, how can you go wrong? Open world-ish gameplay and inventive deaths makes it a good game however it's a little let down with poor directions and very little hints. Some areas will have you wandering around for ages looking for a clue when it turns out to be a tiny marker on the ground which you need to be 1ft away from. Overall a good game, storyline feels rushed but for the morbidly curious this ticks a lot of boxes.

613	0	a	Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...  Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).

2459	1	a	Zach, have you heard of the 2010 video game Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro? It's about an FBI agent investigating a mysterious murder in a seemingly peaceful small town. On the surface it looks to be based on the 1990 television show Twin Peaks, but it really takes the idea in a new direction. It's a very unique experience!  I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song 'Life is Beautiful' holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable.   Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story. Thankfully there are fans that love the game so much that they created their own patches to fix some of the problems! I highly recommend you look into them, Zach.  What's that Zach? Coffee? What a fantastic idea!

Its made by the creators of Amnesia so you know the story is going to be good.  I recomend this game to an Amnesia fan or just a common person wanting a good cheap game to play.  Oh yeah, it only costs $10 for the whole collection.

2665	0	a	I was interested in this game because it has many fans and was supposedly good. What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.  The gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':  1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).  2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.  3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)  4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.  So a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.  Incredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.  This is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.

1642	1	a	If you like Amnesia, this is the developer's first game and it lays the foundation for what came later. It shows in a lot of ways, but it is by no means a terrible game.  For starters, this is the only game Frictional Games has made that feature weapons and combat. This is a good thing, as Overture's combat is clunky and broken. Swinging requires you hold left click, pull to the left or right to prepare a swing, and then swing in the opposite direction to hit. The hit detection is very short-range and the swing area is small. However, the most commonly encountered enemies (dogs) are easy to kill as you can use boxes to stand out of reach of their attacks and simply stun-lock them with your weapon until they die.  The atmosphere is creepy, but all of the story is through notes and you never really encounter anybody else. Aside from some rare jump scares, there's nothing terribly scary because the combat AI is so laughably easy to manipulate. There are spiders in this game, which might make you freak out if you have arachnophobia.  Luckily, the game is puzzle-oriented and there are only a handful of areas full of enemies. Most of the puzzles are figuring out a process of doing something such as turning on a generator or determining a four-number door lock by translating it through Morse code. The Morse Code puzzle is probably the most difficult out of the bunch and merely requires a pen and paper (or notepad) to write down possible combinations; all other puzzles involve manipulating objects in your environment and following some written instructions.  The story ends on a cliffhanger in Overture, so it's recommended you ALSO play Black Plague, which plays much more like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and has much better story presentation. Requiem is technically the third game in the series but is only tangentially related to the other two.  So if you're looking for a horror game that involves atmosphere and puzzles rather than focusing on combat like Condemned or Resident Evil, this is a good place to start. It runs on just about anything at a respectable framerate.

268	1	a	I completed this game in 5.7hrs and I felt like it was an endless puzzle action game... I loved it. It had a few puns once in a while.
2704	0	a	I want you to play this game, just not on the PC. Do you have a PS3? If so, turn it on and download this classic. It really is one of a kind at the moment with no other game to compare it to. Sadly the PC port is a right pain in the a$$! I had to fight with it for way too long, starting my game over because of saves that corrupted.   By the time I was done trying to get the game to work, I was afraid to mess with any of the add on content and played it in windowed mode in fear of it crashing. With that in mind, this game loves a good crash more than Nascar fans. If I could I would tell you it was worth it since the game is amazing when it is working, if you overlook the low budget that is.   Yet, you might not at the moment have any other choice but to play it on PC. If you choose to endure that path, get ready to fight for your right to play the game without problems. Now with the port aside, the game is far from perfect at times even seeming to be broken in places. The vibe it sets and the story it tells is just so cool that you learn to live with the many flaws and ugly graphics.   Also it does have one of the most annoying boss battles I can remember right at the end, but this game is still great and different. If you loved the TV show Twin Peaks, this is a must have and for any surreal fans, you would just be better off getting it on PS3 or finding a copy of the original on 360.

2624	0	a	I would love to recommend this game, really I would. It has a really nice plot, the minigames are suprisingly fun, the shooting action, while stiff and rather easy, feels pretty rewarding. It plays almost as a homage to Twin Peaks with a little bit of Silent Hill thrown in for good measure, and I absolutely oved it for all of its flaws (it even got me into Twin Peaks)... until the game would not let me pass through a certain point because of a gamebreaking glitch involving the time. And I couldn't go back because there's only one save slot.  The truth is this pretty damn good game can be downright unplayable because of the number of glitches and bugs that just seem to absolutely ruin the game. I'm not talking small things like stiff animation and bad lighting, I'm talking glitches that can literally mean you must restart your game or your computer in order to move on... or have to start from the very beginning. I cannot, in any good heart, recommend this game because it has terrible memory leaks that usually cause the game to crash after about an hour or so. When it isn't that, it is a game glitch that I have read is linked to the in-game clock. In a word, if you're outside at exactly the wrong time, the game will crash to desktop until you smoke to let the time pass ('smoking' in Deadly Premonition is akin to waiting in Skyrim/Fallout/Oblivion, except it requires an item) until the next day or until the crash no longer exists. If you've SAVED outside or if you do not have smokes or enough supplies to last until after you smoke, then you're screwed and you MUST restart your game. If this game had multiple save slots, it could be salvaged by saving in multiple slots, but sadly it does not. Sometimes, I have heard that running the game as administrator or setting compatibility mode can fix these bugs, it is not a sure thing for every player. The game, for as good as it is, is broken.  If you're still willing to try this game, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend against that, you should DEFINITELY be sure to back up your saves whenever it is convienent for you (at least every time you exit the game). You can do this by going to the game directory on Steam and going to the 'savedata' folder. If you can remember to do that, and if you're patient, then you should not have any major problems with it.  Barring that, the game is also a pretty bad PC port with very limited graphics options right off the bat. Thankfully, at least for the graphical options, DPFix exists and allows you to change resolution, allows you to alter antialiasing, DOF, etc. It also allows you to change textures and models, allowing for the game to actually enjoy limited modding capability. Related to that, the controls are rather stiff outside a controller, but, for me personally, I could get used to them. If you're not a fan of them, I'd probably get a controller if you can. The controls, from what I have heard, are still not very good on controllers, but they're at least better.  However, if you can get past all of that, the game is a whole lot of good. Voiceovers, especially for a budget game such as this, are actually quite good, although the translation can be a bit stiff at times in the subtitles. The characters, too, are quite memorable, if not stereotypical (although that's pretty much intended). The main character, Agent Francis York Morgan, is actually fleshed out very well as a quirky and sometimes downright schizophrenic special agent for the FBI. Think of Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks except downright crazy sometimes. Dialog is really where the game shines, with very strange characters you can talk to. The game, even though its a horror game at its core, can be very funny with some of the things the characters do and say.  The minigames are actually quite a nice touch to the game. The game's spin on darts is actually kind of interesting, but a bit too easy sometimes if you understand the game. Fishing is a bit boring, but straightforward. Racing is a bit tedious sometimes because of the stiff controls but can still be kind of fun. There are a few other fun bits-and-bobs too, like drinking coffee, that do add to the immersion of the game.  The more horror-related parts of the game, including the shooting sections, can be quite disappointing at times, but other times they can actually be really suspenseful (most definitely including some of the times you encounter one of the antagonists of the game, although I won't spoil more than that). The shooting itself is quite stiff, but sometimes getting a headshot can feel quite rewarding. The enemies are not incredibly interesting or difficult, but can get you unexpectedly at points. However, I will concede that I am a bit biased on this as I have had trouble getting past the 9th chapter for the reasons listed above. You may want to check other reviews for views on this specifically.  The game is open world, although it is not entirely open world like Grand Theft Auto or Far Cry (e.g. you can't go in some of the forests and in specific places). The locations, too, are sometimes a bit vanilla at least as far as exteriors go (the lumbermill, for example, does not look very run down from the outside, especially the bunks and the streets). Exploration isn't a huge deal with this game, although it does exist. Driving also is very stiff and not incredibly exciting, but it gets the job done. A lot of the problems with driving, though, stem from the controls, as stated before.  Sidequests can be hit or miss, in my experience, depending on the quest. Some of them are either fetch quests that don't really have any interesting spin on them (e.g. [MINOR SPOILER] the sherriff's first quest [END MINOR SPOILER]) or really, not even that much of quests at all. However, there are some that do require some detective work and actually do add quite a lot to the game. Definitely worth playing through them, though, in my opinion.  To wrap this review up and summarize the main points:  [CON] The game is incredibly gamebreakingly buggy in some points, with memory leaks that can cause frequent crashing or gamebreaking must-restart-the-game crashes that require you to start again. No extra save slots which causes the latter type of glitches to require a hard restart if you do not manually restart your game.  [CON] Bad PC port with very few graphics options out of the box and poor, stiff controls.  [CON] Shooting, driving, and open-world mechanics aren't the best, although they have their redeeming qualities   [PRO] DPFix can fix graphical and control-related problems to a degrees, and allows for minor moddablity to the game.  [PRO] Very good plot with incredibly interesting characters. The voiceovers, for the most part, are pretty good too  [PRO] Can be very suspenseful at some points and actually cashes in fairly well on being a horror game  [PRO] Decent sidequests and minigames   All in all, for most people, I simply cannot recommend this game to most people in general because the game is very, very, very unstable and very prone to bad glitches and crashes. However, if you're willing to accept its flaws and can be sure to back up your saves incredibly often, then maybe Deadly Premonition is the game for you.

402	0	a	Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.  Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.  The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.  2/10, take your money else where.
2036	1	a	Inquisitor is an old-school RPG with a unique setting and gritty style. It was fun to play but its grindy and often needlessly confusing nature spoiled the immersion for me somewhat. I would not recommend this game to someone who wasn't already in love with classics like Baldur's Gate, NWN, etc., as it's a difficult game to get into initially, but if you still enjoy those top-down RPGS and are hungry for something new, Inquisitor may scratch that itch. If RPGs are a hit-or-miss thing for you or if old-school gameplay with all its muddiness is a turn-off, however, this game will probably not be your thing. 6.5/10

After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want?  Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!!      ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.

1535	1	a	The second chapter in the Penumbra series brings back more of the same psychological horror that was put on display so brilliantly in Penumbra Overture. Some of the mechanics were tweaked a little to make the story flow better but all in all the game is just a continuation of the first. That's not to detract at all from what is offered because Black Plague is just fantastic.  Like Overture, if you're at all a fan of horror then this is a game you shouldn't overlook. You'll be just as satisfied with this as the first.  As far as Requiem, which comes with Black Plague, I'll just say that it is Penumbra's Godfather III. Frictional isn't trying to do more of the same here, they are simply showing you how the Penumbra story ends. Don't misunderestimate this title.

2372	1	a	If you take the characters, setting, and 90% of the story of Twin Peaks and mix it with Silent Hill-style controls and gameplay, this would be the result. I had a friend who described it as 'Japan trying to make an American game', and he is absolutely right. The voice acting is wonderfully bad and rarely matches the animation (which is a trip in itself), the story is very convoluted, messy, and each NPC seems to have an entire detailed backstory (not necessarily a bad thing), the color pallet flips from blood-and-rust to pastel-everything, controls are clunky and tasks like shooting or driving become a chore, and this game holds the record for the most inappropriate use of 'Amazing Grace' in history.  If so much is wrong with it, why do I love this game so much? Deadly Premonition is an EXPERIENCE. Its shortcomings make it all the more charming. The poorly-timed voice acting results in random one-liners that should not be funny. The story, while almost too big for one game, is rather enjoyable and the character's timelines intersect in interesting ways. Plus, nothing beats charging headfirst through hospital hallway doors because it's quicker than opening them normally.  As much as I can try, Deadly Premonition is too much to describe in one review. You're either going to love it or hate it. There is no in-between.

2081	0	a	Great idea for an rpg game. Sadly it's poorly made. If you are looking for a rpg in a good, old baldur's gate style you will be disappointed. I can live with poor graphics but when i have to fight mostly with slow movement speed annoying magic system (most spells usually aren't working, if you hit someone once per every 5 tries you can consider yourself lucky). I was hoping for many quest requiring talking but most are rather combat oriented and fighting system isn't good in this game. What can i say more? It's a total failure and waste of money.

You take seconds to get moving from a stop where the other cars go right to full speed. Any oversteer puts you right into the opposite wall. There are times you are looking at the screen wondering how the hell you ended up the way you did. No matter what you buy you will never have an advantage. Save the money and save the stress.

The puzzle solutions are not quite as clear as they could be in some areas, you might end up on a bit of a search, and I am currently stuck at a stealth portion that is very frustrating. I will go back and beat it at some point though, I would recommend this to any of my friends who like this kind of humor and puzzles.

1331	1	a	Loved it, The beating heart of the Penumbra series. The pace of the game was quicker and darker. Some great twists and turns and the ability to fight back has been taken away since the first game. Better than Overture by far but the strong story makes both games playable. Only 2nd to Amnesia Dark Descent as a horror in my books. Requim is the series going all jar jar binks on itself and is more frustrating than scary but it game with black plague so whatever.

2670	0	a	This port is awful. The fps is the worst Fps I've ever seen in gaming. The settings are configured to the lowest they can possibly go (Thanks to a fan who made it possible to even configure the settings), yet I still get the same fps as if I changed nothing. Do not buy. It has been months since this game has released and they still have ignored it. If you really want to play this game, play it on xbox or ps3.
2700	0	a	This game is unplayable. I don't know what the actual game is like, maybe it's great, I'll never know, because the game crashes on launch. I can tolerate an awful PC port; that's what I did for Saints Row 2 and I loved that game (except for the port part, of course). What I can't tolerate is a PC 'port' that does not work at all. Shame on Rising Star for releasing a game that is literally unplayable.
1481	1	a	Just as good a scare as Amnesia: The Dark Descent
2255	1	a	Get some wine to go with this cheese. Quality video game. Its like Resident evil 4 had a bad relationship with Grand Theft Auto while also cheating on it with Dreamfall and somewhere someone had a kid that is this game and nobody knows who the father is.  Also fishing.  
90	1	a	Completely brilliant, if somewhat linear.  Once you get the hang of figuring out creative ways to kill people, and how to navigate the map, it becomes less tedious.  Who needs clean underwear if you've already got your toys?

1584	1	a	If you're looking for something different, look no further than the Penumbra series. In these games you are just a normal helpless dude trying to figure out the mystery behind what's going on in the story. Weaponless, you're forced to problemsolve puzzles and hide from your enemies. These games offer a very creepy atmosphere and a 3d interactive world. The ambient audio is what draws you in the most, so I recommend playing this in the dark with headphones or surround sound. The best one is Amnesia: Dark Descent. Give it a try if you're looking to take a break from shooters and use your brain.
2358	1	a	Wow.... This game is really REALLY AMAZING... I recommend it ! 100%!  -Please use the DPfix (lastest release) **Dont overdo with the graphical options or it will crash ALOT** -ALWAYS run it as Administrator!  It never crashed on me  10/10! I love it!

2936	0	a	Well, I've got to say that this game has a terrific intro where grandpa goes for a walk with his two grandkids through somewhere he knows isn't safe. He's right because dp.exe has stopped working. My 50 minutes of play reflects how much I enjoyed this game though for the money, I wouldn't have minded finding out what happens after they discover the cut up lady in the tree. I tried several claimed fixes including the PhysX upgrade through nVidia GeForce Experience panel (which is a later version than what was supplied with this game so prevents further attemps of the so-called 'repair' fix that didn't change the crash experience for me, anyway). Nothing seemed to help. It's not as though my system is so old or incompatible (ASUS i7 notebook with 8GB RAM &amp; GeForece 610M with 2GB RAM running Win7)

2787	0	a	Let me start by saying that I like this game, but I cant say enough how much you shouldnt buy it here. This port is broken. You are lucky if it works at all on your computer. For me, with my brand new gaming computer, this game crashes every seven muinets at the most, Making this game unplayable, as many of the save points can be as far as fifteen muinets apart.  Buy the 360 or PS3 version. Theyre still bugy, but at least they work.

I'd like real puzzles, not an I-spy type game. I don't know, I think it is more or less a good game, but I've got issues with it.

With the disappointing turn the Resident Evil franchise took with 6 and ORC (though saved by Revelations) I have been on the lookout for any 3P Survival Horror that is actually entertaining. While this is no RE4, it's a fantastic game along those same lines. If you're a fan of 3PSurvival Horror games such as Resident Evil 1-5/Revelations, you must try this one.

1656	1	a	One of the best horror games I've ever played.  The sense of foreboding, atmosphere and SPIDERS combine to create a game you don't want to play, but can't help doing so.  Some really memorable parts (the ending sent chills down my spine)  Really impressive, and a textbook example of what can be achieved on a tight budget.
1490	1	a	A game's version of a B-Movie. Graphics aren't that great, but the game style, the environment, and the underlying tones more than make up for it. Highly recommended, very very scary game.
2355	1	a	I usually like to go in depth with my 'reviews' but...I just...this game. If you like Twin Peaks and you like Resident Evil style gameplay, give this a try. It's deceptively good despite the incredibly low budget. Also get DPfix because the port is â¥â¥â¥â¥.

34	1	a	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie âThe omen.â The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.     As far as the story goes, Lucius, the devil's son, murders members of his household, making them look like accidents. The Devil approaches you once in awhile, to congratulate you, as well as provide useful abilities or to demand better sacrifices. Over time, the means to kill your target, become harder and more arbitrary. After killing most of the live-ins, you will progress to start killing family members, leading up to the final chapter.     The gameplay revolves around checking notes, listening to people, doing chores on occasion, and finding a way to kill your target. The player will always be in the same house, and never leave it, becoming boring over time. The house, overall, has a creepy feel to it, fitting properly into the story, however becoming dull rather quickly. The player will spend time in three main areas of the house, with a lot of unexplored areas.     The art style, although aged at the time of this review, is still present; dark, creepy and mysterious. The sound and music in Lucius come across perfectly, trying to add to the creepy atmosphere. The Voice Acting is well done, by most of the cast. Some characters are more convincing than others but no character really stands out as a âBad sounding characterâ.    The game can be confusing at times, with the ingame hints being extremely arbitrary. The game isn't overly linear, making the game a tad harder to progress, and may be frustrating. With hundreds of hints and walkthroughs online, makes completing the game very easy, however if you are the type of gamer that refuses to look things up online it may take a long while before you complete all the chapters. I Myself only looked online when it came to the final âBoss fightâ.    Lucius did a lot of things right:     The sound and voices in game is solid   The cutscenes are gruesome and fantastic   The achievements are rather easy, if you plan ahead   Lucius is an enjoyable character   Lucifer is the best sounding, and most interesting character   The kills are satisfying      Lucius does a few things wrong     Massive map with spread out objectives   Can be very glitchy   Can be boring if lost or confused   May be frustrating to some players    can be to easy or to hard depending on skill level     Overall, lucius is a good game, it has its bugs and problems but can be very enjoyable. I killed almost 10 hours alone just playing the story, and i still got over 70% of the achievements by accident. Is it worth the $10.99CAD pricetag? That depends on if you enjoy either hunting achievements or are a fan of the genre. Although different from âThe Omenâ it's still very similar and fans of the movie will most likely enjoy it. Pick it up on sale sometime and give it a play.  
1785	1	a	Pretty scary. That is, if you find spiders and zombie-dogs scary.

2930	0	a	This is the japanese indie love child of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. A pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lovechild, but still somewhat awesome and adorable none-the-less, provided that you can patch it up enough to get it to even run in the first place.    THIS GAME IS BOTH BRILLIANT AND HORRENDOUS  105 hours. A regular triple A game takes about 44 continuous hours to complete if you take your time with it. While you can certainly beat this game in less time without all the side-missions, this game drags on for 105 hours if you want to 100% it. ...and when you're done, you breathe a sigh of relief.  I'm done making excuses for this game. This game features invisible shrubberies, and levitating trees and fences. Cars sometimes fall off the map, straight through the street. The game also more or less requires you to wait several days for a certain side-mission to open up. (It has to be raining during three specific hours, three times, you have to have certain specific items at these times, that you better look up in a walkthrough beforehand, and if you don't want to smoke, that can mean waiting many, many hours IN REAL LIFE. That means leaving your computer and go do the dishes. I means going to the store to buy food in real life. Oh, but the game doesn't tell you, is that the days where the side mission is said to open up, isn't the days where it ACTUALLY opens up.)  Everything that can be broken in this game, is broken. People say that it's just a 'bad port'. No, this is the ULTIMATE bad port. This is a nearly playable port! This is the circus freaks of bad ports, of a game that was a circus freak to begin with!    HOW TO GET IT TO RUN  In order to get this game to even get past the loader setup without crashing, you need to 'repair' its PhysX file. (See description in the Steam forums.)  Then, in order to improve the graphics with custom resolutions and antialiasing, you should probably want to install the DPfix fan fix. ...but you need to edit the fix ini file to a certain resolution. (Also, if you set the details to 'Ultra' in that file, the graphics will crash.)  Now you can get the intro to play, so that the game doesn't crash on start-up. There's still the issue with random crashes in-game, as well as the issue with the car sound.  In order to fix the sound, you will need to set your 7.1 or 5.1 surround headphones back to 2.0 stereo headphones in the headphone's own settings.  As for the random crashes, I have been able to establish two causes. First of all, the game was a memory leak that will slowly but surely eat up RAM until it crashes. When this occurs depends on how much free RAM you have.  Second of all, you need to set the game file (DP.exe) to run in a Windows 98 compatibility mode. You will be able to play the game up to Chapter 6 without doing so, with only occationally buggy inventory menus as an ecceft,, but at that chapter the game will finally crash consistently.  If you experience further problems, there are talks about further fixes that you can do, such as getting the game to recognize higher memory adresses by downloading a third-party tool.  However, this will NOT fix all the crashes. Try rebooting your computer if the game starts crashing too much. Nobody knows why this is required. It could be that the game would require continuous unfragmented areas of memory in RAM.

1609	1	a	This is the game that changed the horror genre once and forever. It became the point of no return. This is indie low-budget game that influenced the industry up to AAA blockbusters. Outlast, Daylight, Alien Isolation, all these run-and-hide horror type games grew up from Penumbra and tried to evolve its mechanics in some way or another with no doubt. Nevertheless this game started it all, started so called new golden age of horror games.

2326	1	a	Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.  This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.  You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?  Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.  Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain  weirdness  of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.  If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.  The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.

1111	1	a	It's a decent game, it's not the best of it's genre but it's a good when u just want some mindnumbing zombie crushing action, its fun to mow down a huge horde of zombies or destroy stuff with the bulldozer, missions get repeatitive tho and their isnt much depth to it other than a really basic upgrade system. but overall its a decent game, worth getting on sale
1797	1	a	Good game, first in the episodes. Don't know why they just have them numbered instead.
252	0	a	At first glance, this seems like a sandbox game where you use your inhuman powers to creatively kill innocent people in a variety of ways. In actuality it's simply an un-optimized puzzle game which rewards your frustrated attempts to lift an object across the room for more than 3 seconds with another unsatisfying useless power in the next chapter. The game itself had so much potential but the improper coding and limits of what you can and can't do with your powers was highly annoying. Think you're going to make awesome use of your mind-control powers to have a little fun with your victim before the big kill? Think again, you can only do anything useful with your mind-control if it relates directly to the step in the puzzle you're trying to complete right now. Think that piano is going to stay in it's proper room and on the floor? Expect to see it flying through the hall ways like a drunken pilot! Even chores will sometimes not complete once you've done all the steps required, forcing you to restart from the last save point.  I can't believe this game even made it to a sequel with how many problems the current game has but I'm glad it did. Maybe on the next one they'll have all the bugs worked out and actually make this a fun game somehow. Until then I wouldn't spend $10 on this game, let alone $20. Time to wait for Lucius 2 to come on sale and see if they actually did it right this time.  1/5 Not a very enjoyable game.

2291	1	a	Great game, great story not so action packed gameplay but really nice overall if you like mistery. I liked it very much 
1613	1	a	Ah, Frictional Games' first-ever. It's definitely a great horror game for beginning horror lovers. Its atmosphere is dark and menacing, and in general it functions well enough to be both a game and a trip through Hell. It's not too hard, and it's too traumatizing, either. It's a good medium for fun and scares alike. However, this is Frictional Games' weakest game, too. There is only one thing that truly spoils the horror and gameplay in this beauty, and if you don't know this, then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, if you want to enjoy the game without spoiling the feel, don't read the following. This is only a gameplay issue which makes the game trivial if you know it. Again, if you do not know this game and have the slightest idea of playing it, you should not read the following:   The main enemy of the game, the undead dogs, aren't truly a threat at all. In all other of Frictional Games' games, monsters cannot be hurt and you are forced to avoid them. However, in this game, the only two monsters -- dogs and spiders -- can be killed. The spiders you are meant to kill; however, you are obviously meant to be stealthy and undetected by the dogs, but the problem is that you can kill them far too easily by simply stun-locking them with melee strikes of a pickaxe or hammer (which, somehow, do the same damage). In addition, they have bad hit detection, and you can sometimes kill them while standing on something just barely above their reach -- even a wall railing you can jump on. When you know how weak the actual horrors are in this game -- even on hard mode -- then all the stealth and threatening atmosphere that was intended for these dogs just becomes a face-mashing party.    In my first run through this game, I didn't know the above and I enjoyed the game well. However, after playing it a second time with the above knowledge, I got bored before even getting a quarter into the game because it felt no longer like a horror game.  In short: It's a great horror game for beginners if you don't advantage yourself with knowing a few of the game's functional faults. However, if you're already too familiar with such, then you should probably start with another of Frictional Games' better works.

1045	1	a	Zombie Driver HD is a very simple but yet brilliant game and well worth the cost, it is basically a small 2d zombie driver/killing game in which the aim is to save innocent people from the zombies and get them back into safety and kill many, many zombies overall i would give this game a 7.5/10 for its brilliant planning and gameplay.
125	1	a	This game is different from what I usually play. It does feel a bit glitchy using the telekenisis ability, especially if you haven;t played for a while, but that might be just me.   It's fun for the morbid part of all of us.
1109	1	a	Brilliantly addicting game, not much thought need to go into driving over zombies. For a couple of quid you can play for hours also which is pretty good compared to most new games.

3008	0	a	It is a great game, the story is great, the characters and the soundtrack are amazing. But it doesn't work properly. I spent two hours fix the dp.exe doesn't work problem. It crashes multiple times I have to repeat tedious activities like driving, the controls are complicated (press space, focus with right mouse than shoot with left) I always f**** up the quicktime events, because there too fast. no I am stuck at the diner and nobody can help me to fix my problem.  if you are in the same situation like me and you have no playstation or xbox...watch a Let's play or ask a friend if you can play it on her/his console but don't buy this game, really it will spare you a lot of frustration.
1745	0	a	The torrent version works better than this, it keeps crashing after this one bit and everytime I exit the game it changes my monitor brightness to the max, It's like a constant flashbang had to turn my pc off and on just to fix it.
2646	0	a	I love this game so much and I yearn for it to fall into my tender loving arms so I can cradle it like a little baby and give it my total loving care.   But it is not to be...  And you know why that is? Because of the absolutely preposterous port which makes the game practically unplayable - yes I know, you've heard it all before.   I started playing this game a few months back, and couldn't get past a particular cut scene (I'm sure some of the less fortuitous people such as myself know what I'm talking about); and 7 months later - after waiting for a patch of some description - it's still broken.   Yes, I do use DP.Fix, but to no avail.  This is an example of how a game should NOT be on a computer, which is darn shame because I really love Deadly Premonition, and on any other system I'd give it an instant thumbs up.   Consoles, I'm afraid you win this point.  [If I manage to fix my game-breaking bug then I'll be sure to update the review - doubt it'd change my recommendation though]

1512	1	a	This is for those who like the concept of horror games, but dont like being scared. This game has a great atmosphere and puzzles, but its not what id consider scary. But i enjoyed it, although it can be rather boring at times. But hell, 9.99 for all three (Penumbra: Overture, Black Plague, and Requiem), its worth it.

1367	1	a	Penumbra Overture was pretty good. There were some very awkward parts, like the fighting. But all in all pretty good. These days though the graphics are looking dated now.  Penumbra Overture was better since you couldn't fight anymore. It made the game more creepy, though again, graphics are a bit dated. The Penumbra story lines are pretty interesting though not necessarily the most interesting I've played through.  Penumbra Requiem was terrible. It's a completely different game that involves puzzles that's honestly just not very fun. If this pack was just Penumbra Requiem, I would NOT recommend it. But the first two are a 'Yes' recommendation so the pack will be a 'Yes'

2048	1	a	The worst parts: grind and not figuring out some of the more obvious things like hidden floor tiles you could easily see, and items you need to destroy in order to advance in quests.  The best parts: lore, the feeling in game, not pampering &amp; spoiling the players like Diablo series, you can actually find yourself spending some time thinking maybe, a lot of stuff to do, not short game if you dont want to rush through and skip lore.  It's not polished like Diablo series and controls are a bit more off, but it's good and easy to get used to even in demanding standards (I just didn't get used to GTA V autoaim nor manual aim for example but this was no problem).  One issue is memory leak, you need to restrart the game every 1-4 hours, but that's kinda good so you wont find yourself zombified IRL lol

2257	1	a	This game is almost unplayaple. Not because the story and the game sucks but because of the crashes. This is a awful PC-port of a game. I would not recommend buying this with it's current price of 25 euros. If the price was like.. 5 to 3 euros you should buy this even tought you don't have a fat chance of playing this game trough without spending most of the time fixing crashes and bugs.  Still the story and Twin Peaks feels give this game my recommendation. Just don't buy this game with the absurd price of 25 euros.  EDIT: After 4 hours of fixing this game installing patches etc. it's semi-playable but remember to save freaking often because it will crash even tough you have done all the steps to prevent that from happening.

1531	1	a	Very good horror adventure game, predecessor to their newest title Amnesia. I finished all 3 games in Penumbra series, and they are really thrilling and compelling. Best played at night in the dark, quite room!
1486	1	a	Some the puzzles and graphics are stupid, but by and large, this game nails down the progression frictional was going for in Amnesia:The Dark Descent, You can easily see the concepts that they were shooting for in making an extremely tense and terrifying experience, and it's terrifying. This game I can say is easily as scary as Amnesia, While the engine is pretty dated and the puzzles sometimes make literally no sense, the whole game can be greatly appreciated for the Horror it conveys. The tension is constant due to a limited understanding of the plot and creatures, and they really drive the HP Lovecraft horror into the mystery of the story, and even after the final curtain, you will ask yourself what the hell even happened. A great 7/10.

1884	1	a	The first game by indie developer Frictional games will leave your head hurting and your heart racing. A suave and compelling story compliment the brain teasing puzzles and terrifying atmosphere. A must have for any fan of the survival horror genre.
1455	1	a	Truth be told, this game is no where near as scary as Frictional Games' Amnesia. I think this is a strength though because I was actually able to complete the game without chickening out like I did during the Dark Descent. The story is relatively well written too.

751	1	a	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.

The 'boss fights' are the most type of oss fights I have ever played on a game. I managed to complete the game hoping for a good ending but it was cheesy and lacked any real depth.

2401	1	a	I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.   Here's a list as to why it sucks: Crashes often Plot is barely explained Plot holes Graphics are terrible Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme] Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently) Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?) Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often) Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use) AI is weird Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...) Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways) There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))  And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.   Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!

2204	1	a	Watching True Detective reminded me of this game. Which is good I guess, considering the show is pretty awesome. And from what I played thus far, so is the game. But I have yet to finish it, because the game just keeps on crashing. It is truly a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port, so if you are not in the mood to try out different fixes and work-around â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I don't recommend this game at all. Although if you can tolerate its quirkiness and don't mind the frequent crashes (thankfully it auto-saves often enough) it can be a really great game. I definitely plan on continuing it once it gets magically fixed by the video game fairies. Deadly Premonition is unlike anything out there. It's a wild ride. A wild ride indeed, Marty.

Is Zombie Driver Hd on sale? You should definitely buy this game.  This game offers hours of gameplay and satisfying content.
48	1	a	So I acutally bought this game last year, perhaps around October (2015) time, and I haven't played it until now.  This game is one that I would recommend for numerous reasons.   Upon initially loading up the game and killing my first person, I was completely hooked. I'm not too sure what that says about me, but who cares. I think perhaps it was the fact that I've never played a game where I am basically the spawn of Satan. Also, post purchase of the game, I was surprised that the game had an actual, well-written (arguable) storyline. It was nice to have to follow a pattern of scripted killings, instead of just walking round murdering at will (not the mechanic xD). I especially enjoyed the fact that every death was different and unpredictable. This was very pleasing.  Another reason why I enjoyed this game was because each character was different and had a different purpose. There was one particular character I had a problem 'ending'...and that was Alastair. I thougt he was cool, and he reminded me of Alfred Pennyworth, who's a pretty awesome Batman character.   However, having said that I would recommend this game THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD IMPROVE.  First of all, I began to feel that the constant murdering towards the end (even though I did enjoy the story and each character's death scene) was getting a little teadous. It just felt like it was going on-and-on, chapter-after-chapter. Although it was still fun. Second of all, I had a real big problem with some of the achievements. As of writing this, I have all but three achievements left to collect:     Playing for 20 hours.     Playing for 40 hours.     Riding on the bike things for 10 miles.    At the moment, the 10 mile one isn't a problem because I know I'm just going to have to ride around, however, the other two are completely ridiculous.  First of all, I don't see how there is 40 hours of content here, and after looking at the global achievement statistics, only 2.9% (or something like that) of people have got this achievement. This is a game that I will come back to and replay in the future but, there is no way that I am getting a 40 hour achievement that is worthwhile to get. So I will be missing these achievements out. Having to do this really annoys me, because I am (and sorry for the colloquialism here) an 'achievement â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'. I really like achievement hunting.   Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I've never really given a proper review before on here, but I felt like I should for this game.  Thanks for reading and please be respectful of my opinions, as I would be to yours.  Thanks again.  
238	1	a	Awesome and creative game with an eery soundtrack. There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.  Unfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.

1411	0	a	You may like the Penumbra trilogy if you loved Amnesia. Same Lovecraftian undercurrents, but everything feels much less polished: awkward combat, bad puzzles, etc. Overture and Requiem are still worth it. Black Plague however is just painful; it's a series of uninspired puzzles without any actual story, and it doesn't work.
2843	0	a	I'm sorry that I recommended this game about a year ago when it was on sale on the humble bundle store for about $1. I thought they had put more effort into the port than they did. But as it turns out it's just yet another bad port. Bad in a way that only japanese studios that regret their decision to take console exclusive deals can do.  Got it running by breaking physx for other games on my system that link to it. Only to see that the resolution is hardcoded to 1280x720. I was aware of dpfix. But even though it evidently loads the symbols just fine (as indicated by not segfaulting) it just sits forever eating my cycles. Likely caused by a recent update.  There are people on the forums trying to defend these incompetent developers. They shouldn't. They're only further ruining Steam. Having a quirky game that likes to have a bit of fun despite itself is one thing (and is why I came to want it in the first place) but having a buggy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ maintained by incompetent developers is another, and believe me they are incompetent.  The fact that libs that override d3d9 symbols exist in the first place is evidence of that. As the complexity of the problem goes up so does the complexity of the override libs. But ones like these -though written by undoubtedly competent people- merely provide basic features that the game should have in the first place. Like adding a second step that adjusts resolution based on values given in a config file.    Edit:  I was able to fix the issue causing the game to just sit there eating cycles and have it running in my native resolution. I'm sure the game will be as fun as I figured it would be but my review above still applies. The short of it is: Don't bother if you're not comfortable having a game that isn't playable right after download from steam. It's going to take a bit to both get it to actually run without segfaulting and get it aesthetically reasonable (meaning native resolution of your monitor and properly saturated environments).  Had I known this port was as bad as it was I wouldn't have encouraged developers who do crap like this by giving them money. I suggest you don't make the same mistake.

2092	0	a	I have a phrase: It's called 'Diablo Clone'.  Diablo was groundbreaking. It was difficult enough to keep you interested, had good, simple mechanics, and story enough to hold onto you. Sure, Diablo was to grind as Congress is to gridlocked, but story and loot were enough to pull you in and keep you playing. Who WOULDN'T like that?  Well, like any game type, it has good clones and bad ones. Good clone? Path of Exile. Bad clone? Inquisitor.  Gameplay and Story are made to serve each other, insofar as if one fails, so does the other. Bioware titles carried the weight of their stories with solid mechanics. In opposition is Inquisitor. I hear the writing of this story is great, and that it is second to none. However, balance is in desperate need in this game. The story has the makings of a great power-hungry-plot-twisty-not-going-to-be-a-happy-ending vibe to it (much like Diablo), but considering the starting enemies (bats) will kick your â¥â¥â¥ if you are not careful (and that's level 1), you are going to have a long road to hoe, and it's not going to be pleasant or, you know, fun. Diablo and Path of Exile don't throw you into the snake pit, they ease you in. Because unless you have a better strategy than 'Stand, slash, win, health potion, repeat', you're going to lose. A lot.   Maybe I haven't tricked out my character properly with the right stats, or I am currently going about strategy wrong, but when it comes to grind heavy, stat based games like Inquisitor, I shouldn't be trying to find out ways to alter player stats. Difficulty is fine (hell, Dark Souls and Mount &amp; Blade are some of my favorite games), but if done wrong, especially in a grind heavy game like Inquisitor, it's a game killer. Which is a shame, because now I won't experience what I have heard is a great story.

1437	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague might not have the best graphics, but it makes up for it with gameplay. Penumbra was developed by the same company that made Amnesia, and has many of the same aspects. It has enemies that roam around randomly, and puzzles that make you think WHILE being hunted down.   In my opinion, the story for Black Plague is much more interesting than Amnesia's. The characters have amazing personalities (Clarence), and you will grow attached to them throughout the game. Some puzzles are unnecessarily hard, but I am proud to say I beat it without using a walkthrough.  If you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, or Outlast, Definitely try this game.

1492	1	a	Very good game, much scarier than the original penumbra overture. I particularily liked the voice in my head, gave me something to look forward too. Enemies were a lot smarter and scarier although just as easy to avoid for the most part. The way the story played out was average. The end felt a little rushed but continued into the expansion pack requiem so I can't complain. The way items and puzzles were laid out was pretty bad, mostly because you get nearly no hints and have to deal with it yourself. I'd play this game again after a while, still have to beat requiem which I'm looking forward too. The game also felt quite a bit shorter than the original, with the exception of providing a more detailed story line.  Storyline 5/5 Characters 3/5 Effects 3/5

2271	1	a	Yeah, this game has its share of problems. The PC port of the game is terrible, and I am glad I got to experience it on a console. It was only recently I decided to revisit the game on PC, and the amount of times it just crashes for no reason at all is just silly.  If you are a person that require decent graphics (you know, the visuals), then this game is not for you. In fact, the graphics are so poor for its time in this game that it looks more like it was released during the PS2 era, when it was in fact released during the PS3 era (I am using the PlayStation as a reference because it was on a PS3 I played this game the first time). They aren't particularly good, but if you can overlook this, then you're in for the next challenge.  The controls. Geezus. Who sat down with the driving part of this game and thought 'Yeah, yeah this is perfectly acceptable.'? Regardless of what platform you are playing this game on, the driving itself is way to challenging for its own good. Sure, it makes you laugh a bit the first time your car is suddenly on two wheels and spinning out of the road and into a ditch, or a house, or another car. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentyeth? Not so funny anymore. And the combat. Ugh. It can't require that much more polishing to actually get the combat controls improved, can it? Because the most challenging part about combat are the controls, rather than the enemies. And that's not the reason you want your game to be a challenge.  But, this aside, I still enjoy this game, and I still recommend this game. Why? Because of the story and the atmosphere. It is so rare to see a game where each and every character you meet feels well thought out and unique. Where the story of the game may not be super original, yet still manages to suck you in and surprise you with its many plot twists. It was my second playthrough recently (though it had been a few years), and I was still surprised by a few of the plot twists. And that's something special. This game is special. And if you like a good story, then this is something you cannot afford to miss.  Edit November 2016: Just nominated this game for The âTest of Timeâ Award. It truly is a gem that should be experienced.

I expected some â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up zombie thing not a dumb dog that is just pain in the â¥â¥â¥.I have also experienced some bugs in the game which were pretty annoying(objects going invisible etc.) but I believe the reason is I am using a Mac(a.k.a. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ computer ) .I hope the second game is much better than this one.I will update the review when I finish the game.

1583	1	a	To anyone who has not yet played them, Frictional Games' Penumbra trilogy is a very appealing mix of thrilling horror and engaging storytelling that will capture you within its world and probably leave you pretty unsettled at various points of the games. By now, most folks have probably gotten desensitized from the large catalog of horror games that have been released since then, and any initial shock the games had (Overture and Black Plague) at their release has probably diminished due to the fact that the bar has been raised for how macabre and grotesque these horror games are being designed. So, to any survival horror fan wanting to give these games a go at this point in time, remember to look at these games as historical foundations for how survival horror games now are. Redefinitions of the genre, in my opinion.

2706	0	a	The Game itself (Gameplay / Story): Wonderfull if you grew up with Twin Peaks.  The technical aspect of the game: Horrible.  ItÂ´s a great game if it runs on your system. (Luck dependend) ItÂ´s a horrible piece of work if it doesnÂ´t.  Chances are this game wonÂ´t run on your system no matter what you do.  This game maybe takes about 8 - 10 hours to playthrough.  Steam sais i needed 24,3h. ThatÂ´s because i had to play sections over and over again because the constant crashes und freezes. I even need to copy the save file between 3 PCÂ´s !!! with different OS and config.  With Win 8.1 donÂ´t even get started, there you will have all the problems that are available. With Win 7 you will have most of the problems.  Like i said, i finished this game on 3 PcÂ´s (Win 8.1, Win 7 64x, Win 7 32x)  
2915	0	a	Screw that game.
626	0	a	Honestly played it for 30 minutes before stopping for good. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to get it. The trailer was really well done and sold me. Unfortunately, the graphics are poor, the acting is poor, the script is poor, the programming is poor, even the layout of the mansion is poor. It didn't take long for this game to convince me that I was not going to enjoy muddling through it.
235	1	a	Don't look at your map since it seems it will always tell you what you need to do next. There is no option to turn this off. Note that I have only played the game for about an hour so I don't know if this goes away. I just stopped looking at the map altogether.  With that said, if you're looking for a game where you play a character like Damien from the movie The Omen, this nails it.
1180	1	a	Pretty fun little game, its the kind of game you should play in small sessions and not very long ones or it will get possibly repetitive. Its the kind of game you would start up to have some good old fashioned casual zombie killing action loaded with a bunch of fun. Perfect for when you want to vent some frustration/stress. I got it on sale, got the whole package for less than 4 euros, pretty much worth it if you ask me!
572	1	a	It was a nice game.  The story didn't take too long and it was somehow a creative feeling killing all these people. I can absolutely recommend it when you wanna have a shot but nice experience! Some passages were a little bit annoying though.
5176	1	a	   Early Access Review
2835	0	a	Thumbs down mainly because horrendous port.  As a port, this is possibly one of the worst port ever in the video game history. Anyone even remotely, vaguely aware of Deadly Premonition should already know by now just how bad the PC port is. Even setting aside the lack of HD graphics, the game runs. like. â¥â¥â¥â¥. It actually suffers from memory leak issue. My personal best time before Crash To Desktop is slightly under 2 hours. On the norm, anything just a bit over 1 hour the game will commit ritual suicide on the dot. Anything related to opening the map screen seems to really exacerbate the leak issue for me, this leads to some very annoying side quests run. Replaying a chapter for side quests sometimes will bug your game out. This is serious game breaking potential bug too. You damn well better make a save backup before you do anything foolish.  As a game, Deadly Premonitions starts out absolutely brilliant. Then it took a wrong turn and ends up on a railroad heading to DBZ town.   The Gold: Really quirky casts WTF is wrong with this music?! The amazing attention to details York's amazing knowledge of old movies   I can certainly see why this game became a cult classic. It has all the lovable and lovably hate-able characters. The flattest character in this game is   the dog  , but I bet even he has ulterior motives deep beneath that   fur coat  . (Actually confirmed by SWERY) The soundtracks have this dissonance to it that it'll play some cheery tunes at some very inopportune times. Too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen toward the end of the game where there are moments where I become very irritated. (More on end game later) A big notable mention is the attention to details of character interactions. Generally, character dialogues of when what where occurred won't be remembered. So in other games there'd be occasions of you've already met this character, even done a few side quests for said person, but the game will still treat you as you've never met him/her unless plot dictates so. Deadly Premonitions is the exact opposite of such syndrome. In fact, it has a near compulsion of keeping track of who/what/when/where. You can physically see NPCs moving from one location to another as they go about their daily business. If the weather changes, their behavior patterns will change as well. That's some impressive bits of details for none big budget games. You'll actually miss some impressive and hilarious nuggets of gold this way if you don't have a habit of exploring and wandering about. I do so enjoy York's car ramblings about old movies as well.   The Unnecessary: Your piddly map screen that can't even fix its orientation Clunky combat and driving controls End game railroading DBZ boss battles and worse dialogue   Time for the really â¥â¥â¥â¥ parts. The controls for this game can be abysmal. The combat is laughably bad. This is PlayStation Resident Evil 1 clunky. The quick turn animation doesn't quick turn my camera as well. I still need to slowly adjust it with my mouse or pad. Aiming is clunky, but at least the game is generously forgiving (until end game bosses.) Driving a car around town proves to be a challenge. This is where the attention to detail bit on the town will drive some people nuts. Greenvile is treated as an actual town, not a crappy rundown composed of just 2 blocks of random shops, houses, and 1 Inn. No. Actual people with their own homes, places where they gather, the works. On paper this sounds like a wonderful thing. HOWEVER, this becomes an issue when your map is forever stuck showing just one tiny bit of the town. The place is HUGE, hardly helpful when you need to get to the far side of the map. The map is NOT fixated to North/South/West/East/Whoville either, it is related to where you are positioned. Thought you got the map figured out? Oops, you moved so it changed orientation. This is Google Map without the actual GPS telling you where to go. There's just a big fat arrow pointing vaguely on the horizon on where your next plot point is. You can argue they are trying to encourage exploration, but being stuck in a game with memory leak problem... Oh, your car also has this weird tendency to do some weird ragdoll physics; hit some invisible or tiny pixels in the road and spin off the road. Car controls itself is pretty damn clunky as well. If you are doing the sidequests that involve racing, this can get frustrating really quick especially in the downtown area.  This is a sad mention, but I actually have an issue with the plot execution. Not because it is ridiculous, but how it really spirals downwards near the end from poor execution. From the outset, the game encourages you to freely explore the town and do your own thing. You can jump on and off the investigation train at any time, no time limit is ever imposed on you. Shoot the breeze with the local crazies. Wow, there's a crazy killer on the loose. So what, I still have time to go fishing, sort boxes at your local store, eat a delicious sandwich made of sin at the diner. Hahaha. So what happens near the end? This is when the game takes itself too damn serious. You are being bound, gagged, and railroaded to the final boss bum rush mode. You want to stop and buy supplies? No dice. You want to redo some old dungeons for cards and infinite weapons? Too bad, so sad. My problem with this game is they've put the Point of No Return a few chapters too damn early. I'm in a game with big memory leak issue. I'm constantly worried about the game choking on itself in the middle of a dungeon, or the last bouts of bosses. Oh ye gods, the bosses. The freaking bosses also have the RPG syndrome of multiple forms, with a side order of crap dialogues. 'Bwahahaha, you thought you killed me? BEHOLD! My second and mightier form!' You kill the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. ':cough hack: You... You thought you beat me?! Foolish mortal! Now I'll reveal you my true self!!!1111' â¥â¥â¥â¥. Me. This is padding. You are actually padding the damn game. Any boss battle with more than 2 forms is considered obnoxious. Your boss dialogue is contrived, half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, simply moustache twirling level evil. Where's that button for taunting or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ slapping my opponent!? Have you dealt with the final boss in Ace Attorney Investigator? Yeah, that really dragged on didn't it? Remember: time crunch, memory leak, game explode? Ugh. I've actually had to skip quite a few vital plot scenes before the boss battles for fear of the game crashing. (and I couldnât stomach the big badâs writing anymore) It turned out to be a smart move, because it DID drag on. Why why WHY? You had such a great start...     Actual plot spoiler tag, do not click unless you know what you are doing.   You know that bit where you become the Raincoat Killer? Looking back, I probably would've enjoyed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of that if I wasn't in such a hurry to get to the next save point before the game crash.

134	0	a	At least as bad as some of the worst games I've played, Lucius is a cheaply-made game at not such a cheap price ($19.99, at least $25 over what it's worth, meaning the developers should pay you to play the game).  Everything from its looks, to its cutscene and gameplay style might make you think this is from another era (and not a good game from that era), yet it's a 2012 game, only one year old at the time of writing.  The game is incredibly frustrating, with no pointer as to what to do, yet it wants you to perform in a way that is 100% how the developers intend you to play a mission.  In fact, there is a hint as to what to do, the mission title, but even if you get it, which if you're like me you will usually, you don't get how to do it because the game just won't let you use your powers in a meaningful way unless you're at the right place, at the right time, under the right circumstances.  Lucius is a very poorly designed game.

1663	1	a	Ever since I played Amnesia for the first time I've become a sucker for good horror games. Don't confuse that with games like Resident Evil where you can just shoot everything and move forward I never felt that was scary. If you can fight everything that shows up than its not really that scary. Amnesia is the first game that I played where you are completely helpless. Hide or die is the motto.  Then I found Penumbra super cheap and got all 3 episodes for little over a dollar. I been meaning to play it for ages but now I actually am. Overture is the first episode in the series and while its not as scary as Amnesia yet its still pretty intense. Yes you can fight but combat is so awkward and clunky you want to avoid more than fight. Besides most of the monsters are unkillable so fighting them is just to stun so you can escape. The story is confusing and disturbing. This ended on quite the cliffhanger and I'm looking forward to continuing the series in Black Plague.

108	1	a	Quite a nIce game. It's about the everyday life of a 7-y.o. boy, with stuff like household chores, finding different stuff for people and ridind your small tricycle in the hallways. I recommend buying it, it's pretty relaxing and a lot of fun.
1648	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the first part of Penumbra series, being called Episode One as back then it was planned to make Penumbra a trilogy. Ended up being a duology plus expansion pack. It's a First Person adventure game with horror elements and combat and it was made by Frictional Games in 2007. Yep, same people who made Amnesia, you should feel this one being similar somewhat.  Actually, one should note about Penumbra tech demo, which Frictional Games people created to show off their engine. It had similar plot intro as in Penumbra, hero wanting to find answer about his dad in a mine set somewhere in snowy lands, and then you wander around in dark industrial corridors. And then meet a somewhat cute monster who is like a mix of slug and bat. And then solve puzzle. And then in the end get lamely knocked out in a small room covered in blood. And well, it actually excited people enough for developers to consider of making a commerical game based on tech demo. After all, it used physics engine where you was the one dragging things around and being able to manipulate with more detail. Like, you grab a side of valve and then have to circle it around accordingly. And then horror games in First Person weren't widespread back then either. Oh, and people being spooked by the cut enemy.  As for how scary this is: Not much. It's not completely realistical and tame, but it doesn't try to screw with your brain with paranormal scares. It just sets of a really dark spooky atmosphere, but once you realize that whatever will be trying to get in your face is just a normal enemy, then well, you will relax. It still can scare you though, in the beggining. I think that game has enough for it going so even those who don't like being scared will feel it's worth playing.  And it does feel like a not-high budged episode one of series. It doesn't have much going for it. It's actually repetetive in how it's maze after maze, password after password, note after note. But at least it's still nice to explore and still has lenght of a fine game. Even if it ends on clear cliffhanger. And there are no models for any other human. Even though you will 'meet' Red. And may like that chap. Who is about as likeable as companion cube. And yea graphics are fine for that time. Does good work with shadows and lighting. Can be muddy. It actually has more than one light source. With one being infinite. Not to mentioning that a lot of areas are well-lit anyway that you don't really have to use them.  Yes, it still makes use of that physics engine, which was pretty nice at the time. Though puzzle-solving part of a game feels so disconnect from whatever horror premise. And it's not used as much as one would hope. But hey, it still gives feels. You can feel how heavy the box is when you are dragging it and can't lift it off the ground. Other parts of puzzles makes you combine items like in your everyday adventure game.  It also has combat and monsters. Or more exactly - dogs. They usually patrol the main parts of mazes and you find a few tools and items that are used on dogs. They are here to make you sneak and hide around corners of a maze, to make you afraid, with combat system that is clunky. But in short, it gets tedious really fast to go from one point to another point while hiding from them, so I would just murder them. It's actually extremely easy, you can exploit them. Or you can whack them directly and time it so they are pretty much stunlocked. So another flop.  But you know, back at 2007 it still was an unique First Person experience. And still is a good fun, even if weaker than the adventure horror games nowdays. Actually, I don't like being scared much, so I enjoyed just having a nice dark atmosphere, exploring and puzzling. Not to mentioning fine music and ambience. And fine pacing at times.

1978	1	a	 Penumbra: Overture , as the title would suggest, is the opening chapter of the first-person horror epic Penumbra, from the creators of Amnesia and SOMA.  Originally released in 2007, P:O was one of the early standouts in psychological horror, and laid the foundation for many of the concepts and mechanics that have come to characterize the genre, notably: a relatively weak, 'everyperson' protagonist who has no choice but to rely on running, hiding, and sneaking to avoid and bypass effectively invincible hostile creatures; consumable light sources that force the player to balance ability to see against likelihood of being seen, as well as exploration against safety; use of auditory and visual effects to communicate the emotional state of the player character; strong emphasis on immersive audio design; environmental puzzles that require the player to brave dangerous or disturbing situations to collect the necessary components and/or clues to solve them; and the application of the Lovecraftian principle that a nebulous suggestion, filled in by the player's imagination and dangled at the edge of awareness, carries much more potential for terror than something explicitly portrayed in graphic detail.  The story begins as the protagonist, Philip LaFresque, receives an unexpected letter from his presumed-dead father, urging him to destroy a set of cryptic documents. Upon investigating them instead, Philip applies his Library Use skill, discovers a reference to a mysterious location in Greenland, and, apparently armed with only a flashlight, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, and his wits, sets off to uncover the truth.   In terms of gameplay, the player interacts very directly with the environment - doors and drawers are manually pulled open and pushed shut, levers manually raised and lowered, wheels manually rotated. In addition to H.P. Lovecraft, the game draws heavy inspiration from Half-Life - in terms of physical interactions, fans of board smashing, crate stacking, and barrel arranging will find plenty to like.   There's even a crowbar engraved 'Freeman.'    P:O is enjoyable and complete by itself, but its ending segues directly into  Penumbra: Black Plague , and players who enjoy the overture should definitely continue. The game shows its age graphically, but the Penumbra series's strong writing and eldritch atmosphere make it a classic for fans of Lovecraft and stealth/survival horror.
2885	0	a	Literally the worst PC port I've ever played.
2042	1	a	I came in with fairly low expectations, but was pretty impressed. It is a bit of a diablo clone and the graphics might not be the most up to date. However, the graphics never detracted from the game for me and I found the story/writing quite well done.

2531	1	a	It's a weird game. Play it only if you have the patience to absorb the bugs and a bad port. Aiming weapons is really limited. Driving is atrocious. I have an issue with side quests available during a particular weather. That doesn't make sense. But availability of side quests at certain timings in a day is realistic. But the game has a good story, keeps you guessing on who the killer is. All the characters are well written and there are many of them. Huge attention to detail.
816	0	a	If you like puzzle games with smooth controls and a refined stealth system, then this is definitely  NOT  the game for you.   I can't think of a kind word to say about Lucien, either the titular character or his 'adventure'. The entire thing is on rails, to the point of explaining what happens before you do it â no suspense, not even the illusion of choice â and constantly swapping between flagrant handholding and dropping you into a room with no idea what to do except flail at the glitchy and painfully-limited interface until something happens.   Then there's the horrible model animation; characters's limbs and held objects routinely clip through things, and it doesn't seem like they bothered at all to syncronise movements to interactions.. Despite there being very few interactions to be displayed. The ONLY positive is the well-detailled house itself, but you'd better get used to it because you never go anywhere  else .  All in all, Lucius takes the worst from point-and-click games and combines it with the worst from 3d RPGs.. and I haven't even mentioned the part where the  six year old child  you play takes photographs of people having sex, or visits a room full of nothing but softcore pornography and sex toys. One has to wonder whether this game was made for anything other than shock value.
2738	0	a	Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus.   So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.  Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.

Have to warn you tho there are a few minor glitches if youre running a old comp. And its best not to go for head on combat in this game. Run, hide, use your wits in order to survive this horror.

From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
2887	0	a	Unfortunatly a subpar port, if a ptch is realised then consider picking it up.
2183	1	a	This is one of the greatest games that I have ever played. It will definitely stay within my top 5 games for a long, long time. I plan to at least do a second and third playthrough, if not more.  Before buying, there are 2 things that you must know:  1. This is the very definition of a cult classic. If you find yourself only enjoying huge budget AAA games and never really straying into anything else, then perhaps this is not the game for you. This game must be played with an open mind, as it is very unique. Also, it is worth mentioning that the game really doesn't pick up until an hour or so into it.   2. The PC port is not very good. I would only recommend buying it if you have intermediate computer skills, as you are going to have to edit a few files as well as apply a user-made patch, DPfix.   The story: Simply put, it's amazing. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent sent to the small town of Greenvale to investigate the murder of a local teenager. The story quickly picks up from here and sucks you in. I wish that I could be less vague about the story, but I risk ruining the game's 20+ hour run. This is the kind of story that keeps you wanting to play the game to see what happens next. It takes many sharp turns and streches across several different genres, including, but by far not limited to: horror, mystery, survival, comedy, and even some romance. I consider myself to be good at predicting storylines in games and movies, but even I could not predict hardly any of this game. It truly kept me interested until the very end. Speaking of the end, you may just shed a tear.   Characters: The characters in this game are incredibly varied and all have distinct personalities. I will certainly not ever forget any of them. The voice acting is great and really helps to bring the characters to life.   Gameplay: The driving is pretty awful but far from the worst I've ever played. The pause menu map only shows your immediate surroundings and cannot zoom out, rendering it useless. You'll have to pay close attention and learn the town if you want to get around. While this map issue was mildly annoying, it made the game a little more challenging. The rest of the gameplay is good, but nothing new or super polished. I would recommend using a controller, as the keyboard and mouse control for this game just feels clunky. The game is open world and each character has a routine that they do. This is important to remember, as they may not always be home for you to ask questions. There are some points in the game in which you must wait a certain amount of in-game time before moving on to the next portion of the story. This gives you time to explore all that there is to do in Greenvale, including a ton of side missions and collectible items.  Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is great, and very memorable. I love the acoustic guitar song that plays at the main menu and at various points in the game. Each track suits the level that it was designed for, and nothing seems out of place. The only complaint I have is that the music volume levels occasionally overpower dialogue in cutscenes.   Other thoughts: The game crashed to the desktop about a dozen times during my playthrough. The crashes all occured at set points in the game's story, so they are not random. There are some suggestions to remedy this with a quick search online though. I had luck passing these crashes by setting the game's launcher and .exe to Windows 98/ME mode and running as administrator. I am using an AMD gpu with the latest drivers (15.7.1 at time of writing) and Windows 7 64 bit.   Bottom line: If you don't mind the possibility of some technical issues and you are a fan of survival-horror/mystery games, by all means, buy this game.

The controls on your powers are dodgey at best and if you're stuck then look up a guide because some of the things this game expects you to do and figure out are crazy and flatout unreasonable at times.   I recommend it, but only if you play with a walkthrough next to you and during the last chapter if you choose the right option and beat the game lemme know because I spent 2 hours on that encounter and had to switch to the left one to beat the game finally.

359	0	a	First time playing, this game was truly amazing, you're playing as the killer for once, as the bad guy, as the guy others fear and not the other way around. Mostly inspired by the Omen films I guess, you're basically the son of Lucifer. You live in this big mansion and you need to slowly kill basically everyone around you. Concept seemed fun, and it intrigued me to buy this game.  You'll gain different powers as you progress through the game, but most of the time, you'll need to rig something to make it count for a kill. Now my problem with this, is there are no waypoints or no hints whatsoever, it is expected from you to immediatly know what to do or where to go. You'll probably look through guides a lot while playing this.   If you miss a key item somewhere you'll be stuck till you find it. It's basically a linear game, you only have 1 choice and you can only execute the kill in a predetermined way. It's fun for the first time, but later feels like a chore. Especially with the addition of those 2 hour farming achievements, it's just a big drag.  AI is poorly designed and most of the time you'll see them crashing into walls, walking and turning around at times for no reason. Storyline is predictable if you know the genre.  I'd give this game a positive review, but it's basically a 1 time play. Those hour achievements could've been better if the game had a new game + mode, or a mode in which you could preform kills in a different way. All in all, overall disappointed with the game, had a lot of potential.
333	1	a	I highly recommend this game for any horror fans out there. Gameplay-wise it's more of an adventure/stealth-game but the story is very similar to the movie 'The Omen'. You play as Lucius, son of the devil, and you do his evil deeds for him, mainly killing everyone in the mansion where you live, I had great fun with this one! And it sometimes is quite a challange to figure out what steps to take in order to complete the killings!

2158	1	a	One of the best stories ever to grace a video game. The game has a few technical issues, and the graphics leave alot to be desired but if you manage to get past these issues you'll find a tremendous story, in my opinion one of the best stories to ever grace a video game.  I'll be honest and say the controls are bad, the graphics aren't really up to par with modern games and you'll more than likely encounter a few technical issues getting the game to run.  Ignore those issues (except not getting it to run, try to find the fix for that) and you'll fall in love with the story. Just keep in mind the game starts off slow, and you'll very likely want to quit if you get caught up in doing side quest in chapter 2. Just push forward, trust me, it's worth it.

2010	1	a	Inquisitor is a stange game. Aesthetically  it is not particularly pleasing, considering we have titles like Diablo III, Tochlight, Torchlight 2, Grim dawn, Titan quest etc. Visually speaking this is comparable to Diablo I and II and even then that may be a stretch. This game contains insuferable amounts of lore, text after text of information that honestly most of us could do without. However, It wins on it's story and the intrigue the story brings. The amount of control you have over how to manage your charecter is nice. The ability to customize stats and skills is refreshing when playing an on rails AARPG like Diablo III.  I would recomend this for those of you who are not scared of hard games with a steep learning curve. Graphics are also a downfall so don't expect it to look pretty. The story (if you love story driven games) Is fantastic and is its primary selling point.  Ticklepants

3001	0	a	I LOVE THE GAME, I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY IT...
3044	0	a	I wish Steam would allow for more than a 'Recommend' or 'don't recommend' option, since I can see both sides of such an argument. Before I begin, just on this review. I have played this game for more than the clocked 9 hours, but apparently Steam does not register this during offline-mode. I 100%'ed the game in about 20-25 hours.  Deadly Premonition is great and terrible at the same time. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the sidequests are almost all gems and when you're in the zone this game becomes rather addictive. On the other hand, the PC version of this game is riddled with bugs. Terrible, game-crashing bugs. If you look online you'll find some fixes, but even after following everything recommended, the game will still crash after about three hours of playing. The problem lies in the memory management. if you unlock the game to use the maximum amount of RAM it takes longer for the game to crash. The way to play with the least amount of frustration is to restart your PC the moment the game starts lagging. Had I not already owned the game before learning of this, I might have passed it over, but even with getting thrown out of the game two to three times per playing session, I still loved it. The graphics are not bad and neither is the sound. the controls are rather intuitive and combat is fairly smooth.  I you're up for a great story and don't mind playing in shorter segments and saving an awful lot, this game is for you. On the other hand, if you get frustrated replaying parts because the dreadful 'DP.exe has stopped working' appears, I'd recommend you go for the PS3 or XBOX versions.

746	1	a	Ever watched the Omen and thought 'wow, wouldn't it be fun to be the son of Satan?'. Well now you can. Lucius puts you in the shoes of a little boy who discovers on his 6th birthday that he is, in fact, the son of Lucifer, and that your true father is very interested in you conituning the family business of killing people in really nasty ways so he can have their souls.  The game is third person so you will always have the little tyke in your sights as you go around working out inventive ways of offing the people living in your family mansion. You can interact and pick up various objects, explore the mansion and do quests from murder to completing chores. After all, a good little boy does all his chores, while also killing. As you progress you also gain abilities like telekensis and mind control, making the murder more wholesome; after all, no one will suspect you if that object happens to crash down on someone without any outward control.

Still,the premise is original,imo, it succeeds in mantaining the creepy horror atmosphere and playing a game where good guys don't have to win in the end is refreshing (Though it was amusing to watch Lucious getting successfully exorcised.'Hallelujah!') .  Worth buying , when on sale with a big discount. Oh and it probably won't take you more than 7 hours to complete it,so there's that too.

2650	0	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan,  Should you know, this game is surreal. Though, what you see now has a tarnished appeal.  'Such poor optimization!' one would declare. If you want the real deal, you should try it elsewhere.  So says, Mr. Stewart.
2169	1	a	 Pros:  - From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there. - Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D - Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player 'go there!...is funny isn't it!?' for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time! - The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP). - The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it. - OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a 'pro' but is not a 'con').  - The OST is amazing! Point mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing period! - The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now). - Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding. - If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.  - 'DP Fix' exist!  (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438)  As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;) Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.   Cons:  - Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT. - You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!   Notes:  - You can find 'Pillow Stains', the song from the former form of DP called 'Rainny Woods' check the trailer on YouTube:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Rainy Woods TGS 2007 trailer&nbsp;

1729	0	a	Short Review Incoming: PENUMBRA OVERTURE the first installment of the Penumbra series is a good horror game. The atmosphere is amazing and really eerie. This and the sound-design is what makes this game for me. It's creepy without any kind of disturbing imagery or jumpscares. On the other hand: The gameplay is rotten â¥â¥â¥â¥. The puzzles are not really well thought through and most of the time you have no clue what to do. And the combat... OH boy the combat. It's dreadful. Hit detection seems like it's non exsistent in this game. It isn't really fun to play.  I would say skip Overture, read a plot summary and start with black plague which is a much better game!

2336	1	a	This game is, sure, weird. But nice. It's nicely weird. And weirdly nice. As the console port it has a lot of bugs and glitches, it has it's undeniable flaws and till the very end it's impossible to decide if it's serious game or is it some kind of a parody. It's also impossible to stop playing, to stop enjoying the characters and the story that is weird... but nice. That is why I love japanese games so much - they can be weird, but they would leave nice aftertaste. For sure.
1482	1	a	This game is in my top 10 if not 1. The gameplay and story can't be beaten.
2443	1	a	What this game lacks in visuals Alan Wake has them, what Alan Wake lacks in ambition this game has it. This game is a problem, but a good one.
288	1	a	Reminded me of my childhood when I used to talk to Satan ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
1170	1	a	Didn't expect this game to be fun at all, turns out I was completely wrong. This game is a nice small type of indie where you can upgrade your ride as you smash and kill zombies while completing missions
735	1	a	Great game, took about 5 hours to complete.. the deaths were entertaining!   Unfortunately the Last two Achievements are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pathetic. A Big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to the dev's for making me idle this â¥â¥â¥â¥ forever, it doesn't track the damn time correctly so far I have 46 hours counted by steam and still haven't got the stupid â¥â¥â¥ 40h achievement.   Idling the game while sitting in my room staring at the player like a creep so it's not like its on the menu or anything, not even alt-tabbed and the Achievements still take â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t time to get, it's just stupid padding â¥â¥â¥â¥ so people think 'Oh wow all these people played 48357975893479 hours this game must be awesome I'll buy it!'  ONLY BUY THIS GAME IN A BUNDLE, I GOT IT IN A $1.89 BUNDLE DO NOT PAY THE FULL PRICE  Other than the achievement annoyance it was fun the first run through.   # Finally managed to get the stupid 40h Achievement after 60 hours -.-

2792	0	a	This game is a lot of fun! One day, I will buy it on a console and complete it. There is currently no chance that I will play this all the way through on the PC. All it does is crash. There are numerous help documents to help in making this game more playable for the PC, but I don't think they ever stop. I think we become immune to them at some point, but I have given up reloading this game again, it takes at least a minute to do that on its own. You just have to look at the guide section of this game on Steam to realise that there are some serious issues with this game.  My thought is that a game can become immortalised by being released on PC. Thus being playable for years to come. In the case of Deadly Premonition, it is going to need a serious makeover.  Maybe it will or does work for you, but you are most likely one in a few who have had success with the PC version of this game.
62	1	a	There are too many 6's involved! The baby was born in June, the 6th month, on the 6th day, in 1966. That's four 6's! Now if the baby was born on 6-06-06 and the game was set back in the day just a bit further than what it is now (60 years lol), it would be freakier.  It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. There is no reset to default in the keybinds, so be sure you want to rebind keys before procceding. Some of the quests can be quite confusing. 'What do I do?' is the most used question I have asked myself throughout this game. You are not really given hints on what to do or where to go until you do them and your notebook is updated. Thanks notebook, where were you before I did this or that?! Satans notebook bites.  Man, I am one evil, little 6 year old murderous brat, it's great. Another creepy thing is, when writing this review my text was spazzing out all over the place. This game is haunted! One of the best game I have got for free through Indiegala.
1737	0	a	I know this now comes as a pack and can't be bought seperately so to not play it would be wasteful, but in my honest opinion Black Plague is far better and this doesn't have much worth in playing except for experiencing the lead up to how the second game starts.  This is because after only maybe an hour in everything becomes quite repetitive while nothing much happens story-wise either except for three short excursions that were fairly interesting but buried within the repetition. *edit* [Hardly a spoiler/Not a story spoiler]:  After the encounter with the first monster, they become annoyances that are tiring to deal with. If you're looking for the adrenaline rush of scary encounters, you'll get maybe two out of this.   Also, for the most part, what happens in the story in this game is explained in the second game. What you do get is more insight on a particular character and of course more notes to read. The ending felt quite underwhelming.  What I will say that I enjoyed more in this game is that the notes you find are much more helpful (and usually necesssary) to your progression compared to Black Plague which means there's less of a feeling of 'I have these useless notes that I could read but I'm not that interested in'. However, the puzzles are also sometimes just a matter of wandering around which detracts from them.  To conclude I wouldn't say you should definitely avoid this game, but that it provides a lot less than Black Plague does in almost every aspect. I feel that skipping this game improves the quality:hour ratio and you don't miss a lot by doing so. If you do decide to skip it and then feel interested in coming back to it, by all means. There are a few sections that are worth playing.

1534	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague only strengthens the game mechanics of its predecessor. Most of the petty imperfections from Overture are fixed. If you enjoyed Overture, then DEFINITELY pick this up. Otherwise, this game merely supports your decision towards purchasing its prequel, Overture.  Gameplay: 19/20 ... AWESOME Story: 8/10 ... GREAT Graphics: 5/5 ... PERFECT Sound/Music: 5/5 ... PERFECT Controls: 5/5 ... PERFECT  Overall: 93% (42/45) ... AWESOME
2975	0	a	Tried this game out after reading a few of the positive reviews even though they mentioned the game was buggy and the controls could be quite awkward, but that the main story made up for it. Sadly I just couldn't get into it, every line of dialogue was more awkward than the controls and every character felt like they'd struggle to get cast in a B-movie.  If you must try it grab it in a sale, but dont expect much.

1081	1	a	it has zombies and uprades;)
511	1	a	it's very fun and inventive, but needs more detail so you know what to do exactly.
147	1	a	I just completed 'Lucius', and thought that there'd be no better time to write a review for it. In this game, you play the title character, a young boy called Lucius who happens to be the son of the devil. This is quite a departure from most other horror titles, and the effect it creates means that 'Lucius' isn't really a horror game at all, as you're implicit in the planning of all the atrocities committed throughout the story. The fact that it probably won't scare you doesn't mean that you will find it unenjoyable, though. 'Lucius' takes the form of a puzzle game, and a few action sequences are spread throughout the title; bear in mind, though, that the action isn't sufficiently frequent to appeal to someone who dislike puzzles and strategy. If you choose not to rely on walkthroughs (which, I admit, I did on a handful of occasions), you'll be spending a considerable amount of time riffling through drawers, shelves, rooms and cellars, looking for the various objects necessary for the completion of your mission. Your mission, invariably, is to eliminate the multitude of inhabitants and employees of Dante Manor. As you have the physical capabilities of a normal eight-year-old boy, you won't be relying on machetes, sledgehammers or firearms for your kills; instead, you have to use your environment. This complements the puzzle-based nature of the game, as, on occasion, the main challenge of your mission seems to be knowing just which weapon you should use. If you've seen 'The Omen', you've undoubtedly already drawn a handful of parallels between this game and the film. Whilst the acting talents of performers like Gregory Peck and Mia Farrow are sadly unreplicated in this uncannily similar game, you'll surely find enough interaction - whether object- or person-based - to immerse yourself in the world of Lucius and Dante Manor.

67	1	a	Good concept for a game, although it is a bit short I completed the whole thing in just over 4 hours. However I have to continue to play or leave the game running for 40 hours for the final two acheivements. Whilst it is a decent game I can't see myself playing it for that length of time. I re did quite a few chapters when I was acheivement hunting so I think I'm done with it now.   The house can be quite difficult to navigate and the game feels a little clunky and buggy at points (It crashed twice and my new PC hasn't crashed with any game). Would have been nicer if you had a little more freedom in the game, as it is you have to stick rigidly to the storyline. But I did enjoy the story and some of the kills were just pure twisted and evil.   I got this in the Steam sale and am happy with it for the price I paid, but I don't see myself paying full price for it. 6/10
1192	0	a	Well it's hard to either recommend this game or not. But since the negative things overweigh, I choose to not recommend this game.  The positive things: - Mowing down zombies which explode. Fun! - Bonus for mowing down even more zombies, wohoo! - A game that doesn't need any explanation and is simple.  The negative things: - Driving can be very frustrating, since you very often get stuck on some stupid corners. And half of the time you're maneuvring back and forth and back an forth and back an forth, while insulting the bad controls with a very foul language. I'm from Lower Bavaria / Germany, which makes this even worse. - You never see what's coming, since the camera angles (no matter which one you chose) takes away any sight or fun. - Time limits, time limits, time limits. Of course not every mission has to be completed in a certain amount of time, but it's annoying as hell if you have to. Why do game makers don't realize we hate time limits as much as we hate escort missions? - Most of the time you're searching for a route to your objective, instead of just driving and giving zombies some hell. The map is very confusing and of course your objectives are at the most far end of the map. The military has helicopters, but meh, f--- this s---, let's just send a normal car instead. The city's completely overrun with zombies and world is in peril, but that's fine. A normal car will do juuust fine! - The cars are a joke. I understand that you're beginning slowly with a taxi, a limo, a van, and that every car has its specific speed, passenger seats and maneuvrabilty. Thats ok, because one has to begin slowly. But they are boring and it's not really getting any better. No special cars or anything. The bulldozer and the tank, which are FUN AS HELL every meter you drive them, you're only allowed to use in one, maybe two missions. Yeah, just take the fun away from the player, I don't think he doesn't mind at all. Let's tease him with greatness and bash him afterwards. It's like getting the biggest and most-fun weapon of a game and than losing it forever and never being able to use it again. - The ending. Really? It seems the creators of this game lost any interest or motiviation or had been cut really short in terms of available time. It seems kind of unfinished.  The things that don't matter: - For a simple game like this it has an evolving story. Which doesn't make sense. Because yeah, let's send a taxi driver in a city overun with zombies to get some crucial things, while the bulldozer and the tank and all the military stays at the base. Are you kidding? Why not a person on a bicycle, just to make things interesting? Yeah, take this, zombie! *bashes zombiehead with club*  Things that could make this game awesome: - A camera angle which actually puts some fun and clarity in the gameplay. - More cars / vehicles which also look differently after upgrading. - Cars that feel like cars and not like toy cars or bricks. - The option to buy upgrades before you start the mission. Not finding powerups during the missions. You can include an arcade mode where this is enabled by default, I'm fine with that. But for story mode it's uninspiring and fun-breaking. Even with the upgrades your machine gun only has 300 rounds - if you pick up the flame thrower, the machine gun's gone. Mission briefing, upgrading the car, killing zombies. This should be the way. So what is the problem? One can never concentrate in mowing down zombies. Instead you're constantly on the lookout for said powerups.  Overall, it's a decent little game, which could be an effin awesome game, if they just would have put some awesomeness in it. I did not finish the game and after failing in a mission several times and watching videos of the last missions on YouTube, I'm glad I didn't finish the game. It would be absolutely not rewarding.

The guidance system and world map are trash I wish there were mods to fix this.  The worst part of the game for me is the driving element. THe map is huge but there isnt anything worthwhile to see or do on it, the sleep and eating mandate as well as waiting around for the right time to start your investigation are nothing but tedium.  Most wont be able to get past the fact that the game has visuals from 2006 at best.

203	1	a	This game is good, if you like games where you can walk around and just cause havok. I like to play this game from time to time, when I am bored of my bigger games. This game is great, the story is a little corny, but i enjoy this game. I like the different ways you set up each person for the 'fall' they encounter and the different maze like ways in the mansion, you can get to different places. Also the story following the seasons and years also. The only thing I hate is some of the difficulties in the game are a little hard to get past, and the build up to the end of the story and having a crappy climax. Other than that an ok game to play on A rainy day. Thanks Pew Die Pie , for bringing this game to my attention. =0)

180	1	a	Lucius is a unique game. It is a brilliant puzzle game, figuring out how to use your powers and things around you to kill various people, even having a story that even though not fully compelling is made bareable by the great gameplay. The mansion is a joy to explore and its had top standard gore. If you like challenging puzzle games with a dash of blood, this is the one for you.

1145	1	a	Zombie Driver doesn't sound like much on paper, but it's actually a very addictive game once you've given it a chance. The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.  If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0

2833	0	a	Won't even run unless you go to the forums and get instructions for tweaking. Graphics are weak. There is no manual so good luck with that.   There is more time watching poorly animated movies than actually playing.  This game is a BIG disappointment.
1695	1	a	this game was about me telling my dad that Saving Private Ryan was an overrated movie. He stormed off to Greenland and hacked me. My dad found out about the word 'noob' and he likes to call me that now. I get texts from him saying 'Hey. Noob. Hahaha' yes dad you're a comedian straight from 1999. Wanna play Quake?? Imbecile trash.
1496	1	a	Easily the best game of the Penumbra series. The movement is pretty smooth, the puzzles are a good challenge, it scares you while pacing itself and the story is good. The game is a tad bit buggy sometimes, but glitches don't occur often, so it's negligible. Unlike Overture's stupid combat system, there are no means of self defense. This, paired with the humming of machines and flourescent lights and other ambient noises makes the environment very creepy. A major flaw of this game is the budget: it's not too long and isn't very pretty looking. But who the hell cares? I think that might be the reason this game got such a low metacritic rating. But if you judged it on how scary it is, take the the total points of the Dead Space Series, divide by three, then add 10 and that's the score this game deserves.   Short Review: Scary, fun/10, definitely worth playing.

1794	1	a	Downloaded this game (and it's sequels) in preparation for Amnesia. A good game, (if a little short) atmospheric, puzzles can be a little irritating, but satisfactory once solved. However, combat is plonky and players should stick to stealth, I also noticed that health regenerates (I was playing on easy) I never died in the one instance of accidental direct combat. Other minor complaints are that when I started the game up I had to tinker with the graphics just get some colour and clear picture.  All in all, enjoyable experience. Makes me glad I bought it in a bundle

2659	0	a	Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game that I would not recommend to anyone.   Many comparisons can be made about Deadly Premonition - I myself found the combat to play like RE4, the overworld to faintly remind me of Psychonauts, the time-based mission structure to resemble Dead Rising's own (although major difference being in Deadly Premonition you can just ignore the time restraints and be none the worse) and even the mechanically-driven story setpieces to remind me of Metal Gear Solid's storytelling methods. The near Frankenstein nature of this mish-mash of tones and mechanics will undoubtedly remind you of many products too.   It's not remotely a serious game, though it does have its serious moments and it benefits heavily from them. The much-touted awful combat becomes merely mediocre if you play it with a gamepad - and you should play it with one. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is exactly as mysterious as it tries to be (though in no small part due to its poorly-veiled source material) and even the art direction is consistent and visually appealing, graphical glitches and some aging NPC models aside.  The point is that many people have recommended Deadly Premonition on the basis that 'it's so bad it's good'. This isn't true. Deadly Premonition is a geuininely good game that has won a cult following despite its shortcomings - I fought tooth and nail to fully complete it simply because I enjoyed it.  But I wouldn't recommend that you play it, because I can't be sure you can.  It took me a good 45 minutes just to get it to start without crashing. Beyond that I was fighting through runtime errors, outright crashes, even the odd Blue Screen of Death - any moment in the game that had me go longer than 20 minutes without a save point was a nerve-wracking nightmare. These aren't some faintly annoying bugs and this game is infamous for its port for a good reason. Right up until the very end my playthrough was plagued by some unseen demon.  For the technologically savvy there is a unique and memorable gem here that has been sadly soiled by its monstrous technical issues. For everyone else, move on. Watch a playthrough on Youtube because it really is worth experiencing, even if second-hand.

2834	0	a	The game itself is fun doesn't take itself seriously and offers quite a lengthy campaign, this game has the best main character i have seen for many years in a video game and made me laugh several times, the game is rather strange to describe but i will try if you had silent hill, a cheesy cop show from the 70s and an old gta game then combined them together you would get deadly premonition, The graphics are bad the textures are awful and the controls are clunky but this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game in any way i think this game works because of how bad some of the mechanics are. If you are mad about graphics and smooth mechanics do not buy this game. If you want to play a quirky game with some good humour and a very unique style of gameplay then this is for you. As for the pc port because it is so half baked and doesn't work for me i will say wait for another patch or just skip it on pc you could probably buy the console version for very cheap now which actually works

2122	0	a	It's Diablo with creepy religion. Diablo one actually runs smoother and this game has way too much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dialogue that gets boring after about an hour.
2009	1	a	I took a long look at some of the negative reviews and if you have read those there are some things you should consider. First off there is quite the learning curve to this game so if somone has less than 40 hours played I wouldn't trust their positive or negative review.  When I first got this game I spent about 20 hours starting, then stopping, then picking it up again. I restarted several times (an ARP curse of mine) finally, nearly, beating the first act with the thieft on hard difficulty. I reformatted my computer shortly after, lost my save file and hadn't played the game in almost a year. About two weeks ago I started a paladin on Normal difficulty and am about half way through the second act and going strong.  This game presents one of the most mysterious, yet compelling stories out of any game I've ever played. This is its biggest pro in my opinion. Once understood and givin proper time, the combat is okay. Not great, but not bad. I'll give a list of pro's and con's:  Pros: -Story is deep, mysterious and as you uncover more secrets extremely rewarding. -Well written and well thought out. -Unique Spells that serve you in interesting ways. -Unique and well written music. -If you actually read the novel length dialogue, characters are MOSTLY interesting.   Cons: -Loot system is on the con side of things. Pretty generic and seems, so far, that there are things to look for and things to ignore. -If they are going to leave the potion system the way it is, please, just please, let me stack them. -Duribility on gear is poorly designed and should be revisited imo. -Buggy. Nothing game breaking but enough to force you to save and restart the game a few times during a session.  Conclusion: If your looking for a unique story, good music, and decent gameplay arpg give this a shot. If you can be patient through the learning curve you'll be happy you gave this game a shot. It offers many hours of gameplay. I would guess im about half way through (could be off there) and I'm about 45 hours in. 7/10.
115	1	a	A personal guilty pleasure. Fans of tacky horror movies will find enjoyment in Lucius.  The mansion where the game takes place is very interesting and is a excellent environment to explore.   The graphics fail to impress and the controls feel very clumsy. Chapters also feel very short and fails to give players the chance to be creative as the way you kill people has already been pre-determined by the game.   Overall the game is enjoyable but could have used a bit more polishing.

1538	1	a	A great sequel to a great game; this one is definitely scarier than the previous installment as it has more 'determined' enemies and an even more ominous atmosphere, not to mention the chilling elements that have been added here and there. If that wasn't enough, the environment has been entirely changed around, complete with new characters and objectives. The only way to see what happens to the brave Philip is to play this game and find out.

Horrible UI.  Not really immersive. Or rather all the garbage just constantly breaks immersion.  The story is a bit interesting but the game is just terrible. I'd rather read this in a book than play this game.   
1644	1	a	one of the best survival horror/puzzle games i've ever played, highluy recommended. it doesn't treat you like you're stupid and expects you to be able to read, use deductive reasoning and problem solving skills. has a very engaging plot and is sh*t-your-pants terrifying at times. just play it, it's great.

677	1	a	A fun little game that I finished in (more or less) one 6-hour sitting. This game has as much jank as it has charm, and while being very linier, the puzzles are mostly stright forward (I resorted to a guide 2-3 times for specific moments, usually when there was a very specific spot you needed to interact with) and the murder animations are incredibly brutal, for the most part.  The stealth sections are garbage, as are the 'fight' sections, but these are both in the minority. Acheivements are dolled out fairly generously to begin with, but there is a 40-hour playtime acheivement which, as I already mentioned I finished the game in 6, will require me to leave the game running on its own for quite some time.  All in all, I recommend this game because it was fun and had enough content to keep me occupied and engaged for the entire time, which is more than can be said for titles like Assasin's Creed. Get this game, but get it on a sale, because as enjoyable as it was, it wasn't without its hiccups 'and' was completed in one sitting, so value that how you will.

2806	0	a	I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is. No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually. Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues. The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch. This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently. If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play. I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene. This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again. Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying. I think the story is very intriguing. The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm. I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand. I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.

It crashes very very often and, since the game uses save points, it is likely you will be unable to progress. If you are thinking of purchasing this then check the forums first to see if a patch has been released. As of now, there are too many stability issues.

2852	0	a	one of the the crappiest games ive ever played. Looks like pre PS2 graphics, horrid controls, and the most disjointed and impossible to understand game ive ever played. it makes me sick that this game is in my libary. i will be contacting steam for a refund, or at the vary least have it removed from my account. thats how bad this game is, id rather eat it than to suffer the humiliation of having this on my account. the devs should be ashamed of makeing something so horrible.
2583	1	a	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
1662	1	a	I bought the Penumbra pack back when Jesus was playing full-back for Jerusalem and made a number of attempts to get into it, but it never really grabbed me for whatever reason. Years later, I found myself in the mood for something a bit different and thought I would take the opportunity to clear some of my backlog. I'm glad I did.  The combat system is awkward but you can make it work once you get used to it. The physics are good, and are implemented well into many of the puzzles you will come across. The graphics are solid, not amazing but they get the job done. The audio is fantastic, the skittering of mutant spiders and low growls of zombie dogs gave me goose bumps on many occasions. The story is ok, you will find yourself doing a decent amount of reading but it keeps you interested and steadily builds atmosphere. I played it on Ubuntu 14.04 and it did not skip a beat, it was probably one of the smoothest gaming experiences I have ever had.  I thought of it less as a horror game and more as an adventure game that scares the bejeebies out of you. Penumbra Overture is terrifyingly creepy, and I loved every minute of it.

2901	0	a	Twin Peaks + Silent Hill.  this game is like strong black coffee: enjoyable, but not everyone would like it, or even be able to stomach a tiny amount of it.  it's got more hardware issues than a customer support center, and wasn't very stable or well-coded to begin with when it was 360-exclusive.  Stylish as HELL though. I'm loving everything about it in spite of its awful flaws. i can't wholly say it's a game for everybody.
1549	1	a	When you buy the gold edition does it now come with Penumbra Requiem Because I got the other 2 but also Requiem? Not complaining great game I rate it 10/10
1904	1	a	Great atmosphere combined with a intriguing story at a cheap price. The combat is incredibly clunky however you are a scientist not a fighter, run and hide and use your mind to find your way to the truth. A rough gem, but a gem none the less

2730	0	a	There's broken games, like Bioshock and dark souls 1, all fixable with tweaking and fixes  Then there's Deadly Premonition, a cancerous mass that even mods and tweaks can't save. They can only spruce it up, but now we just have a spruced up corpse on our hands. A zany, goofy, unique spruced up corpse on our hands.
1934	1	a	Alright so Penumbra is Pretty scary even if you set your Brightness to high because it uses Horror Noises and Scares to Scare the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the Player. It's Very good but not the kind of game i would play often because you can not defend yourself very well in this game and the Other two, Black Plague and Requiem you arent able to defend yourself at all.
1657	1	a	You may like the Penumbra trilogy if you loved Amnesia. Same Lovecraftian undercurrents, but everything feels much less polished: awkward combat, bad puzzles, etc. Overture and Requiem are still worth it.

2268	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a one of a kind game. I've never seen anything anything like it and I probably never will again. It's unique in many aspects, but the most important ones are: setting and pacing.  It's set in Greenvale, a fictional small town in USA, which has become the scene of a brutal, ritual murder. The player controls an FBI agent sent to carry out the investigation. There are many similarities to Twin Peaks as the game generally tried to capture the 'feel' of that TV show and referenced it many times. This is why I consider this game unique - you're not shooting up gangs, terrorists or whatever, you're slowly getting to know inhabitants of Greenvale and drive from one place to other talking to people and trying to make sense of the case. While the game has quite a few action sequences, they're not what's most important, in fact they are very easy and poorly done.  What's bad about this game? A LOT. While it's an open world 'detective' game, it's very linear and doesn't have many opportunities for the player to show off his cleverness. The controls for both the character and cars are clunky. The game generally, from player animations, to map design, lacks polish. The PC port is atrocious, probably the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are PS2 tier, don't even try to play without DPfix and SweetFX. The game regularly crashes, always loads slowly, doesn't allow alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, has broken sound on non-stereo audio configurations, etc etc...  Deadly Premonition is completely broken, there's no point in listing all its technical flaws, because there are just too many of them, Yet I'm still recommending it. Why? Because it's one of those 'love it or hate it' kind of games. I don't even know why I loved it, but when it crashed on me, I always just restarted it and kept playing.
136	1	a	Excellent game! I loved the plot a lot! Buy it, it's worth it!

1671	1	a	A bit spooky, and a bit puzzly! A quite short, but a very enjoyable journey!
1276	1	a	The sequel to Overture, Black Plague further tells the story of Philip which eventually comes to an end. In fact, it turns out, this is not the final episode (as Requiem includes further chapters) but for me it seemed like the final chapter of his adventure.  The story now continues and tells us much, much more. Running and hiding is even more frequent and from this episode we can clearly see the couple of places that inspired Frictional Games to make Amnesia. The game is also somewhat longer.  Since this is an essential part of a great survival horror trilogy, look for discount on the trilogy pack (if there's any) so that all episodes can be purchased at once. The story and gameplay are both well worth the ride!
2793	0	a	I have this for the XBox 360, so was excited to see it come to the PC. Wow was I wrong...! This is a horrible port, to the point the game is unplayable. Now I have a nice and powerful rig, with 8gb Ram, an Gigabyte HD 7970 and still get horrible stuttering at around 4 fps. So I go to change the resolution which is only at 720 when I realise I cant! The res is set at 720!   WHo ok'd a port like this? It's ridiculous that this game went on sale in a state like this. The original game had it's issues but was a diamond in the rough. The PC port is nothing but a lump of coal. If I thought I'd have a snowballs chance in hell, I'd ask Steam for a refund. Yes, it's refund bad.
757	1	a	I have a couple ways to recommend it, you choose which one tickles your pickles:  1) Do you like detective games? How about instead of solving mysteries, you would create them? ;D  2) Do you like the dark side? If so - this will be a sinister delight for you!  3) Murder! :|  4) Aggression begone! Oh, hello Lucifer o.o...
1878	1	a	You can fight back, kind of
263	1	a	seriously love this game
2616	0	a	I'd love to reccomend this game but honestly, It's not very stable, thankfully thanks to mods and unofficial patches it's a little more playable, but honestly, this is a very bad port right out of the gate of a game that was already pretty buggy and had a terrible framerate on the consoles, I guess i'm glad I bought it because I liked it on the consoles and it's a very weird but great game, but I can't reccomend it for people looking for a stable experience out of the gate.
336	1	a	Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high). I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a 'good boy' or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final part that has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise. Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.
1277	1	a	Amnesia's â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up little brother. Same, interactive environment and just about the darkest storyline anyone could ask for. The soundtrack/lighting can give you a headache at times, but then again what sort of horror-genre game doesn't? Sound was a bit buggy in general; had to restart the application a few times. Puzzles are immensly challenging, roundabout corridors will keep you guessing, and the voice acting (which a lot take for granted) was superb. The entire game took me about five hours to complete (excluding idling at the main menu), and the ending was strangely satisfying. Overall: 9/10, would replay.

2202	1	a	This is probably the most broken release I've ever purchased on Steam, and I do not regret it at all.  Fantastic game with some low-budget development that constantly shows, but has an amazing plot. The characters and plot alone justify this purchase despite that you  will  have to use DPfix to get the most of this experience.  That is all.  Buy it, you casual scum.
1945	1	a	Game is over-all, pretty cool. Don't worry if you're scared of horror games, this game really isn't scary. Instead, it's filled with puzzles and has quite the intriguing story. Definitely gonna playthrough another time, 100% recommened.
132	1	a	If you ever dreamed of being the son of evil, this is your chance. Lucius is a game with strong links to 'The Omen'. The player takes the role of Lucius, the son of the devil, who has to clear the mansion of itâs residents. To do this he must orcastrate âaccidentsâ without anyone suspecting him of any foul play.  Sounds great but sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives.

1868	1	a	From my blog  http://www.dyle.org/blog/game-penumbra-overture   Finished Penumbra: Overture 2 days ago.  Played fully on Linux with Steam (native, no Windows Emulation).  You are at the search for the mysterious death of your father. He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâs cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: âRedâ which apparently has gone mad.  As the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.  Compared to Amnesia this game letâs you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a âpiece of cakeâ and whatâs left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.  I can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.  The riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â â¦ to seal that doorâ. Right then you find a crate on the right side. When I jumped up the crate I couldnât reach the door mechanics, but the worm didnât appear. So I thought Iâm on the right place and tried over and over and over and over to get somewhere from that position. Wrong! I needed to simply push a button on the left side of the door! And sealing the door didnât help either â¦  Such quirks appear occasionally in the game: game mechanics great, story telling nice, riddles range from childish to misleading.  Still, walking the strange mine renders some nice and creepy impressions, 7/10.

Read one could reset the game and it would be fixed, did this and nothing, another said to use your flashlight on the door then open it, this did not help either. I enjoyed what I got to play of the game.
1389	0	a	I simply couldnt get into either Black Plague or Overture. If you, like I, come to this title as a heavy fan of Amnesia and SOMA and are looking for a comparable experience, I feel that you will be disappointed. Simply put, I feel the production quality of this game is significantly low enough to seriously break the immersion of disbelief at times. Some examples of this are: laughably crude 'dream' sequences that look like something out of a bad Amnesia custom story, â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor animations and character models, and fumbled horror elements. A sub-example of the last item is one time I kept getting caught by a patrolling monster, eventually the horror was lost and it became more of an annoyance. Another would be  The same caliber of story that Frictional has delivered is all here. The gameplay mechanics are also near identical. But unfortunately it doesn't have the polish to pull off the same experience as their follow-up titles. I think if you able to look at this as its own game in addition to having a serious appreciation for single-dev/handful-dev indie horror titles, you will like this alot. But if you want the same caliber of experience as the aforementioned counterparts, it simply isn't here.

2003	1	a	Inquisitor, a dark medieval role-playing indie game that had been in development for 13 years before its official release. Therefore, you can expect to find the traditional indie RPG stuff with slightly better graphics (since the developers had time to improve them).  Let's start off with character creation. You can choose among 3 main characters: the Paladin, the Priest and the Thief. Each one has his own unique story despite the huge amount of customization in attributes and skills you have. Now, about physical appearance you can't change much. You are presented with 4 faces (or portraits) for each character and you can't neither change facial features nor the character's body details. Despite this fact, you'll realize that the absence of these possible changes won't even be noticed. You won't even be able to tell how the face of the characters look like and since every single item that you equip on your character is shown as you play, you can't tell if he has large shoulders, hairy legs or if he lacks a finger. Still in character creation, as I mentioned, you'll choose to use skill points and attribute points. But that's not it! There are 7 books of magic in total and depending on the character you choose, you can pick some of those schools of magic. There are 4 permitted schools of magic and 3 forbidden ones. I won't get in much detail here so you can explore this for yourself. You can, of course, choose your character's name and you're ready to go!  Inquisitor will take you to a fictional God's Kingdom on Earth and you're sent to Hillbrandt to investigate something for the Holy Mother Church. The way you do it is completly up to you. You can be a neutral investigator, you can follow every single God's rule during the Inquisition and you can even be an evil guy probably just looking forward to torturing innocent people for his own amusement. Yes, there's torture in this game! There are 4 torturing devices you can choose to use during the game, you can use all of them on the same person if you wish. But if you want to keep your allignement on the Good side, be sure that the culprit hasn't given you the information you want and that he's not innocent, otherwise you'll be hated even by your superiors.  This game is divided in 3 fantastic acts and it has a very deep story that will immerse you pretty easily. Now, the concept of story telling is based on dialog that you'll have to read. And trust me, you DO NEED to read everything! If you're expecting a game where you'll have shiny things to tell you that's where you need to go or that's what you need to find; if you're expecting colourful arrows on the ground or even someone telling you exactly where you need to go, then be advised, this game is not for you even if you like reading a lot. You'll be lost most of the times, not knowing where to go, so one thing you can do is explore the areas and dungeons hoping to find what you want. There lots of quests for you to complete and those quests are so well connected that the world feels really alive. You'll have main story-line quests and, of course, side-quests to complete. There are tons of dungeons and many areas, lots of monsters that keep respawning from time to time and heretics! The game is expected to last 150 hours or so to finish but it'll take you much longer than that, since you' re the one who has to do all the thinking about where to go or what to do in spite of having an in-game journal to help you slightly.  Graphically speaking, the world is beautiful despite all the evil and Hell spawns you'll fight. The areas are so detailed that sometimes I felt like just sitting back and enjoying the view. The artwork of the dungeons is gothic-like and it isn't like anything I've ever seen. The music is phenomenal and very well adapted to the areas you're in. The sound in general feels very realistic and the quality is so good that you feel like there really are flies orbiting your head!  The combat mechanics though are pretty standard and straight forward. There's nothing new to it. You have melee weapons of different types, ranged weapons, shields and throwing daggers/axes, lots of magic seals to use and spells from the various schools of magic you can learn. There's also the brewing skill for you to master if you're into that kind of stuff. If not, just buy the potions from the village merchants and you're good to go. You can learn the smithing skill to and many utility ones you'll find for yourself.  Now one thing that I both loved and hated was the difficulty level of Inquisitor. The game is insanely difficult, specially in combat! And that's fine, we all like some great challenges once in a while. But the most annoying thing for me was the dungeon difficulties. Those places sometimes are huge and they're filled with monters you've never dreamed about and despite that the 'boss' monters can kill your whole party with a single spell and you don't have any time to react at all! Imagine one of those 'big bosses' surrounded by 5 of the most difficult monsters of that dungeon....Yeah, exactly, pretty impossible. So, in that regard, I feel like sometimes the difficulty level of the game is unnecessary.  So, my personal rating for Inquisitor is 8/10! It is indeed the best of its genre in my opinion and the only big downside I can find is the insane difficulty that sometimes is just too much to bear. Even though the character creation is not special, it is pretty acceptable and it doesn't even influence anything at all (speaking of character appearence, of course). Now, go to the Realm of Inquisitor and uphold the laws of God in His Kingdom on Earth as you see fit! The heretics must be stopped otherwise the Holy Mother Church will and that can never happen!   Reviewer's note: when you level up, just press C already (character menu) and if you want to pick items up, press Alt, so you can see them easily by reading their names.

1803	1	a	Generally I'm not a big fan of horror and/or adventure games. But Penumbra definetely got me. I won't call it a horror, but it's example of brilliantly done dark atmosphere. After finishing Penumbra Overture I felt not scared but rather depressed. Which games rarely suceed for me.  I suppose you should check it. Penumbra Overture is worthy gem.

2988	0	a	This game has wierd amusing moments, intriging story, some puzzles I ran into were kind of interesting and there were alot of strange side activites that I found. I understand why this game was a cult hit. HOWEVER, the pc port of this game is terrible. Locked resolution that cant be changed unless you get the fix developed by someone outside the company that made this game (Which by the way, may or may not work for some people.... which it didnt work for me unless I used windowed mode LAME). Without the fix this game looks like garbage and what I would expect from a playstation 1 game. Awful controls, hit or miss voice acting (which wasnt that big a deal for me), terrible combat system, AND GAME CRASHES are also present in the game. If the developer actually took the time to fix some of these things in the directors cut and properly ported it to the pc, this may have been a fun experince. But since the game controls bad and crashes often, not to metion the resolution debacle, I would recommend you get the console version of this game or watch lets play on youtube or whatever

1565	1	a	It is a good game. It has got some creepy moments and some decent design. Being the best game in the penumbra series however i can't recomend the other games much, and this game is not without fault. It unfortunately falls apart near the end and i almost gave it a negative for that reason... This is no Amnesia1/outlast but it is still worth a spin if you saw most of what the genre offers and are a horror game fan.... Keep in mind it's an old game too, there are better games to spend your cash on but it's so cheap... What else can i say... It's an old indie game. Keep your expectations in check and appreciate it for what it happens to be.

2016	0	a	This game in one word : TEDIOUS  First of all, the good points of the game : 3D iso old school RPG, interesting story (at first at least) with some well thought mechanism such as the whole idea of invastigating, torturing and burning evil citizens.  Now, the cons.... the first you see in game is the awkward combat system. Well you basically spam blindly and it works (kinda) - I should add I played this game as a caster. Not enough to make a bad game, right. You want some more ? Ok ! So, let's talk a little more about the combat. You begin as a total weakling : your spells hit no more than on time on 5 or 6 and do ridiculous damage. And then you pass from lvl 6 to 7 (or 8 to 9 don't remember) and you become a divine incarnation who OS every mobs.... at least till the end of the first act (well technically you do continue to OS every mobs in the second but that's for later). The companions you can gather are at first invaluable as you just cannot kill mob alone in the beginning (they can)... and just as you become overpowered they become useless... no, more than useless.... a huge pain the back ! They are so useless you'll soon want them dead (as you cannot ask for a companion to leave).  Oh, I forgot to speak about game breaking bugs, like there's 'rank' depending on stats and skills levels, and item use and ability unlock as you progress... That is... IF the game accepts to acknowledge your progress. Often, even when you do meet requirements you would not have the rank granted. And the only thing to do is wait till you level up to spend another point in the skill and pray this time it will work. You just don't imagine the impact of this bug : basically it means you cannot equip the new items, use new spells or ability you need.  The quest system is awkward too : sometimes you need to do things in the proper order to unlock a dialog, sometimes you need to carry an item, sometimes just find it is enough... And there's never anything to guide you. The resource management is awkward too... you want to cast spell : wait. Regain HP : wait.   Well... all in all I had a pretty good time during the first act : you wander the areas around the town, explore dungeons, cemetery... resolving quests randomly, you delve a little into the story... And then you encounter the end dungeon of the first act. A HUGE pit mine with many many floors... so many you will need to do several round trip to the town to empty your bags and repair your stuff. And of course, to do the round trips you will be required to cross the entire dungeons with each and every floor. You just cannot imagine what it is like. Suffice to say the vast majority of players who where willing to give this game a try (and not discourage by the combat system, pacing and bugs) stop there.  And then the second act. You begin in a big town, I cannot judge the story as I stoped in there but it begins like the first act. No, the tediousness of this game stopped me there ! I thought the game will be less tedious after the big dungeon but no ! It's getting worse ! You will never have any space in your inventory due to potions managaement and the need to keep some very big clue you find for quests (oh but you do not know if it's usefull or not, nor when it will become usefull), and.... I was beginning to die again. Oh my char was still overpowered but I could not kill 2 groups of ennemies (and there's LOT of them) without my armor breaking, forcing me to either continue naked and dying from spiky damages, either do a round trip to town...   All in all the game shine by it atmosphere and some good ideas but that's all. All is tedious in this game : fight, use spells (why is there so few shortcuts ?), use items, carry items, companions management.... Too bad there was something to do here but this game miss the target...

1877	1	a	A creepy, modern dungeon-crawl. Overture will keep you running and hiding from a multitude of enemies; frantically race your way through an old mining complex, listening to the babbling madman on the other end of your radio. Clutch your tiny hammer in fear as an enemy slinks by, leaving you undetected... for the moment.  Interestingly, the only Penumbra game in which you can actually fight off enemies! Let them have it while you can, the later titles don't allow such behavior...

2350	1	a	I played this to completion on 360. When I first ran this on PC, I did get a crash at startup, but this was fixed by setting to WinXPSP3 mode and running as administrator on both the launcher and dp.exe. Please keep in mind it might be a hard game to get going, since it's a lazy port. BUT THE GAME IS AWESOME This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The characters and story are so weird that you'll keep laughing and keep trudging through the game just so you can find what happens next. There is no other game like this game. Yes the graphics are bad and the game controls pretty poorly, but if you can make it past those things, you have an unforgettable cast of characters and amazing plot to keep you playing into the wee hours of the night. I recommend that everyone try this game for at least two hours. If the graphics are too bad for you, grab the dpfix which is listed in the forums. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.
1510	1	a	Pros: Very well done horror, more than simple jump scares. Immersive, almost no hud during gameplay Puzzels are significantly harder than amnesia's  Did away with the first games weapon mechanic. Scary-ier IMO than the first one.   Cons: Requires first game to get full experince. It gives a story recap, but it wont feel the same unless you have beaten the first. Some parts require finding an item, that if not found quickly can lead to wandering the entire complex for 2 hours before looking it up online to find you threw a damn couch cusion over it.  Rotation motion is very difficult to do properly  Overall, very good game if your into story-horror games. It improves on almost everything that was wrong with the first one. Still some issues with rotating an object or handle.  Combined, I think the Black Plague and Overture are scary-ier than amenisa.   The Requiem addition is kinda bad. I dont want to give anything way, but it didn't do much to advance the story for me, and isn't nearly as scary. If Requiem wasn't free with this, I would vote to skip it.

1798	1	a	A very short game but there's a reason why people are afraid while playing it. The atmosphere is perfect so that seeing a dead body is either scary or striking, the enemies in the game are incredibly difficult to kill so that you'll actually use the (very forgiving) stealth system and when the game wants to let you know that you escaped on the edge of your teeth, dear lord you feel it.  Also there is a rather striking moment late in the game involving your friend Red. I saw it coming and it still sparked some emotions.

System Shock, The Grudge, Cold Fear, etc...) and no franchise or game comes close to Penumbra, scariest one i have ever played for sure, the only game that could surprass it is Amnesia.  Overture is the scarier one

1847	1	a	A nice immersive horror games that doesn't rely on cheap scares and relies on atmosphere and immersion to make the player feel like he is really hopeless and fighting for survival, the game is fairly short in length which is a bit disappointing but the areas are well thought out and for a game that doesn't have a big budget i think they have done the best with what they had i give it 81/100 and my own personal hooray!!!

2062	1	a	I haven't gotten too far in the game but thus far I am intrigued by the writing and the story; I would suggest reading a guide here on Steam called something like Beginner's Guide to Inquisitor, which provides a brief walkthrough of the very first part of the game and some other helpful information, some of which is not covered anywhere in the game itself or otherwise implied in a conspicuous manner.  The gameplay seems ok, except I wish it was less action-oriented, but that is just a personal preference which I can overlook considering I also enjoy games like Diablo. What I enjoy most about the game is the lore and premise of the story, there is a lot of reading to do, so if you don't like to read you probably shouldn't get the game. What I enjoy most is the part of the game that doesn't involve fighting and the combat. I still don't mind it too much, but I dislike some aspects of the gameplay and the game doesn't help you along enough with certain information about it, along with other aspects of the game, most of which I can disregard.  I am eager to play this game more but personally am not that crazy about the style of combat and gameplay associated with that; my dislike of the combat might be explained by the fact that I haven't gotten very far in the game and it is more punishing at first, but rewarding later. I think it's a special game and deserves significant recognition for its writing and the unique universe the developers created, which I would like to explore more of, not only because of the writing though but also because of the overall atmosphere of the game. The music is great also, and the game doesn't look too bad and is fine at higher resolutions. Inquisitor has that classic RPG thing going, but not just for the sake of it being classic or old, it just works out that way.

1652	1	a	This review contains minor spoilers, mostly of the beginning of the game.  Penumbra: Overture is a first person horror adventure game and the first part of the Penumbra series. You play as Philip, a physicist who teaches at university. After his mother's death he receives a letter from his supposedly dead father whom he barely remembers at all. The letter contains a key to a safety deposit box as well as the instruction to destroy everything that's in the deposit box. When Philip opens the box he finds several document and maps, some of which he cannot even decipher. The findings point to a location in Greenland though. So, instead of destroying everything Philip packs his things and leaves to follow the traces his father has left behind. After arriving at the location he manages to find an abandoned-looking mine.  Penumbra: Overture plays in first person perspective. The player can manipulate objects by clicking on them and then dragging the mouse accordingly. Doors and drawers are used in the same fashion. This system was later refined and used again in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you have played that one you have a pretty good idea how it works. Many of the puzzles are solved by manipulating objects in the enviroment. It is also possible to pick up various objects and pile them up to briefly block a door or throwing them as a distraction. Philip can also crouch and hide in the darkness - a skill that is very much required. While combat is possible I'd highly advice against it. There are only melee weapons available and those work in the same way as manipulating objects works. You have to actually swing them around using the mouse which is very awkward, difficult and therefore risky. The combat is the one thing I really dislike about the game. Luckily it is avoidable in most cases.  While exploring the mines Philip has to mainly rely on stealth and wits. As already said combat is very dangerous and in most cases not worth the risk. Also, there are certain enemies which are so massive that you cannot possibly hurt them in any meaningful way. So for the majority of the time Philip has to lay low, hide if possible and run if necessary. While staying hidden works most of the time there are some parts of the game where you have to get away as fast as possible. This really helps with spicing things up and making the player feel unsafe. Many of the puzzles revolve around manipulating physics objects but there are also some which revolve around finding information and acting accordingly. So you have to example figure out how to assemble an explosive charge, find all necessary ingredients (or substitutes), assemble the device and use it to clear a cave-in, so you can move on. There are several other puzzles which can only be solved by exploring the environment and gathering the appropriate information. Those are very engaging and reward the player with a true sense of accomplishment after figuring out the solution.  Penumbra: Overture features a really creepy atmosphere. You are all alone in the abandoned mines with no human being around but still it is obvious that people have been there until very recently. Whenever you apparently get really close to meeting another human being that chance is taken away from you, so for a majority of the time you can only rely on yourself and on the voice of a crazy sounding man who contacts you over the radio from time to time. While he sometimes sounds really nice he seems very unstable and probably not the person you want to rely on when it gets serious. Overall Penumbra: Overture does a very good job in emphasizing Philip being isolated in a hostile environment.  Penumbra: Overture is the first half of a two-part game (Penumbra: Requiem is rather a spinoff which does not directly continue the main story). The story continues and reaches its conclusion with Penumbra: Black Plague. Because of that you will not be able to figure out the whole backstory after having played only Penumbra: Overture. There are find several hints to find, though. While I think that Penumbra: Black Plague is even better than Overture, Overture is still a really good game.  If you like horror games and/or engaging puzzles this lesser known gem is something you should really try out.   More reviews  here

1956	1	a	Deep puzzles and situations, genuine fear and isolation you'll never see another human for the whole of the game but it's that very part of the game that I loved. The 'hands on' mechanic where you have to do all the moving in the world by dragging the mouse makes you feel more part of the world you're stuck in. Penumbra: Overture is one of my favorite games from the same incredible company that made Amnesia: The Dark Descent which is probably the scariest game I've ever played and this is a stepping stone on the way to get you prepared for that.

2387	1	a	Pure B-Movie in game form. It is amazing.  If you happen to make it through to the end of the game you find a plot that is seriously messed up. No healthy mind could have thought of something this twisted. You need this game.  As a small side note, this is a straight port so there are no PC options. That means you are locked at 1280x720 and for some insane reason there is no controller support at all. Luckily the genius behind the Dark Souls Graphic Fix, Durante, is on the job once again. Here's hoping he can get controller support in there too... Of course, with resolutions higher than 1280x720 you will probably need whole new textures for a few in-game items but I think we could see that from a modder in the near future.

1672	1	a	Yet another Horror Puzzle game at its finest. Grotesque creatures stalk your every move while you figure out which way you need to go, as well as solve any puzzles that are between you and your way out.  Frictional games don't disappoint in these games as they will always keep you on your toes, like a midget in a urinal. The only downside that I have seen is the crude combat that exists. Throwing certain objects, using a hammer to strike them, or just simply sitting on top of a crate where they can't hit you but you can hit them kind of takes away the helpless feeling that Amnesia has. However, the sequel to Overture pretty much elminiated this making Black Plague an improvement.  Overture is Part 1 of the Penumbra trilogy, and I also recommend playing the others as well (Black Plague and Requiem).  9/10

2465	1	a	Great game, bad port. The game is quite unlike anything else. And it's got a bit of the 'So bad it's good' type of game going on. There are some serious bugs, though with some quick fixes the game breaking ones can be fixed and just some hilarious ones (had someone fall through their driveway as they pulled into it) will remain.   Everything Deadly Premonitions does is generally mediocre, but it doesn't feel like a knock off, it feels more like a self acknowledged B-Movie. And although it may not have had a large amount of fame, the game has gotten a cult fanbase and become a hit among its fans.  The gunplay is essentially Resident Evil 4 mixed with Silent Hill. The enemies aren't particularly tough, they don't generally evolve much, but they're creepy and they feel right at home with the silent hill like areas of the game. The driving portions control like a PS2 game, and not GTA quality either. The map also makes the driving a major pain as it can be frustrating to figure out where you wanted to get to without any waypoints or minimap GPS. And there's some simple detective work with generally easy side quests.  The game is open world during some portions, giving you anywhere from half an hour to several hours of real time to wander around, do minigames, simple sidequests, or gather collectables. There's a ton of optional content to keep you busy and it makes the game well worth the money as far as content goes. There's a few 'realistic' elements to the gameplay, such as a need to eat and sleep, these don't really ever detract from the main game though, and never feel like they're a problem. I constantly found myself with TOO much free time and slept in between missions.  The game really shines with how awkward it is. The dialogue at times doesn't even make sense, and is often thrown in front of hilariously inappropriate music. The animations during cutscenes are all fairly terrible and it adds to the charm. The game will jump from a serious sob story, to a completly out of place morbid joke in a heartbeat. And its fantastic. The community has uploaded several recordings of such scenes and it truly shows how surreal the developers are.  The game really requires a sense of humor and a bit of patience with some of its flaws, but if you can overlook them the game is a hidden gem. For an example of the humor see this         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Possibly the funniest cutscene in the game&nbsp;
1020	1	a	Oh how satisfying it is to kill THOUSAND of zombies! Got it on sale for only 1.34 â¬. I think they should've added some kind of a free roam mode but that's just me :)
1417	0	a	this game is mediocre
2605	1	a	The coffee! 'Zach, do you remember what the coffee said?'  This game has so much charm. I'm sucked in by the silly, whimsical style. The characters are cheesy and I love it. A lot of the supporting characters are one dimensional and are defined by their quirky traits, and that's okay. The simplicity of these characters adds to the campy feel of the story, which seems to be intended as a parody on the horror genre.   Deadly Premonition is a campy romp through the twisted memories of our protagonist, Francis York Morgan, as he tells a story of his investigation into a peculiar murder case. In this story, Francis finds himself caught between two different worlds, one 'normal,' and one filled with monsters and spooky stuff. He is an unusual character, and as you start to understand who he is, the question nags at you, is he really interacting with this paranormal parallel universe, or is it all simply in his head? As he often talks to a guy in his head and he consults his coffee for advice, you begin to suspect the latter.   The game play feels a little clunky, with its Resident Evil controls and quick time events. Still, I had a lot of fun running around bashing zombies with a pipe, solving clever puzzles, and driving from point to point in a sandbox environment that is the fictional town of Greenvale. The choice to include these driving segments in the game is a strange one, but strange choices are what drive this game to greatness.   8 out of 10 deadlys, would premonition again. 
161	1	a	Fun. Demonic. Satanic. Lot's of killings (Nothing else lol) Ever wanted to be a 6 year old walking around a big mansion killing people with magic powers given by your father, The Devil? Well i have not, but the game is fun sooo, try it out.

1778	1	a	The Penumbra series is awesome. Like Amnesia, but with more puzzles, more of a challenge, and more darkness (believe it or not).
2673	0	a	Doesn't run. Crash on start every time.
566	1	a	Top tier lip synching
753	0	a	Great idea, sub-par execution.  Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime 'achievements' to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box 'hitman'-esque game.  Perhaps the devil really is in the details?

1361	1	a	---Review for Penumbra:Requiem DLC--  A bit of a disapointing end to the trilogy.  This installment forgoes monsters and focuses entirely on puzzle solving, which wouldn't be a problem except for the Portal-esque manner in which it does so. Unfortunately, the rationale for why the test levels feel so artificial just isn't any where as good as Portal (nor are the puzzles as good as seen in Portal).  The setting is the same, although less dynamic and panic-inducing than previous installments, but there's little to no plot progression. We get a small glimpse of the fate of the character we've been playing right at the end and that's all this installment adds. I was rather hoping for more.

975	1	a	People are often surprised about the amount of time I devoted to this game. The concept is not very complex here - you drive around, smashing zombies and surroundings, sowing destruction and collecting upgrades to your car and momey to buy even more upgrades.  Can this game be any good? Definitely! It's one of the games that I spent most time playing. It has some storyline, but it's not the reason you play this game, is it? I play it when I feel the need for speed and destruction without excessive brain exercise. In fact you can freely relax your brain in this game, you will be using your eyes and fingers, but won't need to plan any complex strategies. But when you play a game that is all about driving into hordes of zombies, can you expect anything else?
1845	1	a	Wonderful games. I love the tension when playing it alone.

342	1	a	Good fun game with a lot of gore. I just love murdering my family in the morning....HAIL SATAN!
313	1	a	  Well yeah i would recommend this game, if someone has been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off lately, most terrible ways to kill a person, (hold dis gaim away for da kids, gives ya'll f nightmares) good graphics even though it's a old game, pretty good story line, yeah ( thumbs up ) &lt;3
2152	1	a	When people decide to make a game on a really low budget, but are aware of it and stick with it in their entire game design, then you could either say, it's a bad game with a really low budget, or a masterpiece in its own right. Personally, I say the latter.  This is probably the worst low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, but it is the only low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, which makes it the very best game of it's entire category of all time.  And I mean that absolutely seriously. This is the worst game I had the greatest fun with in a long while. I had more fun with Deadly Premonition than with many triple A titles. It is awkward, it is really painfully badly executed, but even after I saw the ever appearing 'flicking the lighter to light a cigarette' animation during a cutscene for the 200th time, I still thought it was hilarious.  Deadly premonition is the prime example that a bad game doesn't necessitate a game to be less fun. That and the fact that the story is a ginormous clusterf***.  You'll either love it, or you'll hate it. I loved every single second.
2371	1	a	Essentially the Twin Peaks video game, but I'm sure not complaining. Deadly Premonition is a stylish and unique gaming experience, and definitely worth its status as a cult game. My only complaint is the fixed graphic setting and the limited number of control/performance tweaks in-game (settings can only really be adjusted in the launcher), but otherwise a must play.
2672	0	a	Freezes at the end of a level. Driving is a nightmare.  Unplayable.
2781	0	a	The game itself is amazing, but the Controller support is broken and makes this version too frustrating to play.
2141	1	a	It's like an ugly boyfriend who kisses really well.
126	1	a	This game is different from what I usually play. It does feel a bit glitchy using the telekenisis ability, especially if you haven;t played for a while, but that might be just me.   It's fun for the morbid part of all of us.

1351	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants, 1 hour into the game.  11/10  Would â¥â¥â¥â¥ in pants again.
2172	1	a	Normally I find trying to get a game running a bit of a hobby, something fun. I want to really enjoy this game, it looks like it could be great to play, but unfortunately that's where it ends for me right now.  EDIT, I've got it working. I'm keeping it 'Not Recommended' for the faint of heart.   What worked:  Set compatibiltiy mode to 'Windows XP SP2', run as administrator Delete LAV Extensions Reinstall Physx Launch from the DP application and not the launcher  Using these setting will launch in windowed mode, if you want to run fullscreen create a shortcut of the DP.exe and then in properties type in '-fullscreen' within the target field.  So far it's reliable, but don't have a lot of hours in it at all yet. I like it A LOT so far. I recommend the game to those who don't have issues doing a little bit of work to get a game going. If you can't handle that, you really need to stay away from the title even though it really wasn't that bad to get started.

2226	1	a	Having a good time as far as I played. Nothing quite like it. I got this on sale for $2.49 and I am not disappointed.  It's reminds me of games like Silent Hill and early Resident Evil.
2861	0	a	I was really excited to play this, but it's so poorly optimized that I can't even launch it, even with DPFix and all the PhysX hurdles I had to jump over.  That's $2.50 I'm never going to get back. Get the console version instead.
3000	0	a	Sadly, I couldnt get this to work, shouldn't be sold on steam.
2723	0	a	The game is very enjoyable and it's design is unique. It has flaws, but those flaws bring a type of charm to the game that is very addicting. But the port is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad that it's unplayable. The fps â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in it's pants in some areas. The controls are bad and have technical difficulties. But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it. It's a great game, but I don't think any game is worth this much. You're buying a pig in a poke with this, and I can't recommend that to anyone.
681	1	a	If you've never played this kind of game you should give Lucius a shot. It's not perfect but it is interesting. Ok, now I'm just gonna go back to killing people.
1254	0	a	This game gets boring really fast and reminds me of free games you play on a phone! I got it for 99 cents and would have to say I wouldnt play it if it were free! Not worth downloading onto a gaming rig at all and I laugh at reviews that say it is great.

999	1	a	Pretty damn good top down driving game in GTA 1 and 2 style. If you liked the original GTA style driving games, this is just like them, only with content and graphics like they were made today. It also reminds me a lot of the old APB arcade game.
1330	1	a	Just as brilliant as it's predecessor, but with a rather anti-climatic ending.  I also don't get the hate surrounding Requiem. Sure it wasn't that great overall, but it did a good job wrapping up all the loose ends in BP.

3037	0	a	I simply couldn't get past the horrible combat system, terrible sound, wooden voice acting, and dated visuals. There might be a good story in there, but I doubt ill see it. Also, the game chugged terribly. Not recommended
2458	1	a	Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.
10	1	a	  Good? Bad? Hard to say. can't play it, no servers... if the comunity (and the devs) was more active maybe it could be a good game. Thumbs up for now.
1651	1	a	Really excellent game. The combat is atrocious, but it's totally possible to sneak past any enemies without too much hassle. Great story, terrific immersion, and generally a really quality experience that puts you right in the shoes of the protagonist. Despite any graphical or gameplay issues, I had an undeniably good time playing a game that I really couldn't put down for more than a half hour at a time. Highly recommended, and I'll be moving on to the sequel as soon as I finish this review.

2167	1	a	 Pros:  - From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there. - Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D - Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player 'go there!...is funny isn't it!?' for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time! - The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP). - The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it. - OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a 'pro' but is not a 'con').  - The OST is amazing! Point mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing period! - The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now). - Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding. - If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.  - 'DP Fix' exist!  (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438)  As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;) Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.   Cons:  - Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT. - You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!   Notes:  - You can find 'Pillow Stains', the song from the former form of DP called 'Rainny Woods' check the trailer on YouTube:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Rainy Woods TGS 2007 trailer&nbsp;

1380	1	a	While writing this review, I found it hard to write it without just saying 'It's Penumbra: Overture, but without the hit-or-miss combat system and with more reasons to be frightened of the world.' Because that's precisely what Penumbra: Black Plague is. It's the example of what a successor should be. It sticks to what worked in the original and removes what players didn't like. For example, Penumbra: Black Plague maintains the terrifying atmosphere and adventure game elements of Penumbra: Overture, but removes the (overly reviled) combat system. There was also some new additions, with one specific addition being a character that constantly messes with Philip's mind (and by connection, the player's mind).  Anyway, continuing without connecting it to Penumbra: Overture, Penumbra: Black Plague is just a excellent horror game, and the clear step toward Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The game starts off immediately, with only a brief cutscene explaining the prior events. From that point, Penumbra: Black Plague is practically a nonstop horror show of twists, turns, evil science, hallucinations, and an ancient evil. As cliched as I'm making it sound, the whole of the story is highly creative, with an increased atmosphere as well. It's just as terrifying as Penumbra: Overture, if not slightly more. The removal of combat helps, along with enemies that won't give up the chase and hallucinations that constantly make you question reality. As for the gameplay, the removal of combat makes Penumbra: Black Plague feel identical to the classic adventure games of the 1990s, such as Tex Murphy and Myst. It's a change that is highly welcome, as it becomes amplified with decent exploration, hidden collectibles, and great puzzles. It's a very tense and terrifying game with a great story and more than decent visuals.  Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition also gives you Penumbra: Requiem, a small expansion pack to Penumbra: Black Plague. The expansion is decent for the most part, trading the old-school adventure approach with gameplay more akin to Portal. The puzzles do mesh well with the gameplay, creating some intricate, multi-part puzzles. However, the atmosphere is pretty much gone here and, while still occasionally eerie, it's not nearly as terrifying as the original two games. The story does try to tie up all of the loose ends, which it does reasonably well, thanks to two endings that are up for interpretation. It's a short stint, but worth looking into if you want to see Philip's story to the end (or ends).
2261	1	a	55 hours and I finally finished this game.  Bugged, cheesy, crappy animation, lots of stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crashes all the time (thanks for the awesome port). You'll have to save your progress. Don't you ever forget! Because crash will catch you off-guard. Fan made fix for this game is almost required! Music is out of place almost all the time, it can switch from drama to comedy at any second.  But! Story was great. It always finds the way to surprise you, lots of symbolism will guide through this journey. It feels deep, rich and dark. Like a good cup of black morning coffee. This case was not easy to solve. Right, Zach? 8/10
2497	1	a	If you like good stories then this one will get hold of you like nothing else in videogames. The graphics, combat system and narrative seem cheap and slightly broken at first and you'll be amused in an ironic sort of way. Quickly this disappears to be replaced by genuine affection for the characters, the town and even the things that you previously considered broken. I wouldn't change a thing.
2676	0	a	I really like Deadly Premonition but cannot recommend this bad PC port. It has a horrible framerate and crashes frequently. The game now freezes at a specific point which is 2 hours into the story (just after going through the hospital) and I cannot be bothered to find a way to progress as it will probably only crash at another specific point.  Luckily I bought it when it was only $2.
2613	0	a	I love this game.  Completed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the ps3 version and although it had is drawbacks it was narrativley stunning.  The PC port is poorly done.  &gt; Locked 720p resolution and unstable framerate, can't even surpass 30fps most of the time.  There is a fix you can get by a very talented individual by the name Durante, which unlocks various options for the game such as resolution, anisotropic filtering, SSAO etc and it makes a huuuge difference.  this is an essential fix if you decide to buy :  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=373   Many people have reported this fix working perfectly and others claim it does improve gfx and lets you set custom resolution but the framerate is still unstable.  My experience was the latter, i have major unstable framerate for the game and my rig can more than handle this game.  I can't recommend the pc version of this game since it requires you to work on it to get it running smoothly, you really shouldn't have to do it after paying money for the game.   Though it pains me to give it the thumbs down i would recommend you play it on the ps3 for a better experience because it really is a great game.

1766	0	a	ONE HUGE NEGATIVE!!!!!!!!!!! I paid $10 hoping to â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants while clnching the mouse for dear life, I farted out of boredom.  TWO THINGS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Story by notes and books is awesome. Puzzles remind me of Silent Hill in difficulty.
1781	1	a	I've played and beat this game many of times, and I always come back to it. If you didn't know by now. The people who made the Penumbra series, Frictional Games, also made Amnesia and the upcoming SOMA. If you like puzzles and horror games. This is for you.
105	1	a	:::: Bringing the Devil Out :::::  What to expect from this game?  It is a game wrapped around the life of a boy who is not ordinary. In fact he is driven from the human number of the Beast, '666', and it is your goal to carry on some devilish fun. The game has very detailed graphical visuals that surround the setting of a Mansion where the boy does his evil deeds. If you are into some puzzle solving killing fun, this may be the game to enjoy those fantasies and desires.   What are the positive things about this game?  While playing this game, you will immerse yourself into a house full of family, staff and house guests who will live throughout their last days while you prey upon them. There are plenty of rooms to expllore and things to move or take for your goal needs. Once you play for an hour or so, you will feel like part of the family. There will be different missions/goals to achieve during the day or night, while others are awake or asleep. Rain, snow or sunshine will not keep you from killing. Just, do not get caught.   What is the negative things about this game?  This game is linear oriented to the variety of ways to kill your target. There is only one solution for each goal, which can be very fustrating. (For example: You can easily squash a bug, spray it with poison, or catch and release it. In this game, you can only spray the bug with poison.) This game would be better if their were alternative ways of reaching your goals. Also while playing this game I have encounter some game glitches, bugs and crashes. The game have crashed while loading the next part of the game. I also encounter a glitch while traveling down or upstairs, the NPC characters would either push your character off the stairs or get you stuck between them.  Would you recommend this game?  Yes, solely becuase of the orginality of this game's design. Although this is a very linear game, I find it ammusing to try to leave clues about you being the killer throughout the game. (Such as leaving toys or other objects to appear in the cutscenes when not needed. I had many laughs with it) **There is no playback value to this game, except to have fun and cause mischieve.   BE A VERY BAD BOY !!!!!

50	0	a	Lucius has so many problems. So many glitches and bugs that make to solving puzzles impossible. And you can try so many times before you understand that its a bug. Graphics are acceptable but not smooth and i had fps problems with my i7 4720, gtx 860, 16 gb ram system (but this is not acceptable). And it wont scare you cause you are the guy who is scary. The best thing about Lucius is a idea of playing Lucifer's son (Omen? of course:) ) Totally it needs more things apart from a good idea. I dont recommend it.

2499	1	a	Zach, my coffee warned me about this PC port.  Play this on console if you can. Most people wouldn't bother to troubleshoot all the issues to get through this game but for some reason I did. I don't regret it at all though.
395	1	a	Wish to kill your household members in a gruesome way? If yes, this the game for you. It can be whip to get your brains whacked up to think and plot your murder. Despite the bugs, which can be really infuriating sometimes; this game is a gem of sorts. Head chopping, sending a nail through the face, burning a man alive... These are some of the ways of murder you will experience, which can be really satisfying. This game is gem, i hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.

1533	1	a	Very immersive, creepy, disturbing, puzzle horror game. I never played OVERTURE, the previous game. But there is no real need as the previous game is explained in segments throughout this one.  I really enjoyed this game. More than I did Amnesia, for the simple fact of the Date its set in. Amnesia is more like, reading an old book. This one is set in a year I recognise, or close enough, feels modern and through that I found I got into alot faster and enjoyed it more.   Grab what you need and Run for the hills. This game has no weapons. You can throw items at enemies, but they dont die, they will just be distracted while you run away. But dont let the lack of combat put you off. This game is about the STORY, which is great. And sucking you into a nightmare, which, it does very well.  Highly recommended for any horror fans, or anyone who played Amnesia or similar games.  9 / 10

Downloaded every mod and patch to fix it: none worked.  They should rename the game: 'System Restore, the reboot joyride!'  Please steam, don't get your customers steamed up. Just give me a refund or store credit and I'll try a different one.

2235	1	a	One of the worst ports ever. However the game is just a fantastic mess and if you can pull through the terrible performance then you are gonna love it. Keep your standards low for this one though.  If you have a Xbox 360 or PS3 I would recommend getting it on one of those instead. I just cannot get this game to perform properly even with fixes. The PS3 version is most likely the best one to get because the controls aren't a broken Resident Evil 4 rip off like the Xbox version, and the PS3 version has graphical and gameplay fixes too; along with an extra ending.   However then you might have some framerate issues. In that case, if anything, the more broken the better. You're then getting the true Deadly Premonition experience. I recommend the game, NOT this awful port.

895	0	a	TL;DR for lazy people: Boring, confusing, horrible stealth mechanics. Decent story.  This game sounded a whole lot better on paper than it is in practice. You're a creepy mute kid who is apparently the son of Lucifer and you have to kill everybody in your house so your father can have souls, using diverse methods to knock off your targets one by one while making it look like an accident.  Unfortunately, finding how to do it is a hassle, there's only one way to kill each target and it's not always obvious. there are few clues and if some of them are usually simple and clear, you never know where to find the item, you have to search a huge, confusing manner to find said item and use it. Even after you found the thing, it's not always clear where and how you're supposed to use it. This game doesn't hold you by the hand.  Despite those problems, the game is rather interesting to follow as some drama starts because everybody's stumped and the detective in charge has no idea how all these deaths happen. But then comes ... The Betrayal. The one chapter that manages to ruin what little fun this game managed to offer. You have to cause a power outage so you can sneak around to get in the garage, which is on the ground floor, on the absolute opposite of your starting point. Here, you have to contend with locked doors and horrible stealth mechanics that barely work coherently. you can't see a thing but you don't dare use the flashlight in case this game actually makes you easier to spot when your light's on. All you do is try just about every door in the frickin' house while avoiding the adults patrolling with flashlight for no obvious reasons while your remaining satanic powers are drained because you manage to get spotted by someone who's at the far opposite of you in the corridor or by people you couldn't see or hear and open the exact same door you were planning to open.  This, this is what killed the game, that was barely alive in the first place. It'll probably end up being one of those curios I bought for a buck that I'll never finish, let alone re-install and that's too bad 'cause I'm rather curious about how the story ends. Oh well.  
1762	0	a	It's the first commercial release from Frictional Games, the guys who made Amnesia: TDD. There are a few high points in the game, like the good voice acting of the character named 'Red' and also unsurprisingly the atmosphere is great. But on the other end of the scale the 'combat system' is completely broken and the game has very loose ties to the personal story of the main character, because the whole game focuses on this 'Red' guy who in the end is very unimportant.  The sequel Penumbra: Black Plague is far superior, and at points is even better than Amnesia in my opinion. I know this is supposed to be a recommendation, but I quess I can also recommend people to stay away from games, so this one right here is definitely one you should skip.

2786	0	a	Avoid this PC port, but play this game (on Xbox 360 or PS3)! It's a terrific, dramatic story, in a memorable, immersive, offbeat/surreal virtual town, PC porting issues aside.  If you do get the PC *port*, expect to put up with crashes every hour or so, long load times between zones and cutscenes (especially cutscenes), if you can even figure out the tricks to get it to run. Then, even when you're able to play, you still have to put up with broken vertical aiming that only shows up in the PC version.  If you still get the PC port, look at DPfix (and fiddle w/ resolution and windowing settings), and try setting compatibility to WinXP SP2, or better yet Win98 (but with Win98 you'll probably have to give up the built-in gamepad support and either use keyboard/mouse (mapped onto console/gamepad-first controls) or messing around w/ a third-party gamepad mapper).  I was on the fence 'yes' or 'no', but I'll leave it at 'no' both to stand out in the reviews, and to stick w/ my opinion that this particular PC version should be avoided unless you really don't have a 360 or PS3. I would hate to have you sour on this game's story and world simply b/c the PC port sucks major suck (seriously, even if you could get around the keyboard/mouse, load times (with only a blank screen, no indication DP hasn't frozen--tip: unless it CTDs, it'll probably load, just give it a few more MINUTES) can be unbearable).
2877	0	a	Don't get me wrong, the game itself is remarkably good but the PC port is just insanely terrible and utterly garbage! It's truly one of the worst PC ports in history, imagine a mix of Resident Evil 4 &amp; Dark Souls PTD ports and make it a hundred times worse. It's terrible in every single aspect you could imagine and  so broken that it's  LITERALLY  UNPLAYABLE :   Performance : Extremely terrible, couldn't be any worse. I can't even find a right word to describe how terrible it is! It barely runs at 10 FPS on a modern PC without mods. Well to be honest, it doesn't even run at all without mods. You'd hard a really hard time even trying to run the game without crashing, not to mention you will have to use Compatibility Mode and reinstall nVidia Physix just to get it to run.  You probably have to use MODs just to be able to launch!  And that's not all, Loading times are infuriating, especially the invisible loadings between each cutscene which could last up to 8 minutes! You'll just sit there staring at the black screen thinking the game's frozen but it's actually a terribly long loading!  There are countless super-long invisible loading times!  And that's not all! There's one more bonus for you:  Game constantly crashes every once in a while for no reason!    You're better off playing it on the console rather than buying this terrible and utterly unplayable piece of crap on PC.

To my surprise, this game wasn't as horrifying as I thought it would be. Pretty solid gameplay, story, combat is a bit off but the fact that there is combat at all was surprising.   Overall: 8/10

1611	1	a	Forget Amnesia, this is Frictional Games' underappreciated child that needs more recognition. Compared to Amnesia: The Dark Decent, this game brings more feelings of terror, two-fold the amount Amnesia had on me. In Penumbra, you cannot just run and hide from a situation to make everything okay, in most instances you are faced with a challenge to complete all while being stalked by a demon dog or infected crazies, which can be extrememly overwhelming. The storyline is intruiging, and the visuals are pretty good for a low-budget horror game. The monster AI can be a bit stupid at times, but it doesn't really take away from how terrifying they are. This is a game you will truly find yourself immersed in, and I would recommend it to any horror game fanatic (who doesn't already own it).  9/10

(remember 3 things though: 1: turn off post effects, or you will have a white screen, without graphics. 2. set shader quality to Medium or Low, or for some reason the graphics look extremely ugly. 3. set contrast to maximum in your screen settings, or the game will be very bright at all times regardless of how low you set the gamma to)
697	1	a	This game gave me a good impiression for the neat graphic. Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.

1128	1	a	Very enjoyable game, it's a top down car based arcade title where you have a story mode, races, and my personal favorite, slaughter mode.   Campaign is you're a cab driver during a zombie outbreak and you complete various missions, races and wipe out hordes of zombies while progressing and unlocking new upgrades/weapons for your vehicle.  Race is pretty much what you'd expect except (fun words to use in sequence) you can blow up your opposition to set them back/eliminate them and there are zombies on the race track.  Slaughter is a mode where you survive/wipe out as many zombies as you can in timer based waves earning weapon/repair/cash (score) drops. Various maps you can unlock based on doing well in previous ones+new cars to unlock via the 3 modes and a score board leads to an addictive 'Beat your/friends high score' mentality of old school games.  I only have less than an hour on the PC version (picked it up for $3.74 on sale) but I have 20+ hours on the xbox one version (paid $15 and don't regret it).  The game runs well on my potato so no complaints there.   Fun way to kill time/hilarious game to watch via broadcasts.
2089	0	a	So far for me this is a control + alt + delete simulator, i cant get it to run, every time i open the game it remains black and covers half my screen so i have to ninja the task manager with arrow keys and the delete button because it even manages to block that. 10/10 would play but cant.

The walking is way to slow and the running to fast for the lagging to keep up with and you end up running in to walls constantly. When you are given chores to do in the game it goes on for ages due to the bad controls and really just puts you off wanting to play onwards. Again its a great idea and if the problems are fixed i would happliy continue playing this game but for the moment im not planning to progress any further.

1564	1	a	The sequel to overture has our protagonist pick up a fairly bizarre 'sidekick' that provides for some comic relief and plot development among other things. Puzzles are a bit trickier this time around but still pretty sensible. This time you have no way of fighting the monsters which, like the previous game, is a bit of a non-issue since you can run to certain doors to escape them.
2586	1	a	The coffee! 'Zach, do you remember what the coffee said?'  This game has so much charm. I'm sucked in by the silly, whimsical style. The characters are cheesy and I love it. A lot of the supporting characters are one dimensional and are defined by their quirky traits, and that's okay. The simplicity of these characters adds to the campy feel of the story, which seems to be intended as a parody on the horror genre.   Deadly Premonition is a campy romp through the twisted memories of our protagonist, Francis York Morgan, as he tells a story of his investigation into a peculiar murder case. In this story, Francis finds himself caught between two different worlds, one 'normal,' and one filled with monsters and spooky stuff. He is an unusual character, and as you start to understand who he is, the question nags at you, is he really interacting with this paranormal parallel universe, or is it all simply in his head? As he often talks to a guy in his head and he consults his coffee for advice, you begin to suspect the latter.   The game play feels a little clunky, with its Resident Evil controls and quick time events. Still, I had a lot of fun running around bashing zombies with a pipe, solving clever puzzles, and driving from point to point in a sandbox environment that is the fictional town of Greenvale. The choice to include these driving segments in the game is a strange one, but strange choices are what drive this game to greatness.   8 out of 10 deadlys, would premonition again.

1305	1	a	Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.  Penumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd game in the series. It improves upon many aspects of Overture, and is the best of the 3 games.
6071	1	a	 Early Access Review
1996	1	a	Before Amnesia, there was Penumbra, a series of games that put you in the dark-cold caverns of a secret facility where many questionable things have occured. While not a blood and gore type of game, Overture makes the player feel very uncomfortable right from the start, throwing danger and death quickly into the player's path. While the controls are simple, some are quite difficult to master, such as utlizing a weapon to defend yourself. The number of enemies is limited to less than a handful, but despite this the game has you question your every movement, thanks to the help of a man-eating-giant-worm and the unstable areas of which you tracel. The atmosphere is good, the graphics okay, and the story is relatively puzzling. Unless you are too frightened, you will likely want to purchase the sequal.

I mean it was an entertaining game, the problem is its not worth the money you pay, not even $2.50 like in my situation. A few days before I got this game, I had 2 coupon codes for 2 other games. One game was in the $10 price range and the other game was in a $5 price range. In total, the price was $1.75 (these coupons were bigger). One of the 2 games (the $10 one) I would've gladly paid $7 or even $10 at max for, while the other one (the $5 one) I would've paid $3.75 at max for; this game I would've paid at max $0.50.

224	1	a	Lucius is a bold attempt to put you in the shoes of an evil 6 year old with supernatural powers and a good standing with the devil in order to murder and cause mayhem amongst all other people in your home without being detected. While the developers characterize the game as an open world experience, it only takes place in the very confined place of the house and does not allow for creative approaches when it comes to murdering the inhabitants. Unfortunately, this is also my major issue with the game that has to be lauded for trying something different, but fails upon the execution - quite literally. In addition to that, controls are a detrimental to the experience and become your real enemy in the few, but frustrating fighting sequences. One can argue that a certain amount of dark humor is present, but again the execution feels forced and especially the sexual scenes add nothing except for their own sake being there. In short: Interesting concept - no buy

106	1	a	Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have 'Stealth missions' that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.  Pros:  + Great Idea of the game + Barely funny + Free movement + Open world (Mansion in this case) + Nice skills  Cons:  - A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible) - Bad face factions - Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime) - Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun) - 6 Hour duration average - 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours - You cannot do anything but the quests - When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again - WTF final  My score is 6/10

In particular, the music, writing, and atmosphere are pretty good, insomuch as they are Twin Peaks: the game but the shooting segments are absolute garbage most of the town, and most of the spaces within the buildings in town are empty space and the cars turn like bricks

660	1	a	EN I have honestly to say that I was following Lucius from a long time, but at one of the last sales I've been kinda let down by some bad reviews saying that the mansion was huge and you had to find little objects and made it sound like a pixel hunter game. Last monday I bought it tho, since it was very very cheap (less than 1â¬) and I saw that all the bad reviews were pretty wrong. Sure the mansion isn't small, but let me tell you that if you're a 'game explorer' like me and love to go in every single place in games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim well this map will be a piece of cake and you'll learn it pretty fast. About the gameplay itself, yes there's no much freedom but it's kinda explained with the fact that the kills must look like accidents, but the puzzles ('cause after all it's a big puzzle game from a point of view, where you have to find out how to kill someone step by step) are never frustrating or absurds like in some point &amp; click adventures. If I should point a flaw it'd be about the stealth sections 'cause more than real stealth they're just a series of trial and error until you learn the patterns of the NPCs, so while I understand the willing to vary the gameplay they've been implemented poorly unfortunately. So to wrap it up I'd suggest this game 'cause it's pretty good and entertaining, dunno honestly if at the full price it's back again (18.99â¬ here), 'cause while fun it's pretty short (about 6-7hrs, taking my time to explore, achievements, etc.) P.s. Yes I cheated my way through the 20/40hrs achievements 'cause there was no way I was gonna leave my PC on just for that, it'd be different if the game would take that time to finish obviously!  IT Devo onestamente dire che stavo seguendo Lucius da un bel di tempo, ma ad una delle utlime svendite alcune recensioni che parlavano di una villa gigante dove dover cercare piccoli oggetti me l'han fatto sembrare un gioco stile 'pixel hunter' e quindi ho desistito. Lo scorso LunedÃ¬ perÃ² l'ho comperato, dato che il buon sconto (meno di 1â¬) ed ho notato che le recensioni negative erano sbagliate. Certo la villa non Ã¨ piccola, ma lasciatevi dire che se vi piace esplorare nei giochi come me ed amate andare in ogni singolo posto in giochi come Fallout 3 o Skyrim beh questa mappa sarÃ  un gioco da ragazzi e l'imparerete velocemente. Riguardo al gameplay in sÃ©, sÃ¬ non c'Ã¨ moltissima libertÃ  ma Ã¨ in parte spiegata dal fatto che le uccisioni devono sembrare incidenti, ma i puzzle (dato che alla fine Ã¨ un grande puzzle game da un certo punto di vista, dove dovete capire come uccidere qualcuno passo passo) non sono mai frustranti od assurde come in alcune avventure punta&amp;clicca.. Se dovessi citare un difetto sarebbero le sezioni stealth perchÃ© piÃ¹ che un vero stealth sono solo una serie di prova e riprova finchÃ© non imparate il percorso dei PNG, quindi anche se capisco l'intenzione di variare il gameplay sono state implementate malamente sfortunatamente. Quindi per concludere suggerirei il gioco perchÃ© Ã¨ buono e divertente, anche se non so onestamente se al prezzo pieno a cui Ã¨ tornato (18.99â¬ qui), perchÃ© anche se divertente Ã¨ abbstanza corto (circa 6-7hrs, prendendomi il tempo di esplorare, obbiettivi, etc.) P.s. SÃ¬ ho imbrogliato per ottenere l'obbiettivo delle 20/40 ore perchÃ© non avevo nessuna intenzione di lasciare il PC acceso solo per quello, sarebbe stato differente se il gioco avesse richiesto quel tempo per essere finito ovviamente!

52	1	a	This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours, where I also got 54 achievements along the way.   You play as the devil's child and you have to kill all persons in your father's mansion without leaving any traces, while a detective investigates every death as they happen.  The game is a bit of adventure, point and click, stealth and puzzles in general.  A special note to a chapter where you have to take the power down, then everyone in the house is walking around with a flashlight and you have to avoid them at all costs while doing some tasks - a really fun stealth experience.  LUCIUS IS REALLY BADASS.

416	1	a	The game first appears to be some kind of  The Omen  tribute, where you can raise all Hell and make a mess of this little imaginary world. It could not be more far from the truth. But it does result to be a good puzzle-solving grotesque game. It will get your brains to hurt, not for its difficulty, but for the absurdity of some of them. I highly recommend to play it with a walkthrough and a guide, and trust me, you will thank me later. Bizarre, bloody, a sin itselft for some - but certainly fun. Turn down your crosses and leave your Jesus Christ crap at home, buddies!  6/10
332	1	a	An indie-game that requires intelligence, patience... and sometimes google.  Absolutely fascinating concept; with many, many allusions put into the game. Just the fact that the mansion is called 'Dante Mansion' is kind of a no-brainer, but passing names like Wuornos and Gacy; is lost on those who do not know. I, however, was not lost - and found the game to be refreshingly original.  It is a challenging game, not only in having to solve the 'puzzles' - but in an ethical sense.  A breath of fresh air/fire, this one.

WASD are standard movement controls but the other controls are just not for me. If you want / can aim with left ctrl and space bar among other things then get this game.

2645	0	a	Bought the game for â¬ 2,49, thinking to myself I can't do something wrong for that price.  Actually, the story and the characters of the game are quite good (as far as I know it by now), but there are so many technical issues, that I can't recommend the game to anyone. It just will end in frustration.  At first, you have to use some 'trick' to get it started at all. Then you will have crashes every now and then, which have nothing to do with the hardware (my PC fulfills all requirements by far).  My personal 'I won't play this anymore'-moment is that some crash just destroyed a save game. So I played 12 hours only to recognize, that I can start all over again and I have no guarantee, that the game won't destroy another save game on my second try to finish this game.

348	0	a	It's a shame Lucius is lacklustre. It's a neat concept for a dark and morbid puzzle/adventure game. It's a less-than-subtle homage to the 1976 film 'The Omen'. In it you play as the titular Lucius, a 10 year old boy to whom Satan (who looks and sounds like a poor Jack Nickelson impersonator) reveals is the antichrist. You're tasked with killing the entirety of the household, including your surrogate family, in ways that draw no suspicion to you, or your satanic nature. Asside from an entertaining concept the acting is probably the best thing about this game. Watching your family lose their minds over the inexplicable deaths tormenting them grows more and more harrowing as you progress. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. This game is a technical mess. Objectives are unclear, gameplay is stifling, the sidequests are boring and the glitches are rampant. I spent a whole hour on one of the early missions because you cant use your satan powers when in direct line of sight of NPCs. After looking it up in a guide it turned out I had to stand behind a small, suspended rack of meat about 2 feet away from where I was standing. On the plus side, i found out if you walk lengthways into a door while it's opening or closing, it'll slingshot you outside of the map, allowing you to get a better sense of the houses layout. Later in the game you can unlock a gun and mind-wiping abilities, but aside from the tutorial, I found no place to use either of these for the whole game. Another sidequest reward is a Jack-in-the-box, the function of which I was never able to figure out, but it had a limit of 2 charges of whatever it did. This was my reward for spending half an hour gathering socks from around the house and putting them into the laundry bin, one by one. Despite the open world, it becomes quickly apparent that there's only one way to complete each mission. Ideally, a game like this would involve forethought, strategy and precision. Instead it's just trial and error see-what-this-thing-does. For the finale of the game it takes a stark departure where you are suddenly just throwing fireballs at people like the fantastic four. It feels like the core gameplay just gave up.  Overall, Lucius is a neat concept but the execution feels rushed and incomplete. Can't recommend.

2233	1	a	Aside from the crashes, and visual DEFECTS this game has gone through it's up there in my top 5 games. It's optimal to play this with a controller, and there's mods to fix a lot of this game up.
1291	1	a	The Return of Frictional Games.  No Hammer, No Dynamite and Forget the Pickaxe.  The second half of the penumbra saga is well executed.  From the immersive audio narrative to the freaky monster encounter Penumbra: Black Plague will keep you on the edge of your seat.  My only complaint is that content wise it still feels like the second part of the first game and more enemy type would of been cool, but a side of that now were talking this is one hell of a horror game  8.4/10 Verdict: Run and survive the horrors that await.

I wiped out the original in about 20 hours, so I expect this HD version to give up 40 hours of enhanced and added play.  Tip: if this is still like the original, it might be a good idea to hold off all upgrades in the story mode until you unlock the discounts. Going to find out for myself.  Recommended for single players. 8 / 12

798	1	a	I'll admit that the gameplay is a bit awful, but the game makes up for it with an interesting story and gruesome deaths. You feel powerfull murdering as Lucius while the detective and the residents of your house just can't figure it out that you're the one responsible. The graphics and music are just decent, and the game is short. Has a lot of achievements but one needs you to play (or idle) for 40 hours, where you'll need around 8 hours to beat it. It's an interesting game, but i can only recommend it on sale. For one or two bucks it's worth it.
461	1	a	So, my internet isn't great, and yet I really wanted Lucius. So I got it and downloaded it overnight. During the night, I had the weirdest dreams ever.

2434	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a game unlike any other that has came out in recent years. The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today.   The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the âother worldâ. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.  It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude.   As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York.   Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale.   Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map.   The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various âother worldâ levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right).   The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.  Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the âother worldâ.   These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word âPROFILINGâ fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the âother worldâ, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred.   Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as âShadowsâ. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.  To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.  Continued...

2620	0	a	The actual game itself gets a wholehearted recommendation. Though the gameplay is certainly rough around the edges--to say the least--there's an immense amount of charm, humor, and Lynch-esque eccentricities found in the fictional town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition was never a 'so bad it's good' game, but rather a genuinely good experience saddled with a low budget and a couple of design pitfalls. The main issues lie in the combat. The game's director SWERY65 has been on the record stating that the 'shooting bits' were not actually a part of the game's original concept. The combat was the last part of the game developed in what seems to be an effort to give the game a broader audience appeal. And it shows. Killing enemies in this game is by no means a dreadful or broken experience, it's just a very barebones and arguably pointless affair--some shallow padding until you reach the next chunk of entertaining story exposition and exploration of the game's quirky world. I'd argue that most people played the Dreamcast classic Shenmue for the exploration, character interaction and investigation segments rather than the just-OK fighting-game showpieces sprinkled throughout. As it follows in Shenmue's footsteps in many ways, Deadly Premonition should be treated in the same regard. Do enjoy the warmth that Greenvale has to offer.  If you can.  The lack of resolutions higher than 720p in this PC port have already been discussed and criticized--and then fixed, by the same dude who made the Dark Souls PC fix. DPFix, however, does not fix the lackluster native controller support and constant crashing. You can go find additional third-party mapping software of course, but as this is originally a console game and advertises controller support on the Steam store page, the exclusion is a bit disappointing. The crashing, on the other hand, is not as immediately remedied. It seems very temperamental and varies from system to system, but across my two Windows 7 and XP machines I've had nothing but instability. I have tried putting the .exe in Windows 98 compatability, numerous restarts, and other tweaks found from various discussion threads. But the game still crashes at the worst, most pivotal moments (like before I can get to a save point) or slows down to an unplayable framerate. The framerate is momentarily fixed by a full system reboot, but the sluggishness and screeching halts always return again and again. I've never seen this kind of thing happen in any other game.  So in a bit of frustration and resignation, I've uninstalled this game and returned to finish the original, Xbox 360 version. But I feel like I'm missing out on the definitive experience. The Director's Cut provides some nice touch-ups, like a better map system, less washed-out graphics, marginally improved driving controls, some extra cutscenes, and an easier default difficulty setting, which basically lowers the sometimes ridiculously high health bars on the various enemies throughout the game. Though there's much talk these days about the dumbing down of modern games--that they're too easy--I can assure you that toning down the frustration in this game is definitely a good thing. Anyone who has spent 30 minutes killing one of the 'wall-crawler' enemies in the 360 version should be able to attest. It's attrition, a hurdle, not a fair and invigorating challenge by any means.   Some people have been able to play this port to completion, sidequests and all. Maybe you're one of them, maybe not. Maybe in a year (or more), the game will be patched up and as nice as the Dark Souls port. Until then, I consider this game an Xbox 360 exclusive (the Playstation 3 Director's Cut port is even worse than the PC version, don't touch it please!).  Buy this port if you like a gamble, Zach.

1765	0	a	Ths game is kinda weak. I got myself worked up for the first 30 minutes of the game, not realising there wasn't any thing to chase me yet, and then when they got to their first 'scare' it was just a spider the size of my hand just crawling past me. Then, when a REAL threat came around, it growled which startled me (this was when I was still excited about getting the game), but I crawled around a corner and saw it was a bloody ( yet still unintimidating) dog the size of my spaniel, that I could run past without it noticing. Then later I decided to whack it with a hammer that I got very early in the game and it FELL OVER AND SURE AS HELL TOOK ITS TIME TO GET BACK UP. Later I got on a crate where the dog couldn't get me but wanted to, so I kept hitting it with the hammer, and it DIED. That left me free of the dog until I went to another area, skipping and singing, 'ding dong, the witch is dead.' I just wish they made a better, scarier, maybe IMMORTAL, at least, monster. Plus, the riddles are SO FREAKING HARD. Had to watch PewDiePie play it to know wtf I was doing. But don't listen to me completely, I haven't beaten it yet, and I heard it gets more intense. CONCLUSION: Not a scary game (to me) but don't be COMPLETELY persuaded. Also, definately play this if you wanna play this game's sequal, Penumbra: Black Plague, which IS quite scary, but you won't understand a single thing in it if you don't play this; Overture. If you absolutely DO NOT GIVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the story, go ahead and play Black Plague, but you'll be left with a crap ending that you won't get or like if you don't play Overture.  Ok, I've played the rest now and it got a LITTLE more scary.  Just a couple parts with a huge worm. Long story.  So, all in all, I'd just get Black Plague and just enjoy the scares.  6.5/10 wud play baseball practice with some spiders agin

1278	1	a	  'Every time, itâs harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.â    Penumbra: Black Plague is the second of three episodes in the Penumbra series. While continuing the compelling storyline from the first instalment it also improves the characterization of the protagonist. Furthermore, the excellent music background contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are challenging and enjoyable, without being illogical or forced.   Without the awkward combat system of the prequel, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.     Trivia:    Penumbra: Requiem is the third and last episode in the Penumbra series. Originally intended to be a trilogy the series was reduced to two episodes due to unidentified problems with the previous publisher, Lexicon Entertainment. In the end, the third instalment came in form of an expansion pack in order to tie up loose ends and put the focus more on the puzzles.    Amusing quotes:      âIs the emergency figurative or literal? A figurative emergency might, for example, involve an undersupply of coffee to the vending machines. A literal emergency, on the other hand, might involve flesh eating monsters rampaging about the facility.â      âSoâ¦ you are running around with a human body part in your backpack, and I am supposed to be the bad guy?â      Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.    Chronology:    Penumbra: Requiem (PC) First-person adventure game  (Horror) â 2008  Penumbra: Black Plague (PC) First-person adventure game  (Horror) â 2008  Penumbra: Overture (PC) First-person adventure game  (Horror) â 2007   Link to Steam review for Penumbra: Overture.

1829	1	a	Alright, so that was my first horror game!  I still remember my hard beginnings with the kind of old game mechanics and the old graphics. BUT from the beginning there were -atmosphere -horrorfying music -scary tunnels -and stinky zombie dogs u have to kill with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pick that swings 5sec after u swang the mouse, that was quiet difficult to handle but the game was getting more exciting after every minute I played, and the storyâ¦ no joke, I almost cried at Reds third diary page, so intense feeling for digital person I even never saw in the game   Conclusion: Awesome, more than worth the money, great finale
1851	1	a	A gamed stacked with lots of clever puzzles and horror elements, Penumbra Overture is guaranteed to give you an amazing experience.  
240	1	a	Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.  Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.  The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.  For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.  If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say 'delightfully twisted.' It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.

2934	0	a	Tried this game out after reading a few of the positive reviews even though they mentioned the game was buggy and the controls could be quite awkward, but that the main story made up for it. Sadly I just couldn't get into it, every line of dialogue was more awkward than the controls and every character felt like they'd struggle to get cast in a B-movie.  If you must try it grab it in a sale, but dont expect much.

The options menu - its hard to get arround in it, It took me over half a minute to figure out how to close it.  It seems the game has some performance issues, I ran the Witcher 3 and other more demanding titles on the same machine with ease, but here it seems clunky  About 30+ minutes into the game made me really disapointed, especially after seeing all the other good reviews,

2929	0	a	Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game and a must play, I HIGHLY recommend it. However, the PC port is pretty much broken. You're lucky if the game even launches and when it does, it is riddled with bugs, glitches and contantly crashes. The game itself is REALLY good, but I've never seen a PC port this broken. It's exactly like the Dark Souls port but worse. A fantastic game that it ruined by a horrible port. What a shame. Stick with the console version.

2034	1	a	I got  Boots of Saint Baudolino  for reading through bunch of text! 10/10, Instant classic!  Now the snark is out the way, I'd argue that playing Inquisitor in the year of our Lord 2015 really  is  a surprisingly enjoyfull experience and I'm immersed entirely in the atmosphere and the world.   Yeah, it's... curious to play such a game precisely now. We've got Pillars of Eternity, Divinity - OS and Wasteland 2 that are true heralds of the modern renaissance of the classical text-rich, immersive isometric(-ish) WRPG and still more beautiful games like Tides of Numenara to come, and playing Inquisitor feels extremely similar and evokes the same good pleasure responses like playing any of those games, or reading a great rich fantasy novel.  Sure, graphics show it's age and are nothing to celebrate, but the updated UI and modern resolution support make playing it an enjoyfull enough experience and deep world-building and atmosphere are (so far) top notch and I don't see any truly meaningful differences in playing Inquisitor from reading Wasteland's descriptions, enjoying PoE's diverse dialogue trees, or being delighted by unexpected char perk from making some decision in Divinity.   Yes, I recommend it.  Cause it made me exclaim in tiny sweet delight for obtaining those before mentioned boots and for hearing an interesting story.. erm.. to boot. Cause I leveled up by two levels solely by killing bats around the first hub area. Cause I was then experiencing sweet 'agony' of choice - where should I spend the points - in stealth, or in thieving. Cause I got to be the medieval detective and because of it I got to hear at least 10 different ways of different people saying somebody had his   manhood/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥/genitals/Willy/unmentionables/...   stuck in his throat. Cause playing it I get the same feeling I get from (subjectively) the best game I've ever played - Fallout 2.
2179	1	a	A great game in a bad port.   The bad port comes in the form of horrible graphics settings and crashes. Fortunately I was able to find workarounds for these issues making the game less of a âbadâ port, and more of a âdecentâ port. The first thing you will want to do is download the DPfix mod which will clean up some of the graphics for you. This does not solve the issue with crashing however. My experience with crashing was that the game would always crash at specific parts of the game, usually at the start of a cut scene. By this, I mean that the crashes were not random. The game would crash, I would reload the game, and it would crash at the exact same spot again. I found a workaround, which involved running the game in compatibility mode until you pass the part that crashes then disable compatibility mode after you save past the crash. By doing this I was able to enjoy the game and complete it with only a few technical issues.  Now for the game itself. The game in my opinion has a great story and cast. The characters have developed back stories, and the game keeps you guessing as to who is guilty of murder. The main character is particularly interesting in his mannerism. All in all, this is a case of a great game that didnât have enough money for that extra polish.   I would recommend this game to anyone whoâs looking for a good 3D adventure game with an interesting cast and story.

Some glitches, havent finished the whole game and it can be difficult since it doesen't give you many leads on what to do or where to find, what to do. It doesen't seem to have a story to be interested in but a small story like this game has is enough since you aren't playing it for the story. Could use more freeroam but where you don't get so lost in the manision. This game is something worth the try!

421	1	a	To all atheists, and agnostics, this is actually a fun game. It would remind you of the Hitman series if you're familiar with it. The controls are a bit clunky, and the graphics are not bad per se, but the gameplay's nice. I wouldn't consider it a 'fun' game, though. There's no replayability, except when you want to get all the achievements. So, technically, the interesting aspect of this game is its story.   The death scenes of your targets are fun to watch, though.   Overall, it's a good game, not great, not bad. Just good. Also, there are not many games that focus more on Satanic references and all, so this is one of the good ones.  To all devoted Christians, nothing to see here. Move along.

211	1	a	Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)
1054	1	a	So this game is basically Crazy Taxi with flamethowers and machine guns but zombies and random mutant bosses get in your way. There's also a kind of pimp my ride aspect to it with the garage and the spray paint and stuff. I weren't expecting much from this but it's probably actually one of the funnest games I've played lately..
368	0	a	This game seems half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like they released an alpha and then just ran with it.
2254	1	a	This game is almost unplayaple. Not because the story and the game sucks but because of the crashes. This is a awful PC-port of a game. I would not recommend buying this with it's current price of 25 euros. If the price was like.. 5 to 3 euros you should buy this even tought you don't have a fat chance of playing this game trough without spending most of the time fixing crashes and bugs.  Still the story and Twin Peaks feels give this game my recommendation. Just don't buy this game with the absurd price of 25 euros.  EDIT: After 4 hours of fixing this game installing patches etc. it's semi-playable but remember to save freaking often because it will crash even tough you have done all the steps to prevent that from happening.
2524	1	a	This game is so horrible, weird and ugly, it makes you like it. I feel like I am being indoctrinated into some sick cult. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and similar stuff, you should try it. Otherwise, don't.

I really want to play this game, mommy!  NAH - it is soooo boring... We have 0 choices - we must kill exact as the game want us to do it. We must find / use the exact ducking (usually) small thing to trigger the events / the guide-notebook. Our powers are trash - they are just for triggering things mentioned above.  I hoped for some free play after completing 50% of the game. Then after 75%... maybe after 100%? Nah... I can't leave house and make a killing spree...     At least screenshots are nice?

807	1	a	Really loved the game, and obviously the fact of beeing son of the devil &gt;:3. Funny to play, average cutscenes, but not as interactive and 'free' as lucius 2 in my opinion, cuz you have to follow the rules and have limited space to work with. BUT, it doesnt prevent it to be a good game!  Probably a 8/10, and recommendable! :D
505	0	a	To be very blunt, this game was not what I was expecting. I was kind of expecting a sand box-y style horror game where I would be given mission(s) and could choose to fulfill them however I wanted, what I soon discovered was that this is more of a point and click adventure game, where they expect you to follow very specific rules and paths in the game. On top of that, the graphics suck, they are kind of outdated, like Grandtheft Auto 3 graphics and even on good hardware seem to have issues with frame rates.   Quite frankly, it's a massive disappointment.  It would have been amazing if I could go about killing the people in the house, how I wanted, with multiple endings and murders, but that just isn't what this game is like.   What's even more annoying is at the start of each mission, they usually give very, very vague hints and that's about it. I don't expect a puzzle to be handed to me, but when all you give me is like, 'I don't like this person' and that's it, it can become incredibly difficult.  The AI is also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to say the least. During the tutorial the characters mother spent the entire time simply walking up against a locked door watching me do the entire thing without saying a word.   it's not even remotely close to a 'open world' when not only are rooms locked off if you have no buisness being in them, but there are extremely specific guidelines for each mission you have to follow. If this were an open world, I should be able to kill the people, howeverr I want and this simply isn't true.   In short, a friend bought this game for me for Christmas and I am so very glad I didn't spend money on it, it's a waste of time and money. I feel bad my friend wasted money on this title. The developers had a real award winning idea here and they just wasted it with lazy design and production.

That aside the parts I've played were interesting, but controls are clunky and graphics are PS2-era at best.

( i bet that the same guy also created the story layout for this game...)  honestly, i expected not much, but even this low expectations got disappointed by this game.   dont buy it, i beseech you!

1335	0	a	This review comes from someone who played Amnesia before any Penumbra game, so make of that what you will. I'll try to keep this short.  I'll start off by saying that, on the technical side, the game is pretty darn good. The engine itself (as evidenced by its use in more recent games by Frictional) holds up very well to this day. Black Plague was released in 2008, so it's not incredibly old, but, in an age where I have to check whether or not entirely new games will actually run on my specific combination of hardware, I haven't had any trouble in the slightest getting the game to run. No crashes, no graphics issues, no slowdowns, nothing like that at all. The only problem that I have with it in that regard is that you can't change the FOV, but that's set  just  high enough for it to not be a problem for me, at least.  A lot of the game revolves around physics-based puzzles and they've definitely put enough effort in to make sure that the physics engine works as perfectly as it should do. Objects feel like they weigh as much as they should, moving objects around isn't a chore and the game knows when you want to put an item in a specific place and locks it there without any hastle or feeling like it's doing your work for you.  On the subject of puzzles, for the most part, they work well enough. The solutions are invariably completely intuative (no, you're not going to tie a balloon to a banana and feed it to a monster to get that computer running, you're going to find working drives and format them), and, on the off chance that the answer is simplified a little so that it doesn't get in the way of the game mechanics, it still makes perfect sense and there's a way to find out how to do it. As someone who frequently gets frustrated with adventure/puzzle games and has to turn the Internet off so that I don't cave and look up the answers (i.e. an idiot), I figured everything out for myself pretty quickly, save for one puzzle near the beginning which made sense in retrospect. The only problem I have with the puzzles is that many require finding multiple specific items, and, without fail, every one of them will be hidden behind a couple of other physics objects that are stacked in an odd and very conspicuous way.  Now, unfortunately, there are two very big issues that I had with the game that, while they weren't quite enough to stop me from playing, they are bad enough to me that I wouldn't personally recommend the game. The first is the story: the story of Penumbra: Overture, while not groundbreaking, was at least intriguing and subtle enough that it kept me very invested through the whole game. In Black Plague, that subtlety goes right out of the window from the beginning when it gives you a very clear and safe view of the new monster, then, sometime later, the player character develops an internal voice in his head whose main purpose seems to be to explain every plot point several times over in case you didn't pick up the hints. There were several times when I read something interesting in a note and got as far as thinking 'I wonder if that means-', then he'd immediately chime in and say that that's exactly what it means, please don't try to work it out for yourself. It honestly feels like Frictional realised that they could afford voice actors for this one and just decided to throw in literally anything that they could think for them to say, no matter how dumb or obvious, on top of the quality of the voice acting giving Bethesda a run for its money. I also counted four times in the first hour or so where the player character had the  exact same  realisation about himself. Add in how, for some reason, they decided to throw in an almost constant barrage of downright embarrassing attempts at humour (seriously, one computer asked if I was sure that I wanted to do something, then if I was  really  sure, then if I was  really really  sure...) and I got to the point where I just couldn't consider this a horror game anymore.  On that note, my other problem with it is that it really doesn't feel like a horror game in almost any respect. It's very dark (lighting-wise), yes, but... that's really it. It doesn't take long to realise that you're in almost no danger whatsoever. I think that I came across four things in the entire game that were able to hurt me, disregarding an obvious tripwire 'puzzle', and the very few enemies that you do encounter can be outrun, avoided, sneaked around and generally outsmarted with no effort at all. I appreciate the rudimentary stealth mechanics as a massive fan of the Thief series, but the enemies in Black Plague are exactly as intelligent as the dogs in Penumbra: Overture, which is to say not too bright.  In conclusion, I suppose that, if you just want puzzles and can appreciate something of an adventure/puzzle game in first person (some mechanics actually brought back memories of classic point-and-click games, but much better-polished), and can also tune out the excuse plot for those to exist, then I can definitely recommend the game because I enjoyed those parts a decent amount. If you're looking for a compelling horror experience, then, as far as I'm concerned, you're probably not going to find it here, although I've met people with a completely different opinion to mine. I'll also note that it's pretty short; it took me slightly over six hours to finish, but you get the entire Penumbra series for Â£7 at full price, so that's absolutely more than fair for that length.

Once you reach the hotel and walk into the cafeteria hallway, the sound will give out this blast of distortion that makes your speakers cry out for a quick death. THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES.   2. During the in game cut scenes, York will light a cigarrette, but somebody â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the animation so that when he removes the cig from his mouth, one will be in his hand and another will stay in his mouth.   3. The inventory menu is like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ minefield for crashes. The game crashed on me at least 3 different times when I checked my inventory for either a medikit, some food or just to see the map. The inventory screen will both haunt and mock you.   4. During the second part of chapter one, while you're in the hospital and you're about to wrap it up after killing 3 zombies who are armed with shotguns, you just need to walk out of the hospital and then a cutscene will start up and you've finished the section. What's the problem with this ? WHENEVER THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CUT SCENE STARTS UP, THE GAME CRASHES. Don't give me this 'windows 98 compatibility mode fixed it for me' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. It worked for me sure, except it took 30 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minutes to clear a 2 minute piece of game due to the frame rate drop!   5. Starting the game up in Windows 98 compatibility mode will prevent you from using a gamepad. Wanna use that nice comfy 360 controller you bought for games like this? Well don't worry, you can use the A, B , X and Y buttons. Oh, you want to use the thumbsticks? â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.   And those are only off the top of my head! I'm sure if I sat down and really thought about it, I could easily come up with 10 more!   I was really enjoying this game at first, but the bugs make it unplayable. I managed to make my way through almost through the first chapter but then the game would constantly freeze on me whenever I attempted to make my way through to my objective (the manor where the townspeople are to be questioned).   Many people claim running the game in Windows ME/98 will fix this. That much is true only half of the time. This theory works when it wants to, at other times however the frame rate will drop all the way down to 10 FPS (what's the point then?) . I searched high and low for an answer to the drop in frame rate and it seems I'm not the only one suffering from this. No answer could be found.   Seriously, this game is incredibly unique, cool and different. I wanted to play through this so much, but in its current state, it's just unplayable. It'd be nice to get a refund, but considering that the developers don't care about their customers, and trying to convince Steam to test the products they put up for sale is about as likely as the next coming of Jesus, I find this unlikely.   Again, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PORT. If you've got a PS3 or 360 just buy that version, I certainly know I will.

1401	0	a	This isn't the most horrifying game I've ever played, but definitely one of the most horrible ones. I really enjoyed Overture and I just had to play Black Plague after finishing it. And in the beginning I really thought it was better. But nooo, the developers had to introduce some really annoying things. It's nice that weapons have been removed, the were really unhandy. And not useful at all in this game - not because the new, scarier-than-the-Overture-dogs-looking enemies are dangerous. They're the opposite. They are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing slow. Just run past them, 5 seconds later they won't know where you are. Then there's Clarence. Some kind of demon who possesses you in the beginning and comments everything you do. I guess his comments are supposed to be funny. They're not. They aren't informative, they aren't interesting, but they are really long and distracting, sometimes they even block the controls so you just stay and wait until he stops annoying the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you. He even spoils the most 'emotional' moment in the game. The gameplay, too, becomes annoying. Try solving some riddles while having to run back to a hut every 10-15 seconds so you don't freeze to death. It's not even difficult, it's just extremely tedious. The riddles become really uninspired and in the end I mostly played by a walkthrough because I was done with this piece of crap. And lo, this ending! Instead of just staying on the 'horror' plain, the game suddenly ascends onto a pseudo-metaphysical plain which doesn't fit to the rest at all. I would've liked to laugh, but it was way too stupid.  I'm still going to play Penumbra: Requiem, but only because it's a 100% puzzle game without annoying enemies that just slow you down instead of making things more difficult.

2748	0	a	All I can say is: Stay away from this game. It's the single most broken, poorly constructed amateurish piece of technological garbage I have ever witnessed in my entire life.  If you're fortunate enough to get past the confusing launcher(that has absolutely no technical options whatsoever, restricting you to a control configuration screen that thinks 1 and 2 are 'RT' and 'LT'), you get to enjoy the seemingly 9 in 10 chance of encountering a crash before you even see the main character on screen.  Should you, against all odds, actually get to a fairly playable place in the game, you'll find that something as simple as drawing your weapon... Drops your FPS to about 15-20. If you can deal with that, good. But the game doesn't stop there.  I was unable to get past the first time the 'Profiling' prompt appeared. Why? Because the game encountered a runtime error. Really.   And while I realise many will say 'Oh, but Durante's fix will fix all this!', that's a blatant lie. DPFix is snake oil and causes more issues than it fixes. Running DPFix, I was getting several graphical glitches as well as several crashes.  I'll continue trying to get this functional, but this does not bode well.

You play as a boy named Lucius who becomes interested in his true calling, killing people. So you kill everyone in your household and after each kill you wake up in your bedroom in the night and Lucifer teaches you a new skill. You get skills like Telekenesis, Mind Control, Memory Erase, and more. Overall great game! Buy it! 8.4/10

1210	0	a	What a terrible game.  Firstly, the map has too many things I collide into. In a game like this, you'd expect to be driving around at high speeds, mowing down hordes and hordes. But no, instead when you navigate around you must take your time and try not to ram into every little thing! It slowed down the game so badly, and this has got to be one of the worst parts, since the 1 hour I spent was carefully driving slowly, so I don't bump into something.  What about the other 30 dreadful minutes I spent? Well, let's say it was just killing a few zombies here and there, but it wasn't exciting in any way. Just shooting them, drive away, shoot, probably run over them a bit, it wasn't too satisfying really. The bosses were also ridiculously hard for some reason, I just stopped though by the time I killed the 1st one, it was so boring.  Oh yeah, I completely forgot there was a story that was just shoved in, trying to interest you, but it didn't. At least they tried to make one though, but I would've prefered nothing.  I hate this game. I spent a dollar on it and I still regret my decision.
2804	0	a	As a game, I'd say it's good because of its story but as a product it is not. You will spend a lot of time to try to fix the problems that should've been ironed out before release and I don't think it's worth the time when nothing works as it should.

140	1	a	I just completed 'Lucius', and thought that there'd be no better time to write a review for it. In this game, you play the title character, a young boy called Lucius who happens to be the son of the devil. This is quite a departure from most other horror titles, and the effect it creates means that 'Lucius' isn't really a horror game at all, as you're implicit in the planning of all the atrocities committed throughout the story. The fact that it probably won't scare you doesn't mean that you will find it unenjoyable, though. 'Lucius' takes the form of a puzzle game, and a few action sequences are spread throughout the title; bear in mind, though, that the action isn't sufficiently frequent to appeal to someone who dislike puzzles and strategy. If you choose not to rely on walkthroughs (which, I admit, I did on a handful of occasions), you'll be spending a considerable amount of time riffling through drawers, shelves, rooms and cellars, looking for the various objects necessary for the completion of your mission. Your mission, invariably, is to eliminate the multitude of inhabitants and employees of Dante Manor. As you have the physical capabilities of a normal eight-year-old boy, you won't be relying on machetes, sledgehammers or firearms for your kills; instead, you have to use your environment. This complements the puzzle-based nature of the game, as, on occasion, the main challenge of your mission seems to be knowing just which weapon you should use. If you've seen 'The Omen', you've undoubtedly already drawn a handful of parallels between this game and the film. Whilst the acting talents of performers like Gregory Peck and Mia Farrow are sadly unreplicated in this uncannily similar game, you'll surely find enough interaction - whether object- or person-based - to immerse yourself in the world of Lucius and Dante Manor.

1953	1	a	Despite being more of an adventure/puzzle game than a survival horror game, it does what it does very well, very intelligent puzzles that at the same time aren't too frustrating. The story telling is very good and makes you care about character you may or may not meet, and builds up to an even better story/game which is the black plague. 8/10 because the enemies are almost the same throughout the game and are very easy to run away from which takes the horror elements out once you get familiar with them.
1381	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague is quite simply, a continuation of Penumbra: Overture. It might as well be considered one single game. The engine seems to be the same used in the first game, and most mechanics are identical. The atmosphere continues to be dark and creepy, with the addition of some new surprises that surface throughout. Everything is basically the same, with only the plot and storyline developing further. The one major improvement in comparison to Overture is the amount of thrills found in this iteration. There seems to be more action and more atmosphere overall, which makes the game more enjoyable, more creepy and a bit more scary. The story progression isn't as interesting or original as in the first game, but at least it has much more detail and much more depth. The voice acting also continues its high quality performances. Loading times are atrocious and much longer than in the first game, which tests patience. Some of the puzzles included in this game aren't as logical as in the first. The unintuitive puzzles are more complicated and mostly involve trial and error during a particular segment of the adventure. There are also more absurdly hidden items and mechanisms, which makes this game much more difficult in terms of its playability as an adventure game. There is also more interaction between the player and other characters in the story, which quickly dissolves the feeling of being a solitary person in a creepy and scary locale. The developers decided to get rid of the melee combat instances completely (found in the first game), which I agree is for the best and makes the game more tense and more fluid. There are way too many interruptions for plot development voice acting. Without ruining the experience with spoilers, I will say that these voice acting pauses occur almost at any given time, without a focus on storyline turning points. They can get a bit distracting at times. Not having the ability to engage your enemies in melee combat makes the game so much more tense and exciting. The ending is very good and adds to the story rather well. Penumbra: Black Plague is better than Penumbra: Overture in every way, as it corrected some of the developers' mistakes and made the gaming experience more enjoyable as a whole. This is clearly the best adventure game I have ever played; totally exceeding Penumbra: Overture. Once again, the game runs a little bit short, but I suppose it is of adequate length after all, since it is an adventure game with lots of theme and mood. I am now looking forward to the third part in the series.  Penumbra: Black Plague is good.

2858	0	a	I have no idea if this plays well or not. It runs at least, contrary to what others have reported. However, it does not recognise XBOX controller at all, there is no way to remap the keys, it has poorly dubbed voiceovers akin to a film originally produced in another language, the graphics are clearly directly ported from something like a ps2 with no way to increase resolution, and (one of my all time pet hates) there is no way to turn off subtitles. For some not being able to use a controller OR remap keys might not be a deal breaker but since I am left handed the whole awsd extended map is a complete btfk for me. Even at 90% off I would advise you not to bother.
588	1	a	To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.  Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.   Grab this game when it's on sale!
2107	0	a	It says it's an indie game made in 2012. Yea 2012 B.C. maybe. I say that because I am extremely confident that a better game could be drawn on a cave wall. Got this in a bundle with some much better games included. This is complete garbage. Like an incredibly bad ripoff of Diablo 1. I understand they were probably going for an oldschool look and feel, but this is just horrible. The worst graphics I have ever seen, almost no real combat animations to speak of, no health or mana regen lol, horrible and bland and god awful in every possible way. It doesn't even deserve to be held in the same regard as some of the worst games of all time because it doesn't even qualify as a game.  -100/10. Yes you read that right, negative one hundred out of ten. Maybe if they work on this for a couple more years and release an actual finished product then okay, there you go, a real game. Rather than a day one combination of the worst brainstorms from a team meeting that took place in the span of fifteen seconds then was programmed in the span of fifteen minutes while they were blindfolded punching in commands with their keyboards turned upside down and the lights turned off.

But you should wait for a sale more like for 1.49$ or something - 20+ Hours if you explore look for secrets and simply have fun with the mansion -Creative ways to kill -Lots of details -Nicely optimized -AI is kinda good... -You're a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing demon and a son of Lucifer how cool is that?!

DAFUQ AM I SUPOSED TO DO HERE  -LUCIOUS LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥  -BORING CHARACTERS! -THIS ISNT A HOUSE BUT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MAZE -CONTROLS SUPPORT SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWFUL -WHAT AM I SUPOSED TO DO WITH THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DEMON POWERS THEY HAVE NO USE AT ALL! Conclusion: But either way It's a nice game,but avoid this â¥â¥â¥â¥, 69/100 just because there is a nude scene ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) and It's nice for a chil after playing all those FPS and head exploding games.

476	1	a	Did you like Hitman?  If answer is yes, then get Lucius.  If answer is no, then bog off and go back to The Sims.  Why is it similar to Hitman? Accident. The safest, the hardest, but the most sophisticated way to get rid of someone. Let no shadow of suspicion lay on you. The farther into the game, the more powers you possess and they stronger they become. Use your hiding skills, use items, use devilish powers to achieve what your 'Father' tells you and don't get caught. Even if they find you, you still have a chance to escape. How? 'Father' teaches you how to trick weak people to act according to your will (or rather His will).  Anyway. You are Devil's disciple and you have to kill your targets. Area of your actions isn't big - it's a manor. 3 floors. Several people. Each must be killed in a specific way. Lucius is a very linear game. You can't choose targets and means to kill them. Your task is to figure out how to achieve this predicted result. You have the 'tools', sometimes you have to find certain items, but in general you have to play in a specific way to set things (sometimes literally) in motion. Push them over railing. Kill them with an icicle. Burn them... and many others. Souls is what you need.  Satan is your Master and you do what he says. Please him and bring him more souls.  Graphics is fine. Sound is fine. Music is nice. Location is ok (a bit empty at times). Mechanics is simple. Story is good. Pacing is ok.  So what's wrong with this game? Very linear. Little replay value. Simplicity.  As with every game you expect to play it more that one time or at least offer something more on another playthrough. That's not happening.   My suggestion is to treat Lucius like and point and click adventure game (just this time happening from 3rd person perspective). Those don't allow second playthrough as they serve all they got in first playthrough. Try to figure out puzzles on your own. If you like stealth, puzzle and adventure genres then Lucius is a good choice. It is a solid game overall, but nothing else.
910	1	a	Recommended. You are a child who are just turned into 6 years old, and you will receive a 'guest' during your birthday. You will then slowly learning, and control your evil power which is bestowed/awaked from that guest.   This game is very puzzled though. Some clue might appear on your note book. I only plaued and completed chapter 2 (during this review) and it was a good game, and satanic.  7/10 for now.

I asked for a refund because the camera movement is crazy and makde me feel ill. I haven't ever gotten that feeling from a game before but Zombie Driver HD got me feeling sick. So buyer beware!
245	0	a	A great concept completely ruined by some of the worst gameplay decisions I've ever seen. First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it. The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target. In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).  To make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place. These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight. You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.  You're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol. I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending. The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.  I really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea. The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun. Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it. If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle. Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.
2686	0	a	Great game. Terrible port. It hurts having to not recommend this game, because this is one of the best games I've ever played, but this port is unacceptable. It crashes randomly and it's riddled with game breaking bugs like AI NPCs not doing what they're supposed to making certain sections unbeatable (Nick's car not moving when you have to tail him and the final boss bugging out making it impossible to beat).  It's not worth it. Play it on PS3 or XBox. I paid next to nothing for this game and still wasted my money.

908	1	a	Truly a messed up game. You play Lucius, son of Lucifer in a house of people who were once your family. You need to kill them all for Lucifer to harvest their souls. Maids, chauffers, deputies, family, no one is safe from this messed up 6 year old. It's a VERY linear game where you need to kill people in a certain order and a certain way for a scripted event. Some deaths are very gruesome like the nailgun to the back of the head. It's a very mature game that's almost a puzzle game. A very interesting take on The Omen film. It's not a great ache but it's not bad. It's 20 very short chapters, will take you no less than 7 hours to finish this game. If you just want something to hold off your satanic killing/assassinations... this is a decent game.

2964	0	a	This game is amazing! It's almost like they took Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, and cast him individually as an FBI agent investigating a small town murder with a Silent Hill twist.  Unfortunately, you have to jump through hoops to get the game working, and god forbid you have 5.1 surround sound!  Unfortunately, going through the process of fixing the game, the game is still incredibly bugged, and is borderline unplayable. If this game functioned, I would give it a 9/10 (some gameplay elements are laughable). However, the sad reality is that you may end up wasting your money buying this game, especially if you are not persistent and willing to play through the many crashes that truly break the game's immersion.

2022	1	a	INQUISITOR! Yell it out in a funny accent that nobody in the living world actually possesses, and you will feel good about yourself. Do it over and over, because this game is really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good. It is extremely well written, something that makes you not give the smallest nugget that the excellent story is making up for the lower-grade graphics. INQUISITOR! (roll the R, roll the R) has the most refreshingly original subject matter I've seen EXECUTED PROPERLY in a game for a long time, and the actually mechanics of how you choose to solve the cases and mysteries you encounter are so far from anything else I've seen in what is essentially, a classic-style isometric RPG, that INQUISITOR! stands in a league of it's own to me. 'Why haven't you played 300hrs of it then?', I hear you ask. Well, it's because... IT'S REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HARD. My first playthrough I decided that I would try something a little different from what I usually do, and knowing that 'mages' are always the hardest class to keep alive, I set it to easy and picked the monk. Wrong choice. I died so many times I lost count and found myself quick saving every time I killed ONE of the plethora of monsters out in the wide world. The only reason I persisted was that the story was just THAT good. I played along long enough that the little deamon that lives in the back of my brain kept saying, 'If you're the good guy and you're torturing people for confessions, imagine how much fun it's going to be siding with the devil!' And so that is what I did. And it was glorious. And made me feel a little bad sometimes. But I got over it. If you like a challenge and you're looking for something really FRESH in the world of RPG's, buy INQUISITOR! You won't regret it.   OOOOOOO! There's a 'No' option for recommendations now! Time to review Sanctum of Slime...

If you have ever dreamed about racing a taxi with rocket launchers into a zombie mob, pressing fire, and driving through a fireball of epic proportions, then this game is for you.   I would suggest buying an X-box controller for this.   Drink for this game? Mountain dew, mixed with vodka and a dash of lime, with a spoonfull of strawberry jam.

Found the game can only be played at 720p, forced resolution, no way around that using the vanilla game software.  Tried DPFix to change that. All ini file parameters were WELL within what my PC and vidcard can handle, which, for this game isn't a heck of a lot. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Did the PhysX reinstall again.

2503	1	a	Let me tell you something about Deadly Premonition. The controls are clunky, and driving, being maybe half of the game, is a nightmare. The character animations are awkward and at times terrifying. The squirrels make public-domain monkey noises and the fast travel mechanic (if you get it) is punctuated with a cartoon car crash sound. The voice acting ranges from actually enjoyable to god-awful. Half of the time, the game crashes or won't let me load my saves, and I had to download a patch just to get the game to run at over 720p.  This might be one of the best games I've ever played. 'Twin Peaks: The Game' is an accurate description for the storyline -- Except York could challenge Agent Cooper one-on-one with how downright charming he is as a character. If nothing else, play for the story and the interactions between the characters; this game has some moments that are truly hilarious, and some that are just completely off-the-wall, and the end has a twist that will make you want to replay to truly understand what's happened. True, you could just watch a Let's Play on Youtube, but in doing so you'll miss half of the true charm. The side-missions, while infuriating, and the long monologues York has in the driving sections are really the cherry on top of this sundae of dysfunctional oddity. This isn't a game for everyone, but if you do like it, it's like this game was made for you.  In short: This game is awful. I love every awful moment of it.

2832	0	a	Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks. Sounds freaking AWESOME, don't it? But let's take a closer look...   Your character is an FBI agent, who has frequent conversations with some imaginary (?) person in his head. This would be a fascinating enough idea...except that he does it RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE, and no one flinches an inch. He drinks cup of coffee after cup of coffee just to read the tea leaves at the bottom...in fact, one of the main, recurring 'side-quests' of the game seems to be the eternal quest for a cup of coffee. And when he finds a cup of coffee, or a tin of pickles (branded 'The Pickles' on the label, not bizarrely at all I'm sure you'll agree), we get a spooky little tune to, er, remind us that this is supposed to be a spooky-arsed game even if nothing particularly spooky has happened for the last half-hour of gameplay. WEIRD, maybe...there is weirdness aplenty...but the spookiness is a little more on the sparing side. At least as far in as I have played this game. Maybe I'll try and play it again some other time, but for now I need a break 'cause, quite frankly, MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HEAD HURTS. Sincerely.   Here's some of the other madness you'll encounter, should you be brave enough. There's wooden crates, in various public places. You can 'push' them. But instead of pushing them aside to reveal something, like in, say, the early Resident Evil games, you just push AGAINST them until they shatter under the sheer Herculian strength of your besuited character, sometimes revealing cash. Cash you can use to buy live worms and a fishing rod from the strange old lady who runs the huge hotel where no one else is staying, so you can nip out to the back of the hotel and catch yourself some fish. To eat, I presume (I didn't quite muster up the courage and/or patience to try this theory out). There's a couple of bars in town which you can apparently visit, one of which is called...wait for it...The Galaxy Of Terror. Which appears to be an oddball reference to the semi-obscure 80s horror movie of the same name, which I guess is meant to tie in with the recurring thematic of quirky low-budget 80s horror films which is fleshed out further in the conversations our protagonist has with himself/his split personality whilst joy-riding around in a police car which he has freely been given the keys to (along with the apparent permission to blare sirens, beep horns and run into other cars with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever). I mean, c'mon...I love The Deadly Spawn from 1983 as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I need to hear the name of its director and fascinating little tidbits about it having a completely different crew to its sequel, while I'm supposed to be driving to a police station to find out some information about a murder victim. Whose file has been lost by the nerdy, quite possibly homosexual deputy who then spends hours looking for it while you can pop downstairs for a quick nap in the cells (to replenish your 'tiredness' meter, of course...there's a hunger one too, hence the aforementioned coffee and pickles and fish and, er, lollypops and crap like that as well). Next thing I know, it's 5pm and the police station decides it's closing time - 'come back tomorrow' - and while I'm driving back to the hotel after an amazingly productive day of stealing freshly-made cups of coffee from unoccupied hotel rooms and completely failing to find out ANYTHING whatsoever about the ONLY murder case the sleepy little town has had in eons from none less than the police department, I decide to stop by and investigate a completely random letterbox outside someone's house and find some pistol ammo in it. As you do. Oh, and there's at least five or six cops in the police station at any one time, and if you try to talk to the majority of them your character decides that 'This person probably has nothing to do with the investigation'. I guess they must need all those surplus cops to do traffic duty in a town with absolutely no bloody people in it, and couldn't possibly spare the manpower to contribute to the solving of a perplexing and incredibly rare murder case...   What...you're STILL reading this review? Okay, should I mention some of the technical problems then, like the fact that the mouse is INSANELY oversensitive to the point where your character spins almost 180 degrees with the faintest movement of one's hand - running around is a particularly enjoyable chore herein - even once you reduce the mouse sensitivity to its absolute minimum, which you can only do in the game's launcher, meaning you have to exit the game to perform such a privileged function? Ah, look...seriously...I'm done. I don't even want to think about this any more. Like I said, I HAVE A HEADACHE. I wanted this game to be good. It looked so much like my cup of tea...er, coffee...er, t-tin of pickles...   Oh man, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight. And not the type which I WANT games like this to give me. I'll probably be wandering around an endlessly huge and empty hotel searching for warm beverages and canned food all night. I swear to God, if I develop yet another bloody psychological quirk from this game, like never being able to look a tin of pickles in the face again without suffering a nervous breakdown, I am going to SUE THE DEVELOPERS. I just wanna go to bed, and maybe cry myself to sleep. I can't take it any more. I'm sorry. I just can't...I just can't...  Verdict: 4/10.

2310	1	a	Remember the cult 90's show Twin Peaks? Fantastic series, and this game holds up well as 'companion media' to the show. You are put in the role of Francis York Morgan, an FBI Special Agent who is dispatched to the small country town of Greenvale to work on a homicide case. As the game progresses York becomes involved in the town's sinister affairs and realises that things are not as they seem.  The game plays a lot like an actual investigation. You will go to gather evidence, interrogate suspects and follow leads. The game world is open to you with no time limit, so there's nothing stopping you from enjoying what Greenvale has to offer!  The game's story is its true strength. The characters, locations and subplots adds to everything that makes the game 'so bad it's good'. A terrific game to play if you're interested in Twin Peaks or The X-Files.

2168	1	a	Deadly Premonition: The Directorâs Cut is a strange beast. This horror game plays like resident evil or silent hill, but feels like Twin Peaks. The game is absurd, terrible, weird, stunning and basically the closest thing to art video games will ever be. The story involves an FBI detective who talks to himself and is rewarded with cash for each card of medal he collects as well as any headshots he performs. He loves headshots. You talk to people, like these weird kids and you collect items to use on things, like this fuse box. Lollipops and donuts can recover your health.   The game takes on a wider open world feeling later on and between missions you return to this home base of sorts, to get more incomprehensible chunks of plot thrown at you. This game is weird to say the least, but I dig the vibe of it all. You certainly donât know what it will throw out next. Make sure to grab DPfix, from the maker of the Dark Souls resolution fix, it lets you play the game beyond the 720P default.  Watch the video review on youtube in Steam Shots EP125

Controls are clunky &amp; driving is nearly impossible with a joystick. I have to swap movement with the D-Pad &amp; lightly press it for turns because it's so sensitive. I don't know if I'll ever really finish this game because of the terrible controls.

3014	0	a	I love this game, but this is a ridiculously horrible port for PC. Crashes render the game unplayable and there are no simple, or heck, even hard fixes that deal with the issues. Unskippable Intros and Cutscenes make crashes even further infuriating. I could not use a controller due to the buttons defaulting to unusual key bindings and not all of the buttons can be altered. The start button was on the Right Trigger. I doubt we'll see patches that deal with these problems as well. I recommend buying it on a console, or watching someone on the internet play it for you, and save yourself the annoyance.

879	1	a	An entertaining puzzle game with a unique concept. It's actually a lot of fun and features some great music and controls! However, the second half of the game becomes lazy with the puzzle design, almost as if the product was rushed. Also, you are forced to murder people in specific ways while being restricted to a small environment to explore. Get past all of this, and there's still a solid game underneath.
202	1	a	Quite enjoyed this game, twas a good Saturday distraction. I managed to get 55 of the 58 achievements in under 10 hours, while also finishing the game with both endings. The remaining achievements were the running one, which I did while getting the laundry chore done (got lost enough! hehe) which I managed the following day within a half hour, and the other two were the time-based achievements (play for 20 hours and play for 40) which I'm still on my way to getting.  All in all, a very enjoyable game, though don't expect open-world, it's very scripted. This doesn't take much away from the experience though, and there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had from engineering the needless deaths of those around you.  Top story (though the acting/script could be better) and worth paying attention to, it does however give you the option to skip the cinematics (which I only used once I'd seen them already and was doing replay for achieves or random fun).
1932	1	a	This game is one of my favourites. Due to it's release date, the graphics are dated, but I do not find this to be a poblem. It is a very dark, crepy game with a great storyline. Some of the story may not be perfect, and objectives can be unclear and hard to complete. Over-all, I loved it, but it is not perfect. From me, it still receives a 8/10.

1666	1	a	It's likely most people played Amnesia first before trying this, and, going in, they will find a lot of very familiar mechanics. The crate-pushing, object-throwing, drawer/lever-pulling, and wheel-turning physics and puzzles were all here from the very start. And, for the most part, they work pretty well. 'Most of the time' because, well, there are times when it becomes a hassle, as they still hadn't a completely polished engine and had yet to implement features that would make things less hassling. There are quite a few doors, mainly the heavier ones, that can be fussy to open or shut, turning wheels is more of a pain here than what it'd be later on in Amnesia and, worst yet, no rotation function. You know those stacking puzzles that involved crates, barrels, planks, or similar objects of some variety you needed to use to reach certain areas? Sometimes they'd be in a position that made them not ideal for stacking, until you found you could hold 'r' and rotate the object around until they were optimal for climbing. Unfortunately, here, if you have to stack something (which isn't too often thankfully) it's a matter of throwing and bashing them around until they are positioned how you want them. So what is the 'r' key used for here, then? It's 'interactive mode,' which allows your cursor to move freely about the screen, turning off mouselook. A very useless function I'd say.  Now let's talk about your light sources. You have a flashlight which uses up batteries which you'll find occasionally lying around throughout the game, a glowstick which has unlimited use, albeit a slightly shorter range than the flashlight, flares you can throw to light the way, and even a weird sort of blue-tinted 'night vision' you get from moving around while crouching. So yes, light sources are near-endless, and considering that the game is actually fairly well-lit a good amount of the time, you likely won't find yourself using these often, even at the recommended gamma level (either 1 or 1.1 works). And when you DO need light, I found myself just using the glowstick. It suited my needs just fine without a flashlight and can be used infinitely, making the flashlight somewhat pointless. And that's another flaw, for a game that takes its namesake from a type of shadow, treading through dark places is hardly ever a concern, especially since you don't play a nyctophobic yet until Amnesia a few years later. Making light a more precious resource would definitely have given the game some edge.  So with light and darkness not being an issue, the main challenge of the game is navigating its large open spaces and avoiding patrolling attack dogs, with a couple other enemy types you'll encounter occasionally too. The dogs here are aggressive and persistent, and can even climb stairs (how about that!), so you either need to be very good at stealth, hiding behind dark corners and waiting until they walk the other way, or, if you want to take a riskier but perhaps in the end easier-on-you approach (since you'll be backtracking and wandering around a LOT, trust me), you can fight them off. This would be the first and last game of Frictional's to feature combat, and it's probably for the better. The game is notorious for having terrible fighting mechanics, and not without reason. Your main 'weapon' will be a pickaxe, which you use by holding down the left mouse button and swinging it in the direction you want it to go. The problem besides it being slow and awkward to pull off, is it's also imprecise, short-ranged, and of little help against your much faster opponents who will often attack in groups of more than one. There is a supposed exploit where you can just stand on a box and kill the dogs that way, since they cannot reach you, but I found they just avoided me altogether when I did this. What IS nice though is there is more than one way to take out an enemy. For one, you have explosives, such as the occasional dynamite to collect or plenty of pressurized gas canisters you can hit with a hammer or pickaxe, throw them over and cause an explosion (good if you can time them right), or just say 'screw it' and pick up a big heavy object like a rock or a barrel and repeatedly throw it at the enemy until they stop moving (I found myself using this tactic more than any of the others). Later in the game there's even an area where, if you're good enough, can trap a dog and blast hot steam in their face until they fall over. It's satisfying, but a pain, to pull off, so throwing heavy crap around may be the way to go.  The second most common enemy is the spider, and they perhaps are the most annoying by far. They are this game's 'tiny enemy that hops everywhere and is hard to hit.' Every game that wants to annoy you has to have one of these things, right? Like Castlevania and its stupid fleamen. Anyway, the spiders are a nuisance and you encounter them mostly in tunnels you crawl through, and since you're unable to run when crawling they are all the more aggravating. And they often come at you in packs! Very wonderful. Usually you'll see a batch of eggs where if you get close they'll hatch and hop right in your face. If you think you can just throw some dynamite in a nest to kill them, nope, that'll just hatch them faster. The enemy that will cause many a death and headache for the player. The last enemy you face (won't spoil it) is much, much rarer, cannot be killed, and is Frictional's first stab at a panic-inducing chase sequence, and it's executed well I have to say. You never see it coming, and there are at least a few things you have to do along the way to slow it down if you want to survive.  As for 'plot,' there's not much of it per se but you do gather a lot of background information through notes, a tradition Frictional would proudly continue onward after this, some listing procedures, a lot of them clues for puzzles, and some chilling accounts of some terrible events that happened and the last things written by the people documenting them. The actual story, followed with Black Plague of course, starts with you receiving a letter from your father, presumed dead 30 years ago, with instructions to burn items contained in a lockbox, which include a map and other cryptic documents. Instead of doing this you head over to the map's marked location, leading you to the mess you're in, good job! There is also one other character you communicate with (or, rather, he communicates with you since you never answer back) via radio transmissions named Red, who occasionally offers direction but mostly goes off on insane tangents (and as you find documents of his and read more and more about his plight you will understand why), the game's one truly memorable character.  The one aspect this game excels at I believe is in its puzzles. Not exceptionally difficult but thoughtful and logical, and some maybe more challenging than what's in Amnesia. My favorite is the explosive mix you have to concoct, and gently carry it over a precarious chasm, risking blowing yourself up if not careful. There is definitely a lot of 'put x item on y thing' inventory puzzles, some requiring tons of backtracking through confusing, repetitive maps with few landmarks, but on the whole it's all very well-executed.  Not a particularly scary game, a few moments aside (more under-your-skin creepy, which is still fine by me), and can be clumsy and frustrating in the worst of times, with the annoying combat mechanics, stealth and friggin' SPIDERS, with some dull map design and too much backtracking through them for my liking. But despite that is it still worth a go? I'd say yes, with its innovative designs, great background story if you have the attention span for note-reading, &amp; well thought-out puzzles and atmosphere. Recommended for Amnesia fans who've yet to play this and curious as to the company's start, and fans of atmospheric horror games in general.

2041	1	a	You stand at the precipice of eternity, the darkness ever encroaching. You must keep the faith, less you be lost to those who bear the mark of the beast, orcs, Murderers, rapists, beastmen, or Daemons who've found their way into our world through the fornification of men with the great enemy.  'Trust no one, not even yourself. It is better to die in vain than to live in abomination.'  Inquisitor is an old school journey through a 13th century world beset by the ruinous powers of Satan, himself. It is your task, to root out this evil wherever you may find it, sparing no tool in your mission to defeat the depravity you will encounter. The breadth of your search will take you from small hamlets to great metropolises, but do not be fooled, evil cloaks itself both in stygian shadow, and obfuscates the less than stalwart gaze with the glow of the light.   May God be with you, nothing less will suffice.
1931	1	a	I have seen several let's plays of this game and now that I have played it myself I have realized a few things. -Compared to Amnesia: the Dark Descent the controls were a little sloppy (for me at least), if not, it was at least not the most efficient set up. (Now this isn't so much as a negative system, but it might be too efficient causing to no longer be efficient). -The only story of this game is: get through the mines. Now while you traverse the mines and caves you get hints at what the next game will hold. Red also explains what has happened and what is still happening. Now ... to actually get or say this has any plot to it: you have to read the notes, and listen to Red. -Another comparison to Amnesia: the Dark Descent is in this game you almost never have a time of absolute darkness to where you cannot see in front of you.  -Although the puzzles were good and some were very easy; unless you have seen someone else, have maps of the game, or even have a walkthrough ... there are no initiatives for directions of how to work the puzzles (although Red does help a little it is very easy to miss his times of speech especially when being chased or if you are in hiding). There or the 'To Do''s but unless you have clicked on something that requires reminding, it is very unhelpful/useless. -Now this game is the first commercially released game that Frictional Games has done and therefore deserves a high rating of amazement from an avid gamer to the company. I definitely recommend this game to others who are looking for a game to play.

'Twin Peaks is about an FBI agent investigating a murder in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. It's a mystery, but mostly a character drama. What would the player fight in this game? There's not much action in the show.'  'Zombies.'  'Ok...are we going to explain to the player why there are zombies?'  'No! I don't wanna! Let's just make it so the zombies are only visible to the main character. That way we don't have to explain why the rest of the world doesn't know there's a zombie apocalypse.'  'So every combat section of the game takes place inside the players head?'  'Yeah. Head zombies.'  'Got it. So how does the player get around?'  'It's open world.'  'Like GTA? You can drive?'  'Yes, except you can only drive from a first-person view, you can only drive certain cars, and they'll each go an incredibly slow speed and flip over all the time for no logical reason. Oh! And the cars will include an incredibly small gas tank that you have to use in-game money to fill up at the one and only gas station in town.'  'And you can go anywhere?'  'Sure! Except if you get out of the car in areas where we're too lazy to implement pathing or textures we'll fine you for being stranded and magically teleport you to a random location. And - I almost forgot - there are invisible walls everywhere.'  'Nice touch. Gotta have invisible walls. Will there be a fast travel system to avoid all the monotony?'  'Definitely. But we'll lock it for most of the game until the player completes an obscure side quest.'  'Why obscure?'  'Well the side quests will only be available depending on the weather conditions. We're implementing  dynamic weather .'  'Oooooooooo.'  'Yeah, buzzwords. But since it's weather and the player obviously has no control over it, they probably won't encounter any sidequests on their own. They'll be basically impossible to find without looking up. Did I mention there's a time system too? And the side quests are also dependent on that? It complements the weather.'  'That's so real. Just so real. Can the player control the time at all?'  'Well they can sleep, but only at pre-designated areas that we'll make sure are very inconveniently placed. And if the player doesn't want to sleep, we'll make them! If they stay up after midnight the zombies will come out and attack the town!'  'I thought they were just in his head? And you know vampires are the monsters that come out at night, not zombies.'  'Don't question my inconsistencies! We'll also make the player tired if he doesn't get enough sleep. It'll slow him down and eventually start draining his health. The same for food. You have to eat. If you literally do nothing and keep the game running you'll die in under an hour. Just like real life!'  'So the player has to manage food and sleep levels, with a limited inventory and only specific, far away places they can rest or buy food?'  'Exactly!'  'This game sounds truly awful. There's no way I'm going to play it.'  'Oh I'm not going to play it either. But we can still sell it: just call it  art .'   On a meta level, the PC version has all the problems Dark Souls did: terrible graphics, awful mouse support, and constant, ever-present crashing. You're going to need third-party hacks to even get it to run. In the process of getting my 100% playthrough the game crashed over 100 times (yes, I started counting). Developers: shame, shame on you.  At one point I had a save file that would crash exactly five seconds after I loaded it. I almost gave up at that point. Luckily I discovered that sprinting inside prevented the crash, and I happened to be only about four seconds from a door.  How I wish I could get the hours spent playing this back, but I wanted to give the game a chance and by the time I realized it was never going to explain anything or get any better I was so far in I figured I might as well finish it. That's a lesson in not trusting my own instincts early on.  The story and setting are so close to Twin Peaks that I think there might be a legitimate plagary case here. Additionally, it's like the creators of the game don't understand storytelling fundamentals, writing dialogue, or even how to make games fun. Your arsenal includes weapons with infinite ammo, and despite the bad controls that simple fact makes the combat trivial. It seems like such an odd choice to provide infinite ammo but then make the player have to manage food. It's tiresome and does not add to the believability or realism of this utterly unreal world. It's like this game was trying to combine every genre: third-person shooter, open world, adventure, survival horror. But in the end it did all of them poorly.  This isn't groundbreaking. It's not art. It's just bad.

If you're into a tablet port where things go splat - great, here's your game. Enjoy, splat some zombies and have fun. I don't doubt that you'll have fun as this is a fun game - just not for me.

That being said it's one of my most favorite games ever released, horrible PC port though and that makes me sad, the games quirks all come together to make a very compelling story, finding out who did the murders was a thrill ride up until the very end. I'd say, if you can don't buy for PC but if it's your only option look for bugfixes, it's honestly a solid bar of gold under all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on top of it. Rarely will you find a game as great as this one.

1911	1	a	If you're looking at this game, it's most likely because you've heard of or played the famous Amnesia: The Dark Descent made by the same developers. Penumbra: Overture is Frictional Game's first game and it definitely shares characteristics with Amnesia.  The mood and style of the game is similar to Amnesia. The lighting and eeriness of the locations set the tone of places you'd rather not be at. Notes are scattered throughout the game, providing background history of the places you travel through. The game is also physics based, but unlike Amnesia, you are allowed to have weapons, which does suggest that there is some form of defense. However, the physics nature of the game requires the player to manually swing melee weapons by moving your mouse back and forth. Nothing quite as fun as swinging in panic! In addition to these, there are quite a bit more puzzles to solve, but nothing that is frustrating and some have satisfying complexity.  If you're buying this game thinking you'll get the same experience as you did when playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent then you will be off the mark. While it does share Amnesia's atmosphere of horror, its level of execution isn't the same. A play through the game shows that a lot of thought went into finding ways to instill fear into the player, but it's unable to maintain the same pressure throughout the game. If you want to get the same scares as one would get playing Amnesia, then you'll be disappointed. But if you're interested in playing a horror game or seeing Frictional Game's earlier works, then it's worth picking up this title.

2599	1	a	Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.

265	1	a	An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.  The good:  - Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use  The bad:  - A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck. - Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all. - Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..  Definately recommended
374	0	a	I haven't played this game for very long yet but from what I have I can tell I'm utterly annoyed the controls, the way the menu works and the amount of bugs.  It's sad because the concept is good. I like the idea of playing as a kid who kills people and has the ability to contact with the â¥â¥â¥â¥in' Devil but...this game didn't put it off very wel. I certainly won't stop trying to enjoy this game but I won't recommend it at all.

2891	0	a	Unfortunately Zach, I just can't recommend this game. Sure, it has some of the goofiest writing I've ever seen, and the music seems to become inappropriately cheery in scenes where a murder has just taken place, but this port is awful. It crashed at least 15 times in my playthrough, sometimes well after my last save point, causing me to lose a lot of progress. The DPfix mod helps make the game look decent, but the game itself is just way too unstable. Get the XBOX 360 version if you just have to see what all the fuss is about.
72	0	a	I wish I could write iffy reviews. Because this is a game that will infuriate you with it's bugs and lack of a save feature but then make you laugh at all the stupid voice acting and goofy death scenes.  A lot of the times the missions will be vague and you *will* need a guide.  Sometimes your interface will disappear on you and not come back until you restart the whole game, and you can't save.  There's no first person camera so get used to the back of Lucius' head blocking everything.  But if you can look past all that, the game is still very amusing and atmospheric.

Cons: - No plot at all (you are basically a paranormal serial killer) - No logic involved in many puzzles. - Huge mansion, small essential objects to collect not easy to spot quite often. - No AI. Just bots walking up un down predefined paths + some triggers. - Extremely linear game:  * Puzzles have 1 and only 1 solution, if you miss a tiny object in the corner of a room you are simply stuck till you spot it.   Overall: - Dull, repetitive, frustrating paranormal serial killer simulator. 'Avoid this game as hell, the power of the Christ compels you!'

608	1	a	I would recommend playing this game, it's very good in my taste! I loved the main character plain and simple, the graphics were good, and there were plenty of neat ways to kill people. One of the bad things is, any kind of hint the game supplied such as the notes in your notebook weren't that helpful about 30% of the time in my experience. There were also more than enough bugs/glitches to even count, which most of the time ended in a game over or just simply resetting the level and doing all of that stuff you FINALLY accomplished all over again. But my main pet peeve about this game was that the telekinesis power was EXTREMELY hard to use. Things would go off into random directions or the item itself that you were trying to move will just be stuck in its place.  Other than physical game problems (bugs, glitches, mechanics, etc) both endings were just terrible. I appreciated the alternate ending feature, but both endings consisted of almost the exact same gameplay content at a ridiculously difficult level lol. Worst part about it, there was only a slight difference in the ending cinematics. Both endings in general were not creative at all. When I played the first, it was 3/10. The second one I'd give maybe a 5/10. Although my review sounds more negative than positive, I do like this game and rate it above average; my critique in endings of anything is always picky anyways lmao. But over all, the story and characters intrigued me the most, so I'd give it a solid 8/10, probably would play again! :^)

957	1	a	Zombie Driver is the same for the top-down car racing games as Zombie Shooter is for the isometric style action-RPGs: mindless fun offering you hours and hours of entertainment while ridding the world of a horde of zombies!  You play as a taxi driver who is entrusted by the government to complete certain tasks during a zombie outbreak. The story is nothing special but some of these missions can be very exciting - sometimes you can use a tank to just destroy everything that's in your path but even with the taxi cab mowing down hordes of zombies can prove to be satisfying.  While story mode can get really boring (you should mainly play it for the money) Survival Mode puts you in a much smaller area and makes you the target of never ending zombie waves. The longer you can survive the higher score you can achieve and you can compete with your friends on the leardboards.  Furthermore, in Blood Race you have the opportunity to compete against other drivers controlled by the A.I.   This game offers long-lasting, solid fun! You have machine gun, rocket launcher, flame thrower and even a rail gun at your disposal to wreak havoc!  This is a highly recommended game!
2742	0	a	Good game IF you can get it to work which i cant
1726	1	a	 Penumbra Overture , the prologue of the series, sets the atmosphere for its sequel, as you are put in Philip LaFresque's boots who decides to take a trip to the desolate northern Greenland, after receiving a post-mortem letter from his father. As expected, this experience will turn into a nightmare for Philip as he will find out more than he would have ever wanted or imagined.  The game has a nice pacing as it progressively introduces you to new elements in its story and gameplay, making it an enjoying and not time-consuming horror survival experience. We can also notice this early Frictional Games' passion for creating a good story, riddled with a deep psychological theme (even more noticeable on its sequel).  A true classic of the first person horror survival games. Revolutionary. Unsettling. Recommended.

1314	1	a	One of my favourite games ever,much better than the first and while not as polished or as scary as Amnesia I prefer it since the theme of a secret facility and abandoned mines are much more interesting to me than the usual haunted house/castle in Amnesia.    This Game continues from the first and the story is still a intriguing,mystifying and scary story,better puzzles and harder too since you are usually in danger while doing them so you are distracted and might do them in a shaky rushed way.The gameplay I feel is slightly more refined and the physics system is still innovative.   Since you can't fight back and the enemies are quite fast so the best method is to hide in the shadows terrified the infected with the flashlight will see you and bash you in with a crowbar.  Still a staple for any horror fan,cheap too even bundled with overture.
210	1	a	Ever wonder what it would be like to play the villain? Or need a good game to vent some real life frustrations on? This is definitely the game for you. This is a beautifully designed and rather well written dark parody of classic horror movies and video games. The story itself could take you anywhere between six to twelve hours of gameplay to beat depending on how well you fair in puzzle games. It does focus a lot more on puzzles and stealth, but has it's action moments. This game is definitely worth a pick up and play when you are bored. Personal Score: 7.5/10.

2520	1	a	This game is polarizing. You either love it or you hate it. The pc version has a kind of cost at entry, where you have to root out various bugs and hindrances in order to play unaccosted. once you get set up and stabalize it however it's pretty good. This is probably the single greatest example of making good on incredibly low budget. Deadly premonition was originally a ps2 game which was bumped up in scale before being released for the xbox and ps3, this means that it has a lot of the quirk and 'jank' that you get from old school ps2 games with a larger scale and length.  Over all Deadly Premonition is an exercise in video game weirdness, the merit of the game comes less from the plot or gameplay and more from 'Wow look how weird this guy's character model is when he's smilling' or 'pffft that zombies running sideways.' Kind of a more eloquent goat simulator.  This games charm is impossible to describe, so for reference go and watch the 'two best friends play' of deadly premonition where they will constantly and in detail describe why the game is REALLY GOOD while also looking terrible.

1273	1	a	I won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra series.  Black Plague is the second of their three-part Penumbra series, but in this man's humble opinion it tops even their most successful of games.  Yes, I said it. It's better than Amnesia. Now before you get to the hate let me just say that I adore Amnesia. It introduced me, as it did so many others, to Frictional Games' work. But once I finished it up I wanted more. I was lucky enough to see this package come up during one of Steam's classic Halloween sales and decided to snag it. For some reason or another, I started Black Plague first, and I couldn't have made a better choice.  This game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notes. But this one does what I hope Soma (Frictional Games' next title) will do again - make a great story.  I won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investment.  I highly recommend this game.
1527	1	a	The roots of Amnesia are undeniable in this standout entry from Frictional's sci-fi series. If the first part was a cautious walk the second is a full-tilt run: tighter narrative, better graphics, excellent level design, evocative sound, great enemies and even better physics puzzles. It also has the distinction of being a game that effectively crosses genres from mystery to horror fantasy to existential sci-fi and even buddy comedy on whim (granted the 'buddy' is a psychic tumor). Admittedly Penumbra isn't an entirely frightening experience for the fact that the antagonists are a vulnerable batch of evil aliens (similar to Metro's Dark Ones). It absolutely has it's moments though, particularly the unseen creatures taking residence in the Kennel's long, dark hallwalls and the moment you're locked in with a person that's just succumb to infection. Bringing up the inventory or reading notes in real time also adds a tremendous ammount of immediacy to the proceedings (try fumbling through your pockets to heal while enemies are searching for you and you'll see). There is a third episode but it's a forgettable platformer which adds nothing to the narrative, nor the impressive ending, of Penumbra. Black Plague takes the sterility inherent to puzzle games and injects the kind of story and mood you'd never really expect it could have.
254	0	a	I'm on chapter 4 of what, 20, and I'm through with this game's crappy control, annoying music, boring, linear gameplay, bad acting, bad animations, bad AI.

2311	1	a	As much as it's ugly, clumsy, buggy, dated technologically and features some dull combat sequences that belong to much older PS2 games, none of its flaws are at all worth avoiding it for. Deadly Premonition features some of the best characters in gaming in the last 15 years, some fantastic and funny dialogue, a moving story, and some of the weirdest atmosphere you'll ever see. Where it fails, it somehow only enhances the experience. And where it succeeds it soars. It's completely and utterl one o fa kind and every gamer should play it on any platform they can find it on, because there's just nothing else like it. When your time comes to a close, you will so deeply miss York, Zach, Emily, Greenvale, and every looney in it.

109	1	a	Lucius is a psychological horror stealth game developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global for Microsoft Windows. It is centered on a six-year-old boy, who is the son of Satan. Players take control of Lucius as he murders members of his household, using powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that lead to the deaths of multiple residents of Dante Manor. Players use their wits and follow hints to ensure they do not leave any evidence that would lead to a mission failing.
1591	1	a	 Penumbra: Black Plague  is the second and longest official installment of the Penumbra horror epic. It begins immediately after the end of  Penumbra: Overture , with the protagonist, Philip, awakening in a locked cell, having been incapacitated by an unknown entity.   Black Plague fills in the sketch of the story begun in Overture, eventually unveiling the truth of the hidden facility disguised as a mine in northern Greenland, the method behind the madness of its inhabitants, both human and bestial, and finally Philip's father's dark secret.  The game far surpasses its predecessor in the vastly increased level of terrifying surreal elements: in Overture, I was mainly running from spiders, hiding from mutant wolves, and being stalked by a madman. By contrast, in Black Plague  I waded through pools of blood to manipulate monstrous forearms growing from the walls and was forced into hallucinatory visions by a foulmouthed mental hitchhiker while fleeing for my life from disease-infested monstrosities.    Gameplay-wise, Black Plague keeps the best aspects of Overture, and improves, refines, or discards the worse. All of the immersive, horrifying elements that made the first game an indie hit are maintained, along with environment-oriented puzzles and physical interaction via manual manipulation; Overture's clumsy combat mechanic has been completely removed in favor of more trap-based encounters with hostile creatures.   By modern standards, the game is a bit graphically dated, but the writing and the ambience were more than enough to keep me fully immersed ( and fully tensed ) as I explored the hallways of the facility and the dark passages of Philip's mind.  Penumbra: Black Plague is a psychological horror classic, and I recommend it to all fans of the genre.

Except that you get lost everywhere Except that the autosaves are at the wrong place  So if you like horror games, start with Amenesia the dark descent. Then if you liked this game and want some more, crawl the internet to find mods. But don't play Penumbra.

I didn't buy this for a while because many reviews spoke of mainly 2 reasons that made the game frustrating: 1) A lack of autosave means you have to do the WHOLE level again if you get caught. 2) It isn't clear what you have to do, and you spend forever wandering around trying to find or use the right item.  What they don't mention is 1) a level lasts 2 minutes when you figure what to do and, bar 1-and-a-third levels, you can move freely around your mansion. 2) You're given many clues, but there's always Google for when you derp. I HATE doing the same thing over again, even just backtracking, but this never happened.  Another common complaint is the linearity, but the way you have to kill them is often the logical choice. You're supposed to cover up your kills, so the game just letting you shoot everyone would bore as well as defeat the point. (Lucius 2 would go on to prove this point according to all those reviews.)  It falls down at the final part/ending, it's a bit awkward, but overall it's a fun, quick game. While some things aren't amazing (voice acting, cutscene animation, music use), it should be noted that this unique game came from an independent developer from Finland, so I give them leeway, and it's not bad anyway. Best of all, they actually care about their players. I'm reviewing their final, polished version. When there were noises that the finale was disappointing, they made a thread on Steam and asked for feedback and if people would like an alternate finale, then added one (it's a bit better).  Be that creepy mute kid who follows people around on his tricycle down hallways. It's a right laugh.

2019	1	a	As stated earlier, potion drinking simulator. This game has a really bad combat system, companions are useless and are only used as meat shields.   9/10 writing - very well written 9/10 plot - very easy to like, a lot of twists and secrets 9/10 atmosphere - feels dark, bloody, demonic as intended 3/10 combat system - potion drinking simulator, really not what you're going to look for in this game 6/10 sound is satisfying - nothing out of the ordinary

1960	1	a	The best in the series I think. The game is by far one of the most fear striking games I've ever played. Name any other horror title - Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Condemned, The Suffering, FEAR, Doom, Clock Tower - None of them compare to what I felt playing this for the first time.  Your pride is on the line for this title, buy it, and don't think twice.

1720	1	a	...it may be a quickie, but the interesting story, creepy atmosphere, and complex puzzles make for a great little horror game. Although, if you're going to play, be sure to grab the next two installments because this one will leave some questions unanswered. I can't wait to dive into Black Plague!
2502	1	a	Have you wondered what would happen if you replaced everyone in RE4 with ham actors? Well wonder no more cause that's what Deadly Premonition is, delicious ham acting. Yeah there are times that the voices would change tone mid-conversation, and the driving is pure-crap but that's ok the story makes up for it so much.   9/10 wish it had less bugs  P.S. You shoot a tree with moving hands, just so you can get a hand shaped doorknob.
2356	1	a	After living through the best 42 minutes of my fledging adult life I've come to the realization that I've ecountered the best single experience one can dream of.  Within this nearly 3/4 of an hour of bliss I've witnessed grotesque horrors beyond my mind's capabilities, dialogue AND monologue worthy competing of Shakespeare's best soliloquys. The life like animation engaged me on not only an emotional level but that of a spiritual one as well. The picturesque enviroment had me on the verge of tears in terms of sheer beauty; the amount of love the developers put into making every drop of water in the lakes and every leaf on the trees shows their commitment to the art that is VIDEO GAMES. The subtle yet numerous pop culture references to movies and films also shows how up to date and hip this studio is. The sound quality and level of fidelity to it is in of itself amazing, the character's voice actors really engage each other with passion for the roles they play.   In short this game is the Citizen Kane of Schindler's Lists' and is truly deserving of being called art. if it was any more perfect I'd need to check myself for testicular cancer. I can't enjoy anything else now, this was the top and it'll be downhill from here on out.  9/11 it was an inside job worth making.

2349	1	a	Zach needs COFFEE! 8/10 3$ game. Totally worth 3$! If you like horror games then you might enjoy this. Oh and you can shave your face.  People say this is a bad port and it crashes. I haven't had one crash yet. Maybe a sugar crash but thats about it.  Beware this game has alot of cut scenes!    
2509	1	a	It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.  If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.  Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.  That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.   So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.
1212	0	a	this game got my confused i always wanted to PLAY a zombie theni bought this and i get just automobile, you never get to see driver is he realy zombie or not?? so huge let-down for me..
1013	1	a	This game is a really great new twist on a classic style of game. The old game series where you'd fly a helicopter around, saving guys with your ladder and fighting enemies all over the map as you did little missions.  It's like those old games but with a slightly customizable car selection and zombies. Grab it if you like zombies and see it on sale, it's a very fun smaller title.
906	0	a	The controls made this almost unplayable, I wish I could have used my controller though it would have only helped slightly. You move so slowly and if you try to run it goes crazy which makes manuevering around very hard and disorienting. I saw potential but I can't play this game with these controls...

1303	1	a	Huh! Unlike the console horror stylings of Overture, Black Plague feels more akin to, say, System Shock. A combatless System Shock! Does that make sense? Maybe not.  Anyway â the writing is surprisingly light-hearted and comedic than the first game or horror games in general. One particular character is basically writtten like a devilish, sarcastic Stephen King antagonist. That may or may not be to your liking. Humour tends to spook away the horror.   All in all, I appreciate how they went a different way with Black Plague, and in its way this is an extremely worthwhile game in a world where sequels tend to tread same ground.  REQUIEM, though... so, you know how sometimes there's like a '10 new levels!' or a 'time trials expansion' pack to a story-driven, self-contained game?  Yeah, Requiem is one of those and it's sort of a snore. Basically, it's Penumbra: Aperture Science â nine boring 'hit the lever' puzzle stages with a fourth-wall breaking female computer voice cracking jokes on someone's behalf. Art assets seem to be recycled from the earlier Penumbra games and their scrapped content, and the ending doesn't really relate to the main game story. It's basically a crock.
321	1	a	I'd say the movie 'The Omen' was an inspiration for this game. You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Killing staff members in your giant mansion while 'Daddy Lucifer' occasionally visits to give you new gifts. Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in. So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed. The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level. But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.
2435	1	a	Absolutely terrible port! No graphic option, not even resolution. It has a crashed a lot of times for me.  As a game I have mixedfeelings. First impression was a low budget game with terrible writing and voice acting, yet for some reason I kept playing. The story got somewhat interesting and made me wanna see the ending. Halfway through the game the story just takes a turn for freaking weird. It's a shame cause it had could have been a very interresing story.  On the gameplay side there are a lot of things wrong with the game. The driving for one is abysmal, you would have more luck driving concrete then cars in this game. The shooting is a bit so so but entertaining enough. There are a lot of sidemissions which are basicly all very short and very boring. The writing of some of the dialogue can be absolutely terrible, whilst the writing of the main story is not to bad.  Oh and make no mistake this is not a horror game not by a long shot! It's more of a murder mystery game, yet it's so weird it's hard to follow what is actually going on.  Still even in all it's flaws I would recommend trying it.  6/10
601	1	a	So much reverb.  Best played muted while listening to a horror soundtrack playlist on youtube.

Otherwise fun game, I still recommend!

241	0	a	A great concept completely ruined by some of the worst gameplay decisions I've ever seen. First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it. The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target. In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).  To make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place. These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight. You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.  You're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol. I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending. The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.  I really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea. The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun. Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it. If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle. Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.

1594	1	a	This game concludes the first. It uses the same excellent mechanics system that I've fallen in love with and has a much more intriguing storyline to boot.  This time you come face to face with a virus and you get to play the events out as the virus takes over. I'd say that this was less scary than the first, but once again, there were moments when I was hopping out my skin.  I forgot to mention the puzzles in Overture's recommendation - They were clever, and Black Plague carries on the same style puzzles.   With this game you also get the 'epilogue' Requiem. I've been told not to think of it in the same way as the other two Penumbra's, but as its own game. Currently, I can't and therefore it was a touch disappointing, but once you've completed the main story you may as well see the epilogue of it, and frankly, I'm glad I did.
2912	0	a	Silent hill 2 if it was directed by Tommy wiseau.  For someone who loves investigation games, this was far too goofy, and you can find out who the real killer is the moment you meet him.
1605	1	a	The second entry of the Penumbra series, Black Plague forces you into an even more disturbing and frightening situation than before. More puzzles and environmental hazards abound as you attempt to find your father and escape this forboding place, and the game gets much more difficult from there. Your ability to fight back had been lost, which makes your attempt to survive against un-dead-ish human beings and a gaint worm much more difficult. Your very psyche becomes a battleground in the game, making it an even more engaging and distressing experience. Much more horror and atmosphere makes this a much more enjoyable (if that is even a good word to use) than the previous Penumbra installment. If you like this entry, be wary of buying the next and final episode.
802	0	a	I want to like it, but the puzzles are far, far too vague. I'm not expecting hand-holding, but once through the tutorial there is precisely zero guidance on what to do next, it's not obvious from context. If you like having to work out literally everything about a game through trial and error, this is the game for you. Otherwise, move on by, nothing to see here.

1290	1	a	If you took Portal and turned it into a survival horror narrative you would have the Penumbra series.  Penumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd installment in the series and the best hands down. The heavy focus on exploration, lack of weapons, brilliant level design, ambient sound and fantastic voice acting make it a well rounded experience that paved the way for games like Outlast and Amnesia: The Dark Descent (this studio actually made that game).  If you love horror you owe it to yourself to play this. People who assume horror can only be jumpscares will laud FNAF as a 'masterpiece' but that game looks like a sunny day at the park compared to the viscreal scares of Penumbra: Black Plague.

2756	0	a	Was really hoping to love this one, as I'm totally into weird kusoge heavily inspired by Twin Peaks, but I was so taken aback by the blatant misogyny all over the place that I haven't touched this ever since I finally picked it up. Just seems like the weirdest thing that nobody ever mentioned this to me and I had to spend money to find out for myself. So in case you're wondering, yourself, there it is. Now gamers can vote my review down because I didn't evaluate it completely or objectively or whatever (die, nerds).

2609	1	a	Deadly Premonition is weird. that is true. it's also eerily close in themes and plot to Twin Peaks, a show which the creator of Deadly Premonition claims to have never heard of. The graphics are uncanny valley, the writing seems purposefully enigmatic and strange, and the plot seems right out of an episode of the X-Files while still trying to play itself straight. But these are all reasons why Deadly Premonition is one of the greatest mystery games of all time. Engross yourself in the culture of a small american town as seen through the eyes of a japanese videogame developer. Take control of Agent Francis York Morgan as he reads the future in the clouds of his coffee, and shoots plant zombies while wearing a bright orange suit. Get paid by the goverment for shaving. And most of all, embrace the weird, and you might find yourself seeing the game for the piece of art that it is.
361	1	a	I never thought being the child of Satan would be good fun. I do have a few problems with this game, but would recommend it overall. I feel like some of the achievments are a bit ridiculous and time-consuming, yet aren't fun. (Side note: I have been trying to get the music box achievment and still cannot get that even though I am sure I am right.) There are some things in the game that do not run as smooth as I would like, but this is an older game so it is actually kinda impressive. Just be careful using your tricycle because you might get stuck in a wall. It happens, no big deal. Some of the voice acting is a little cringy, but the gameplay itself is pretty fun. The story isn't exactly award-winning, but it doesn't totally suck either.   TLDR: Game isn't bad, and it fun but I personally would not pay full price for it. Achievements are annoying at times. Game itself, ignoring achievements, its entertaining. Not the best game, not the worst.

2012	0	a	Drink all the potions, run away to slowly making it to the edge of the map where you can fast travel (seriously, leaving a dungeon midraid is such a pain in the â¥â¥â¥), so you can buy more potions while unloading all the useless crap you picked up, so you can go back into the dungeon to drink more potions while braving hordes of orcs. Oh, and don't forget to repair your equipment. Just one more tedious aspect of this game. The whole inquisition/investigation thing is interesting, but the automap and quest log aren't very clear about where things are. This makes for a lot of aimless wandering, looking to see if you missed an NPC. I also recommend knowing how to pick locks, because bashing open a chest or a door takes forever: your character frequently misses (it's a door, how can you miss it?) and does little damage. Also, once you turn down a quest you can't take it back up again. So if you're a roleplayer, and you turned down a quest because you didn't think your character would care that some dude's wife is missing, you won't be able to start investigating her once it appears the missing woman is actually at the center of a sinister conspiracy. If you liked Diablo, you may enjoy this game. But it's not that great.

2900	0	a	I thought that Resident Evil Revelations was a horribly generic version of Resident Evil but this game takes the cake. Made in 2009, then re-released in this HD version in late 2013, it looks, sounds, and feels like a game from no later than 2005. The graphics and character movement are basically updated versions of controls and graphics from Resident Evil 2/3. The graphics look a thousand times better in the screen shots on the store page than in the actual game. I bought the game because it looked good in the screen shots but boy was I wrong. Thankfully I only paid $2.50. But I do not judge the overall quality of a game based on graphics, although it certainly does suck when the graphics suck. The character and enemy movement, shooting, melee attacking, effects, everything feels much, much older than 2009. However I am not really complaining about it just pointing it out, because obviously a game that was released in 2009 for only $20 at the time does not exactly scream high quality. Either way, it should be technologically advanced to that year, not take a step four years backwards.  The shooting and melee attacking feels very stiff and generic. Enemies being hit by your bullets/weapons is just laughably generic. The sound is forgettable and the music is ear bleedingly bad. The music that plays while talking to people in town during cut scenes sounds like music straight from an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Much of the cut scenes are unnecessarily padded with total nonsense like âman this biscuit is good. Where can I get these in town?â âwell actually I um... I baked them myselfâ. Or pretty much the entire conversation with the old lady at the long dinner table early on.  I would love to give the game a further chance but I am without doubt that it will just get more silly as time rolls on. I do not expect it to get even the slightest bit better, especially since I have already seen how horribly generic combat and character movement are and those things simply cannot improve. It is also not a pure survival horror game. It is about 50% adventure, 50% real game. I separate âreal gameâ from âadventureâ because adventure games do not have real gameplay. In an adventure game you just walk around and find clues and objects to use later and talk to people and watch a lot of cut scenes. This game has a ton of that. It is not too much of a gripe though considering that when you do get to actually experience combat, it sucks as well. The real deal breaker was one of the worst problems I have ever seen in a game: when I got into the police car to drive, a terrible, ear piercing screeching sound was playing looped nonstop. I checked the forum and it is a sound glitch that can be fixed by setting your speakers from 5.1 to stereo. I do not care what game it is, I am not going to go into the control panel to redo my sound setup each time I switch to a certain game. And besides, my speakers are configured to 5.1 but I have a audio control panel app for my sound card that lets me switch to stereo, headphones, or whatever, and I had it set to headphones since I was wearing headphones while playing the game so who knows, who cares. If it is something that I had to actually set to stereo in the control panel sound setup options for speakers, there is like I said no way in hell I would ever do that for any game, and would never have to for any other game for that matter. Only this one, no thanks. So that horrible sound problem sealed the nail in the coffin for this game.  I realize it has a cult following, and it is not a horrible game (besides the seriously unbearable sound screech problem when driving), but I do not see the point in bothering with something so barely decent when many much better options exist for your time to be much more well spent. Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, and Revelations are all far superior games and are all available on steam. So with those games and a few other survival horror games out there also if you look, there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time with something as heavily mediocre as this.  Painfully generic, 5/10

2863	0	a	I really wanted to play this game, after having watched a full LP of it. It really seems like a unique experience, despite its many many many apparent flaws. However, after an hour or two of launching, tweaking, relaunching, browsing numerous forum threads, and generally throwing everythign I can think of at this thing, I CANNOT get it to function properly, be it running with a decent framerate or even properly recognizing my controller's analog sticks and d-pad (standard 360 pad). Even after trying every downloadable fix, and recommendation, I have not been able to play any of this game, so I obviously can only recommend you stay far far away from this particular version. If you want to check it out, get it on PS3 or 360. The devs deserve none of your money for this non-functional port.

2580	1	a	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
2243	1	a	This is a terrible game. The controls are wonky, the actual gameplay is repetitive and it's full of QTEs. The PC port is a total disaster that barely works, crashing every 30 minutes and lacking basic 16:10 monitor resolution support, meaning I played the game with everyone being rather more skinny then they should be.  This is also one of my favourite games of all time. In every other way it's indescribably magical. Playing this game is like a religious experience.

2677	0	a	'It can't be that bad!' I thought. 'I'll try it anyway!' I thought. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC! It is a nightmare of technical issues. Experiencing the game this way should be considered an absolute last resort. You can get it in Xbox 360 or PS3 without the crashing or hours of bugfixes that will render the PC version borderline playable.  Third party graphical enhancements SHOULD have made this the definitive edition of the game, but it is far too unstable to be worth any money at all.

But they are lying to us , Zach . Your life is too short to spend so many hours figuring out how to make the game not crash at lunch Zach. Your backlog is too long to waste so many hours of your life restarting your computer because the game locked up at random . And the inventory Zach , the inventory menu is a death trap - it will freeze your game , always and forever Zach , without fail. All your quirks and weird tonal shifts can be enjoyed in LP form, without the frustrating hurdle of trying to play it zach .

1311	1	a	Penumbra Black Plague is an improvement over its predecessor Penumbra Overture. Instead of fighting random animals, you will encounter mutated humans. Unlike the first game, there is no possibility of combat against them. You are defenseless against them, upping the ante on terror and suspense. The music is still excellent and the controls are solid once you get the hang of them.  This particular package, Penumbra Black Plague Gold Edition also includes the final game of the trilogy, Penumbra Requiem. Unfortunately, it is the worst game in the series -- easily. In this game, I never felt any suspense but mostly frustration because it was loaded with convoluted puzzles (the worst part of the series) and completely lacking any monsters, therefore no sense of being followed (the best and scariest part of the series). I didn't feel a need for wrapping things up with the main character's storyline, which is what Requiem does essentially. Requiem's biggest sin is the fact it centers around the main character completely as opposed to continuing the plot from the previous game, leaving no room for any scary moments whatsoever.  Overall, this game is worth the purchase. Personally I think the series ended well with Black Plague, as there was closure in its conclusion. But if you want to play the whole series for the sake of completion, go for it!

2142	1	a	I had originally played Deadly Premonition on the 360 during May of 2010. I was visiting my grandmother and was out with the family at Best Buy, where an uncle of mine was considering getting a printer. Being the dork I am, I went to go check out the video game section, and there were a few copies of Deadly Premonition lined on the shelves. The cover caught my interest as a horror fan, and the cheap $20 price tag sold me on it to make a blind purchase. When we got back from our day out, I put it into the 360 and started to play.  The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition, and something that has remained true, is that I love its soundtrack. A few select tracks are used maybe a little too often, but the music perfectly fits the odd tone of the game, and is pretty damn catchy. Even as I am writing this review, I find myself humming a few of its tunes. This is a case where the soundtrack isn't just good, but is a big part of this game. I am convinced the game may not have been as well received by as many if it didn't have this off-kilter soundtrack that really gets you into the mood for the oddness the game throws at you.  The next thing I and about anyone else will notice is that this game looks dated. It's something of a miracle that a game in this graphical condition was released as a published disk-based console title in this day and age. It looks dated, but then controversially I would say the look fits the game. It sort of sets you into a set of expectations for the sort of game you're about to play. This may be backwards logic, but if the game had looked amazing I feel a lot of people would of found the actuality of the game to be lackluster to its looks. And as the game goes on, the odd facial expressions and clunky animations become very amusing. Notably, the Director's Cut does update the graphics some, but honestly its hardly noticeable.  The rest rolls from there. The controls are a bit awkward, but you adjust. The first chapter isn't all that great, but it gets better. And before you know it, you start getting hooked into the game. I know I did. And it's the type of game you want to talk about.  Heavily inspired by Twin Peaks (to a point in development the game got in legal trouble for far too many similarities that they had to change it, back when the game was known as Rainy Woods), the story follows the same basic premise; An FBI agent goes to investigate the homicide of a local high school beauty in a small pacific-northwestern town, but the town has a darker side the FBI agent discovers as he gets deeper into the case. The town is Greenvale, and our character in Deadly Premonition is Agent Francis York Morgan (but just call him York, that's what everybody calls him), an offbeat FBI agent who solves cases through odd measures, particularly of note in the fact he uses a system he calls profiling (that basically results to magic to figure out what happened by collecting clues), and see's shapes and messages in his morning coffee and newspaper that gives him clues to things to investigate. He also talks regularly to some unseen person named Zach. Many will quickly put together that 'Zach' is actually York's way of talking to the player, who only he seems to realize is watching everything, and who only he interacts with.  Deadly Premonition has unforgettable characters. York stands out, as the player really begins to form a connection with their odd agent, but the rest of the cast are just as good. The likes of Emily, George, Thomas, Mr. Stewart, Polly, and the rest of the colorful cast will last with you long after the game has been completed. And the story legitimately begins to get gripping. Like the rest of the game, Deadly Premonition tells an odd tale, and honestly some of what occurs in the game is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow you'll legitimately care what's going on. That is when you're not laughing your â¥â¥â¥ off, as the game is somehow both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious at the same time.  But it's more than just that, this game manages to actually be touching, and I found myself more emotionally involved with this game's story and characters than most any other game I've played in the last few years. And while I don't want to get ahead of myself, the last few hours of the game's story are unforgettable. Saying bye to York and the rest of Greenvale is up there as one of the hardest things I had to do as a gamer upon coming to the close of the game.  Deadly Premonition is not just, 'so bad it's good' (though definitely parts of the game are just that). The game does some things absolutely wonderfully, really stellar and uniquely. But it does other things terribly, absolutely horribly. It has flaws, a lot of them. But somehow most of these flaws become strangely part of the whole experience. They sort of blend in with everything else and become part of the overall experience of Deadly Premonition. Not everyone will like Deadly Premonition, but the title since I've played it has taken on a fairly big cult following, and for good reason.  Deadly Premonition is more than the sum of its parts. The game has obviously a lot of heart in it, and it shows. But it also is loaded with flaws, and that also shows. But somehow, the heart put into this game and the elements that make it amazing shine above the cumbersome driving, or the glitches the game has, or the fact the game has a few annoying QTEs. The term, 'experience', in games gets thrown around a lot these days, but this truly is what Deadly Premonition is. An experience.   And it's not a short one either. The game should take someone 15-20 hours to complete the first time. To do the side-quests easily adds another 5-20 hours (and you should do the side-quests, they're rather fun and most all of them add additional cutscenes and character depth, plus some of them reward you with handy items, like quick-travel or a weather doll or infinite ammo weapons, or even just new cars and suits).   The PC port has plenty of flaws. There are many fan-made work around's and patches made to help, but these still exist. I was lucky that I didn't run into much, but the game did crash a couple of times for me, and there's this weird thing with the game where the longer you play it without closing it and re-launching it, the slower over time the FPS will get. It's hardly a perfect port, and some will definitely be turned off by this.  But it's also definitely the best version of the game. And if you haven't experienced Deadly Premonition before, you definitely ought to at least give it a try, maybe stick around for the coffee.  Deadly Premonition is not a masterpiece in a traditional sense, and it's too flawed in ways to be named a good game (maybe okay at best). But Deadly Premonition is probably one of the best gaming experiences you could have that's released in the last few years. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll be hit with feels, and you'll panic. When all is said and done, we need more games like Deadly Premonition. It's the mid-tier game in one of the purest forms, flawed and arguably bad, but with so much heart and enjoyable elements you may not care, and hardly any game will put a smile on your face as much as DP does.

This has many missions and a great character list. In the first mission alone you get to trap a maid into a freezing meat locker and freeze her to death, and that's only a tutorial on how to play!! I love this game and I would love to play it more, I'd give this a 7.5/10
1638	1	a	This was an amazing game. First in the series, I enjoyed this game very much. I found that the graphics weren't all that great, but the gripping story made up for it. You play Phillip, unaware of his surroundings who decides to venture out and regrets his decision almost immediately.  I thought the story for this game was great, the audio was great and the general atmosphere of the game was phenomenal.   A great buy and a great series

Every single different one I have had to use a walktrhough BECAUSE the interactions with items are NOT PREDICTABLE AT ALL. Sometimes you can pick up shovels, but in the next level you cannot. Why? I don't know, probably because the makers of this game wanted to make all the puzzles complex, but had to save space. I do not recommend this game for anyone who does not enjoy having to use walkthroughs and tear out their hair trying to figure out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ levels. I've been stuck on a level for THREE WEEKS. This is absolutely ridiculous.   Don't make your puzzles so complex and elaborate IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FORM OF STABILITY IN THE INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR ITEMS, JESUS CHRIST.

346	1	a	Lucius is a horror game that combines stealth killing like from Hitman games with puzzle solving but will you want to play this game ? In Lucius you play as Lucius who is the son of the devil. On his Six birthday Lucifer Grants Lucius powers but in exchange for souls which Lucius has to deliver to him by killing his fathers employees. So how is this game ? Overall Lucius is a very fun horror game. Now first the atmosphere is great. The entire game takes place in a mansion which is really confusing to navigate but theres alot of stuff to see and explore another thing thats really cool about this game is to figure out the ways that you need to dispose of enemies. You keep a journal which tells you about the victim and his or hers weakness which sometimes helps and sometimes doesnt. The game also has some illogical puzzles but just minor stuff and thats pretty much it. And plus this game takes inspiration from the Omen so you can practiclly say its Omen The video game. Overall its a really good game with a few small problems. I give Lucius a 7/10

2712	0	a	I can't believe I've put up with this torture for more than 30 hours. Probably the half of it was spent for just getting the game run properly. I've seen all kinds of glitches, e.g. crashing, freezing, broken image, stuck in a corner, etc., etc. I tried DPFix and various kinds of attempts, none of which worked definitively. I am not complaining about the story and contents by themselves, but this is arguably one of the worst implementations of a console game. It's amazing how many bugs the devs could cram into this and still managed to think the game is playable.  No, I won't play this again. (I was supposedly in the last chapter.)  P.S. Also, the game behavior is affected by random things like monitor resolution, which makes running this game a kind of black magic. I regret I've run out of extra sheeps to sacrifice.

966	1	a	-ZOMBIE DRIVER HD REWIEW-  This game is not bad.There is long Story Mode Stages and Blood Race Mode Cup events to get some action and Slaughter Mode to teste your drive ability and experience in this game.If you have gamer soul you can't get bored while playing this game.  Different Cars to drive and you can upgrade them that sounds good.Also you can try to reach high rank at leaderboard on all stages and modes like you want but i need to warn you i said ''if you have gamer soul you cant get bored white playing this game''before.Yea its true but this game is kinda slow like not a normal race game or different category car game maybe cause it's a 2nd person strategical driving game that makes it slow i think  So is it worth to buy it? Maybe yes or no but you can try it anyway if you liking to climb leaderboards in different games   Drive to your best score Good Luck :)  My General Point To This Game:5/10
259	1	a	I fixed it so I could see the mouse, but it'd be nice if it could go fullscreen boarderless.
196	1	a	Pros. Nice graphic unique gameplay Need to think first before act Unique story  Cons. The stealth thingy feels stupid bug.lot of em even in the last fight you must restart the game more that 3 times.  Be aware that this game are full of satanic thing and gore if you can't stand or get triggered by that kind of thing then don't buy it,But if you like those thing i reccomend you to buy it because it can turn on your inner psychopath feeling  Overall 8/10
383	1	a	it has a pretty bad storyline, but if you want to you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with stuff in the house
233	1	a	I didn't know what I was in for when I got this, but I was in for a treat. The game does lack in action, gameplay, and replayability... but it makes up for it in storyline and fun.  The basic idea is that you are a little boy who is evil, cold, and heartless. Your goal... kill your rich family and its employee's. It is done by solving puzzles and making it appear like a tragic accident.  Unfortunately once you play/beat it... there is no alternative methods to really kill your objectives so its really good for one run through. It can be creepy and you might need a guide a couple off times...  But if you want to run the gambit of a child murder horror game... this is it for you. :-D (FYI - Gore, Nudity, and Cold Hearted Death.)

724	1	a	I first seen this game on Pewdepie. (who else) It took me a while to get it. I used a shiity laptop to play the game. It runs around 30 fps at max on low setting but it is playable, just get at least 16 GB and a 980 Geforce to play this on good settings. The gameplay is a Hitman like clone but with no body draging and less freedom to do whatever. The Powers are only used in a certein place in the house. The playable charater is cool and I can't help but root for him. The game does have a game breaking bug that happens in the end of the game but it could be my PC than the game. The music is great and ok sound too. Voice acting is â¥â¥â¥â¥ but in the good old school horror way. The map can get coufsing and the game barly holds your hand so some traild and error is nessary. I think the story gets the job done.

1146	1	a	tons of fun blood and pew pew in this arcade style game. love it!
598	0	a	I do not recommend buying this game at full price - I got it for 2 dollars though, and if that is still the price when you see it, then by all means, drop two bucks. That being said, this game is a mess.  I like the idea - I REALLY like the idea - but the execution is mediocre at best. Run around a mansion as a 7 year old and murder everyone in various ways. Sounds like a blast! I didn't even care that it was all scripted, and that there was little to no creativity allowed. What I cared about was the wacky bugs and confusing as hell missions. I had to look at the wiki in order to figure out what to do in the last half of the game, and I regularly play the Sherlock Holmes games, so I'm no stranger to adventure/puzzle games. But there is very little guiding your way. An intial mark on the map shows you your target, but after that, nothing. No markers showing important objects or following your target or anything. You can get a couple 'gifts' that give you hints, but unfortunately my game bugged out and failed to register my 'chores' so I couldn't get past the Ouiji board (which only hints at an important item to obtain, not what to do). Need to kill one of the maids? Clearly the thing to do is...break the washing machine by dropping an iron into it, thus making her...take a shower? Of course! Need to kill the driver? Well break that washing machine with the iron again to lure out the mechanic (because to hell with washing clothes!), then...find a mix tape so he can turn around and listen to it, allowing you to get some paint thinner and a rag to knock him out with? Masterful! There are also plenty of zero purpose items in the game. Books and bottles can be picked up, but serve no purpose. You can't even throw them to distract NPCs away from locations. Light switches can be flicked on and off, leading one to believe that there is a 'stealth' aspect of the game Nope...in the one section where you can do it, darkness has no meaning - mom will find you whether you are standing in pitch black or right under the light bulb. There is a section of stealth gameplay later in the game where darkness actually matters...but you take out the power to the mansion, thus rendering the switches useless anyway!  The powers are cool, but you rarely get to use them. Telekenesis is your go to, followed by mind control. You can mind control a few of the people in the mansion, but unless they have some scripted interaction in that particular 'chapter', you can't do anything with them. Later in the game, you get some offensive spells...but unless you choose the 'Action' ending (oh yes, that is a thing), you will use the fireball spell twice and the combustion spell - your last spell, btw - once. Yep, one time. The only truly useful spell that doesn't require a scripted event is memory erase, where if you are caught doing something, you can make them forget (but only 6 times a chapter).   And don't even get me started on the bugs. I have witnessed: an NPC walking into a closed door, effectively locking it for me. A chore not registering as complete (taking out the garbage), thus failing to allow me to continue that line of 'side quests'. Dropping that iron into the washer didn't work a few times. Dropping a hair dryer into a tub didn't work because it got stuck behind it, and was out of 'range' of telekenesis. Entries in my journal not registering, leaving me with zero clues on how to continue. And many more minor annoyances (glitching through walls, glitching through each other, falling through the floor once, getting stuck in the courtyard on a very small 'hill'). The voice sync is awful, the voice acting is...not terrible, but not good either. If what they do with their faces could be called 'expressions' or 'emotions' then those are awful too. Many of these could of probably been fixed, but clearly the developer did not see a reason to.   Overall, the game is a mess, but it is certainly worth the two dollars I paid for it. I love the idea, and I would like to see more from the developer (although I'm told the sequel to this is even worse), but please polish it up, give a bit more creativity, and let us use our damn spells! If there isn't a sale on, avoid this one. If there is, anywhere from 1 to 5 bucks...go ahead and give it a whirl.
2146	1	a	Basically Twin Peaks but made into a game  Pros -So many side missions -Soundtrack (actually pretty good) -Subtitles (Big and Easy to read) -Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 (Probably the Graphics, Specific save points, over the shoulder gameplay and the BIG Subtitles) -York is so quirky -Characters are all so unique in some way (E.g. Gay Assistant, Thomas) -Humor -Quite lengthy  Cons -Its a port -Minor Hiccups -Driving sections  Overall, some might say that this game is bad because of its outdated PS2 graphics and other it being a port and all but honestly, those people don't see the the good points, what good points you may ask? The over-the-top humor, a range of memorable characters &amp; Nostalgic gameplay (RE4). I would say this game is worth a buy but you'll probably only during a sale since the game is kinda old and at $25 you can get other better games and besides its like $2.49 during a sale.  Score: Get during Sale Final Verdict: 8/10

47	0	a	Lucius is a third-person adventure/puzzle game, in which you play as Lucifer's son and murder everyone in the manor you live in. The concept is interesting, since it's kinda like reverse horror, but unfortunately the execution is poor.   The gameplay is pretty much just murdering the people in the house in a certain order and in a pre-determined way and watching a cutscene showing the murder. After the murder cutscene you get a new cutscene, which usually involves a detective, who is put on the case after your first murder. The game could have easily been a point-and-click game, because you just look for items and after using the right items you watch the murder commence.  The game let's you free roam around the fairly big manor between the murders, but there isn't much to do aside from some 'fetch quests' called chores and looking for items needed in future murders. After doing enough chores you get some items, of which 2 just give hints for the murder puzzles and the last one is a tricycle. The tricycle let's you move around the manor a bit faster and also let's you use a glitched staircase to get out of the house.   After each murder you get a new superpower or upgrades to the ones you already have. The game has 4 superpowers: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase and combustion. You will need all those superpowers for the murder puzzles and while you can use some of them for other purposes, they're not really fun. The combustion power is also used in the boss battles the game has and also in some extra mini-game, which seemed to involve priests chasing you (a child) with crosses in a dark forest. I didn't like the boss battles or that mini-game at all, because the combustion power isn't fun and felt a bit clunky to use.  Graphics-wise the game looks pretty good for an indie game, but the devs decided to occasionally use some post-processing effects, which actually made the game look a bit uglier. The lip-syncing seemed to be a bit off, but it didn't really bother me. The voice acting ranged from pretty good to quite awful. The game also has a pretty badly done sex, which looks quite funny as a result and there's some frontal 3D nudity as well.   The story and dialogue is pretty bad and the ending was probably one of the worst endings ever.  It's a pretty bad game, which could have been so much more. I wouldn't really recommend playing it unless you want to experience some pretty funny glitches. The game is pretty short (took me 5 and a half hours to complete), so it's not like you'd waste a lot of time.

But by god, if it all doesn't come together somehow in a broken hot mess that's one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. As if Silent Hill and Twin Peaks had a twisted mutated baby.

2845	0	a	It's still unplayable with DPfix too but I suggest to buy it and play it as long as it works fine. And after that watch 'Deadly Premonition The Movie' on YouTube.  It's about story, gameplay is pure garbage.

2449	1	a	An amazing game, one the best of the last generation, and also one of my favorite games of all time even though it doesn't shine technically. The graphics aren't very good, the controls are clunky but the atmosphere, setting and characters are outstanding and make the purchase really worth it. Another thing I'd like to add is that the game really benefits from a PC port, the graphics don't magically turn perfect but they are better on PC. Also a stable framerate is a gift of god.

2228	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played.  The story is one of the best I've seen in a video game, the characters are all interesting and fun to interact with. There's tons of sidequest and stuff to explore.  The puzzles are also hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥, my fav one is when the game kept crashing and I had to run it in windows 95 compatible mode to get it to work.  This is a must have for fans of surealistic horror games like Silent hill or clock tower. Highly recomend that you get it for Xbox as the port is horrible, though entertaining. 
2925	0	a	I can't give an honest review of the game because I haven't actually played it - so keep that in mind. I haven't played it because each time I try I physically cannot keep going, it's so terribly cheesy and awful I can't help but turn it off immediately. I hope it's good when you actually start playing - but the cheese factor is too real for me :-(
498	0	a	  It has potential. Potential that lucius 2 has used. Game 2/0987654321 
2660	0	a	Even with numerous fixes and unofficial patches it still crashes very frequently, leaving you frustrated over the fact that the previous checkpoint was 30 minutes ago.  If you are willing to suffer through that, you're probably going to like the game, which is quite original.
2411	1	a	Definitely one of the most unique games: Deadly is a game that despite its many flaws, is worth playing. As many other people have said, it's so bad, it's good. The plot is bizarre, with odd twists and turns, though it does borrow heavily from Twin Peaks. However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years. The gameplay reminds me of Majora's Mask, with the variety of side-quests that depend on the time of day.  Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it. Also, there are a number of technical difficulties (I've died a few times by falling through the floor). However, if you can get past those annoyances, it's a game that is worth your time.
1211	0	a	This game is more of an arcade type of game with not very many upgrades. Also the gameplay wasnt even that great. Honestly the only slightly cool thing in my opinion is the zombie bosses. This is more of a game for people who like a challenging driving game and pick up upgrades on the side of the rode. Personally I dislike it and I didnt know what I was expecting when I bought thankfully I got it when it was on sale for a cheap price but I still wouldnt suggest it to anyone of my friends though.

1516	1	a	Continuing the story of Penumbra: Overture, Black Plague puts you back into the parka of Phillip as he winds ever deeper into the mysteries of 'The Facility'. Hounded now by freakish, infected creatures - the compounds former employees -you must deduce your way through security systems and pray the earthen horrors that wait just outside the concrete walls don't hear your footsteps echoing through the empty corridors.

2164	1	a	Right I just want to say I LOVE this game (trust me I'll need to say that before I get into the parts I don't like). I think the story is amazing. It's a very well-written game with interesting and well developed characters. Yorke is wonderfully entertaining especially when you're just driving around and he's talking to his alter ego Zach about 80s movies. A lot of the mini stories are fun and the action is very tense and can be really scary at times. I'm serious this game can be pretty horrifying. I enjoyed every part that didn't involve...well uh... ok... The controls.  I've read some other reviews and apparently the console versions controls were a lot smoother but the PC controls leave much to be desired. Yorke kinda controls like a tank (which would be fine in a point and click game) but this is a horror shooter so it's a little clunky and awkward. The real time events are uh... a little difficult. Now I'm slightly biased as real time events are the bane of my existence but Deadly Premonitions are something very special indeed. In most games the real time event keeps the same pattern so that you can kinda power through it after several tries. This game changes the pattern EVERY SINGLE TIME. So it's a little difficult. Though I feel someone with good reflexes could get through it no sweat, I'm just slow af.  When you drive you feel like you're driving on black ice though I will admit it's very fun when you drive really, really fast and crash into stuff.  Also if you're playing on PC be aware this game might crash, several times. It did for me a lot. You can have several days without crashing and it could play smoothly until one day it's like NOPE and crashes on you during a scary part, and oh boy you forgot to save so time to go back into the scary tunnel again with those wall crawlers that take a dozen hits with a shotgun again!  And yet... after all this... I still love it. It's like Taco Bell, even though it hurts and might even be morally wrong you just keep coming back for more. I really do think it's the characters, story, atmosphere, Twin Peaks-vibe, challenging puzzles and fun shooting segments that keep me coming back.  I'd recommend it to people who have a lot of patience and want a game primarily for story. Still amazing though.

1263	0	a	The looks nice and is quite interesting. Although I have DLCs with additional missions and so on, I didn't used them. The game bored me after about 15-20 missions. It's all about killing zombies. Without co-op it's not worth playing longer than just to relax few times for about 20 minutes. Also the ingame font is really small on big screens and resolutions. And since you can play with controller it should have better fit for big screens.
1755	0	a	I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a horror game after a couple hours with it. The game has its moments of horror, but they only slightly stretch passed the initial reactions to it. The beginning does a good job of keeping you in the dark in terms of story and atmosphere. There's a sense of confusion and loss that doesn't leave; however, this eventually turns to a sense of confusion based upon the lackluster combat and wonderment of why you should be scared. The enemies aren't difficult to run from, I found myself just running through areas avoiding enemies because of the horrid combat. Along with the weak combat, you'll get lost fairly easily as there's little to no direction regarding your goals.  The game is short, so if you're looking for some cheap thrills, then I'd recommend it, but if you're looking for an engaging story and continuous horror, look elsewhere.   5/10

2668	0	a	The game crashes without fail on startup. I have tried every solution that was recommended, it still won't get past the intro credits. It should be patched, but never will, because reasons. No, your advice didn't work. I'm sick of being put through the ringer, so even if it did work I don't care. Games should work for everyone, on every system, at launch.

1853	1	a	Great episodic series. I've only played Overture so far but I can safely say that spiders were never so menacing in a game before! The sound design and graphics are quite good and the story is compelling enough to keep making you want to play it; delve ever deeper (literally) into the mine that the first part of this series (Overture) almost entirely takes place in. Also, the puzzles and game play mechanics (such as being able to smash open a locked chest or closed door with a hammer or pick + having a glow stick, a flashlight, and even flares at your disposal to light your way, are all great features as well)  Can't wait to play the rest of the series!

137	1	a	I just completed 'Lucius', and thought that there'd be no better time to write a review for it. In this game, you play the title character, a young boy called Lucius who happens to be the son of the devil. This is quite a departure from most other horror titles, and the effect it creates means that 'Lucius' isn't really a horror game at all, as you're implicit in the planning of all the atrocities committed throughout the story. The fact that it probably won't scare you doesn't mean that you will find it unenjoyable, though. 'Lucius' takes the form of a puzzle game, and a few action sequences are spread throughout the title; bear in mind, though, that the action isn't sufficiently frequent to appeal to someone who dislike puzzles and strategy. If you choose not to rely on walkthroughs (which, I admit, I did on a handful of occasions), you'll be spending a considerable amount of time riffling through drawers, shelves, rooms and cellars, looking for the various objects necessary for the completion of your mission. Your mission, invariably, is to eliminate the multitude of inhabitants and employees of Dante Manor. As you have the physical capabilities of a normal eight-year-old boy, you won't be relying on machetes, sledgehammers or firearms for your kills; instead, you have to use your environment. This complements the puzzle-based nature of the game, as, on occasion, the main challenge of your mission seems to be knowing just which weapon you should use. If you've seen 'The Omen', you've undoubtedly already drawn a handful of parallels between this game and the film. Whilst the acting talents of performers like Gregory Peck and Mia Farrow are sadly unreplicated in this uncannily similar game, you'll surely find enough interaction - whether object- or person-based - to immerse yourself in the world of Lucius and Dante Manor.
1352	1	a	Its really good puzzler / survival horror. Not as good as Amnesia : Dark Descent  but still if you loved Amnesia you will love this one too.  Honestly i wish there were more atmospheric first person puzzler / survival horrors with stealth elements like this one. A well made horror can even make a simple wild dog encounter be a creepy, terrifying experience.

715	0	a	a game that is a hitman clone. it functions in almost the exact same way but can only kill targets in 1 very specific way. not to mention game breaking bugs that causes the game to crash. for example choosing puzzle option and throwing 2 specific tables causes the game to crash. last boss so to speak that you need to kill cant be done atleast not for me. all my powers were disables and could only run around
2250	1	a	Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made.  That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.  The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.  So pretty much it is Twin Peeks.   Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.  Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.  He is Smug and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as 'Zach' But I will not spoil how that ends. York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.  Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.   The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.  You probably will learn your way around the town.  Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.  While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.   In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! 'The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary.'  The enemyâs you fight 'all 1 of them' are called Mysterious Shadows.  They look like zombies with clown make up on.  And they make stupid noises when they die.  The shooting works but it wonât blow your mind or anything but it works. Melee weapons work decently.   The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.  It's baffling when it happens.  The game in general is 'unintentionally' funny.  The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.  There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.  He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time.  There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.   Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10 Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!
1920	1	a	 Good : Great atmosphere. Have to play the sequels to get a complete picture, but the story is looking great so far. It has definitely caught my interest and I'm eager to play the next game in the series.   Bad : A bit too much dragging of items around for 'puzzles'. Combat is extremely clunky; you can go towards a more stealthy approach, but killing things gives my heart peace. Much shorter than expected.   100% recommend this game. I got a STALKER vibe while exploring and I loved it. Also check out the movie 'Devil's Pass' for more of the same vibe (it's like Stalker meets LOST).

266	1	a	You are playing as Satan`s child.  10/10
2444	1	a	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.

693	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game. The characters fall a bit too much into the uncanny valley, which works for the creepy child protagonist but is not that great for the others. And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.
1577	1	a	certainly in my top 5 of the best adventure games EVER to exist that Ive played and I must have played possibly 100's in my 25 years of regularly playing adventure games. Its so good it has an uncanny way of transporting you in the game. You dont need virtual reality it does a good job of that alrteady. would be even more amazing to play though no doubt. It reminds me of amnesia the dark descent. Mainly in that though there are monsters you have no weopons in which you could defend yourself. I actually think its slightly scarier to play than amnesia.

2966	0	a	Really bad PC port. Can't even get past the opening video sequence in the beginning of the game without a crash. 'Dp.exe has encountered a problem' and then crash to desktop.  This happens with DPfix AND without DPfix.  You may have better luck than me, but just to be safe, don't buy this game on Steam unless it's incredibly discounted in a sale. That way you won't lose much if it doesn't end up working.  It's a shame I wasn't able to get this working because it looks like a neat game otherwise. Just can't recommend such a sloppy port.

2784	0	a	As a game, I'd say it's good because of its story but as a product it is not. You will spend a lot of time to try to fix the problems that should've been ironed out before release and I don't think it's worth the time when nothing works as it should.
937	1	a	Now, I've only played a bit of this game, but I would say it's VERY interesting, some parts are a bit difficult, but nothing bad.  I'd buy.

If you like that Baldurs Gate camera view, vehicles armed Flamethrowers, rocket launchers and gatling guns all in the name of cauasing mass zombie genocide combing mbloodier kills for a higher score multiplier.  Then this is your game.

3040	0	a	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.

1461	1	a	A very overlooked game, but still very enjoyable with an intresting story and genuine scares (few, if any jump scares).
871	1	a	I really like this game, and feel bad about liking it at the same time. For anyone who has seen any of 'The Omen' movies, the main story is pretty much the same, for the ones that haven't, here it is. You play as Lucius (duh) the son of Lucifer (pinnacle of evil etc.) and you job as his son is to give him offerings in the form of human life. You start of easy with little accidents that leads to fatalities, and slowly work your way up with power he grants you as you go along. You live in a huge mansion with lots of staff, maids, a driver, mechanic, custodian and you even have a private tutor. Each mission introduces something new you can do or have to do, in order to act innocent you have to appear to be a good boy and do chores, which gives you presents (that's how parenting works) This game have some issues though, for me it was mainly graphics, in the form of lighting effects that were way off at times, but also some crashes, which is really annoying because you can't save. The game autosaves for you, mostly after a kill (a new chapter begins). It still alot of fun though and there alot you can do, and it takes you awhile to figure everything out in every mission. Overall a solid experience and loads of innocent blood. 6.7/10

2815	0	a	- Game horribly laggy no matter if fulscreen or windowed (like 4 or 5 FPS while Bioshock Infinite turns flawlessly with my config, wtf!) - impossible to change the screen resolution - QWERTY or GTFO (you can bind all keys except for the directions. Wtf again!)   I got this for cheap thanks to halloween sales but I regret it. I want a refund.
707	1	a	Playing this game has been really fun. The controls are not bad at all, and it's easy to pick up the game and just start playing. However, as the majority of people who have reviewed this game have stated, many times I was stuck wondering what to do. I also didn't favor running all around the house for the chores or items needed to make a kill. It seemed a bit tedious after a while. (â¥â¥â¥â¥ the laundry chore. Just skip it.)  But the kills! SO rewarding!  Lucius is one of the only games which compelled me to complete all of the Steam achievements. I have them all except for the 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' achievements. My only peeve with these 2 achievements is that it takes less than 5 hours to finish the game, so 40 hours is a LOT of time to fill!   Bottom line: -You get to be a cute little 6 year old who kills people. -Sweet powers from Satan himself. -You get to light people on fire. -You get a tricycle.  It's an enjoyable game. Get it on sale and play!

2989	0	a	I bought this on sale for $5. I couldnt even imagine spending more.  The game is riddled with bugs and frequent crashes and the controls feel clunky and uncomfortable.   The gameplay isnt really that good but the story and music are interesting and are just enough to justify buying it on sale. I can understand the almost seemlingly visual manifestation of something like Macintosh Plus (music) mixed in with heavy influences of Twin Peaks. The music is strange and it makes the whole experience and vibe strange, in a good way.   Unless you like bizarre experimental type games that does not take it self seriously and/or a big fan of Twin Peaks or anything like that then I would skip this unless you can get it for $5 or less.
2892	0	a	Never got past the intro thanks to a regular crash. Of course I am not one to give up easily, so I tried 7 more times, using dpfix, using compatibility modes, fiddling with NVIDIA settings, launching stuff as Admin and changing between windowed and fullscreen mode. In the end I sat in the launcher for a few hours to get the cards and then moved the game to my 'Trash' category, because that's what it is.  Edit after all those months : Thanks to a forum thread the thing finally started to work. It required me to uninstall the LAV codecs I had installed. I' guess getting the game to work is already part of the gaming experience :l

1698	1	a	Okay,yes,this game is old - well,lets not say 'old',lets say,it's a 'classic'...yeah thats it ,this game is a classic and for a classic,I've got to say its still a great looking game ! In my humble opinion,this is one of a handful of games that has deeply inspired a lot of the present day games of the genre. . . The game has an overall atmosphere of dread. . . It does a wonderful job in the fright department without resorting to cheesy,un-needed jump scares and gore. . .  We play as Phillip,a 30 yr old man searching for his presumed dead father. . .Phillip talks to us throughout the game and the voice acting is above par I think. . . The story unfolds by way of notes and letters,journal enteries and our own thoughts,voiced again,by Phillip and Red,that talks to us over a PA system and walkie talkie. . . I need to say something about Red (no spoilers) ,he is stupid-funny ! ! I sat at my laptop and honestly laughed out loud so much from what he says to us ! ! Don't get me wrong,Red is an annoying butt monkey,but he does it with humor or at least I think so. . .  The game is set in Greenland in an abandoned mining research/living facility and,like I mentioned earlier,we find various notes,journal enteries,research papers and so on. . . And thats how we find out what the hell happened to all the people that used to be there,including Phillips father,where they went,why they went there and just what in the world could have gone oh so wrong that they're all long gone. . .  There is lots to do,explore,learn,find,solve and run from. . .We even get to do a little killing,but the controls for the combat system are somewhat sucky and should be avoided if at all possible,except when you absolutely have to and there are times you have to.  So,in my opinion,I must say I really loved this game and it had a story that I was invested enough in,that I thoroughly looked forward to finding the next clue so I could advance the story and find out all of the who,what,where,when and whys . . .  I 100% recommend this game and the rest in the series,as they only improve upon what I think is a great story. . .  I give this horror/survivor game an 8/10,   Happy Gaming Everyone !!

In all seriousness there is a decent interesting game here but theres just too many bugs and crashes to make it worth while. From what I have played I really like it but having to play from save point to save point constantly worried if the next cut scene or character conversation is going to cause a crash really distracts from the story and atmosphere of the game.  A few fixes or patches would shape this up into a good little game but as is its I can't suggest anyone else buy this game.

1475	1	a	Certainly not the best or most groundbreaking horror game, but it was fun for me and i enjoyed it.
70	1	a	An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.  The good:  - Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use  The bad:  - A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck. - Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all. - Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..  Definately recommended.

3031	0	a	It is difficult to discern if this game is brilliantly bizarre or bizzarely brilliant. One thing is certain is that this game is not worth full price. There are no options to adjust the graphics; and the graphics suggest that is game has been poorly ported or created.   The controls are fine, but employ tank controls for shooting. That is to say, movement is not allowed whilst aiming. The game does not have the horror vibe that the tags indicate.   One last thing to note is the amount of loading screens and unnecessary sequences. If you pause the game you get an unnecessary sequence of bushes moving aside. Or when you pick up an item, it presents a slowly rotating image of the item.   For buyers considering the game, wait for sale.

445	0	a	Great idea, bad execution.  The entire game feels really repetitive and gets boring after a couple hours. I have never really gotten into the story even though I have finished it. Bad voice acting and limited gameplay most likely contributed to it.   Pros:  - Interesting idea   Cons:  - Limited gameplay. You have only one way to complete your mission even though there are a lots of possibilities that you can think of. - Bad voice acting. It is cringe worthy at times. - Frustrating hints. It's either a little hint per stage or no hints at all. I've spent quite a lot of time just running around the house trying to find something to progress further. Eventually I got bored and had to look up for a hints online.

1864	1	a	I played this game because I loved amnesia: the dark decent. i didn't have much expectations on the game, but I liked it in the end. It ok, but its worth playing it to play the second game, 'The black plauge', thats the really good one. In the beginning when you are walkingt through a dark tunnel its scary but after that you are mostly in lighted rooms. But there are some fun atmospheric and scary moments. Like the lake, the worm chase and the room with the UV-Lamp text. There are basicly just 2 enemies. Zombie dog and big spider. Your attack is really bad. When fighting the zombie dogs you get a lot of diffrent things to lure them but to kill the enemies the easiest way is to just stand still att hit them when they attack. Hate the spiders, they are so annoying. &gt;_&lt; The story is hard to follow, but you grasp it and can but the parts together in the second part. Also the flashlight is so muth worse than the green tube whih never runs out of battery. But in 'black plauge' they made the green tube worse so you have reason to use the flashlight. ^^
1255	0	a	To be honest, I wanted a Netrual button over here, its unffair to say that this game is crap, but there are some points that avoid me to enjoy this 100% Tobe honest I have played only the single-player campaign. need to say that for cons this game is well balanced, has a fair challenge, great graphics and has a nice twist on the over-used zombie formula. But the game has some very annoying issues, first of all the campaign drags itself far too long. 30 levels with many many missions types repetead over and over again,how many scientis do I need to rescue ?  And : Stop at the marker  Zombies left in the area : 2 Stop at the marker Zombies left in te area : 3 Stop at the marker Zombies left in the area : 1

1653	1	a	You'll Nervously Wonder  Penumbra: Overture; an eerie survival-horror bolstered with an excellent sense of atmosphere and accomplished physics.  Will you jump in fright? Perhapsâ¦  Youâll enter mysterious hatches, open mysterious doors, and shine your flashlight into mysterious darkness.  As you play youâll nervously wonder if something might be down in the darkness with you.  What if you run into something?  If you do, will it be something that can kill you?  So youâll often crouch and hide in the dark from everything because youâre actually scared.  Then something will make a sound nearby and youâll promptly fill your pants.

1842	1	a	This game is like a FMV console horror game from Sega Saturn or Sony Playstation except it's in realtime 3d. Honestly, it shares so much with Enemy Zero or Hellnight and its more streamlined ilk. You've basically got puzzle rooms interconnected by a corridor sequence and on you go dodging death and solving puzzles.  The mechanics may not have aged well, and the second chapter (Black Plague) retcons plenty out of this one, so don't get burned there. The horror premise is well-worn and the setting is honestly inspid, but it's a decent game all in all.

2072	0	a	I want to like this game. I really do. I thought the concept was intriguing. The twists and turns of the plot so far are fun to navigate.  However, the combat mechanics don't work well. Even when I have the game on easy, and cheat (I'm a few hours in, and made myself level 100), the game kills me within ten minutes in the current dungeon. And, according to the walkthrough I found, it's a dungeon I should be able to get through at this point in the game.  There is a lot of lore for this game. So much so, it sometimes overwhelms me. I just scrolled through what people were saying and only paying attention when a 'quest added/updated' or 'journal entry added' message popped up.
3029	0	a	Fromw hat little I played, I loved this game. The charecters and the story are promising and reminiscent to the likes of twin peaks, the gameplay, while clunky seems to work within this context, the graphics and sound are not great but again, they seem to blend well with this game.  My issue witht he game however is that, as much as I want to enjoy and complete this game, the constant game crashes, bugs, freezes and sound glitches have tested and brought my willpower to the brink. I am sad to say that I have finally given in, I haven't even finished chapter 1 yet just because of how unbearable it has become. I've tried the durante patch, I have changed my sound from 5.1 to stereo to fix sound issues yet the random crashes still occur, at times making me lose quiet a bit of progression.   In short, I really love and do wanted to complete this game, but the constant crashes have prevented me from doing so.
433	0	a	I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.  It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.  Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.   In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.  Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.  Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.

2842	0	a	I have played this game before steam using GOG. Back then I really thought I should try it since everyone was talking about how its one of the best mystery game out there and how funny and cheesy it is. So I downloaded the game . When I went to start it, it would not start so I modded it and it worked out great with no glitches and no frame drops, but why the hell did I go through the trouble of doing all that? the game it self looks absolutely terrible for a 2010 game, and the shooting and melee mechanics look like butchered resident evil 4 mechanics that should have been fixed 11 YEARS AGO (when re4/biohazard 4 came out). The game trys to be a fresh new start and try a whole new genre of mystery and detective work with resident evil mechanics. but the game turned out aweful looking, broken, boring and dull. Not even minding the bugs, the story itself is decent but not even worth the trouble of fixing the game to play, and the interesting characters are the only thing that basically make the game. People say its good because of the many random encounters that dont make sense and the fresh ideas put into the game but the random encounters are not even funny and makes the game look like crap. If you're gonna play the game stick to console and also if you're looking for a game that focuses on mystery using the atmosphere and the enivronment then do not get this game, its looks like it was put together in a month. People say its one of those game that its so bad its good but I just do not see it. I personally would give the game a 4.5/10 for the characters but for everything else the devs made it look like they didnt even try.   TL;DR Buyers beware. Do not even accept this game for free and put your time trying to fix the bugs to play it, its not even worth it. If you want to play it, play it on Xbox 360 ( I heard the ps3 version is also broken.)

1972	1	a	first game [prolouge] of the penumbra series, very good! I recomend playing this game first, I played black plauge first and I think you would absorb the INTENSE plot a little faster. this game series is like the precursor in the spirit of Amnesia the Dark Descent, and lemme tell ya, the plot of this series is on par if not superior imo to amnesia, very fluid gameplay and story. its a bit older yes, but its so optimizable its rediculous. buy this next time its on sale if ya got dosh its great.
508	1	a	At first I wasn't sure if I would like this game. I had many problems (finishing quest before starting causing the quest to get stuck, and getting stuck in numerous walls) but I went with it (not gonna lie, those pantie physics made me want to keep playing).  As the game went on I started liking it more and more- Until the last level. (spoilers) I chose the puzzle instead of actionâ¦ it made me so mad. Trying to kill the priest I was aiming for the chandelier but I ended up getting âcaught.â So? He knows Iâm trying to kill him, why would it matter if I get caught? Then I realized I was supposed to use the fire to get him. Dang priest ran out so fast I donât even know how many times I had to restart because I ran out of time. Then, after that, when getting the father, I encountered a problem where after he was knocked down I was stuck. After messing around with various powers it eventually popped me to where I needed to be and I completed the game. Itâs not an overall bad game. I thought the game was enjoyable, but there are some things that can really make you angery- things that should have been fixed. As for recommending- it's a tie.

1149	1	a	Zombie Driver doesn't sound like much on paper, but it's actually a very addictive game once you've given it a chance. The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.  If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0

1990	1	a	First chapter of the Penumbra Series.  After a mysterious note from his passed away dad, containing clues. Philip (protagonist) sets out to Northern Greenland to find out more about this mystery and the past of his father. I like the fact that the game takes place in Greenland. Deep down in a long abandoned mine. A very unique choice for a location. Being a with snow covered uninhabited place makes a perfect set for a horror game.  The beginning of the game got me right on spot. The story started off rather sad but had me curious about what was next. Was rather vague at first but piece by piece it started to connect. Not to forget that this is part 1 and part 2 will give even more depth to the story.  Every level has a couple rooms that contain valuable information and/or objects that you require to venture further. In between these rooms there are dark halls and corridors with danger lurking around every corner. Some levels have some very difficult puzzles that took me a while to figure out. It felt like an accomplishment each time I managed to solve a clue and make progress.  According to the developers, playing in the middle of the night with headphones will grant you a full immersive experience. I did as they say and it sucked me right in. Psychological horror at its finest. Not a lot of jumpscares to freak but mostly the atmosphere. And spiders. :) Have fun  
1038	1	a	I payed 2.99 (complete edition) 0.4h on record atm, but i have to say thats totally worth it. Reminds me a little bit a game from '97 IGNITION (lots of hours played on this game xD), similar camera (not because the zombies hehe).
45	0	a	I don't have 9 hours on this, I left it idling while going to get pizza. I bought this for 2 dollars. I did, however, beat this game in 4 hours.  If anyone were to find this game enjoyable, it would be myself. I am a huge fan of the hitman franchise, puzzle games, and being an edgy powerful spawn of satan that can manipulate people and burn â¥â¥â¥â¥ with his/her mind. I expected this to be an open ended puzzle game with many solutions to every mission (offering replayability) that slowly worked up to a Carrie-esque climax when your power reaches an apex.  This was not the case.   Reasons:  1. Every mission can only be solved one way. Past the 7th mission, [almost] every mission is solved by simply manipulating people to kill themselves. Most missions are either too easy or pseudo-difficult by not allowing you to use your satan given powers for unexplained reasons. Some missions are so unbelievably easy that it can take quite a few minutes to figure out because you need to take a moment and stop thinking creatively.  2. At your most powerful, a priest with a looped cliche voiceline 'The power of christ compels you' can 'game over' you in the matter of seconds. Same goes for a man with a fire extinguisher. Aparently, satan's child can be killed by a swift whack to the face with a fire extinguisher. Oh and god forbid satan's son got surrounded by fire because OF COURSE you can't walk through it. Same goes for locked doors.  3. The game does not play smoothly. In order to open a door, you must have the 'hand' ability equiped instead of any of the other powers given to you. Every action just enables another animation/cutscene. This makes you feel separated from the character entirely and everything feel like a chore. Might as well actually get off the computer and pace a large â¥â¥â¥ mansion looking for some super glue... the graphics in real life are better.  4. There was absolutely no attention to detail. The developers were obviously very lazy as they did not fix/add simple things. Uncomfortable pauses in voice acting, clipping, glitching, dull gore, the list goes on. One of the most lazy moments: When people see you using a power, you are spotted and it's a game over which makes sense but at one point, a person who is trying to kill you knows that you are a spawn of satan and you can still get a game over by them seeing you use a power in order to defend yourself. I suppose the developers simply forgot to remove this feature at this part in the game. This is probably because it is near the end and none of them could actually bring themselves to play this far.  5. The story is    The Omen    how original!  6. The side quests are so dull the developers didn't expect anyone to actually do all of them. Well guess what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, I did. I did all of your boring side missions. I did them because they unlocked items in game! However, this is only true for the first three or four chores. After this, the developers couldn't come up with any more easter eggs/items to use. Imagine doing a tedious side quest in an RPG only to be prompted with 'No more awards available' after you ran Dr.â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥head's Bread all the way to Fort Shimbles!  7. Even the achievments are lazy.  8. Finally, the developers were lazy which completely makes the game unenjoyable.  The moral of the story, don't give these lazy â¥â¥â¥ devs even two dollars of your money because they may possibly devote their profits toward ruining another good game idea!
2860	0	a	I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need. The cars drive like busses and topple over at relatively slow speed, NPC's aren't where they're supposed to be, some of the internal buildings have bad graphics - 'daylight' streaming in from windows is green. In my view, this game shouldn't have been released with so many bugs, is a waste of money and impossible to play due to constant crashing. Don't buy it and get the Xbox version instead.

1640	1	a	I've never had so much fun running from dogs~!  Seriously though, you should buy this game. For this being the first horror game by Penumbra that I know of, it is really good. The combat is a bit weird, and may screw you over at times, but you aren't suppoed to be fighting the enemies to begin with. My favorite part about this game's combat is definitely how you're supposed to use the weapons, swinging your mouse in the direction that you want to swing the hammer or pickaxe. While there isn't much variety in enemies, just spiders in about two or three places while your main enemy will be the dogs, it is still fun to get past them. Your only companion in this game, Red, has dialogue that is amazing from how it can range from Metaphorgotten to just borderline insanity. Personally, I prefer the Penumbra games over Amnesia and am disappointed that the story to these games is finished, although I can see why. If you're into horror games with a side of puzzle-solving, you should get this game. The main menu music is also simply beautiful in my opinion.

1414	0	a	A game that is supposed to be scary.. First 30 minutes of it was decent then rest of the game became a chore.
642	0	a	Bit of an overrated game. Nothing special about it, really. It's basically a blatant ripoff of the movie The Omen. Hell, it's played out almost identical. But even if you haven't seen the film, you can tell it's pretty hokey, between the crap voice acting, the rusty gameplay, the maze of a mansion design, the lack of character development, the lack of subtlety regarding Lucius and his father Lucifer (not much of a spoiler), and the lackluster gore moments. I mean I'm a gorehound, but this was pretty boring. There is little to no suspense, the plot is predicable, and the idea of making a killer child is getting tiresome, which doesn't help when you add in the satanic aspect. If you actually want this game, don't bother. EVen if it's on a Steam Sale, the price isn't worth it.

2035	1	a	Recommend? Hmmm...  If you get it on sale you may like this for the interesting plot (i.e. you don't really know initially who the heretics are, and how to get the proof against them). Overall, it feels like a badly implemented cross between Icewind Dale and Diablo 1, with less side quests than IWD but more plot depth than D-1. Also, character advancement is pretty rapid, you can easily get over Level 20 or so in ACT 1.  But: - Graphics are VERY outdated for a 2012 game, looks like a much older game that hasn't aged well - UI is pretty clunky (no sort in inventory, etc.) - Limited types of weapons, armor, etc. - Balancing seems off: melee/ranged combat can be far to easy, but as soon as you meet multiple shamans/mages, it can get surprisingly dificult, with your main character becoming confused within the 1st second of combat. Poison works for an ungodly length of time with few counters, etc. - Few 'side' quests - Income is very limited compared to cost of consumables - Many game design decisions are... well... let's call them old-school (no Town Portal spells or similyr)  May still be considered OK for a low budget production. Without the storyline it would not be recommended at all.

I have no idea if that's still the case now, but I'd recommend checking out the pcgamingwiki page concerning this game before making the purchase.  On console, that's a different matter. The game is a gem, and it's weird as hell. Definitely check it out on a stable platform. I usually champion buying the 'good' version, but in this case, like with Dark Souls 1, this is definitely not the good version.

104	1	a	Have you ever wanted to corrupt the innocent and be a generally evil demonic little child? Well then this is the game for you.  If you just stick with it through the glitches and try to overlook the many shortcomings this title has then you WILL have a good time. Itâs a real diamond in the rough.  On the surface it may look like a third person action game, but itâs actually a third person puzzle gameâ¦ one with a good premise too.  Price wise though wait for a sale, full price it is a little much, unless you LOVE the idea of being the Antichrist then have at it.  Trust me, go ahead and play the son of the devil. Its fun ^_^ 
2008	1	a	Inquisitor provides one of those rare experiences of satisfaction and achievement in gaming. It doesnât hold your hand, it doesnât overcompensate for impatience, and it is not a title a small child will be successful in. What it does have is brilliant atmosphere, an engrossing story, intricate plots and intrigue and requires you to really think about what your next move should be. The obvious time and effort the developers put into the title completely makes you forgive them for the often frustrating combat mechanics and steep learning curve. Inquisitor is the Dark Souls of isometric RPGs.
2280	1	a	A near masterpiece, yeah I said it. Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Frances York Morgan as he travels to the small city of Greenvale to solve a ritualistic killing which he thinks may lead to more. Deadly Premonition is a third person survival horror game with bits of comedy in it. You may think that sounds weird but it works very nicely. The comparisons to the TV show 'Twin Peaks' are incredibly valid in setting, characterization &amp; situations. I don't want to give away the story of Deadly Premoniotn as it's without a doubt the main draw. Agent Morgan goes into an 'other world' when he's profiling and searching for clues. Here is also where you'll do some combat and a bit of minor puzzle solving. The story is so engrossing that you'll want to push ahead just to see the cutscenes which include great dialogue and voice acting. NOW the bad news. Deadly Premonition is a buggy console port. The graphics are dated but serviceable. The biggest gripe is without a doubt the controls. To shoot guns is incredibly clunky as is the ability to use items. The driving is without a doubt some of the worst I've played in any game. Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a breeze compared to this. And until you get the radio (if you ever do) you will drive A LOT. The two three tiered boss fights at the end also overstayed their welcome, the last being especially being an issue with the known aiming issue. This game is also very lengthy as it took me 30 hours to finish with only a few of the side missions completed. You will get your money's worth. Don't let the slow start fool you. The wonderful atmosphere, unusual music cues, the great story and amazing cast of characters more than make up for the many issues this game has. This game truly is not for everyone but I enjoyed the heck out of it. An easy 9/10 from me.
272	1	a	Overall this is a very hit and miss adventure game.  It starts off well enough. Slowly introducing you to the game mechanics and drip feeding new abilities, but then the game never really goes anywhere.  A few levels in and the mansion opens up, but then most of it is pointless space with the occasional hunt for an object in one of the rooms. I feel it would have been better to restrict each chapter to a certain area, but admittedly this would feel constrained.  The solutions themselves range from pretty straightforward to bordering on the illogical. Additionally there is only one way to solve each murder and sometimes feels like guesswork to deduce the intended method (clues can be obtained using an unlockable item).  One for adventure fans to pickup on sale, otherwise avoid.
2980	0	a	I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it. I seem to have fallen in love with it from the first time i played it back on my 360, then to the second time on PS3, now looking to do the hat trick by fully completing it once again on PC!  But For the love of GOD as much as i want to i can't! As much as i want to play my favourite game i can't due to the simply shocking port of it on PC. Constantly crashing, unreliable at almost every turn, and most recently when i hit act 1 Chapter 6 and saved outside the Greenvale Community Centre, my save file will not load at all. It shows the loading screen then tabs me out the game saying 'Dp.exe has stopped responding'  So i warn you all now, fans of this game it is fantastic and the thought of playing it once again is exciting. But it's an utterly appaling port. Hence why it saddens me to downreview this just for that.

2195	1	a	Okay here's the deal with this game.  You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage. Framerate is atrocious, freezes and drops are frequent and completely random. Like, I had to play the game on two separate machines in order to get to the end. Driving is the worst you've ever seen, shooting is clunky and shooting sections are tedious. This game is a technical turd.  BUT, there is a good reason why Deadly Premonition is a cult hit.  The cast of characters, story, atmosphere, and the central mystery will make you chew through the issues if you're into Twin Peaks, can handle Lynchian, as well as general japanese weirdness, and non-linear storytelling. It's almost like this game has no right to be any good, but it has so much soul, and leaves you with such heartfelt goodbye, that you won't be able to anything but recommend it. Plus, it deals with some really heavy themes like child abuse, â¥â¥â¥â¥, transsexualism, and it can get very rough and creative when it comes to violence, down to straight up shocking. It goes beyond what most games try.  The great moments in this game shine so brightly, that you'll wave off the jank.
519	1	a	Overall, I enjoyed Lucius and the funny moments that arose when I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes that roll after each kill. It did glitch (cutscene wouldn't activate) for me in the last chapter, but other then that my gameplay experience was smooth sailing. If you're not a fan of games with linear and restricting gameplay then this isn't the game for you. Most of your time is spent looking for items to kill your target with. Also, unlike Hitman which i've seen this game compared to there is only one way to kill each target. The puzzles for the most part are pretty straight forward, and not much of a challenge. After the first couple of kills it gets a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time in the world of Lucius, and do not regret my purchase. If this game is on sale I would highly recommend picking it up.

2690	0	a	I would have given this quirky game at least an 8/10, but due to hardware silliness, and a bad port...I just don't know.   I want to LOVE this game. I really do.   The console version is waaay better.   I'll base my review on what the game truly is without hardware/software difficulties and bad porting.   If you are familiar with Twin Peaks or any absurd David-Lynch works, you'll understand this game completely.   If you're not...just go with it. Yes. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing weird. Yes, York (the main character) is a dweeb. Yes, this town has no basis at all in reality. Just go with it.   Gameplay-wise...meh. It's really about the weird characters and story. Sidequests everywhere!  Ultimately, I cannot recommend the PC version if you're running any machine newer than like...2007-2009.  If you can get your hands on the xbox360 version. Great. 
1232	0	a	I recieved a coupon through crafting a badge that showed me this game. It actually allowed me to get this game for a dollar. I was pleased - an inexpensive game with an interesting and fun sounding idea and an equally interesting and fun looking trailer? Sign me up.  No no no, wait, take my name back off of that. Now. I changed my mind. First impressions told me that this game was goign to be fun, to be interesting, and be overall very enjoyable. It isn't. The controlls make the car hard to manuver, amn near impossible to kill anything with, and overall, it simply feels broken. I figured, then, with the story mode being lackluster, I could probably get some enjoyment out of the Arena mode. Locked in an arena with a near endless supply of zombies. Just you can your car to fight them all off... Sounds good, right? Just as boring. Jombies drop like rocks at the touch of your car, and do almost nothing to it. I started the first arena in hard mode - ten minutes later I got the gold medal by doing nothinbg but holding the fire button and driving in circles.  Terrible game.

1717	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is one of the best adventure/survival horror games I've ever played. The only real flaw with the game is that the weapons are pointless and the game would be better without them, and this mechanic was rightfully removed in Black Plague and Requiem. The story is Overture's greatest strength; you are thrown into a world of mystery, and the game does everything it can do build up atmosphere. Overture focuses on fear of the unknown, which works very well for it since most of the questions brought up would be answered in the later games.   Overture is my favorite of the Penumbra series and is my second favorite survival horror games of all time (only to Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.) I whole-heartedly recommend it, as well as the other great Penumbra games.
40	0	a	A great idea, executed in a not-so-great way. That is Lucius, a horror-focused action adventure.  So, the idea is great; a free roam game where you get to kill people like in those famous horror movies we've all seen. You'll be using items and powers to kill off these people. It's not all that straightforward though. You have to solve little puzzles to complete objectives. And every time you complete one of these objectives you're one step closer to killing a certain someone.  But it's all executed in a mediocre way; the inventory is cumbersome to use, but manageable. The 'stealth' missions are terrible; there's no way to see where a certain character is so you'll bump into someone frequently. And sometimes the hints you get just aren't clear enough, which results in you doing the wrong thing. And when it's Game Over you have to start the mission all over again (including sidequests).  It's an interesting idea though. And I would love to see a(n improved) sequel someday.  [Rating: 65/100]
2931	0	a	In principle it is probably a 'thumbs up' game. Alas, it wont run on my PC, no matter the tweaks with PhysX, DPFix, etc. pp. Hence the thumbs down. Apparently it is a poor console port to the PC.

Next go steal an obscurely hidden key in room #43 and get the water bottle from the second shelf in room #3 of a million rooms, then use that to access a draw in a study with bullets and then guess the combination to a safe and take out the gun and then load the gun and don't shoot it no you have to put it on an arbitrary desk near the teacher and tell him to shoot himself and he's like what and then he does it but you don't get blamed.

2163	1	a	Do I recommend Deadly Premonition? Absolutely. Do I recommend this version of Deadly Premonition on Steam? Well that's going to need explaining.  Deadly Premonition is, in as few words as possible, Twin Peaks: The Video Game, you play as Francis York Morgan, a quirky FBI Agent is brought out to the town of Greenvale in order to solve the death of a young woman, who York believes was killed by someone who has done similar murders in other towns, all with the same connection of mysterious red seeds, along the way he will meet with and help out the town inhabits in any way he can to bring him one step closer in solving his biggest case so far.  Basically my recommendation of this game comes with an asterisk, you have to be able to enjoy quirky plotlines, weird gameplay, and have a basic love for Twin Peaks or a number of other David Lynch like things, that being said even though the Director's Cut of this game fixes a lot of problems and adds in a few extra bonuses, there are still core issues with the game that must be suffered through in order to enjoy the game's story, for example this game has an open world but with no fast travel unless you do a side mission half way through the game, but before that you have to drive everywhere, and the map system is not the best, add in clunky shooting mechanics and missions thrown in just to add filler and you have gameplay that is not the most exciting thing in the world, not to mention the graphics look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game.  But even with the issues this game has I fully recommend it, the story is interesting, bizarre, and downright insane at times, and will leave you wanting to see what happens next, though you may have to suffer some gameplay to get to the good part... or some bugs.  Which brings me to the second part of this, the PC version of this game has issues, many, many issues, I recommend people to check out guides and the forums to understand some of the fixes, if you have a Playstation 3 I feel that version of the game is the best to get, but if you are unable to and PC is your only option, be ready for random crashes, weird texture bugs, slowdowns, Windows 98 compatibility mode, and many hours fooling around just to get it to work right, if it even works at all, but who knows you might be lucky and the game works perfectly, at any rate know that going in.

1713	1	a	I finished this game some time ago I think late 2013. Yes it took me 6 years to finally play this and when I did I was so glad I played it, this is the precursor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and it's really nice to go back and see the evolution of Frictional's horror games and how they did so well with Amneisa. Anyways this game is really good while it is not amazing in terms of horror it really stands on it's own. There are no incredible grotesque monsters to hide from and the creatures you do encounter can be dispatched with weapons found, the puzzles are incredibly simple and the atmosphere does well to put you on edge.  Overall I think this game is deserving of the attention of all horror fans and I highly recommend you play the others in the series too.

1383	0	a	I wanted to like this game, but couldn't. TLDR: It wasn't that much fun overall. Not really much of a horror game (not scary). I found the voice of Clarence to be rather annoying. The puzzles were bothersome at times. The ending took turn way out into left field.   Longer review:  I will start by saying that although the first installment of this series (Overture) has its flaws, I was able to finish the game without a walkthrough and the story was interesting. Black Plague on the other hand improved upon some of these flaws, but ended up making a worse game in my opinion.   Story: Black Plague continues about where Overture left off. However, it goes in an entirely different direction by involving some organization that is apparently a gloabl order. It felt like much of what happened was created after the first game rather than having been the plan for the story all along. By the time I reached the ending, it felt like the story had gone into a whole other direction. And then there is Clarence. He is a voice in your head that (if you play you can figure out how he got there) was just really annoying. I understand the overall contribution of Clarence to the plot, but I would have done it differently myself. But perhaps his annoying voice and dialogue were exactly what the writer(s) wanted to show. Overall, it wasn't satisfying for me.  Gameplay/Puzzles- The gameplay and object interaction were pretty standard if not better than Overture. I definitely think that Black Plague was better off without combat. The enemies were not difficult to face, but rather acted to obstruct you on the way to your next destination. Overall standard gameply. The puzzles were problematic for me as I wasn't really into the game and was in a hurry to finish it, so I often would miss an item that was needed to solve the puzzle. For example, one puzzle required a book or note to tell you how to complete it, but I never saw it and thus was frustrated as to why the puzzle made no sense. Thats on me, but I probably would have liked the puzzles more if they were actually realistic.   For example: at the beginning of the game when you need a soda to short circuit the wiring in the refriderator room; I didn't realize putting in some random and crushed coin into the vending machine would get me the soda. I couldn't go back to get it because the boards over the spike pit had fallen. And there were perfectly fine liquids in the room. Why couldn't I have just used one of them?   Anyways, the puzzles were not always consistent with the objects you could use to complete them. I personally didn't find the puzzles to be realistic at times (not that this game is meant to be real of course)  Horror: There weren't any parts that I felt scared or surprised. The environment had good horror elements, but I could always see enemies coming and never really felt any danger unless I couldn't solve a puzzle fast enough. But the death trial and error system helped bme to not worry about death. Simply put, the game wasn't really scary. Just dark and spooky maybe.   Graphics: Its an older game so I didn't expect anything great. I am sure it looked fine when it came out. The graphics aren't detrimental to enjoying the game.  As I said at the beginning of this review, I didn't find the game to be enjoyable or fun. The story evolved in a way that didn't make much sense since there was no foreshadowing of it in the first game. There were some links of course such as the 'infection' it self, but I think it all fell flat by the end. I guess if the game goes on sale and you don't have any better options available, it is not that expensive and will provide a few hours of gameplay. There are many positive reviews, so you may enjoy the game. If you are looking for a solid horror game, this is not it. It is important to note that the devs did make substantial improvements in these areas in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

2477	1	a	The bad: It's not a good port, you must use a small mod to get it to run in 1080.  The good: It's batshit crazy - so bad it's good.  If it wasn't buggy I'd give it an 9/10 so far.  I'll let IGN explain it ...  'Imagine if you took the complete script from David Lynchâs Twin Peaks television series, translated it into Japanese, then translated it back into English, then had a drunk friend read it to you from the passenger seat of your car while they clumsily flicked between obscure jazz radio stations that intermittently fluctuated in volume.'

You've either got a machine gun, a flamethrower, a rocket launcher or a railgun mounted on your car. You even can choose your vehicle, e.g. a taxi, a sports car and not at last a tank in story mode. Beside the story mode, which is not that challenging, there is a racing called Blood Race and a survival mode called Slaughter. All of those are fun and the game itself is just about fun, it is certainly not a high-class game. Despite the variety of three playable modes, the game is rather short. Nonetheless it is worth buying, especially on sale.

The gameplay itself is mostly a string of tiresome exercises that lead from one plot point to another. And for a while that was enough. It is kind of fun to see York unravel the mysteries of this town. But after a while, I don't know if its charm just faded, or some of the twists just broke suspension of disbelief or what. By the end, I was just going through on stubbornness.  On the bright side, it made me all nostalgic for Twin Peaks, and I picked up the boxed set.

310	0	a	I was interested in the concept of this game but it just never really got me into it and I got bored fast. All the missions are very linear in that you can only kill the target in one way and it doesn't allow for any creativity or fun. Running around the mansion looking for the right items is tedious and it just doesn't have a lot of fun to it.
2166	1	a	It is like blue cheese - you either like it or avoid it. I absolutly love it, but ironically wouldn't touch blue cheese with a two meter stick.  An unique game with a story inspired by Twin Peaks. I truly recommend for all horror/mystery fans!    My nominee for 'Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!' Award in 2016 Steam Awards ceremony.
2053	1	a	Overall pretty neat game.   Great story, lots of dialogue. Art is great. A lot of small details. Tons of side quests.  Takes a good time to beat over 90 hours if you do everything possible. Can be difficult of you don't spend your skills wisely etc.   Play as an inquisitor and save the realm from evil.
2945	0	a	Hey now, don't be confused by all the hype you've heard. This game plays poorly, really poorly. It's unstable and has poor FPS. Mechanically, it's a mess. It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).  The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.

1310	1	a	Imagine Half Life without firearms or even your crowbar. Black Plague features a significantly different art design over it's predecessor Overture. Featuring less abandoned mines and spider infested caves with underground facilities with advanced technology and a mutant plague virus that threatens the world. Sound familiar?  Black Plague however distinguishes itself in numerous ways to Overture. For one it's significantly more character driven. The original only had two major characters, the player and the enigmatic Red who wasnt even modeled ingame. Here you have a skitzophrenic voice in your head and zombies walking linoleum hallways.  Really what can be said about Black Plague? It suffers from the same problems as Overture, and vis-Ã -vis it features all the improvements so dearly needed for the game. So really... it's just a sequel that feels like it needs to be packaged with Overture instead of seperated.

Since like chapter 8 whenever I wasnt sure what to do next, I better look into walkthrought because you are constanly running from one point to another with mostly no idead what you looking for (some items are very small and not indicated in any way) with wasnt fun at all. Also technical part of game is kinda bad and most of the character are just roaming mansion and repeat 1-2 sentece, with really didnt help with atmosphere.  So overall not the worst game, but for me to be enjoyable experience, it would need much more work into it.

Itâs a very intense, trilling game that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The story is simple in an excellent way, as it should be for a horror game. The physics puzzles were fun and kept me thoroughly immersed the entire way through. For only $10, this game is definitely worth it.

The launcher says at the bottom D-pad: Select Option and A: Confirm even with no controller plugged in. 2. Check box in the settings menu of the launcher is already checked for Full Screen mode 3. Press Play and the game starts in a bordered 720p window on my 1440p monitor. 4. Get to main menu, can't use my mouse. In fact there isn't even a cursor. Have to use keyboard arrow keys to navigate 5. Go to options and see there aren't any graphics settings whatsoever. 6. Quit the game. Cry.  At the time I wrote this review it's on sale for $2.49 which is 90% off it's regular asking price of $25. $25 for this? Even at $2.49 it's a massive rip off. Avoid at all cost or risk a heart attack trying to play whatever the hell this is.

2737	0	a	The game is very enjoyable and it's design is unique. It has flaws, but those flaws bring a type of charm to the game that is very addicting. But the port is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad that it's unplayable. The fps â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in it's pants in some areas. The controls are bad and have technical difficulties. But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it. It's a great game, but I don't think any game is worth this much. You're buying a pig in a poke with this, and I can't recommend that to anyone.

183	1	a	Lucius is a devilish game that follows a little boy hellbent on murdering everyone in his house to please his father; Lucifer. The game is broken into chapters, and in each chapter you must kill an assigned target. There is no time limit to this, which gives you plenty of time to explore the game and interact with your fantastic surroundings, and talk to the characters which have unique dialogue that change as the story progresses.  The game has some very difficult parts that take quite a bit of thinking, and a couple of easier parts. Sadly, each death is scripted and you have no choice in the way they die, which means if you replay the game, you don't get a different experience. Having said this, it is a wonderful little game, with some very interesting cutscenes. The premise is a little cliche, but the execution is fantastic, as it keeps you interested until the very end.

97	0	a	So awful that it's actually kinda good.   Hilariously over-the-top gore, unexpected nudity, laughable writing and voice acting, wonky physics, bugs galore - it's like the Goat Simulator of horror games.  The game's main problem is that it is so linear, limited and obtuse that it's pretty much essential to play with a guide so that you can follow the precise series of steps required to complete a chapter. Wandering around the mansion with no clue what to do next gets old very fast.  
85	1	a	A game where you get to play as the antichrist, I found Lucius to be alot of fun. If you're a fan of the older Hitman games (Where planning of a hit was paramount) then you will find this game rewarding. Its also a breath of fresh air since you get to be truly evil for once.   A small indie dev so don't go in expecting AAA production values.

And it's not even 'so bad it's good', I mean yeah, the graphics and animations and voices and everything are so kooky but it's an open world psychological survival horror thriller where everyone has their own schedules, and you have to eat/shave/do laudry and there's all sorts of weird side quests, some of which can't even be done until you've beaten it a few times, and Francis York Morgan is one of the single greatest video game characters ever.  I don't know, I mean, I get why at face value some people can't get behind it, but I just really feel like if you actually play it and still don't like it, I mean, I kinda feel sorry for you.

2437	1	a	This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XD  The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.  The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.  The controls are not that great.  And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.  So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).  A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)
1624	1	a	Back to 2006 where I first bought retailed version of Penumbra Collection.  Frictional Games started to release one of most intense/psychological horror first person game which become the trend for many FPS type horror. But what does, it's not about jumpscare. Penumbra introduces player with questions and goal of Phillip. Even there's no character development, the most the time each piece of his answer is revealed during playthrough. Overture still left many questions as it's first episode of series.  The solid parts of Penumbra are atmosphere and puzzle. Plain map designs but feels uncomfortable and hopeless. The puzzles play as major role of the game. It's fun, creative and encourage player to think outside the box and learn from environment. The combination of point-and-click with real time interaction are well executed. However, when it comes to combat the player don't have much choice beside guarding position and spam your weapon due to clumsy control.  Penumbra: Overture is small, interactive fun and left you with some intense moment and storyline. I enjoy everytime I picked it back in action.
1837	1	a	Do you remember when wolfeintein and Doom came out and basically invented FPS games? Years later came Half-Life and completely revolutionized the genre. The Penumbra series is the Half-Life of horror games, nuff said.
2517	1	a	This is a one B-movie of a game. Imagine a Japanese Fred Olen Ray shooting a Twin Peaks rip-off with a twist of Silent Hill and a bit of GTA. The result is a campy and cliched mess that for some unexplainable reason fits really well into late-night TV program. You hate the game for being stupid and ugly and buggy, but can't stop playing it because it's obviously a labour of love.  Too bad the publisher doesn't give a rat's â¥â¥â¥ about compatibility. Many complain about technical issues to the point that the PC port being totally unplayable. So it would probably be a better idea to get a PS3 version - which has it's own problems as well, but at least is more stable.

1739	0	a	Control method sucks. In this game you don't hold objects they kind of hover below your hand. After about 30 minutes of trying to open that fecking hatch in the snow I gave up out of frustration as the rock kept dropping willy nilly and I was not able to control its height or position with any accuracy. Why do developers have to mess with tried and true control methods i.e. grab something and securly carry it until needed. Oh and make use of the laws of physics and allow you to throw or drop an item with at least a little accuracy. Just....frustrating.
2594	1	a	Before you leave a negative review, please play trough the first chapter and apply DPfix by durante. The game itself is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a technical level (crap graphics, crap animations/lip sync) but it realy begins to shine when the story picks up.   Trust me, this is one of the best games i've ever played and it's definetly worth looking past its obvious flaws.
1973	1	a	One of the best horror games i've played, but it does has some flaws.  On the bright side, the atmosphere is fantastic, the music and sound effects are really well made, it gives the game a constant feel of dread. I found myself scared to advance in several ocassions. Even though the game game has a interesting story, at the end it only raises more questions than answers ( but there is a sequel called Black Plague, i've played a couple of hours, so far so good). Also, the character named Red, is one of the best things in the game, and the voice acting was great. The physics based controls and gameplay are also one of the (and maybe the best) best things of the game.  As i said, the game has some flaws. The game is rather short. Unless you get stuck somewhere, you can finish it in under 6 hours. The combat is a major flaw, and my biggest complain. It is poorly made and barely effective. The best resource against an enemy will be to run like hell. Also, once you figure out how to kill an enemy, most of the suspense and tension gets lost.  Overall i recomend it, it's an interesting game, and even with it's flaws, is still very scary.  7.5/10

2011	1	a	Inquisitor is a great old-school RPG game for those who wish to step in the boots of an medieval inquisitor solving crimes against God and King. The game is a little tough from the begining since you don't have many good items or money, but that can be quickly solved. The game has many maps with a nice number of dungeons crawling with enemies waiting to be hacked to pieces. The story of the game is long, exciting, full of twists and turns and can really suck you in. The quests may be a little hard since you practically have to do everything from scratch (You start from zero just like a real detective investigator) but when you solve them they give you all the more pleasure for doing so. The combat system is simple to understand, hard to master and unfortunally a little buggy and unbalanced but that shouldn't be a problem. I would recommend this game to every true RPG player. In short: + Storyline + World + Variety of texts, weapons, armor &amp; spells - Combat system - Difficult quests (but this is the charm of the game, should be under +)
309	1	a	They need to make a Lucius II.  It is nice playing as the bad guy once in a while, but making the bad guy the 6 year old boy takes sinister to a whole new level. This is more of a story than a game as some of the controls are clunky and the game is completely linear. Still the game has a unique 'evil' feel about, a 'who-dun-it' atmosphere that is backed by a great musical score. **79%**
670	1	a	This is a great game, you can interact with most things. Good texture/quality/graphics and gameplay. Some glitches, havent finished the whole game and it can be difficult since it doesen't give you many leads on what to do or where to find, what to do. It doesen't seem to have a story to be interested in but a small story like this game has is enough since you aren't playing it for the story. Could use more freeroam but where you don't get so lost in the manision. This game is something worth the try!

2203	1	a	Once you get used to or just ignore the Playstation2 generation graphics, you will find this game to be quite the gem of Twin Peaks &amp; the X-files translated through some Japanese artist &amp; game designer then translated back to English to make a highly intense mystery-action game with addictive music, humorously written &amp; deep investigation game full of horror &amp; wonder. Hooked on this game after seeing it on GiantBomb &amp; happy to play it again as it's that wicked good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (once you get used to the art/controls).

2364	1	a	(6.5/10) [65%]  Strange game, Captivating. (8/10) @first, then levels out. You need to endure, but it is engaging.  It is fascinating.crazy, but bad.frustrating at times because of, 'the raincoat killer' and ambush sequences, where You have to press keys in a certain order and have to put up with shoddy aiming.  First Impressions, +Story, +Characters, +Music and +Atmosphere... -Controls, -Crashes, -Frustrating.  This game can be too much of a *pointless.disturbing* head-case at times. //EVIL.  I recommend this game, because it is more good than bad, with a fascinating STORY and a great atmosphere. If horror is Your type of thing, it is definitely worth a look.   //Hospital End Scene Crash. for Windows 8... :(  Did these things to get past the hospital stage. ( set USEJOY = 0? to USEJOY = 1 in *configJ.cnf* ; Launcher sets it back to USEJOY = 0 ; BUT.

1287	1	a	This game much like the first is really good. I did not like it as much as the first game, but not by too much. I thought the story was still very strong, but they definitely were going for a much more 'helpless' feel and more focus on puzzles than lurking around in the dark avoiding enemies. Though actually, when considering the end of the game, this theme actually makes a lot of sense...There's definitely a lot of evidence of why they went with no combat in Amnesia after they made this. It made this game feel way more out of your control and more terrifying.

Well, now is your chance. Play as a satanic, ungrateful little â¥â¥â¥â¥ who slowly murders everyone around him because he is part of the cult.

2589	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the weirdest games ever. To give you a good analogy. Imagine if David Lynch wrote a brilliant script and gave it to Tommy Wiseau or Ed Wood to direct, then you would have a movie that would resemble this game. If this sounds like the most awesome movie ever, then you will probably enjoy Deadly Premonition. Ed Wood movies may be terrible, but their entertaining as ****.   Deadly Premonition is the brainchild of Hidetaka 'SWERY' Suehiro. I've read some interviews featuring SWERY and decided that he is completely bat**** insane and yet a genius at the same. This game went through development hell for 6 years and was almost cancelled 4 times. It seems like nobody on the team really knew how to program well, and the game was perhaps too ambitious for it's own good. When the game came out it was a broken mess. The graphics would have been good on the Dreamcast, the controls are so bad it feels like it has to be intentional(seriously, the car controls are so bad you'll have to play it to believe it), the voice acting is usally passible but can be cringe-worthy at times, the animations on the characters are laugable, the repetive yet catchy musical scores come on at the worst possible times, and despite the terrible graphics the game has horrendous performance issues. Apparently SWERY was actually shocked when critics proceeded to rip the game apart.  Despite all the games shortcomings, there were some people who loved it. Some thought the technical issues only added 'so bad it's good' charm of the game. And of course, the plot and writing of this game is brilliant, if not completely insane. It was obviously heavily influenced by the David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Many of the characters, including the main one, are completely bonkers. The main character Francis York Morgan always introduces himself by saying 'I'm Francis York Morgan, but just call me York, that's what everyone always calls me.' He constantly talks to his imaginary friend Zach. He says not to ask him about Zach, that's a 'private matter.' He literally tells his fortune by looking at the milk swirls in his coffee. To give you an idea of how crazy the writing in this game is *tiny spoiler ahead*, there's one part where a guy in a wheelchair with a skull mask and a gask mask on, who talks by whispering rhyming sentences to a translator, orders a bizzare sandwich in a restaurant. This sandwhich happens to be white bread and turkey, with strawberry jam and cereal(which appears to be corn flakes) smeared on top. York comments that this is a sinner's sandwhich, a sandwhich ones makes to punish themselves for their sins. The guy in the wheelchair challenges York to try this sandwich. After York tries it he jumps out of his chair in surprise, saying it's delicious and orders one. The expression on the two women's faces next to him is one of the moments that makes this game a masterpiece. BTW, you need to actually try the sinner's sandwich. I used Publix Italian Bread, Smucker's strawberry jam, deli turkey meat, and cornflakes. Putting the jam and corn flakes on top is ludicrous, so I just flipped the bread over. Surprisingly, it's delicous. I even made a second one after finishing the first one. SWERY says one of his starving college student friends actually made this, because he didn't have any money and those were the only ingredients he had. Too be honest, Americans put cranberry sauce and potato chips on sandwiches, so it's not too much of a stretch.  Slowly, but surely, just like the game NiER, Deadly Premonition gained gained a cult following. It did so for it's amazing writing and 'so bad it's good' gameplay. If you get this game, be aware that it may not even run properly and you might have to finish it by watching a let's play on youTube. SWERY actually apologized for this horrible port. However, there are a ton of fan patches out there to fix the problems. SWERY was flattered that the game had so much support that people would go to these lengths to make it playable. He said he wished he could hire some of the people who fixed his game. It might remind people of another cult game that was broken on release and had to be fixed by fan patches, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. That also featured terrible gameplay, but a brilliant plot.  Definitely give this game a chance if you're a fan of cult classics. At least watch a let's play on youTube to experience the plot and bizarre characters. SWERY has also created a new game, D4, which is a lot less broken and features characters that are even more insane. Sadly, SWERY's games have failed to make any money(he released D4 on the Xbone and not the PS4 I mean, come on, the only thing Xboners play is Call of Duty), and he has taken some time off to recover from an illness but insists he'll be back. We can only hope. This guy is up there with Eric Wolpaw(Portal, Psychonauts, and Old Man Murray) as one of the industry's best writers, and it would be a shame to lose him.
279	1	a	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie âThe omen.â The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.   Kinda Like it :D
2114	0	a	One of the more underwhelming games I've played. Very disappointed. It reminded me of the classic Diablo games, and as it turned out, was a cheap knock off of them lacking any charm whatsoever. The dialogue is jarring and stilted, there isn't any drive or motivation to do anything, the quests are quite bland (With the first one being to kill a certain number of bats) and the mechanics aren't properly explained. I was stuck in my inventory for a while, pondering over how to find out the stats of the items I had and what they did. Since I've played, I forgot how to do so, and there isn't any in game hints or even a manual that tells you how to do so. Overall, not a great game. If you're looking to get your Diablo fix, go play Diablo. Diablo II is a far better game than this coat-tail riding copy.
1124	1	a	Had a 90% off coupon, so I got the game for $1. Man....what an entertaining $1. I don't even like the whole zombie genre of games. But this somehow managed to keep my attention for 3-4 days till I beat it. The voice overs are hilariously bad, which adds a little humor to this simplistic drive-around-kill-everything game . The game itself is simple and pretty long if you take your time. Really kinda suprised I liked it....Try it
1625	1	a	The first episode to Frictional's survival horror franchise that put them on the map. This series, much like Amnesia, is a true blue example of how horror is done in gaming, only this series gains points of not having an arbitraty sanity meter, but then loses those points for an awful combat system that thankfully, is optional half the time. The puzzles in the game are a nice relief from fetching â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly designed slabs of stone to be placed inside indentations in walls and are actually solved through common, real world sense, such as just plain smashing that locked chest open with a rock using the dynamic click and drag world interaction system. Finally, the story is compelling, and you'd be surprised how much you'll find yourself caring for the only support character you meet, even if he's just a voice over a battered old radio. If you're a horror fan and are sick of the uneventful â¥â¥â¥â¥ that's passing for horror these days, you owe it to yourself to catch up on this series!
2113	0	a	OK first of all it has a greate storyline and I LOVE the design (old-school rpg) . BUT I has more bugs than it's story can cover. You meet the first one when yo try to create your character and the game just blacks out ... no error no nothing. Then you spend half an hour searching through the list of posible isues. Then you have to go through all the comments to find the file where they keep the settings to manually put it in windowed mode. I find this inapropriate for a game you have to pay for and this is the reason I do not recomend it.
2149	1	a	This is a really tough game to review.  Imagine a really bad restaurant. It has terrible service, terrible decor, smells bad, looks bad and is just generally unpleasant. It shows no promise at all. And yet....  ...They serve about the best main course money can buy.  Deadly Premonition's main dish is it's completely captivating story, which is brought to life by some excellent voice acting. The main characters are a really well written bunch and I found them quirky, utterly charming, charismatic and lovable. I wanted to know everything about them.  If you have seen Twin Peaks, you will not fail to notice this game has derived A LOT of inspiration from that show. Luckily it does so in a really cool and often suprising way and so it never feels like a bland ripoff. Beyond the Twin Peaks influence, it's pretty obvious the game designer, Swery, likes David Lynch's wider canon of work too, to the point that the game could be mistaken as a collaboration. Being a Lynch fan, that's not a bad thing in my book; I think other Lynch fans will love this too.   So what's not so good? I'm afraid there are quite a lot of niggles that takes the shine off the Deadly Premonition experience.  Here we go:   - My experience was massively hurt by technical problems. The game crashed constantly unless put into ME/98 compatibility+admin mode. Alas, this had the side of effect of gradually bringing frame rates down from 60fps to 10fps within 15 minutes of continued play. Repeated reboots were required to maintain a playable frame rate.  - in compatibility mode, a slew of minor bugs arose, such as gun-aiming glitches, which made the game annoying. - A unofficial hack (called DPfix) to unlock the 60fps is required. - Pretty poor graphics with a washed out palette, rough textures, and some very ropey 3D models at times. - Driving is really tedious. It takes too long to get anywhere. - The core 3rd person survival horror game is not very enjoyable.  - The RPG mechanics (health, hunger, tiredness, inventory management) are completely superflous - Time lapse mechanic is frustrating. You have to wait around for certain events to happen. Time can be sped up, but the mechanic means that you can end up passing TOO much time and missing your appointment.  - The game is littered with tedious mandatory mini-games, such as waggling the thumbstick to run away from danger, or hiding from an enemy to escape danger.  - boss battles are a chore - not scary in the slightest. (even the bits I think were meant to be scary) - Dull fetch side quests. - The game is not challenging in the slightest. - Production values are not great. Very rough around the edges. Wonky transitions between scenes and parts of the musical score.  - Story got so ridiculous it was immersion-breaking. (A mad story isn't necessarily a problem, but there needs to be some sort of underlying internal logic to make the suprises and twists truly matter)  - no steamcloud  In short, the core game is just not very good. I played this to enjoy the story and get to know the town and townsfolk of Greensvale, not for the sake of the game.   That's enough criticism. I don't want to put anyone off from giving this a go, because DAMN, the story and characters and atmosphere are SO SO good....Good enough that I can forgive that massive list of faults.  But would I recommend it to you?  Now, that is a tough question. I have to give a somewhat nuanced answer here. I'd have to ask:  - How tolerant are you of bad ports? This is one of the worst I have experienced. - Do you like brilliant stories so much you can put up with a subpar game which is very rough around the edges?  - Do you appreciate great voice acting, atmosphere, superb characters, and perhaps David Lynch's work too?   If you are pretty tolerant, likes stories, love Lynch and can put up with a game that is a quite poorly designed, go for it. You won't regret it.   If you veer the other way....stay WELL clear.   I few things to add: the game is supported by a deliciously quirky soundtrack, and features one of the most charismatic protaganists I have yet encountered in a video game: Francis York Morgan (who is up their with Garrus from Mass Effect for me)   I LOVE this game, despite its numerous faults, and I can't think of a game so in need of a modern remaster that polishes the rough edges, gives it a nice, glossy coat of paint, and improves the core game so it can be experienced by a wider audience.   It's not a whole hearted recommedation, but if you can stomach it's faults you are in for an unforgettable experience.

1474	1	a	SHORT REVIEW INCOMING PENUMBRA BLACK PLAGUE is one of the best horror games ever made. If you want to play a game like AMNESIA this is the game for you. Great atmosphere, awesome story and tight survival horror gameplay. Some of the puzzles are incredibly smart and getting chased by monsters is a breath-taking experience. By far the best PENUMBRA game.
1366	1	a	 What I liked:     Best Control interface( Using the mouse to swing open doors, and to physically throw items)    Great Atmosphere, and tension moments   What You Need to Know:      This game isn't scary to me at least ( I have yet to find a movie or game to scare me enough to not sleep at night)    Part of a trilogy (I didn't play Overture and couldn't get into Requim)    The ending is satisfiing enough to not need to play Requim    Puzzles are somewhat easy, not good enough to be one of the GREATS    Amensia is better in every way to this game, but this is good just for the decent story and atmosphere    My Score:

2429	1	a	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.

1499	1	a	I recommend Black Plague based on the scarcity of good horror games, but it is very flawed. It is much better than Overture, with combat completely removed, scarier enemies, and more varied locations. Penumbra actually has some scary moments this time. Problem-solving is generally better than in Overture, but again, logic can be inconsistent. Early on, the game teaches you that barricading doors with heavy objects doesn't work as the basic enemy simply flings the door open, but later, you have to do just that. Some sections seemed to be added just to worsen the game: a freezing outdoor segment that drains your health when away from fire, and a tedious computer puzzle involving the sorting of programs into circuit boards. If you can tolerate these annoyances, then Black Plague's interesting story and atmosphere make it a fairly good horror experience.

1231	0	a	This games was great on my other laptop. However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia). If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up. If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.   There have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck. This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card). My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).  The game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned). If they fix the game i will change my recommendation. However seeing as though i cannot play it i would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.

2188	1	a	One of, if not the most divisive video games ever created, there's good and bad with this game.   To be fair, yes the game suffers from stiff controls, very outdated graphics and animations (even  when it first released as I understand it was to be a ps2 game originally), but for me, this game was like falling out of an airplane midflight, only to land safely in a hot tub at the Playboy Mansion on trampoline night.  To be sure, there's a definite influence from the tv show Twin Peaks (I've only seen the first episode of the show and can safely make this claim), but the supernatural story, the memorable weird and  unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, the twists, open world to explore, humor, atmosphere, and adventure that bleeds its own distinct charm, this is one I'll always remember.   Highly recommended despite its shortcomings, I would tell everyone to at least give this a try.  Or at the very least, watch a lets play.  The monkey screaming Squirrels in the opening cutscene should let you know exactly the sort of  experience you're in for.

2575	1	a	I am honestly very confused by this game. I have no idea if it wants to take itself seriously or not. I can't really give it a description that does justice to how bizarre it all is. There's an FBI agent who solves crimes with the help of his imaginary friend, but you're his imaginary friend... I think? He takes advice from his coffee and the soundtrack likes to play really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up sax solos when you fail a QTE. It seems like it wants to go for the survival horror angle but is just so weirdly written and presented that it feels more like a parody that loops back around and becomes terrifying in a drug-addled fever dream sort of way.  All I can really say is give it a shot if it can be picked up in a sale for super cheap (like $5 cheap). It's certainly... something.
2667	0	a	An utterly broken piece of software. It'll run for a little bit then either fail to load the save file, stop recognizing keyboard input or simply crash. How bad does a game have to be before Steam decides to stop selling it?

1959	1	a	(TL;DR at the bottom)  Eh, if I were to sum up Penumbra: Overture, I would call it a watered down version of Black Plague, wich again was a watered down version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. You can tell quite clearly that this was frictional's first attempt at a game, and I would say it's their weakest game (after AMFP of course). The mix of combat and stealth feels kinda off, like it was tacked on, as it feels incredibly stiff and uncontrollable (yes, I realize that's to highten the tension, but I'll get back on that). Because the combat just wasn't very playtested it seems, there are some pretty obvious exploits to make game incredibly easy and pop the tension like a balloon. For example, if you stand on top of a crate/barrel, you are invincible, and you're free to smack the living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the dogs when they're trying to reach up to you. I found this exploit extremely early on and decided not to use it to get a better horror experience, but just knowing that I had this ridiculous advantage just removed the scare factor for me.  On top of that, overture suffers from the same thing as Black Plauge, wich is balance between horror and puzzles. Where BP improved a little bit on this front (I would say 65% puzzles and 35% spooks), Overture is more like a 80/20. Because of that, Overture doesn't really feel like a horror game (and even less so if you use the exploit mentioned). The entire game is laid out like this. There are about 3/4 large areas with puzzles to be solved in order, with most of the puzzles requiring an item on the other side of the area (I would guess to stretch the lenght of the game out). Now this would be fine if you had a constant mix of horror and puzzles like A:TDD, but in Overture you enter an area, kill the dogs, and then spend like 30 minutes solving the puzzles (though, a few places throw in spiders, and the last level with the giant worm. But again, these just aren't that scary, considering you have a small arsenal and the monsters are genuinely unfrightening, predictable and easy to overcome).   If you're a fan of puzzlers though, you'll feel right at home here, as Penumbra: Overture at heart, is a puzzle game with a spooky mid-tone.  TL;DR  Pros:  + Great atmosphere (at first, anyway) + Genuinely challenging puzzles + Alright story + Great voice acting + Superb writing (except for a few typos)  Neutral:  = Extremely heavy with puzzles = Ok graphichs (Quite muddy and low-res, but it gets the job done, therefore I didn't have the heart to list it as a con. The lighting is great aswell)  Cons:  - Short (3-4 hours) - The weapons are poorly implemented - Predictable and non-threatening enemies - Repetetive gameplay - Some odd level design here and there    I'm on the fence with this one. I mean, it's a good PUZZLE game, but not a good HORROR game. I'm just barely giving this one a reccomendation, as there are ways of playing that make it scarier, and it's stealth aspect, but if you're looking for horror, look elsewhere.  Overall: 6/10

170	1	a	I rather enjoyed this game. Playing a precocious child by the name of Damien Dante, you have to kill people. Why? For the glory of Satan of course. This game is pretty much just The Omen: The Videogame. You have to figure out how to kill people without getting caught. The only problem is there is just one person per level that you kill, and there is only one way to kill that person. So it does not play like a sandbox murder simulator, it plays like an adventure game. That means it is boring. Even rudimentary skills at rpgs or adventure games will make this one far too easy. But still, it was fun. With the exception of the 20 hr and 40 hr acheivements, that is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t when I can, without cheating, complete the game in 6 hrs. The style of game also makes it not replayable. Buy it if you can get it on sale for super cheap.

Besides, this is a small screen what can not be enlarged to full screen. The bones of decaying humanoids apparently are stronger then a steel pipe. Wasting bulets on extremely slow monsters?

2728	0	a	I tried to play the game Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut yesterday. This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010. It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.  Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.  Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.  This is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the 'quirky dialogue' as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.

I am a big fan of mystery/adventure games and this game and controls were absolutley awful and half the time couldn't even make out where I was going and kept bumping into nothing. The 'ghost' at the beginning was laughable and reminded me of something out of the grudge. I did not even finish this game and turned it off after 5 minutes of playing as I was fed up and bored. Sorry but if you are a fan of adventure games like me , I do not recommend this game as it will be a big disappointment. I want a refund even if was Â£1.99

Pros: -Great great concept of the game.  -Great character.  -Interesting ways of killing people.  -Loved the consistency throughout playing it.  Cons:  -There were a few bugs that I noticed. To list some: Falling out of the map, biking outside of the house, and... TELEPORTING PRIESTS.  -Final 'boss' battle, was too simple, but required the thinking to pull it off quickly. -I felt bad for some of the people I killed (LOLNOPE)  Overall an 8.5/10 game. Would run around burning people and biking over the dead bodies again.

2343	1	a	Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.  TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.   With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game 'good' or 'bad.' It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.  There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.

2758	0	a	This game seems so promising. I mean, it's based on Twin Peaks, and amazing TV show, that still to this day is relevant, and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are so many bugs, crashes, and errors that this game is hard to recommend. Hard, because I WANT to recommend it, but when a game is as faulty as this one, I simply cannot endorse it.  These Japanese developers cannot hide behind the quality of their games anymore, when offered on consoles. They need to put forth the effort to make them playable on PCs as well, something they seem reluctant to do. It's unfortunate, because I love a lot of the games Japan offers, but I cannot in good conscience stand behind something that is so obviously flawed in the PC market.  Even the much maligned Konami(boy is that a change given how much they were loved through the 80s and 90s) offers ports that are better performing than much of the Japanese games in the PC games market. It's really unfortunate, since I don't think PCs are beyond Japan's understanding. They seem to be people with a great understanding of electronics, yet play by the rules of consoles, and not the openended way of PCs. I hate to break it to Japan, but choice is a way of life, and rigidity enforced by consoles is simply a way of the past. The PS4 and XBone are proving that. They came out recently, and yet are far behind the PC market. People who want more power, and are willing to put in the work to access that, will always be far ahead of the console market. Many developers recognize that, and make games catering to the PC market. Even guys like Totalbiscuit will recognise that in the beginning of his reviews, highlighting what the options portion of the game allow a player to customize. The old ways of the console have become antiquated. The personal computer, while being around since the 80s, if not farther back than that, offers more choice and customization, and the offerings of hardware allow multiple different price points of entry. That is the way of the future, rather than a one size fits all console offering.  Most of the world has accepted this. Japan would do well to join the trend. Now I realize I am singling out this developer, who may have felt backed into a corner, with consoles the best chance of success. However, I realize that in today's times, 2015, consoles are NOT your best choice, regardless of the market. You adapt, or fall behind.

2244	1	a	Let's just get something out of the way here: this port is one of the worst ports I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Even after following a lengthy list of instructions and applying the DPFIx, DP: Directors' Cut features a butchered, shoddy port that is prone to frequent crashing, weird speed ups and slow downs, bizarre physics mishaps, corrupted saves, and a really, really weird issue where playing for more than two hours in one sitting can result in some... interesting... consequences for the engine.  And even if the game wasn't completely broken, it still suffers from a myriad of problems. The combat is abysmal. Not only does it feel tacked on, it literally is tacked on, as confirmed by Swery65, who explained that his publisher forced the decision in an effort to garner more sales. The combat is tedious, featuring only two distinct enemies: ones that die quickly with no effort and ones that take up five minutes of your time in pure tedium â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. If the combat is supposed to provoke a challenge, it is easily negated by how easily you can cheese the gameplay by acquiring infinite ammo and durability weapons early in the game, but not even instakill weapons can save you from a never ending supply of quicktime events.  Disregarding the gameplay, the graphics are incredibly poor. I'm not one to turn my nose at dated graphics, as some of my favorite games are before Steam was even a thing, yet Deadly Premonition released in 2010, the same year as Red Dead Redemption, Halo Reach, and Mass Effect 2. Going up against these games graphically is a bit ridiculous when the game looks like it came out in... 2006, but whatever.  At this point, you may be wondering why there's a postive thumbs up next to my review, since I've done nothing but trash Deadly Premonition. Well, the truth is that this game is the best worst game I've ever played. Like I've pointed out, there's just so much wrong with DP: DC, and yet, it's an incredible experience. All of the characters are well written and lovable, and all form a cohesive, believable community and setting. Dialogue is as bizarre as it is hilarious, and trust me, there is plenty of writing to enjoy. Weird quirks dominate the scene, such as having every single character follow a routine and schedule based on a variety of factors, and allowing sidequests only when the time is right, and pulling those sidequests away from you if you're too slow to grab them. Additionally, Deadly Premonition has care in weird areas that I've not seen in other games before, like letting you use your turn signal in a vehicle, or having your character be able to grow a beard and shave it regularly, or most unique of all, having your character sleep under the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blankets.  Name me one game that lets you sleep under the covers besides Deadly Premonition.  ... *Ahem*  All in all, Deadly Premonition is a bizarre, flawed, hilarious, witty, diamond in the rough. It has a ton of bad, but if you're willing to put up with the bad and push through, you'll discover a truly unique experience that no other game will ever deliver quite the same.

375	0	a	I guess, seeing trailers a lot of people may get an impression that Lucius is something like sandbox killing game... a Hitman game with demonic powers. Sadly - it's not.  In a game, you play a role of Lucius, a young boy, who - thanks to his Grandfather's occult involvement - posses demonic powers. Each month, he's visited by Lucifer himself and each month he has to kill a new target. It's an interesting, if not slightly controversial concept, which should have allowed for wide spectrum of possibilities. And even first 3 of the chapters show a fair amount of potential that this game should have used to maximum.  Well, the main problem of the game is that - there are no alternative solutions to a problem. After 5 or 6 missions, you realize that - even though 'the playground' is getting bigger and bigger - the concept and possibilities the game gives you stay exactly the same. This essentially makes the game just a shallow adventure game, where player's task isn't to find the best way to kill a target, but finding a way that developer's designed.... even if it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so - in later levels, you're running back and forth, through a gigantic mansion, trying to find that one object that you need to finish up your task, only to find something that is as big as rock or battery(!). This alone wouldn't be so bad, if the game gave you enough hints on what you're looking for or what you have to do, but that isn't a case.  Not only that - the game sometimes doesn't even fallow the rules of 'smart level design' and places many objects that you have to use in shadows and badly lighten places - the type of places, where a player is least likely going to look for them. I remember being stuck in chapter 10 for good 10 minutes, only to realize that objects I was looking for were hanging on the wall - the only place in the entire the room, that was in the shadows. Finally, the design on a mansion itself is extremely confusing and it's going to take good few hours, before you're going to learn where to go, to not run in circles.  From all of that, you may get an impression that I completely hated the game. That isn't the case. When everything was going fine and I had any idea what to do, where to find it etc. - the game was fairly entertaining. And storyline - even though, idea behind it felt flat on its face after 7 chapters - kept me interested enough to keep playing till the very end. The number of achievements also helped quite a bit, making me feel rewarded even for the most minor of tasks.  When it comes to graphics - Lucius looks decent. It's more or less something that I'd except from a game of this calibre. There are few textures that don't look right and few places in a house, that feel empty, but it isn't anything game breaking. Character animations sometimes look a little stiff - especially facial animation could use some work. There are also some weird problems with optimization, where a framerate drops in some areas for no obvious reason, but - once again - because it isn't really an action game, I don't consider it a major problem.  Lucius also has a decent music. Although, by the end of the game, you'll hear each of the tracks way too many times. Sound assets are good and fitting for the most part. Voice acting however is a mixed bag. I've played an English version and I personally wouldn't say that for the most part actors are doing a bad job. It's more of a case that script they had to work with and lines they had to deliver aren't very good. It's also obvious for me that in many places, they weren't given enough directions on how should they play their roles, which results in some hilarious conversations in few parts of the game.  Bottom line - I'd avoid Lucius for the price of 20â¬ or even 10â¬. However - with 75% discount, I could recommend it to people that like adventure games or simply don't mind checking walkthroughs. It's a 6-8hrs long mediocre game, that sometimes shows its potential, but at the same time - is flawed with problems.

2544	1	a	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around. (The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)  - Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic.   - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.

88	1	a	Lucius is a gem of its own kind.  The story, very original, compliments and works perfectly with the very original and unique gameplay. Even though the basic concept remains the same throughout the game, it never fails to feel new and more innovative each time, by asking you to really sit and think about how to proceed in your tasks. It's also very challenging ! You may get stuck on a few of the murders as they will really push you to be creative in your process of thoughts.  It just was fun. Very fun.  Now of course it's not perfect : there are a few minor bugs scattered around, and the gory/satanic side of the game may give people some trouble, but then again that's what to expect with such a game.
2091	0	a	The writing and story is great so far (I am not too far into it just yet.)  The mechanics of controls, journal references, combat, and combat balance, is like stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.  I am personally torn, I want very much to continue the story, but I can't stand another hour of the mechanics.  If good writing and an interesting story is enough to carry any game for you, then this might be a game worth picking up, especially if you find it on sale for $0.99USD like I did, or in a very cheap bundle deal. At full price, no one should consider touching it, even if you love great stories, it isn't worth $10 USD, buy a book instead.

1874	1	a	Pros: Very immersive, almost no hud.  Does a very good job at making intense chase scenes, require you to think on your feet and not just simply 'run away fast enough'. Puzzles are significantly more complex than amnesia's.  Lots of interatable items.  Cons: Has a weapon mechanic, which leads to some good puzzles and chase scenes, but also allows killing of monsters. The mechanics of using weapons are also really bad in some cases. Requires the second game to get full experince. Requires finding very specific items, which if not found quickly could result in you searching for hours for them, only to look it up online and find you threw a couch cusion over it.    I would recommend Black Plague over Overture, but both games are solid story-driven horror games. Combined, Overture and Black Plague make for a scarier experince than amnesia IMO.  If you have really bad arachnophobia, it may be a bit unsettling to know that spiders are very common in the game.
393	0	a	  You play as the son of the Lucifer who goes on a killing spree while hiding in plain sight and make sure nobody suspects you in this game. Sounds fun, right?  Sadly, no, this game isn't as fun as it sounds on theory.  I really tried to like this game, I really did. But with mediocre story, boring puzzles, annoying music, confusing gameplay (you'll definitely need a walkthrough at some points) and not to mention the random glitches, I just cant make myself recommend this on a full price. Luckily this goes on sale/giveaway every so often so if you still feel like giving it a try, get it then.

1997	1	a	When playing a survival / horror game, atmosphere is definitely a key factor in immersing you in the game... which Penumbra Overture does just fine. Puzzles are simple tailoring the games' story line. The sounds are also simple yet enough to send chills down your spine.   What makes takes this game back is the stupid AI of the dogs and the awkard handing of the weapon.  Graphics ain't top notch but it's still worth a try to play the game.

120	0	a	Lucius is one of those games where so much could have been done, but nothing was. It is very linear, you cannot decide who you want to kill and when, but the game tells you who, and exactly how to do it. It introduces new skills when they are to be used. The characters have no character, except for the father and the detective. Either the mansion is too big, or there is too little in it. I did enjoy the story-telling element of the detectives puzzlement.  I got Lucius on sale for 90% off, and that is a more fair price at which I would recommend it.

2970	0	a	In principle it is probably a 'thumbs up' game. Alas, it wont run on my PC, no matter the tweaks with PhysX, DPFix, etc. pp. Hence the thumbs down. Apparently it is a poor console port to the PC.

406	0	a	This is a game I got on sale for $1. The most i'd pay for it is maybe 3, and after getting to chapter 5 i can't recommend it. Figuring out how to kill your victims is an extremely boring process, probably even more so if i didnt use any walkthroughs or anything like that. It's also a big flaw that each of the victims only has one way they can die, so you get no freedom in that, which is what would make the game fun (if it had it). Kinda fun, very very boring and not worth the work once you finally figure out how to finish the chapter. I'd only recommend it it's on a big sale.  p.s. my hours aren't accurate, ive probably left the game open on accident a few times.

1692	1	a	Just like Black Plague, this game deserves a spot in every horror fan's heart. As this is the first game in the series, I'd suggest to start with this one. I also like the Penumbra games way better than Amnesia as I think that the story has more depth to it. Enjoy!

144	1	a	After completing the game I decide to write a review within minutes of completing the game no spoilers are included: The game is about killing everyone in your house without getting caught and using unique ways of killing. The game has decent graphic despite only a few characters having proper walking animations and everyone else just wobbles. There are some glitches like being cornered and then pushed off the map, but glitches are bound to happen with old game. I do have to say without help from a few guides on some missions that lacked explanation or I have not notice.

Downloaded every mod and patch to fix it: none worked.  They should rename the game: 'System Restore, the reboot joyride!'  Please steam, don't get your customers steamed up. Just give me a refund or store credit and I'll try a different one.

2284	1	a	Because it's like Twin Peaks but MORE mental.   That said, it's a real mess of a port, and the patches still haven't fully fixed it. You have to get used to saving at every opportunity so that frequent crashes to desktop won't ruin too much progress.  But even in spite of that, it's still really worth having if you have an appetite for strange.

I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10

2959	0	a	As much as I want to recommend this game, I really don't think it's worth buying.  Many other reviewers give this a thumbs up because of the game itself, which is indeed fun and unique. But this port is so awful it's definatly not worth the money. It's crashing more consistently than any other game I've played. Playing it is an excercise in stubborness, and every time you do ANYTHING your first thought is run to a save point before it crashes and I have to repeat that again.  It doesn't matter how good the game is if it's unplayble. Do not buy this unless the devs fix this terrible PC port. If it gets patched then definatly get it. Not before.

Anyone who says this game isn't a ripoff is either in denial or didn't watch a single episode of Twin Peaks...  I really wanted to enjoy this game but I couldn't. The execution is really good but the tired story has completely ruined it.  pros:  +atmosphere +good soundtrack +cool protagonist +good gameplay  cons:  -boring missions -outdated graphics -disappointing story  Avoid this game if you have already watched Twin Peaks because it's basically the same thing but in a video game form.

1300	1	a	Penumbra Black Plague is the second entry in the Penumbra trilogy. Maturing from the action-puzzle of Overture, Black Plague is a survival-horror. With puzzles. It has great scenes and is worth the time it takes to play. If you are looking for a good story and a survival-horror that is not as scary as Amnesia (by any means) pick Black Plague up!

2285	1	a	Deadly Premonition tries so hard to be Twin Peaks and a survival horror. Because of the lack of fundings, the entire game feels like a cheap Twin Peaks/Resident Evil 4 knock off but not an awful knock off. Just cheap. People tend to have mixed feelings about this game. People seems to adore it, while others just can't stand this game. I understand both statements. If you can bear the awful pc port, awful survival horror part; go ahead. If you are a Twin Peaks fan, you gotta give this game a try. Even if you don't like it, you have to agree that this game has a cult following since its release.

This is one reason I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It's simply too buggy to play. The game crashes constantly. At ~14 hours gameplay, the game crashed (which happened frequently) but this time my save file was corrupted. So now I can start over from the beginning, or uninstall. Uninstall it is.  Maybe one day I will try it again &amp; keep a backup of my save file,  maybe ...

1731	1	a	Okay, so the best thing about this paranormal/survival horror game is the one thing many games out there don't have and which is my biggest peeve: ENVIRONMENTALLY INTERACTIVE. Yes, Finally, a game designer had a brain. I hate when there are things in the room and they are just made to look pretty and not be messed with, like part of the building's structure. If you see a book, you can pick it up. If you see a mattress, you can toss it, use it for a puzzle, launch it over a cliff. Glass can be broken. Hell, throw a barrel at your enemy and watch him stumble. How control how you pick it up and where you want it to go, Go play jenga with barrels and bags of garbage. XD  As for that, the rest of the game is very enjoyable in a very dark and strange way. The lighting, the atmosphere, the game dynamics. Very nice. Never had an issue with the game, including gameplay, puzzles, exploring. The game's sequel Black Plague is also just as enjoying, but not so much as the expansion Requiem.  I highly recommend this game.     NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.
1689	1	a	Awesome game! Must buy X3
1168	1	a	Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!
