2807	0	a	I was really starting to like this game when I realised that there's a major bug with aiming. First I thought I was just really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb and couldn't solve how to get this object down from a tree... you're suppoed to shoot it down but it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ING IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥ CAN'T AIM HIGHER THAN COUPLE OF METRES VERTICALLY!!!!!!! If you don't want to lose your wits while trying to fix this bug then don't buy this game. On the other hand if you're one of the lucky ones you may not have to deal with the bug but I wouldn't risk it.

2304	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.  That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldnât miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.  In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and itâs up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the townâs biggest case yet.  Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.  The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where âan ingenious law school student â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ over 800 victimsâ to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think youâve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.  Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, itâs also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however itâs worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.  Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.  When youâre not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, youâll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesnât get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While youâre shooting enemies you may encounter the âRaincoat Killerâ who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesnât find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.  I think I should also mention the graphics; they wonât impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.  Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole âso bad itâs goodâ tactic perfectly.  Itâs nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.  The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, itâs like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.  After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.  However I think itâs now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you donât have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.  If youâre curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: âDeadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. Itâs perverse, itâs wrong, and yet itâs so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing funny.â  There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.  The game is not only so bad itâs good; itâs so bad its borderline perfection!

3015	0	a	I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it. I seem to have fallen in love with it from the first time i played it back on my 360, then to the second time on PS3, now looking to do the hat trick by fully completing it once again on PC!  But For the love of GOD as much as i want to i can't! As much as i want to play my favourite game i can't due to the simply shocking port of it on PC. Constantly crashing, unreliable at almost every turn, and most recently when i hit act 1 Chapter 6 and saved outside the Greenvale Community Centre, my save file will not load at all. It shows the loading screen then tabs me out the game saying 'Dp.exe has stopped responding'  So i warn you all now, fans of this game it is fantastic and the thought of playing it once again is exciting. But it's an utterly appaling port. Hence why it saddens me to downreview this just for that.
2339	1	a	I LOVE THE GAME.... But the downside is the PC Port the sound quality and the effects are horrible especially 5.1 but overall it's a cult classic it's a beautiful game,there's something about this game that just simply reminds me of Sega I just can't put a pin on it but I know it's something nostalgic but with that being said the storyline is so rich it draws you in and just how corny the jokes are....to put it simply just reminds me of an old-school corny detective movie do I recommend the game?, yes but buy it when it's on sale... like i did for 3 bucks

I shift tab - CRASH Press escape - Crash Full screen mode- Crash Windowed - Crash. I don't have a bad computer and am unsure why this is happening but it seems to be unavoidable. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in such a poor state, that I can't even start it up. Sigh, $24... waste.
432	0	a	If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the game major source of fun which is killing.  You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!

3045	0	a	This is a fun, quirky, game that unfortunately got a miserable PC port. When I start it up, I'm greeted by a black screen - I can hear the intro playing but I can't see anything. Through trial and error, I discovered that it was due to having my gamepad connected. Unplugging my gamepad allows me to play the game but I'm stuck with keyboard controls in a game that was clearly designed for controllers.  You have to download a fan-made patch to raise the resolution beyond 720p and there's just a whole host of other technical problems. Play this one on a console if you can.

2617	0	a	I wish I could give this a positive review, because the game itself it great. But the PC version is nearly unplayable. If you want to play Deadly Premonition (which you should, it's a great game) I'd recommend playing the xbox 360 version if it's available to you. I've tinkered with this game for hours and it still won't work, and it seems the developers have no intention of fixing this version of the game as it's been unplayable for years. I actually bought this when it first came out and gave up in frustration, and now, years later, it's still broken. I have to give this a thumbs down. Sorry.

2197	1	a	i seriously loved playing the game,i first watched half of it as a let's play a and bought + played it all by myself.  many people (Especially developers) think let's play videos make less of their games sell,while if you ask me,they do the opposite. Many games get reviews and trailers...but often they can't really convince people to try a game since they do not know if it's worth it. Let's plays give them more a feel for the game and convince them to experience it by themselfs aswell.  i loved how the game turned from a crime investigation...to a horror hunt for a killer that could be anyone and anything,i wish the raincoat killer would have been fought in his outfit/Character...but besides that,i loved every aspect of the game.  if you guys like in depth mysteries,great soundtracks,characters and horror games in general...go ahead and purchase it,it's worth every coin and i would pay TWICE it's price just cause of how awsome it is,good job SWERY !

2558	1	a	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.

699	1	a	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.

2294	1	a	Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.  This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.  You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?  Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.  Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain  weirdness  of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.  If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.  The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.

1660	1	a	I tried playing Amnesia multiple times but was terribly bored and not sacred (though I could never last long enough to get to anything that actually happened I guess). I was afraid that Penumbra: Overture would be similar, but luckily it was not.  The graphics are not amazing by any means, but this almost just adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game. In fact, most of the horror elements of the game are just by sheer creep-factor, suspense, and tension alone. The story and atmosphere do most of the work, but they do it pretty well.   Combat is a little difficult - weapons are melee-only and swing pretty slowly. Weapons movements are not very fluid, but once you get used to it it's not terrible.   Overall, it's worth playing, but know that you have to continue on to the next games in the series to get any sort of conclusion to the story (based on having just finished Overture, apparently the first in the series).  One thing though - a lot of the combining inventory items and figuring puzzles out seemed almost impossibly difficult. I don't use walkthroughs very often at all, but I did for the majority of this game, and I have no idea how anyone could get through it without a walkthrough. Maybe I was impatient, but I think I definitely would have simply stopped playing the game if I wasn't 1) brought in by how scary it was and 2) the ability to use a walkthrough - otherwise I definitely would have put the game down and wouldn't have bothered. It's just not the type of game you *want* to spend tons of time on - you just want to play it. Perhaps I should play through Amnesia with a walkthrough...
2184	1	a	  After 7 hours of play, I can say that this is one of the best games of which I had the pleasure of playing and I want to still play for much longer. This is an open world horror (which to me is splendid), which gives you various situations and things to do and explore. The city is fairly large and strongly recommend not to risk walking out because there are several places spread very far corners of the map, and so there are police cars to take you, and no, you are not a ride in this game you must control the car and it is possible both at first and in the third person. Something that caught my attention is the amount of commands to do so, beyond the standards, give arrow and have control over the lights at any time, as well as using the windshield when it is raining because the game there day transition and changes in time. For this reason the various possible locations may not always be available because everything has its time due to happen. There markets, gas station, houses and other various places to explore, and you can fish in certain places, of course with proper equipment to do so. All of these sites available no atoa, your character beyond the life bar and stamina, there is also the sleep bars and hunger. For this there is a hotel and some houses you have access to sleep in almost any location truth, if not all, it has a bed can rest. About hunger not always have time to go on the market and that is why there are machines where you can buy some food. This also applies to sleep, do not always have a bed available and the way is turn taking cafes stored in inventory. There is gun shop, but perhaps the most interesting is to get the weapons infinite ammunition obtained in side quests. The game has a police series style several years ago, full of stereotypical characters and cliched situations, the beginning of the keep itself has fragments of what happened in the chapter you are both in photos and with excerpts of speeches. Your character is an FBI agent and called Francis York Morgan, but he always says that it is to call him York, and I've got a 'special' name if I present myself this way and the other ignores it tends to say this for some reason did not like me. That's what happens when you present to the sheriff of the town of Greenvale, George Woodman calling York 'mrs. Morgan '. This ends up just causing a bad impression. You come to this city because the murder happened it resembles the other which has investigated, and so he joins the local police: the sheriff with his closed way of being, the beautiful Emily Wyatt and sweet Thomas MacLaine (Interpret 'sweet' as you prefer). In several game moments you can chat with Zach something or someone who is close to our protagonist, but that would be really someone or is it just a hallucination (a second personality perhaps?). In these conversations with Zach, they talk about various things such as films giving various details about the same as the actors, scenes, who is the director and so follows ... but it is more often when we are in the car, it is You can hear a real dialogue, at other times only York speech, apparently alone and this comes to interrupt others and occasionally other people wonder about such conversations with passengers also take place and it will you should tighten the button to start. Deadly Premonition despite being a horror game, occasionally happens comic scenes, however not all actually have felt in those moments stereotypes given much emphasis. Like when York eating a cookie at the police station and say you need to know where it was purchased because it is delicious at this time Thomas gets all embarrassed and bashful and says it was he who made ... (something that usually happens when the girl gets a compliment someone who finds beautiful or who she likes). Time failed typically receive punishments already expected to come face to face with the place closed or even end up getting a 'earful' lack of commitment to the case, as it is possible that the passage of operating time you are invited to remove and this will force you to 'spend time' in some way, perhaps one of the best ways is smoking (consumable item).  The gameplay takes place in three situations (places) different: the real world, the spiritual world and dreams. In fact, the real world to the spiritual is something reminiscent of 'Silent Hill', this transition usually occurs when the character you want to do something alone. On the game mode, it is quite simple, but the sight itself is very difficult to have control, but nevertheless it is possible to 'turn around' with what he has. The other commands usually respond well. Something I saw people complaining are the car's controls are terrible and you end up stuck in places, well I never had many problems, perhaps the fact that I always played first-person account for this. The car has also status, nothing else, just the physical condition and the amount of gasoline. However if you are in the middle of nowhere and end up having to leave the car do not worry, use the signal that exists in inventory and it will bring a new car for you (100% / 100%). The game also has moments of multiple choices and quick time events.  Things that caught my attention in particular: - The menu in the game which is very interactive} - Soundtracks that are great and together with the sound effects give a greater strain on the player. - There are secondary missions of various types: how to make a stretch in less time or find something and give it to someone. - In certain game moments are informative situations, such as in the car with Zach and they talking about movies or even a part of the beginning with Thomas where you need to find a key with a kind of 'squirrel' (if I'm not mistaken) of something specific and every key handed it says it is not right that speaks the characteristics of each species. - There are cards collectibles in the game. I do not know really say what happened to me, but this was perhaps the only game of this style that I felt committed to continue to play and I just loved it from its beginning until now (but I believe it will continue until its end) . Afraid I was very deceived with the game I was behind other analysis and had a completely different view from mine, I finally found one that was negative, talked about the graphics and gameplay treating them as bad, also spoke to this was a game considered a cult, but that could be seen as a masterpiece depending on the person.  tÃ­tulo: Deadly Premonition: obra prima ou pseudo cult?

This game reminds the 'Omen' movies that are a must to watch if you like horror movies with satanic characters.  I played 10.5 hours to end the story with a bit of exploration and to complete all the second quests and,finally,I think that Lucius is a very good game to play,but not spend 20â¬(yes,I'm Italian :D ) to buy this game!Wait for some sales,like I did!  Thanks for the attention!Bye ;)

1800	1	a	 (Original post date and time: Jan 15, 2013 @ 11:25pm)  Penumbra: Overture is very much worth the money! This game is scary, but it doesn't rely on random scares(jumpscares) most of the time to make it scary, this game relies on it's environment and ambience to give the player that unsettling feeling so they can get the full experience out of the game! If you enjoy horror games, this will most likely feed your hunger for horror and some!
2510	1	a	If you love survival horror games and Twin Peaks, you'll freaking love this game. Great game that was really underated.
83	0	a	An interesting concept, though poorly done. Doesn't worth to be picked up, unless on a very big sale.  Lucius has a very good story, decent graphics and amazing voice acting, though the bugs, glitches and the limited gameplay ruins the chances for an entertaining experience.  Being the son of Lucifer, he does have quite a few paranormal abilities, still, making his tricycle drive for a few seconds after he gets off it and eventualy crush half of it into the floor - is definetly not one of them. Same with Lucius walking through closed doors and getting into places where he is not supposed to be. Noticed this once in the middle of the game, and once again at the very end, when you're supposed to kill your father in the burning house, somehow i walked through the front door (which was locked) and could't manage to get back inside after trying for a half hour, ultimately being forced to restart the game. Yet, this is all pice of cake. The most annoying glitch in this game are the hints. It's not enough that they are kind of unclear, but sometimes they appear after you already completed the task, leaving you in the most complicated missions without no clue what to do. As for example there is a mission where you must kill one of your maids and the only hint is 'she is doing laundry'. After i spent about 2 hours trying everything that came into my mind, i finally gave up and decided to watch a walkthrough where i found out that i'm supposed to use telekinesis to pick up an iron from a top shelf and drop it into the washing machine, then start it. By doing this you'll brake the washing machine and leave the maid without an occupation, then she'll decide to take a bath giving you the opportunity to kill her. How the hell was i supposed to know this ? And guess what ? After i broke the washing machine i got the hint that i should do so...  What i hated the most was the limited gameplay. The history was already written for you. You can run around in a huge house, interact with the people you find, but you can't choose which one to kill, or at least how to kill him. Each crime is to be commited in order, and by the specific methods, even the special powers that you have can be used just on specific missions, specific people or objects...  I would recommend to skip this one, unless you get the occasion to pick it up on a very big sale (at least 80%) just for the heck of it.

1706	1	a	the overture is the first game in penumbra series and its also first game by frictional games and you can see its their first game  story-you go into the mine where you trying to find something that leads to youre characters father because he probably did some research and something screwed up,and then he dissapeard (i guess)  along the way you encounter youre only enemy in this game........Dogs.......zombie dogs. yeah and then there is a giant worm but he wont chase you throghout a whole game so whats the point but lets talk about zombie dogs.who the hell thought they will be good enemies?! if you kill them they respawn but even with that theyre not good enemies.youre always quicker so you can lose them and if you will see dead end ahead of you,well dont worry just throw stuff at them they will stop.God even spiders youll meet are more terrifying.  thats not the games only flaw.youll might love the envoirment of the mine but me...well im sorry but it was quite boring envoirment,it felt all the time same for me  with that what i said you might think i hate the game but actualy i think its quite decent. puzzles are decent and made me think for a while and even though i said that enemies sucks,atmosphere is really great and it actually feels like a horror the story isnt the best but also not the worst  to sum up the game is decent but ill rather reccommend playing second one because i think that second one is better but if you want to know what happened in the begining go ahead and play it.its quite short so even if wouldnt like it you can end it in less then 3 hours   not bad start for frictional games  6,5/10
1425	1	a	The best way to describe this game? My heart just cried the whole time.
78	0	a	A brilliant concept, but inescapably dull gameplay. You have to spend too much time wandering around looking for objects, or specific interactions, and because the game's kills are so linear, there is no way around this.   A great idea, well built atmosphere and theme, but it just isnt really worth the time. Also, my xbox360 controler did not work for this game despite 'full controler support'.   6/10

1836	1	a	One of the best horror games for PC. Must play for any horror fan.
2321	1	a	What has often been referred to as one of the 'best-worst' games of all time. Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.  The game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him' and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?  Balancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately 'wacky' music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?  Yes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.  York and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious 'discussions' about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and 'Jaws' amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.  Deadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!  Edit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.

770	1	a	So, only a day into playing Lucius I am already enthralled in starting my career as a profressional serial killer. Not only has this game taught me the necessary skills, but it has helped me master the art of confering with the devil.  10/10 would sell my soul again!
2394	1	a	This game... It's just weird, in a good way. Kind of like Twin Peaks. If your into horror games and want to try a game that's out there. Pick this one up, it will not disappoint.
2739	0	a	There's broken games, like Bioshock and dark souls 1, all fixable with tweaking and fixes  Then there's Deadly Premonition, a cancerous mass that even mods and tweaks can't save. They can only spruce it up, but now we just have a spruced up corpse on our hands. A zany, goofy, unique spruced up corpse on our hands.
581	0	a	I didn't find the game to be that interesting or intuitive. There's no motivation from the main character to bring about the horrific deaths of other people in the house except 'Satan appeared in my room one night and told me that if I murder people I get more psychic, I am totally okay with this.' Like, okay, sure. I'll fumble around with no hints and kill people I have no/minor grudges against, sounds great.

Watch all the cutscenes on Youtube  While there's approximately 6 hours of cutscenes, you'll find this to be much more enjoyable. The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next.   Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).

1317	1	a	A fun and scary adventure horror game. Reccomended if you like horror where you are un-armed and have to sneak.
107	1	a	It's entertaining, short, adventure, puzzle quest game with many gruesome deaths, little bit of nudity and few plot twists.   Game is straight forward - there is only one way to kill each person and you must find all items to do it. Even with all quest items, it may take some time to understand what and where is required to do, but luckily there are guides for that.  Don't expect open world here - mansion and garden is all you can explore.  Graphics even on Ultra High left me unsatisfied. You may encounter some bugs, restarting chapter will fix that.  There are 2 endings. First is easy, 2nd takes some time to do it right, but will reward you with more satisfying ending, a la horror movies.   Don't expect too much, this is no AAA title, but good for indie developers. Buy it on sale and you won't regret it.  P.S. Don't let your kids play this.
2810	0	a	The game itself is great, but playing the PC port was one of the worst gaming experiences I've my life. THIS GAME IS BROKEN DO NOT BUY IT.  Right off the bat the game had problems. It would crash upon starting, and had to be trouble shooted to even work. Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash. At its worst point, I had to download a save file from someone else that was past a crash point just to continue the game.  Here are some of the fun things I did during the course of this game -download a fan made patch to 'fix' things -Run the game in older windows compatability modes to get past crashes -switch the game to windowed mode to get past crashes -lower the resolution to get past crashes -download save files that are past crash points -dig through the game files and repair files in hopes it stops crashes -turn off steam overlay to stop crashes -ask on forums how to get past crashes at specific points  I couldn't even finish the game. I someone made it all the way to the epilogue and hit another crash wall. At this point I couldn't take it anymore and just watched the ending on Youtube.  I tweeted the creator of the game, and he replied that he had nothing to do with the PC port and that its the PC development company's fault. I tweeted the development company and they told me there is nothing they can do because they don't have a development team for Deadly Premonition anymore.  It sucks because the actual game itself is great &amp; unique. Do yourself a favor and get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead.

3030	0	a	As an open world detective game my thought is, what's not to like? There's going to be a murder to solve, you're free to roam and take on side missions, and there's something creepy and supernatural going on. Unfortunately, this is the definition of a bad port, and probably shouldnt be on steam at all. The game just isn't stable, and it looks horrible. The controls also leave a lot to be desired, at least if you're using a controller. Fortunately, the community of gamers have done a lot to support the game and fix what they can. My version looks a whole lot better, and is a bit more stable as a result. My confusion however, is why steam, and the original developer would want to be affiliated with all these known problems with no attempt to correct for it.

73	0	a	A fairly mediocre adventure game with an even worse story. Got bored really quickly of the mechanics of the game and the story never really interested me. It is a surprisingly violent game but I personally think it doesnt really add much to the experience.  It also has two really poorly designed achievements that require you to play a total of 20 hours and 40 hours of the game. Why is this poor design? Considering the game can easily be beaten in 7-9 hours the high time requirement just doesnt make much sense. Sure, the 20 hour one could be conisdered a 'beat the game twice' kind of achievement but as the game really lacks reasons to play it more then once not even that one feels justified. The 40 hour achievement just feel like they want people to keep the game running longer as free advertising.   Time to 100%:  40 hours

2160	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a very polarizing game. Yes, the gameplay can feel like absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ (the driving controls still kill me even to this day) and the PC port itself is pretty catastrophic (random crashes, ahoy!), but this game has a lot of heart with a pretty thrilling story and interesting characters to boot.  Definitely recommended for those who love the following:  1) coffee 2) Twin Peaks 3) japanese wackiness 4) who just want to play something that offers something unique, despite having a lot of flaws  I don't like open-world games in general and while Deadly Premonition has a lot of OPTIONAL stuff, I recommend you to do some of those to get to know the local population of Greenvale better. You will thank me later.

1670	1	a	Well Penumbra Overture Iam so happy to add this game to my horror collection it is among the most unique and satisfying horror game of all time the atmosphere is nothing short of brilliant and will have you squirming in your chair the whole play through. The game play is very unique and similair to Amnesia which by the way is one of my favorite horror games as well but penumbra takes a different approach when it comes to horror and builds the terror as you play with each moment and every solved puzzle bringing you further into the madness that is penumbra. 10 out of 10 a must have for horror fans.

2771	0	a	This is probably my favourite game ever.  This is also the worst port I have ever played.   For a few hours, I thought I was safe from the horrors of the port. I followed recommended fixes, ran it in compatability mode and the like, but it randomly - in full screen mode - being windowed with the rest of the screen black. Then it started crashing, randomly - in the middle of a cutscene, in the middle of a level, in the map screen.   I paid 2.49 for this and it isn't worth it.   It really is unplayable.   Treat yourself and get the XBOX360 version - that I have played through, and yeah, the controls are clunky, but they're clunky no matter what version you play. The XBOX360 version works. I'm planning (when PS3's come down in price) to get the director's cut for the PS3.  Anyway, in terms of the game, this is one of my favourite things ever. Having ran through the game the first playthrough, I'm doing all of the sidequests this time. It is a wonderful, quirky, interesting, strange game. Get it on console and enjoy.

A pity they did not use the gasmask more when you where being hunted. That would have been true Claustrophobic horror.  The second part. Requeim is not like the others. Its like a third small extra game where they put all the puzzels with they could not fit in the other games. You go around bigger puzzels and when you are finished go into a portal and get to the next puzzel. You do that like 9 times. Not really any story or any enemies. Feels a bit like portal put more scary minus the portalgun. They try to make you feel like there are enemies that can hurt you around, put there never is :P

1757	0	a	When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.  High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work, which is limited. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.

1776	1	a	The practicality of its puzzles is P:O's strong point. The problems and their solutions all feel firmly rooted in the world you are exploring, and solving them elicits a nod of satisfaction for their intuitiveness. Beyond that, the gameplay is rather lacking. The enemies that can be combatted present zero threat or challenge, resulting in a severe lack of tension throughout the journey. Fortunately the exploration and mystery is the far bigger draw and well worth a playthrough.
44	1	a	Finally a game where i can be the bad guy. Its rare to see a game like this. The voice acting is a little weird at times while the faces have little to no expression to them. You get to be a little demonic fuker going around killing everyone. Achievements are easy enough aslong as you try. Some of these deaths are really brutal, which i love. 10/10 Everyone should try this game.

2554	1	a	I played this on Xbox360 and beat the game with near 100% completion, that's why I don't have much time played here on steam. Anyways...the game is a masterpiece. It has one of the most interesting stories in a video game I have ever played. It has aliens, the main character talks to a person that is in his head(his other persona), romance, and betrayal. Not to mention silly some of the times with it's own (I find hilarious) sense of humor.   The graphics aren't the best, but they don't need to be, because it's simply fun and thought provoking. Good job whoever brought this game to pc and on steam! Hip hip hurrrrrrrray  10cups of coffee out of 10!

2327	1	a	Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Hideo Kojima of all people. Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird. It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice. I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer. Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with. It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.

2698	0	a	I would have given this quirky game at least an 8/10, but due to hardware silliness, and a bad port...I just don't know.   I want to LOVE this game. I really do.   The console version is waaay better.   I'll base my review on what the game truly is without hardware/software difficulties and bad porting.   If you are familiar with Twin Peaks or any absurd David-Lynch works, you'll understand this game completely.   If you're not...just go with it. Yes. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing weird. Yes, York (the main character) is a dweeb. Yes, this town has no basis at all in reality. Just go with it.   Gameplay-wise...meh. It's really about the weird characters and story. Sidequests everywhere!  Ultimately, I cannot recommend the PC version if you're running any machine newer than like...2007-2009.  If you can get your hands on the xbox360 version. Great.

1675	1	a	I came to this game because I was so impressed by SOMA.   I can say now that the Frictional team are masters at creating an atmosphere of genuine terror and authenticity (when viewed through the lens of 2007 technology), emphasizing story and thinking rather than egregious violence.  However, by any standards, the gameplay is laughably bad at times. 'Combat' is either trivially stupid (tossing a can at a dog 5 times) or impossible (swinging a hammer at a spider). The puzzles range from simple to impossibly counter-intuitive. If you find yourself spending more than 5 minutes wondering what to do next, don't hesitate to look it up somewhere.   The story also leaves something to be desired. There seem to be several subplots woven together, but I saw no real arc or connection between the story's beginning, middle, and end. Maybe the dots are connected in the sequels?   Enjoy this game if you're interested in seeing the roots of Frictional's more modern work. There is also something to be said for it's atmospherics, horrific story, and historical value, but not much. Don't expect too much out of it as a game. Like SOMA, some elements of the gameplay actually chip away at the value of the overall immersive experience.

2729	0	a	I wanted to say something good about this game but I can't. This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually 'works' there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is 'improved' version.  Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this... Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw. Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)! My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best. This game is just bad at everything. Good thing I bought it for 2,5â¬ when it was on sale!

54	0	a	Lucius is a reversed horror-based detective story, where it's you who has to apparently outwit the detective and not the other way round (as is usually the case).  As the son of Lucifer, it's your task to rid the entire household of Mr Wagner, a US senator while being discreet as possible. In order to achieve this you're given some powers that will aid you along the way that include memory wipe and mind control.  It's fun while it lasts but because it's within a mansion and you have no control over how to go about killing these people (it's written in stone), it quickly becomes boring.  6/10.

Hours of roaming time? Countless collectables? More Collectables? Did I mention too many Collectables? Is there such a thing as 'too many' collectables? Do you like commentary on 80's horror movies? Do you often have suspicions than NPCs are up to no good, but are often unfonded?  Would you like to reveal the dark secrets of those 'innocent' NPCs through tons of side-quests? Even if it ruins their otherwise perfect marriages and lives? And finally ... Are you willing to put up with the games wonky combat controls to enjoy an otherwise great story and game?

Aside from all that it's really a great game, but only consider buying it on sale. Truly a flawed gem...

2607	1	a	Very bad game that's fun; compliments of Swery. What a good game. Gives you more freedom than most of the new games today. 
2485	1	a	Deadly Premonition is hard to write anything for without giving away spoilers, so I will break this down into two sections: A simple spoiler-free 'Pros &amp; Cons' section with a summary of my review, followed by a spoiler-filled review.  Pros: + Lovable characters in a charming setting + Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing + Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot + Tons of side quests and post-game content to explore  Cons: - Frequent crashes (both random &amp; reproducable) - Terrible port that isn't optimized for modern PCs - Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX - An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food &amp; sleep were almost never needed) - Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable - Terribly timed and overused QTEs - Tons of muddy, low-rez textures - Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes - A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the game   Overall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.   Spoilers below, you have been warned!  I went into Deadly Premonition expecting 'Resident Evil with FBI Agents' and instead received 'Shenmu with Zombies'. While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It's a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale's attention to detail wasn't put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat's SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.  Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce 'supernatural' elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach's head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don't know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 &amp; 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.  All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don't have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.  While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with 'Previously during the investigation...' segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won't be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console.
2177	1	a	Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.  Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.  Technical addition: If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version.

30	1	a	I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only 'redeeming' characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.A third-person adventure game based loosely on the film The Omen, Lucius lets players control the titular character. This nefarious six-year-old spawn of Satan murders everyone foolish enough to come onto the grounds of the family estate.The game is broken up into nearly 20 chapters, each one themed around Lucius killing someone in his house without drawing attention to himself. To accomplish these violent ends Lucius has access to a variety of powers, including telekinesis, mind control, and spontaneous combustion. The game manages to find a wide variety of clever and gruesomely creative ways to employ these powers, but it's important to note that all the cleverness is on the part of the developersâthere is no experimentation allowed, and each kill must be performed in a specific pre-scripted fashion.At times, this can make the game feel like it's on rails as the player moves mechanically from one kill to the next with only the barest context offered by cut-scenes. While the brutal murdering goes smoothly enoughâin fact, most of the levels can be zipped through in just a couple of minutes if the player knows what to doâthere are other aspects of the game that are downright rough.Two key stealth sections are far more difficult than they ought to be because the game never clearly expresses what its rules of stealth are.Even worse are the game's ill-conceived boss fights. There aren't many, but at certain points in the game Lucius is exposed, and has to kill a foe not through guile and trap-laying, but by throwing fireballs at them. The controls are a little wonky to start with, and in these sequences they completely fall apart.While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience.
2094	0	a	Plenty of excellent written dialogue but the game is broken. it's not even mediocre. It's awful.   One of your first encounters is a spider. A very common enemy. After defeating my first spider, I noticed my character's health rapidly depleting - OH NO - I check my bags - chug a healing potion....but it's no good. The potion goes right out the hole in my stomach where the spider stung me. 80-90 seconds later I'm *dead* Are you kidding me? I'm dead in the first 3-4 minutes of gameplay? I check the internets for a cure to this spider venom, sure enough there is no cure. You have to learn a spell - but it's a level 2-3 tier spell which you can't get until much later in the game. And every cave you go into, heck even in random forests - you will encounter spiders.   The shops are so ridiculous I burst out laughing after I realized what I was dealing with. I am going to play out a scenario in the game for you:  You walk in to a thrift store and you are looking for a pair of headphones and you ask the shop owner if you have any - 'Sorry we are all out' says the blue-shirted employee. You nod. And then ask him again. He again tells you he does not have headphones. Determined you ask him a third time. He replies 'we have three in stock... But you don't have enough money'. Unsatisfied with his selection you ask him again if he has headphones. He replies he has no headphones at all including the three he just showed you. You ask again, finally he reveals to you that he has a pair of used headphones and they are cheap give you a bonus to your health points if you wear it. You buy it. You ask him again out of curiousity to see if he's holding out on you - this time he has headphones that are not used and are slightly better than the ones you just paid for.  Thats right, every single time you check a shop keepers inventory it changes. You could potentially sit there for hours until you see the scroll, sword, shield, whatever you want appear. You don't have to walk out the door to check, you simply click to speak to speak to him again.   Speaking of headphones, don't wear them while playing this game. Music and sound effects are so bad your brain will explode. The startup screen song sounds like a 5-year-old playing on a keyboard. Afte you start you get to keep listening to it over and over and over again. The bats, zombies, ghosts, spiders make painful squeals and grunts as you hit them. You will always hear them before you see them which is good because if there are spiders you'll be running for your life because if you get poisoned, your as good as dead. The only way you could sanely play this game is if you turned off the audio completely - too bad you need to hear for spiders. Seriously, if your freaked out by spiders this game won't help.  The monsters: 1/10 Where are all the demons? Witches? Why am I fighting orcs, zombies, ghosts, and SPIDERS (hate those things). I played the game for 20 hours, got nearly to the end of the first chapter and was completely unsatisified with the selection of enemies. How about a possessed man attacking me? Maybe imps? Witches? IDK - this is the scariest you can think of? The safest way to fight any mob in this game is to get your quickness skill up and run away while firing your short supply of arrows.   The story: ?/10 If you can't play the game, what difference does the story make. That's like a writer handing you all of the pages of his new book, out of order, and dirty from sitting the the backseat of his Buick Skyhawk. There will be better reviews on the story from people who can play this game.  Your companions: 5/10  You gain followers but if they die, they are dead until you gain a resurrect spell. So make sure you quick save every five seconds. All it takes is a quick spider bite. I only recruited I believe 3 companions in my time playing this game. There are a few more. They have little tiny stories but other than that.   The classes My biggest complaint is with mages. They created specializions that are really hard to remember. And when you buy scrolls to learn spells you have to buy for that specializtion to be used. I remember I bought the one that is suppose to make me posion resistant but then found out, it only does it a small percentage and got posioned by a spider anyways and had to chug 2-3 health potions.  Back to the spider - so if you get stung, you literally have to wait nearly 3-4 minutes for the poison effect to wear off. Which means, automatic death if you get stung, there is no way to avoid not drinking multiple potions. Potions can get expensive so I recommend fleeing to church and let the priests free heal you instead of sucking down expensive potions.   Boss battles and combat strategy 1/10 The trick here is simple. Summon a genie, ask him for protection. He will summon a spirit and it will do all the fighting and kill everything on screen including the boss. No need to get your hands dirty. This is not a joke. You can try to fight but you are so limited in combat options that it comes down to this - brute force and running away while fighting. Everytime. And if you don't have it or the space to run away (and you won't) you will be dead in seconds. I hope you quick saved. Demon Souls isn't even this unforgiving.  I suggest you fight the same 5 random zombies, bats, and spiders till you make enough gold to buy good equipment that gives you an experience boost. Then keep farming till you are at a much higher level. So if you see a spider, you can shoot it dead in a shot or two instead of 6-30 shots.   I can't recommend this game and unless you want to play a bad game for laughs but if you do play, do me a favor and kill a spider for me.

2656	0	a	I had a very hard time thinking of how to review this game. There is no  'yes'  or  'no'  for this game. Hell even if steam had it there isn't even a  'neutral'  or  'maybe' . There is simply an   'I don't know' . So this game has what I think is an interesting story line but it is done very poorly. It has bad graphics, glitches, and it crashed a lot for me and others at points in the game (though I think someone  MAY  have made a mod to fix this, I never checked.) to the point where I couldn't see the epilogue because it crashed every time I tried but there is still something appealing about this game I can't explain well. The core story is very interesting. The only problem is that this game could have been much better if they took out the bad combat system and spent the money on other parts. Not being able to change the resolution and the 'DP.exe has stopped working' though are the big part for me.  That being said I will still re-play it some day because I still like the story. As for anyone who wants to buy this game, You have to be aware that it doesn't feel good and have to go in with low expectations to enjoy it's random storyline. I guess that's the best way to put it. I would give it a...uhh...to be realistic 5.5/10 but I'm still not 100% sure how to rate it. You'll just have to buy the game when it's on sale as long as you can live with what the problems I stated to understand why this game is so good-bad. Though this game is a port and doesn't seem to crash or have most these problems on console so it may be worth buying it on an xbox than on steam.

2084	0	a	I don't know. It's hard to rate this game. I didn't play it very much as you can tell so I'd give it a neutral if I could. Now I get they are going for an 'old school' vibe - and I love me some old school games. I love the old Ad&amp;D Gold Box games and eat up iso RPGs, But there is a difference between 'old school' and 'plain old ugly and cheap looking'. Seriously, look at old-school type games like Undertale - low fidelity graphics DO NOT mean that it should look bad - Diablo, Fallout, all of those old school games had charm, lots of effort was put into how they looked and presented the story even with the limited technogy of the time. This attention gave them a unique and appealing appearance which still holds up today.... A game released emulating them in 2015 shouldn't look significantly worse. Saying your game is 'old-school' and 'not about the graphics' is not an excuse to release a game that looks like garbage that you obviously didn't spend much time on or put any effort into the presentation. If you are going to do that then avoid graphics all together. This would have been better as a MUD, to be honest. I might have enjoyed it.  I get that this game isn't about the graphics, but It just looks awful, the UI hurts my eyes, the sprites look like they were made in ten minutes (your character doesn't even have a unique sprite), the 'animations' are so low fidelity that I wonder if they spent any time on them at all.   But the worst sin of all is that the text, which is the games main draw and reading is most of what you will be doing, I found it obnoxiously hard to read and the way it explodes on the screen had me constantly scrolling up to follow the wall-of-text conversations. It's a bad way of doing it. Seriously, hundreds of games have done 'conversation style' text well, it's inexcusable and gets old very fast.  That, I think is what did it for me. I could probably have stomached the rest of it if they had a way of reading text and having conversations with NPCs that didn't give me a headache and make me constantly have to scroll around.  It's just... I don't know.. Maybe the story is awesome - that's great and I would have gotten to it if I could have stomached the awful presenation and design. This is still supposed to be a game, after all. If I feel like the devs didn't care about or put any effort into how they presented their product to me, I can't care about it either.  Anyway I really don't like to not recommend indie games. I feel like they are the engine of the industry and need all the support they can get. Especially games that try to be very different like this one and deal with mature subject matter without flinching...but I just can't recommend this game.

2258	1	a	Horey shet, this game is great.  First things first though, while 'directors cut' is slightly different from the original on the consoles, its a horrible PC port. Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.  I absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.  All in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues. Its an amazing, crazy, weird, funny and extremely interesting.  I'd r8 it an 8/8 m8, no h8.

2637	0	a	**Speaking for the game itself 9/10, Just awesome !**  With that being said, I tried 4 different computers with every fix available and can't get this working at all. How is something this bad allowed to be released? I recommend staying away from this one all together. So if your thinking: 'Hey, it can't be that bad, and the price is good, why not try it'? Your wrong and it won't work and you'll be mad!  I have 17.8hrs Gameplay and not one achievement so I think that speaks for itself.

2553	1	a	This game is... Well, it's certainly something. Ignorant of the infamy of DP's PC port, I happily bought up a game that seemed like it'd take some time to complete, and for like $2.50 no less!  I love it. Simply put, I love this game. York is a humourous and fun character and the way he reacts with the Greenvale citizens is also great. That said this game crashes like CRAZY, even after installing a few mods to fix it. Deadly Premonition is a labour of love, and while I haven't finished it yet it's been worth it so far. I've never played anything like it.

Black Plague seems to fall into the problem of going much too far into the story and then seems to end in a jumbled mess. Don't get me wrong, the game is great and should definitely follow finishing Overture, but originally meaning to be the 2nd game in a Trilogy definitely took its toll.

1312	1	a	Get this game. Best Game. 11/10. I would buy again. Might seem spooky. It IS spooky but purely psychological. gg 11/10
1144	1	a	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.
2363	1	a	This game is likely one of my favorites that I have played within the last couple of years. There are many flaws in the game engine which vary from person to person, but the game was good enough for me to want to push past them. Once I got into the game a bit, terrible things like frame-rate drops stopped happening, and the main bugs were just the physics engine.  As a safety note, as with anything, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. I never had any problem, but many people complain of losing progress or having things disappear after having collected them, so keep backups.  Onto the game elements...  + Awesome story. It is a bit weird and out there as you get further into the game, but it kept me intrigued the whole way. I love games like Silent Hill, but even if you don't like those, try the game. It's not as crazily demonic as those. A very interesting mystery to keep you guessing.  + The graphics were still pretty good, except for the glitches. I liked the style.  + The voice acting was pretty well-done, and I liked most of the characters overall. They had their own interesting pieces to them (oh man, that Cold Pot lady).  - The gameplay, altogether, is actually a letdown, though wanting to see the town and the story held everything together for me. Most of the fighting 'monsters' was rather pointless and unnecessary, and just got boring after a while. It makes sense for things like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and it's usually done in a way where it's not too boring or you can escape if necessary. Here, the fighting is just boring, one-by-one, often forcing you to empty rooms before you can move on.  I still think that the game altogether was great, just getting past the glitches took a while. If you are looking for an off-the-wall, but really interesting, action/drama game, just look into this one.
2727	0	a	An unplayable port of a great game. Unplayable within the first 5 seconds of starting due to ridiculous framerates. Did not even get as far as the crashes. Community patches do nothing. I really wish I could play this game because I know for a fact that it's really good. I paid a dollar and I still feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and avoid this version like the plague. If you pay full price for this I can only pity you.

2024	1	a	Requirements to play this game: be masochist. Pros: - good story - 'old school' Cons: - still buggy as hell, getting stuck on the wall for the 1325th time starts to get annoying - heavily favors non-melee characters due everyone and their mom having some on-hit debuff which in most cases you can't dispel (not that it would matter anyway since they just re-apply it) - pots, pots, pots and more pots, either use 3/4 of your bag space for pots or prepare to return to town often, well you're going to hit the town often anyway since your bags will be full very fast - overpowered casters who can floor you faster that you can react - evidences that eat up huge bag space. I understand that stuffing 3 *BEEPspoilersBEEP* in a back bag would be rediculous in real life but in most games, quest items are on their own space  So then, recommended? Well being some sorta masochist, I finished the game just because I don't like to give up. I know some will like this game, I did here and there, but if you lack greater patience, don't bother. With no patience, you will end up whacking your keyboard to pieces and smacking your fist through the monitor. That being said, it's 0.89â¬ right now when I type this, so trying the game costs you next to nothing.

Good puzzles, if not a little obscure in places, and fairly suspenseful. I've not completed the game as yet as I keep getting distracted by things like work. So far only met a couple of monsters but the AI is pretty good. I'd rate this one a good 4/5.  I may even finish it one day along with the rest of my games list. Aaaah to dream.

980	1	a	Never played the original, so no comment on how this is or isn't a dev/pub cash-grab, but this game scratches that car combat itch. Lots of repetitive zombies and sound effects (and poor voice-acting), but the positives are a nicely-bombed-out lookin' city, and a good range of cars and weapons at your disposal. The different game modes (story mission, racing, and survival) help mix things up, and a bunch of not-unreachable achievements is always a bonus.
2702	0	a	Be warned this game simply doesn't work. You can do a lot of effort and fixes to get the game to technically boot, or you can watch the first season of Twin Peaks. One is a significantly better use of your time than the other.

3023	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I recommend any version of this beautiful game other than the pc port.  Deadly Premonition might be the greatest game of all time. While this review shall be focusing on the abominable pc version, I'll say this about the game itself: the graphics might be terrible, the sound effects were probably pulled from a free sound website, and it doesn't make much sense storywise at several points. But if you believe that games are about being immersed in a truly unique world, if gaming is not about getting an arbitrary number of points but is about telling a story in an amazing way that makes you care for the characters you see, I'd highly recommend you get this game for PS3 or Xbox 360.  Now onto the pc port, it's garbage. The problems are so numerous I have to seperate them into multiple catagories.  Crashes: Crashed 4 times in about 3.5 hours...maybe I could get a fanmade fix, but it's NEVER the fans' job to make sure the game works.  Controls: Space bar is draw weapon and aim (You can only fire and reload if you are aiming) I got used to this, but my problem is, while you can rebind many of the controls, you can't rebind aim to something resonable (Such as right mouse button) Also, certain buttons on the controller won't work if you bind them, for instance, I wanted to put the lock on command to left trigger. After I bound it, it did not work. Same as when I tried to put shoot onto right trigger.  Framerate: First half hour runs at about 10-15 fps, it ran fine for about an hour, now runs at a steady 5 fps. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not work.  Driving controls: They work fine (If a bit wonky) with a keyboard. When you use a controller, the physics speeds up so the cars, which only go about 60 mps in the game, can easily hit 150 on the open road and it makes the steering hyper sensitive. I thought at first the car's physics might have been locked to the framerate on consoles, explaining why on pc the cars go faster, since the pc version has a higher framerate. But why does it only effect controller?  In conclusion, the pc port sucks it's certainly not worth the bucks buy the game on PS3 or xbox, It will truly, knock off your socks.  So says Mr. Stewart.  Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, 'CultGamerAlliance'. Check it out if you get a chance!

2492	1	a	It has problems right from the beginning, at first the game crashed on me until i used a patch after thoroughly searched the internet for it, you are faced with bad graphics and the shooting mechanics are extremely similar to Resident Evil 4 but that's irrelevant when you enter the twisted and somewhat funny story of Deadly Premonition. I have to admit, i haven't seen in my life characters so unique and entertaining while remaining mysterious, creepy and peculiar at the same time. The story is compelling and the way the game goes are 'too real' for a generic sandbox game, you put gasoline in your car, you use the turn signals in your car, you cannot overspeed (not always) and if you don't change your clothes regularly you'll get dirty and flies will fly over you. It's sense of humour always makes me come back for more and, if you forgive these problems i just mentioned in this review, you too.  Good Luck, Zach

2588	1	a	This is a game you have to appreciate for what it is. It is the tropic thunder of video games. its a spoof of spoofs while spoofing itself and then somehow still is taking itself seriously in regards to the overall story. Its also worth noting that this game is actually a movie in a videogame. There is a universe of movies where the characters in game are really just actors. Spyfiction is one of the other games that is actually a movie in the universe. Forrest (a character in DP) has the same 'actor' as another character in Spyfiction.   But onto the review. So while you get bad repetitive music (which is a joke on purpose and actually kind of catchy) and characters that are laughable yet deviously insidious you find yourself caught in a confusion of emotions regarding the game. It catches you and sucks you in with it's hard to take serious yet super serious dialogue. I played this originalyl on Ps3 and i kept laughing out loud at the game because it was so bad... but then i found myself going to houses and asking questions and being a detective because i needed to know what was happening. The numerous time specific side quests that give more insite that are only found by what would seem to be chance give more back ground and much of the games nuance for the story is missed if you avoid them by accident or lack the ability to find them. And the story is actually so... well i wont give anything away but its WORTH the time and effort and the annoying car noise that is satans fingernails on a chalkboard.

Even if you get Durante's excellent DPFix mod it's hit and miss whether the game will actually run decently for you, if at all. After much trial and error I managed to get it running but after 30-40 mins of playtime the FPS grinds to a halt and needs a game restart to get it smooth again.  What a shame, the game deserves better.

Avoiding them was suggested, but enemies are not anywhere near scary enough to warrant hiding. Amnesia's Grunts and Brutes always warrented hiding, a big difference. Small amounts of steam coming from pipes should never be used as an environmental killer. It feels wimpy to die to it. The puzzles are too short and easy. Honestly the game feels like a chore. Going to give Black Plague a shot after this. Currently considering Overture as Frictional's warmup attempt at a comercial horror game. Amnesia was stellar though.

736	1	a	While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience, and any hardcore fans of the genre owe it to themselves to give it a look, provided they have strong stomachs.

865	1	a	As a player who decides what games to buy based on the reviews of the certain game, it's my duty to write a complete review about any game i finish, so here is my review:  LUCIUS:  Lucius a game where you are a kid of a rich family, the son of Lucifer (your family doesnt know that, that is what makes the game exist), where you get orders from your father to bring him 'tributes' by killing people. The thing is, nobody must find out who you really are nor what can you do, so, by using your mind and your powers you have to make every kill look like an 'accident'.  Before i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.  PROS: +Very good story. +Even if it isn't listed anywhere, it is an open world game, you can get almost anywhere in the house at any time of the game. +You can get a bunch of items in the inventory that can be usefull at any time.  CONS: -The map is almost uselss, it has no explanation of the place nor your target. Needs too much thinking on finding out where to go. -The controls of the bike are bad, like trying to play a shooter game with a joystick bad. -The achievements are not a challenge at all, you can just do something, then replay it 4 times to get the achievemnt, doesnt matter if you get a Game Over. -The 40-hour achievent has no use at all, this a 8-13 hour game, you just have to leave the game running all night.  TL;DR It is a good, not great, psychological horror game and has a good story. Get it on sale  8/10
1728	0	a	Play Amnesia instead.  This game plays exactly like what it is: Frictional Games' first shot at a full video game. The horror, atmosphere, and story elements are as good as always, but there are additions to the game that just make it worse. 1) The AI is terrible. 2) Being able to attack/defeat the monsters takes away from the horror.  Their later games keep all of the good parts of this game and remove all of the bad.

2216	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a game that David Lynch would have created had he been a Japanese game developer. It is strikingly similar to the television show Twin Peaks and one of the characters even bares an uncanny resemblance to an actress who played in 'Mulholland Drive', Naomi Watts. It's obvious the game's developers drew heavy inspiration from the show and Lynch's other works. If you ever wanted to play as Dale Cooper in a world so bizarre, spliced with elements of Silent Hill, then this is probably your best and only bet. Just be prepared for what is truly terrifying... a terrible PC port. Save often.

Penumbra really leaves you wanting more.  Penumbra is different from Amnesia, since you have weapons and can fight. It is a different experience that should be played. The fight mechanics are a little wonky and some of the puzzles are a bit odd, but it still is a great game. Overall I think Penumbra Overture gets a 8.9/10

931	0	a	I looked at this game for a long time when it finally got on sale. So I went and bought it. My little brother warned me against getting this game. He said it was bad. I ignored him. I owe him an apology. He told me the controls were hard to work with and the plot was stupid. Lo and behold, the controls were hard to work with. Not at all helped by how the framerate likes to bounce up and down like a hyperactive child in a bouncy castle going through a sugar high. As for the plot and story , I don't know what to telI you on that front because I was too busy having a wrestling match with the controls to find out what the story was.  I was so unsatisfied I requested a refund, which I normally never do to a game that is on sale. I am really disappointed in this game and myself for buying it.  Just go watch one of those 'demonic child movies' I heard about. I'm sure you'll get the same experience.
775	0	a	An aglamation of interesting concepts that don't quite bear fruit. By the time you get to the middle or late missions, you're checking your diary and trying to decipher the incredibly vague clues you've scribbled down for yourself. It's like having a DM in D&amp;D running the Tomb of Horrors for your party, and he won't give you a straight damn answer no matter how well you roll.

2404	1	a	Iâm usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. Itâs a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).  This rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.   Itâs a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the charactersâ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But donât let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, itâs supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, donât assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though itâs a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.   From a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.  You just have to play it.

1261	0	a	As I write this review I'm on the verge of vomiting. Not because I'm being over dramatic, but because I'm literally nauseous from playing this game. I thought it was just me until a read another reviewer suffering the same symptoms. The graphics, theme, and content of the game are fine. But it's the gameplay that made me sick which consists of you driving endlessly round, and round, and round... Oh gosh I'm making myself sicker just thinking about it.  Perhaps if the maps were bigger and had a better layout, I would have no complaints. But because of my negative experience I say stay away from this game if you get car sick easily. It's too bad because I was looking forward to this game. At least I only paid something like $2.  By the way I just took a pill for motion sickness and I hope it kicks in real soon.

1358	1	a	I bought this game with literally the only reason in mind, to say, this is far far better than â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Amnesia. If you liked Amnesia, this game will blow you out of the water, and it's sad to see they're making another Amnesia and not another Penumbra game. Basically just think of these as Amnesia, with a better story, better graphics, less shitactular gameplay, and with a playable view. Like seriously, Amnesia is 50% filter, 30% camera shake for the fear. If you want a scary game, get this, if you want a mediocre overrated semi-scary game with no story (or rather, a boring one) and hate fun, get Amnesia. The game is basically a horror game with puzzles, an interesting story, and well, that's about it. If you want to be freaked out, get this game for sure. Amnesia IS NOT, anywhere near Black Plague's league, ignore the hype, if you can't , get both games at least. 9/10

2017	1	a	This is a game with very high qualities and very low shortcomings. If the glass is half full or half empty that is for you to decide....but in the end it is still a half full (or half empty) glass that you are served, keep that in mind. The highlight of the game is a very good story very well told, thick convincing atmosphere that stands way above the norm. The gameplay is a mixed bag, thats where the half full/half empty thing comes into play. There are many things that are very rough around the edges like the game areas that are very small and you can just exit them by mistake simply getting too close to the edge. The combat is difficult and requires using a neuron or two thats the good part, the bad part is that its still very rough around the edges, feels like it was made years before the first diablo. Gameplay-wise it feels less polished than similar Sega Genesis games back in the day, but it more than makes up for it with a fantastic story and atmosphere. If story and atmosphere (and a rather high difficulty level) sound appealing to you then go for it, its well worth the money even at full price. If polish and fancy are your cup of tea then stay away even on discount.

963	1	a	In ZDHD, you are Joe Citizen who, for reasons unknown and never really explained, has been recruited by the military to conduct a series of combat, scouting, and search-and-rescue missions. The first ten or so story missions of Zombie Driver HD were fun and the last twenty-one generally vacillated somewhere between tedium and entertainment, with a couple of teeth-grinding exceptions. Most of the components of a good game are here, but none of them stand out in any way, which makes the whole more-or-less precisely the sum of its parts: a mediocre story, weak voice-acting, decent but not remarkable gameplay, nice car models and (mostly) destructible terrain, and some value-added game modes.  Your missions start with briefings, like the one shown above, after which you select a vehicle and buy any upgrades that you can afford based on what youâve unlocked so far and how much cash youâve earned from completing objectives or finding money stashes. ZDHD is one of those top-down games where you never get out of your car. The variety of vehicles, ranging from your starter car, a taxicab, to a giant armored vehicle with a 10-passenger capacity, is fairly impressive, but when you dig into the game youâll find that youâre really only using one or two of the vehicles in your garage, generally a compromise between carrying capacity (most of your missions involve rescuing scientists, first responders, or civilians with special skills such as pilots) and durability.  The upgrades available for your vehicles fall into two categories: weapons and modifications. Modifications affect a specific vehicle only and are these: armor, speed, and ramming (the last of these represents a vehicleâs ease of turning intact infected into smears of roadkill). Weapons include such items as machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and a rail gun, each of which has three power level upgrades. Weapons are provided in the form of âpickups,â meaning that you drive over a weapon to equip it and only one may be equipped at a time.  What story there is in the campaign unfolds largely through the mission briefings and monologues by survivors that you pick up and bring back to base. No explanation for what caused this breakout of zombie-ism is forthcoming although itâs evidently some kind of bio-toxin, and the military has you picking up various groups of folks to assist in containment and control efforts. Many of these groups will question (as you, the player, no doubt will) why the military is sending a lone, untrained civilian to perform these dangerous tasks and some will hint that the military is somehow behind the zombie plague, but whether these are the ravings of a paranoid few or glimpses of the truth is never made clear.  Once youâve completed (for me after about 10-12 hours) or gotten tired of the story mode, there are two other single-player modes to explore: Blood Race and Slaughter. The Slaughter mode is basically a horde modeâyou have one vehicle and you pick up powerups and kill as many waves of zombies as you can before your car is destroyed. Blood Race felt a bit like a less-fun version of Death Rally: you compete in a marathon of eight events composed of âeliminatorâ (destroy a target number of enemy AI vehicles before time runs out), âenduranceâ (survive as long as you can with a bomb on your vehicle by passing checkpoints to add time to the countdown), and âraceâ (what it sounds like). The race sections arenât really up to DR because destroying an opponent only takes him out of the race for as long as it takes for him to respawn and most of the tracks are very curvy. Even using a gamepad, the steering for most vehicles is very slippery, so sliding around corners isnât really an option for novice racers.  If you like top-down driving games and hate zombies, you may enjoy Zombie Driver HD. Itâs not a great game but itâs not a terrible game and thatâs about the best faint praise I can give it.
1484	1	a	This sequel definitely has more terrifying enemies, but they're pretty much the only enemy in the game. Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is the random humour of the character Clarence; it can really detract from the uneasiness you should feel. Still a fun and interesting sequel regardless.

1313	1	a	After the first one I felt in love with this kind of game experience. Gathering notes, exploring the facility for the artifacts. Like I said about the first one, it has a great atmosphere of despair. You feel like you are alone in this god forsaken place.  But like in the first game, after one or two enemies encounter you forgot about hiding tactics. You just dash your way through the hallways, and avoid enemies by jumping. The game has one or two encounters when you need to use your brain to defeat or avoid enemies. But beside this two exception there is nothing to fear from monsters.

2841	0	a	Oh man where to start.... What a mess of a game.  Its riddled with gamebreaking bugs, youll have to download other stuff to make it work, controls are clunky all around, graphics are dull, the music is attrocious (whistling song) youll get 3/4 skit songs that will play the whole game, so annoying and the monsters are far from scary. The only reason i got this is because it was like 99 cents and everyone praised the story. After trying to play this, i just ended up saying ''â¥â¥â¥â¥ this'', but i still wanted to know the follow up to the story. So i went on youtube as other reviewers suggested and watched the whole 5h borefest it was. The more the story advances the more WTF moments pop up, until the end..... oh my what an end.....the kind of end that makes you want to cry because you realize what a waste of time it all was.  Save yourself money (even if its 99 cents, its not worth it)  Save yourself time (the story is â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyways)  Enjoy an other game, there is trully nothing here but a borefest filled with a non sensical â¥â¥â¥â¥ up of a story.  Not recommended.

1014	1	a	I have mixed feeling about this game, overall it's good but not very well done, I'm reviewing it with all dlc available. Edit: I have beat the main story so I think I should update this review   pro : - good music - stunning graphics - ram all zombies and blood everywhere - good game without thinking much  con: - there are not much content in this game so the game feel very much repetitive, I played until the very end of the game and the last 2 levels are very predictable - the survivors that looks like asian has russian accent :D ( I think it was on mission 28 or 29) - feels like mobile game with controller support, i don't know why, but it just feel that way - the plot is kinda stupid, till the endm why a taxi driver do everything and army sit behind desk. I meant the story is pretty much predictable - I hate the zombie that can throw things, i just don't make sense at all, I keep thinking when playing where they get throwable things and able to throw like 50 meters away -- and when there are too many of them and you don't pay attention you will die almost instantly from them  other: - GPU intensive, my notebook was overheated while playing it for hours :D - CPU intensive too starting on mission 25++ - The apocalypse DLC ruins the game because new player like me didn't know anything about the game and we could pick truck monster that was overpowerful for early level.  -   stupid ending, doesn't explain anything    final score 7/10 (it was 6.5) give 0.5 because at least they put something new for the last mission
2189	1	a	This review is for any one having trouble with the game, and my honest opinion. Firstly to get the game to work what i did was, go into steam/steamapps/common/deadlypremonition/redist. then scroll down until you find PhysX_SystemSoftware. Double click then click repair then start the game and it should work perfectly.  The game itself I have played multiple times on both xbox and playstation and is one of my favourite games, of all time. This port is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and its takes a certain patience. But the overall game kinda makes up for it. plus you can get get a bug fix online  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix.  kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ service from the people who ported it but eh what you gonna do complaining won't do anything. Get the bug fix do the repair and have fun with the game. You need to play this game, isn't that right zach!

2115	0	a	This is a bad game. Do not buy it.  The main selling point of this game is that it has lots of text to read in it. This is no bad thing. Unfortunately, despite taking three years to translate it, the translation is laughably bad. The English is full of mistakes and awkwardly unidiomatic to the point where it is painful to read. Here are some examples:  'Don't lose your faith- we have hope till we breathe!' 'I can only say one thing to that matter'  'I'll say you goodbye in that case' 'Is there any problem in it?!' 'I can't talk to you righ [sic] now'  'people, don't wait for anything and light the stakes for witches and sorcerors' 'a man who has destroyed good many hell spawns' 'one should keep good mood and strong faith' 'before anyone could react they ransacked entire mining village'  'so much dark side power was released that it would have dismembered me to pieces'  Another selling point is that the game doesn't hand-hold the player with quest markers and so on. I can appreciate the sentiment but it just makes playing the game tedious. An example of this is when killing bats outside the town at the very start. You keep having to go back and talk to the guard to find out if you have killed them all yet.  The combat in the game might seem diablo-like from screenshots but it's not that fast-paced or interesting. Generally you will be drinking thousands of potions, missing the enemy a lot and walking round incredibly slowly.  Seriously, do not buy this game.

But with mediocre story, boring puzzles, annoying music, confusing gameplay (you'll definitely need a walkthrough at some points) and not to mention the random glitches, I just cant make myself recommend this on a full price. Luckily this goes on sale/giveaway every so often so if you still feel like giving it a try, get it then.

179	1	a	After completing the game I decide to write a review within minutes of completing the game no spoilers are included: The game is about killing everyone in your house without getting caught and using unique ways of killing. The game has decent graphic despite only a few characters having proper walking animations and everyone else just wobbles. There are some glitches like being cornered and then pushed off the map, but glitches are bound to happen with old game. I do have to say without help from a few guides on some missions that lacked explanation or I have not notice.

1402	0	a	Slightly better than Red Lake. Slightly  Ok, I wanted something interesting and thrilling. Got something weird randomness with a buch of jump-scares.  Moving and stacking objects:  Maybe the worst thing about this game. Occasionally you'll have to stack some boxes to jump over laser-triggered mines (which were put up by a delusional person, judging from their locations). And mines only go off when you pass through them, they ignore objects for some reason. So you'll have to put one box on top of another. But jumping on them will often move and destroy the structure. It is annoying as hell.  Puzzles: [Mild Spoilers] If you want to get through that door, you'll have to inject some kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥ into your arm and pass out. When you get up, the door will magically unlock. I don't think I need to add anything else.  Jump Scares: They speak for themselves really. The only thing the game can frighten you with are jumping images and loud sounds.   Additionally, it is just raw. There is a point where darkness literally bites and kills you. You have to cover two holes in the wall to avoid that....

This game is incredible. It is flawed, very flawed, but it has character and soul that most games lack in abundance. It's fun, interesting, and it's really an unforetable experience. For best results, watch all of Twin Peaks before taking the dive into Deadly Premonition, which pays homage to Twin Peaks in really charming ways. 10/10

I believe a good horror game needs buildup: A proper story, atmosphere... any game can tell a story; it takes a hell of a good game to make you feel like you've lived it. I reccomend this game, and give it a 9.5/10. It set in stone a standard that many games would follow after, such as Outlast, and it's own successor, Amnesia, with it's surivival/psychological elements.

835	1	a	this is a fun little a game where you play as a evil little boy killing the unsuspecting people in your family's manor to gain dark powers.  pros -unique concept -really embracing evil, which is not really common in gaming -nice story, but it could have been much better  cons -some powers were not very useful, one of them, telekinesis, was simply useless. the controls for it were that bad -house layout was very confusing. it takes time to get used to it, but this is a short game. -doing chore could have had more impact -the ending could have bee better  score : 7/10  just get it with steam sales

I'd recommend buying the console game, as the PC Port is beyond broken and a patch to fix the issues seems out of reach. My only consolation is the soundtrack, that alone was worth the couple dollars I paid during the sale.
2317	1	a	Maybe we should send the ones who are responsible for this console port to the great city of Harvest. Steve the old kidder with his stupid â¥â¥â¥ lumberjack shirt will accompany their trip for a night and if they come back Deadly Premonition will become the new Harvest and Twin Peaks in one. Ergo: The best â¥â¥â¥â¥ing town/game ever.   Long story short: Buy this game, its awesome. Torture the ones who made this port. They deserve it.
2648	0	a	nope, dont buy it til they fix the crashing issues, and fix the fact that this game is a pain in the a** to get working in the first place.  booting the game you get an endless intro loop. gotta do a bunch of stuff to get it to work. during the endless loop you cant skip, you cant get to the main menu. you can only close the game. the loop just plays over and over and over.  if you get passed the intro loop..... the start of the game runs fine, but once you get into town and out of the first building, NOTHING BUT CRASHES!  very irritating. drive around crash, walk around, crash, get in car, crash, get out of car, crash....start up game and just barely start, crash.  this needs a patch.  a great game though, but unplayable. the crashes are random and often.  dont buy this til they patch it which doesn't seem likely.

64	0	a	Meh.  As others have stated it's not a 'kill people in clever ways you choose in a sandbox'. It's a 'figure out how to kill people in ONE clever way that it pre-determind.'  It's narrative driven and probably not bad (gfx and controls are good) but not what I hoped. Should have researched before I bought.
2548	1	a	TLDR  Had to cool off before posting this. It's been about 4-5 months. Was going to thumb this game down almost immediately. But over time I remembered some memorable moments, even though this wasn't the Alan Wake experience I was looking for. I give Double Penetration: The Director's Cut a thumbs up, but with a caveat emptor ... it's considering that nothing UGLY happens (which it most likely will on PC/Steam) ...

2111	0	a	TL:DR; game is TRASH. Im playing computer games since 1994. I'v played lots but loots of old school rpgs and this one is totally crap. First of all i have to say i dont want every isometric rpgs to be similar like ultima series or diablo 1-2 or baldur's gate, which are the decent games i love for whole of my life; but guys Inquisitor is a waste of time, atmosphere is okay but thats only significant pros that you can find about the game. So here is my opinion, do not buy this if you dont wanna feel like a potion addicted junky and just be sure about you can play way more better old school rpg's than that.  SCORE; a point for dark atmosphere, another point for inquisitor made me to miss diablo 2 again and the last point for its easy to forget how mad you're about buying a game like this because its cheap. 3/10
978	1	a	Surprisingly fun! I didn't expect much from a game where you just drive around the whole time, but through fitting audio, brutal animations, powerful weapons, massive zombie doom-bringing tanks, and fast paced action, this game makes mass zombie squishing extremely satisfying. 'Slaughter', a wave-based survival mode, brings all of the weapons to your disposal early on, like the super powerful railgun, making normally repetitive zombie smashing very enjoyable.
521	1	a	This game was great. I really enjoyed playing the evil, vindictive little brat.   Pros: -Art was great. It felt natural some how, and yet eerie. -Good story. There were times the plot was quite obvious and other times I was a little surprised, which is hard for stories to do lately. -Even I got scared sometimes.  -I thought the thought put into the exploration of the house was great.  Cons: -Some of the characters were quite flat. -I would have liked more interaction with the devil. -The ways in which you go about destroying your enemies were all planned out. Left little room for planning the demise of your enemies yourself.  Get this game. And be the bad guy!

2439	1	a	Iâm usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. Itâs a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).  This rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.   Itâs a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the charactersâ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But donât let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, itâs supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, donât assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though itâs a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.   From a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.  You just have to play it.

219	0	a	The idea is great and the it's sometimes satisfying due to the concept.  Overall though it's not something I can recommend. First off, the gameplay is just boring, outside a few stealth and combat sections this game has nothing exciting to offer as far as gameplay goes. The puzzles are sometimes nice, but mostly uninspired. The story is what kept me finishing the game, in the end I felt that it had more potential, but was still fine.  What really annoyed me though is the lack of life from most of the characters, if you can even call them characters. They have no personality, not even a glimpse of it, which would be fine if we didn't spend like I don't know, 75% of the game killing people like that. I mean as a hellspawn wouldn't it be much more satisfying to kill people who are good and have things to lose? It's more devilish, you know. Sure, everybody has something to lose, but why should we care about these people? Some of them are considered annoying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s by Lucius himself (let alone me). And the others are just there, because somehow you must fill the mansion with people. The main characters are OK, and it's interesting to see them reacting to the events. So yeah, outside a few things this game doesn't really offer much. It's a great concept and a little bit of fresh air with the change of roles, but it doesn't execute well enough to be considered anything but a good idea.  tl;dr it's eh. 4/10
1219	0	a	Gave it a shot- it was $2.49... its ok. cars handle differently, and hitting zombies with them has impact. Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid.   EDIT: OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option.... Free Camera mode is a little better. And the game threw a Defend this Area type mission... but its still made me dizzy a bit. I think the camera is too close and has to adjust itself too often since you can be driving quite fast. so yea.... i still would not really recommend.
2873	0	a	I may be harsh - looks bad, plays bad and simply was unable to hold my interest for more than an hour. My opinion might change, I will try and play more with it - but as it stands right now this game is what I call bad. Or maybe I was expecting too much. ---------------------------- I gave it another (short as it turned out) shot. No change: crap is crap. Outdated looks, animation is embarassing, textures are bleak... was this a PS1 game? PC version needs extra utils to actually 'run'... some bugs here and there (maybe more to come but frankly I cannot be bothered to play more....) Crashes? Just some - and only _if_ you get the thing to launch :-) In my opinion this 'game' is not worth playing, not even if it was free. As for it being the Twin Peaks of PC games... poor David Lynch - that statement is an insult. Maybe the story was supposed to be like TP? I will never be able to tell.

2568	1	a	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
256	0	a	A perfect example of why a lack of quality assurance can turn a mediocre game into a bad one. The concept behind Lucius is a good one - you are a demonic child whose purpose is to sacrifice souls to Lucifer in exchange for power - but the execution is lacking. Rather than allow you to do anything on your own accord, Lucius plays out more or less like an old-school point-and-click adventure. Every event is coded in advance and the only thing expected from you is to follow the exact steps laid out by the game. There is no creativity of any sort, only trial and error.  Worse than that, the game is plagued by numerous bugs. The engine is poorly optimized and it's not uncommon for characters to clip into walls or objects to melt into the environment. The lighting is completely bonkers. Certain achievements don't trigger properly. The sound design is abysmal. Rather than put together a soundtrack, the developers downloaded a bunch of royalty-free 'horror' tracks and shoved them to play during the game without any sense or purpose, often completely ignoring what's going on. Get used to the atrocious 'chase scene' music from the tutorials to barge into the cutscenes that follow, even if that cutscene is a peaceful Christmas dinner.  Lucius is a game that tries to sell itself on its concept, but doesn't treat it with any kind of care. It feels like the developers simply pushed out the game, caring more about how much money it makes than whether it's actually any good. A shame, because a strong concept like Lucius could benefit from a developer who isn't completely apathetic toward their creations.

2722	0	a	Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus.   So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.  Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.
61	1	a	Lucius reminds me and I'm sure of a lot of people of The Omen. The gameplay is simple yet the manor is a big place to explore and the chores for side missions were fun to do for gifts and rewards that help you around.   The voice acting is pretty bad and the graphics are fair but despite this, it's the idea of controlling a six year old to kill that gives me, and people that actually understand this game, a very deep guilty pleasure.

1408	0	a	This Linux port is not OK. I gave it a try for 40min, but in the end I gave up. It's the experience that turned me away.  First I started it to see if my Intel card can take it. Surprinsingly, it appeared to work very well in 1280x1024 (good framerate for this type of game, decent texture quality). I had to configure it from using Pulse Audio to ALSA, but that's OK. A lot of applications don't get the Pulse Audio integration right. Then I grabbed a coffee and prepared to go through this game from A to Z. I wanted to experience all its features.  The first hickup: multiple monitors. I have a second monitor connected to my laptop. The xrandr/xcb support for this is working perfectly (all applications [thus far] supporting multiple monitors have no issues). But this game simply doesn't get it right. The list of resolutions is weird (I don't know where it gets those), I can't predict on which screen it will start and if I increase the resolution past 1280x1024, it will use both monitors in one large canvas with the game centered. It's unusable. Thus, I'm stuck with a low(ish) resolution.  The game tries to start in fullscreen mode, but today it started doing a decoration-less window mode. Very unusual. There does not seem to be a truly _windowed_ mode, which most Linux users will prefer specifically because fullscreen with X is a very complicated affair.  The next hiccup: the sound. There's a constant 'click', as if the game constantly misses the deadlines when feeding the audio sink.  The next hiccup: CPU usage. Even though I'm in the main menu, the application consumes 100% of my CPU time. I appears to be constanly rendering something, event though I can't see anything noticeable changing. But maybe my driver is not so stellar. Actually, I'm sure it's not. When switching from X to the terminal, the CPU usage drops to ~6%.  The game itself: I started with the tutorial. There's a step where I have to put a box into a coffin. Took me four tries to do that, because the box dissapears all of sudden. Eventually I managed to drop it in the coffin, but it made me woder if there was any QA involved in making this port.  At this point I was pretty bummed and I was ready to do something else, but I kept doing the tutorial until my system rebooted (my laptop's fans didn't keep up with the generated heat; but that's an unrelated hardware issue I have). Hence: this review.  All in all, the game looks very interesting and _maybe_ I'll try it again later, but it's a pitty that I had to step into all these issues which remind me of the Xfree86/artsd era. Maybe it works better on a desktop. Who knows,

261	1	a	Lucius, a 'Puzzle' game with a gloomy and dark setting.  Pros : + New kind of puzzle, I call it a puzzle to kill a person without anyone know  Cons : - You can't solve the puzzle in several ways - The puzzle clue is somewhat hard, and needs attention to solve  Why I repeat the puzzle word is because, while it's kind of new for the theme of this game, Lucius is no more that a puzzle game or point to click adventure like 'Deponia' or other games.  From the theme and review, I was expected I would have several ways to kill a person, but it seems the game didn't meet my expectation and you can kill the person with just one way, the way the game designer designed the next person will die in that way.  I hope steam allow me to do a so-so review, because while the game is kind of a new breeze in the theme, it's kind of boring because you have to roam the house just to find the correct item or way to help you kill the person. Why don't the game let you decide what do you want to do with that person way to die?  I still recommended this game to you that haven't played the game. And it would be wise if you wait until the game on sale.

69	0	a	Unfortunately Lucius is buggy with a poor checkpoint system and has game breaking levels that are just unacceptable. The vague tutorials will have you looking for walkthroughs quickly and hampered by bugs in the game. Sometimes leaving you with the game over screen when it shouldnât be. Lucius is a clever idea and can be funny at times, but overall misses the mark.

2297	1	a	Controls - C / 4 out of 10 Graphics - C / 4 out of 10 Sound - A+ - 10 out of 10 Story - A+ - 10 out of 10  Verdict?  A++++++++++++++. 1000 out of 100  The greatest game I have ever, ever played. More deserving of the title 'Game of the Year' than any single game ever. Better than Ocarina of Time. Better than Fallout. Better than Grand Theft Auto. The true Famitsu would've given this game 280 out of 40.  Let me explain my scores up there some more. The graphics look like they belong to a game from the middle of the PS2 era, the controls are horrific. The music is amazing, but most of what makes it amazing is the timing of it. Sitting down around a table somber just after someone died? Bring on the whistling! But what truly makes this game shine, is the story and the characters. Every single character is interesting and lovable, though not always to the same person - for example I hate Raging Bull Jack, but I'm quite sure someone out there thinks Jack is hilarious.  For $24.99, this is one game you should not miss out on. So buy it, and get hype for the greatest game ever.  OK, Zach?

2221	1	a	Twin peaks was a weird show huh Diane?   Final score 8/10
2365	1	a	Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.  But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.

The game in itself wasn't difficult but I had to look for ''walkthrough'' to avoid the lags and be able to keep playing, which is a shame really. The game in itself is a melting pot of humor, horror and drama. The story and characters are awesome and makes you want to keep playing to know what happens next.   For me, this was a little gem and I'm recommending it for anyone who wants something a little different.

704	0	a	Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't. You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.  In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.

573	1	a	Lucius is a game very heavily based on the movie 'The Omen'. It's a great game that places you in the role of the devil's child Lucius. Despite it looking like a horror game, it is not really scary since you are the threat that's killing people on the go. You get a big mansion with a lot of staff in which you will kill them one by one in seperate chapters.  Overall the game feels like a puzzle game, and a pretty tough game at that. I really enjoyed playing it. I'm just going to list some positives and negatives below:  YES Great idea for a game Big location Gruesome deaths A lot of backstory on most characters Awesome demonic powers So much death!  NO A lot of bugs and glitches Controls make you feel like you are driving a tank instead of controlling a 6-year old Bad voice acting for some characters Not scary Very linear  Despite the games awesomeness, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. In the second chapter, the mom kept walking into the door leasing outside, despite it being locked. Also, the telekineses power is very hard to use most of the time. There have also been a couple of instances in which I hard to start a chapter again because people would not die when they were supposed to, or stayed put when they were supposed to wak out of the room.   Despite all of this, Lucius is an awesome little game that puts you in the bad guy's shoes. A part 2 is on its way, so let's hope the developers have learned from their mistakes and will release an awesome sequal!

1427	1	a	One of the best horror/puzzle games I've ever played and in my opinion it's the best one in the whole series of Penumbra. The underground laboratory and housing setting adds much immersion and the 'creatures' that lurk down there do so as well. The Storyline is above-average in my opinion it's not God-Tier but its pretty good. There isn't much I can say about this as there is not much to say without spoiling it but I highly recommend this if your looking for a pretty good fright or just a good game to immerse yourself in.

2192	1	a	I listened to a lady drone on and on about her magic pot, I drove too fast and my car flipped sideways and went on for about 50 feet before correcting itself, I shot 360 bullets from a single magazine of a sub machine gun, smoked for 6 hours inside a guys trailer, then I stole his root beer from the cupboard. I had a wacky chase scene with a guy in a raincoat chasing me throwing an infinite number of axes at me, had a quicktime event that everyone has failed at some point or another. Finally I ate 3 hotdogs and slept for 12 hours.  11/10 GOTY
2213	1	a	This is by far the most interesting pile of absolute garbage I have ever had the brain grinding pleasure to wade through.
2049	1	a	Plays like a cross between Planescape torment and Divine Divinity. Not as good as either. Story is quite mature and lots of reading involved, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you like your games. A lot of time and dedication went into the making of this game, and it is clearly a work of love by the creators. Buy it. 80 out of a 100 in my opinion.

Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness.[1]  Dizziness, fatigue, and nausea are the most common symptoms of motion sickness.[2] Sopite syndrome in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness. Nausea in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship).[3][4] If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting won't relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person could vomit until the cause of nausea is found.'  Well, 'the cause of the nausea' has been found and its name is 'Zombie Driver HD'. Seriously, if you were to design a game to cause 'a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement', this would be it. Zombie Driver HD, is basically a vomit simulator . . . in HD (or should that be 'stimulator'? I dont know. I've just been playing it, so im fairly disorientated).  I would highly recommend trying the demo before you buy, as watching the trailer does not do justice to the epic degree of nausea felt while actualy playing.  Then again, you might, (like I did), think 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. It looks cool. Im getting it.' More power to you. You too can be the ower of the most powerful 'multicolour yawn' inducing set of camera options in gaming.

2247	1	a	I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.  The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an â¥â¥â¥ losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, 'Are you there, Zach?'

1784	1	a	This game is a must for any puzzle/horror fun who wants a thrill ride fueled with mystery. Some times the game glitches out during puzzles, forcing you to reload a previous save. Save points are quite few and far between so beware, if something seems off and you've already tried everything, then its most probably glitched and you will need to reload. Other than that the story is interesting and mysterious, tempting you to see it through to the end just so you know what happens.

2600	1	a	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around. (The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)  - Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic.   - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.

2023	1	a	This game is actually really good. There is real depth to this game and like the diablo series randomly generated items ranging from potions to rings. It feels like a cross between Arcanum, Baldurs Gate, Diabo while making itself a rich experience of its own. NPCs either like you or dont and you unfluence dialogue by your skills or your choices. If you see this on sale its worth the the regular price, I grabbed this on sale thinking id get an hour but found this experience to actually draw me in over and over.

1852	1	a	It's good and pretty scary, until you find out how easily you can kill all the dogs and bypass all the threats. It's essentially a survival horror stealth game with one of the most clunkiest inefficient combat systems out there that is purposely bad to make you feel utterly hopeless. A great idea to drive the horror with poor combat, sort of like how Resident Evil took use of the bad camera angles to gimp and make the characters have a weakness. However, poorly executed, could be way better if the combat is scrapped entirely or gimped even more.  Ignoring all the flaws, it's still a very good horror game.

Enemies can't just be ambushed from the shadows as you can in 'Penumbra: Overture' to clear out an area and make it safe.  If you want a scary and stressful time, get the Penumbra pack! Also, keep an eye out for 10 statues hidden throughout the game.

2736	0	a	I tried to play the game Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut yesterday. This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010. It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.  Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.  Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.  This is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the 'quirky dialogue' as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.

762	1	a	Woke up, rode my trike into the garage, doused my mechanic in gasoline, and set that n-word on fire.
2002	0	a	Yes, this RPG is 'old-school'. And believe me: I *know* old-school computer RPG's, which I've been enjoying since the Commodore Amiga days. So, I know what kind of hardcore design and grueling challenge and slogging gameplay I'm in for, with an RPG like this. But there's good old-school, and there's bad old-school - and this is *bad* old-school.  The best qualities of this game are its story and dialogs, and its dark, gritty atmosphere. The artwork and music are good, for an old-school game. The turn-based combat is okay (though I've seen far better). But it's all ruined (for me, anyway) by the ridiculous numbers of restorative potions you have to guzzle during and after combat, even if you play on the game's 'easy' setting. Not even in Diablo did you have to use and manage *this* many potions. There's the ubiquitous health potions and mana potions, but there's also stamina potions, which are the worst offenders.  Just about every action (especially the combat actions) requires a certain amount of stamina - and your reservoir gets used up quickly. (Running out of stamina in the middle of combat is a frequent and dire problem.) Once you've cleared an immediate area of opponents, you can stand around and do nothing, which will slowly regenerate your stamina. (Or you can switch to walking around at a snail's pace, but then your stamina regeneration is lowered to a glacial pace.) But there's no 'rest' key to press, to speed up the process. There's no 'camp' option, either. Nor can you trek back to town and sleep at an inn. (Although you can pay the priest there to restore all your health, stamina, and mana, but that gets to be prohibitively expensive, and he's way on the other side of town.)  So, you the player literally have to sit there, staring at the screen and waiting for your character's stamina to regenerate. Oh, you can go take a quick bathroom break or go grab something to snack on, or whatever, while your stamina regenerates, but the number of times you'll find yourself having to do this is beyond ridiculous. Really, the game pretty much *forces* you to rely on stamina potions - and lots of them.  There's also a heavy (albeit lesser) reliance on health potions and mana potions, and those too you'll have to upkeep in your inventory by the dozens as you continually burn through them. (And if you have a henchman or two, fighting for you, you'll burn through the health and stamina potions even faster! Because they need them too, as often as your character does.) You'll end up dedicating a third or more of your ample inventory just for upkeeping potions.  Eventually, you'll find magic items (rings, amulets, belts, etc.) that can speed up (by, say, 20%) the regeneration of your stamina, which helps a little. Other items will even allow you to ever so slowly regenerate health and mana. (Otherwise, health and mana do *not* regenerate at all!!) But those items are hard to find and prohibitively expensive, the first dozen levels or so of your character's progression. And even when you do acquire them, you'll continue having to burn through potions by the scores as opponents get tougher and exploration gets deeper and more protracted.  Well, after around 10 hours of gameplay (including trying first with a paladin and then re-starting with a rogue), I think I'm going to toss aside this computer RPG and move on to the next one in my queue. I've played more than enough of this type of game to know if it's worthwhile, and for me this one is not.

Lucius succeeds in surpassing my expectations with it's artistic flair and gripping story. with a plot heavily inspired by The Horror Classic 'The Omen' yet cis creative enough to pump in original ideas and establish its own identity, Lucius triumphs in a storytelling view. the visuals work well with fleshed out character designs and and a beautiful mansion setting, large enough to work as a world within the game and can be explored throughout. If there was one thing to gripe about it's the controls. Lucius has only two speeds: Slow as S#it or fast as F*@k, depending on if you sprint or not. still, the game is well worth a play and I highly reccomend it

1967	1	a	Run from the dogs: The Simulator  Haven't played Penumbra games as first Frictional game I played was 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent', which I really liked a lot. So going back to older Frictional games was quite odd.  Anyhow, game is horror'wise quite weak and the 'combat' is just horrific, but the storytelling &amp; puzzles make up for it. Considering this is first frictional games game &amp; it's almost 10 years old then this game is quite good. So obviously it isn't as polished gameplay'wise nor looks as amazing in comparison to newer Frictional games titles, but that was a great start and there are 2 more chapters to this game.  Though i found it easier to run &amp; lead dogs rather than avoiding them altogether. Seriously.. those damn dogs.. Ending was somewhat sad as well.   Want a game with interesting Puzzles &amp; Story then sure, play this game.  In a nutshell: +Interesting story +Great puzzles +Fitting atmosphere -Isn't as 'scary' as hoped for -Horrific combat  7/10
1354	1	a	A good game, made by the same people who made Penumbra Overture and Amnesia. If your into puzzle horror games then this is what your looking for, Its puzzles can be simple or just damn too confusing. However the horror makes up for the puzzles giving Penumbra a dark atmosphere, Its story line isn't something to follow as most of the time you will be interested then flat out bored of it because its mostly go here do this and then go there and do that. Overall Its a good game and would recommend it.

Keyboard controls also suck hardcore for a lefthanded person like me... you see, I like using my mouse with my left hand... which means I usually use arrow keys to nagvative, not that WASD â¥â¥â¥â¥. so there's usually a delayed reaction for my character when I have to switch between mouse and keys.... that ends up with my character dying a lot. it's actually much more work to play this game than it is fun to play.....

Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece.   Supports Window Mode. Has controller compatibility. Changeable Graphic resolution.

It's reminiscent of the first two GTA games - a top down driver where you're occasionally equipped with weapons but always running over crowds of zombies. The music isn't great, so I muted that and played my own tunes. Lots of fun though.
2701	0	a	Ok I'm done. I'm done trying to get this to work. For as ambitious of a game as Deadly Premonition is, this port completely ruins whatever might have been a good game. I spent almost 30 hours of my life dealing with crashes, glitches, and other glaring issues and even removing all of that from the picture the game still has its problems which makes it completely unforgivable.  If you have any interest in playing this game whatsoever I would recommend you try and find a way to play it on the original platform(s) (360/PS3) as the port is just awful. Even after applying the fan-recommended patches the game has a dice roll for every area you load as to whether it will crash the game. Loading times can vary from 15 seconds to 2 minutes depending on factors you cannot control. Without the graphics patch the entire experience is blurry and ungratifying.  Even after patching the game and overlooking most of the porting issues. DP has fundamental problems with the aiming system which is very camera-dependent and glitchy at best. Vehicular controls are equally shoddy and the mapping system is more of a hinderance than it is a boon. The profiling sections serve more to cram ridiculously obvious information in your face than to reveal anything new and the chapter review quizzes are basically an insult to the viewer's intelligence ('HEY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED 5 MINUTES AGO? HERE'S A QUIZ!!'). I really, _really_, tried to make this game work because it came off as highly recommended but the truth is it's just a mediocre silent hill clone with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ RE4 controls and a lamentable open-world system.   I'm going to spend the rest of my 'time' on this game watching a longplay just to see how the story ends. I recommend you do the same.

The combat system is useless, and we have to fight a lot with rabid dogs, and spiders. Don't waste time on it, play Amnesia Penumbra was developed, when Frictional games had less experience.

1472	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague is basically a prototype version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This is not a criticism; just know that if you are coming hot off of Amnesia there will be some steps backward.  Having gotten rid of the ability to fight back in Overture, Frictional Games makes a much more frightening game in Black Plague. The enemies you encounter in Black Plague are gross-looking, cannot be killed, and sometimes carry light sources to see you in the dark. Unfortunately, they are also dumb as rocks and there are plenty of objects you can jump on top of, safely out of reach, and look around to solve your predicament. At one point, I managed to glitch a mattress in a doorway to keep a monster out of the room I was in.  Without spoiling too much, there are plenty of moments that made me jump or feel uncomfortable and the plot balances 'scary heeby-jeebies' with actual plot development, letting the horror set in by implications of the happenings around you rather than the monsters you find haunting you.  Overall, Black Plague is a vast improvement over Overture and from a design perspective, it's interesting to see how Frictional Games went from that game on to their more popular game, Amnesia. If you like Overture, Black Plague is better. If you like Amnesia, give the Penumbra series a shot (and check out the fan-made Penumbra mods for Amnesia; they take place after the official Penumbra games).

2219	1	a	In the game, Deadly Premonition, the main character is recommended a sandwich consisting of turkey, strawberry jam and cereal stuffed between two pieces of bread. A few moments later, he declares it's the best. sandwich. ever.  That describes DP. It's a janky, open world game with poor controls, PS2-era graphics, the worst driving in any any game, and shooting controls that make you want to cry. The voice acting is painful (except York, the main character; I love that guy), and the character animation is so bad, I was shocked that they actually used motion capture for it. It's plot is a convoluted mess, liberally rips off Alan Wake, Twin Peaks, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and with a touch of Cthulu mythos.... and yet....  And yet it's been one of my favorite gaming experience of the year. It's a game so bad that it flips back to good, to bad again, and edges back to good again. All the pieces are so bad, yet the whole was so satisfying in a crazy sort of way.  Now excuse me, I'm going to try that turkey sandwich. Maybe it will surprise me too.

2747	0	a	This product should not be sold on Steam. Granted, there are some people who successfully installed and ran and even played it, BUT there are many many others, myself included, who have tried and failed multiple times to play it.  Generally, I usually chuckle at people who have problems installing a game but this time the joke is on me. I tried three different PCs, nothing funky in the hardware and OS of any of them (all Win 7 64bit). Long story short, I did manage to run the game. My gameplay (after actually entering the game) consisted of one interaction before the game crashed. Repeated attempts came to the same conclusion: it seemed that any interaction caused the game to crash.  There are a number of so-called fixes, none of which worked. An amusing one requires you to run the PhysX driver over again, first to uninstall and then to reinstall. This actually works, sorta. It allowed me to get behind an instant crash and get the game running. But as noted above, the game would crash soon thereafter.   If you get DP as part of a cheap bundle, go for it and roll the dice, but don't pay even a Steam holiday sale price for this product.
2765	0	a	I really wish there was a shrug icon when reviewing games. On the one hand, I am enjoying this, on the other, there are way too many cutscenes! It almost seems like take three steps forward, watch a cutscene, etc. The controls feel very awkward at the start. Unlike a lot of other players, I'm not having problems with CTD or FPS drops, so I can't complain about that.

595	1	a	I love this game so much due to the fact that I'm playing as the son of the Devil. I'm going to just dive right in by saying that I haven't even completed the game yet but I felt like it deserved a nice review! So, the main goal of the game is to give your father souls. To do this you must kill your family, people who work for your family and your families friends. Pretty funny right? No. You literally give some pretty gruesome deaths to people for no reason whatsoever! I love it! You have cool powers like Telekinesis, Mind Control and more! This game focuses on following a plot [kinda] which is why you can't just kill people randomly, and you can only kill people with certain moves or objects.   Lucius 2 is the game for you if you feel like literally killing everyone who crosses your path. It's just rooms of people that you are allowed to kill - constantly. 
1835	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a first person adventure/stealth game for cynophobics: you can sneak past the dogs or if you really, really hate the beasts you can sneak behind them with a pickaxe and bash them to death by wildly flailing your mouse around and hoping it hits something. Given how clumsy this was, the developers abandoned combat in the sequel and everything they've made since. This is either their great discovery that revolutionized horror gaming or a gigantic mistake that led to the genre abandoning resource management and becoming a puddle of samey, poorly-designed walking simulators with bad lighting.  Regardless, it still nails the sensation of being trapped in a not-quite abandoned Greenland mine, at least to someone who has never been to Greenland or lived off dead spiders and dog meat in a mine shaft (if you have by any chance experienced either of these and feel that I am mistaken, feel free to let me know). If this sounds appealing to you and you don't mind the possibility of having to load someone else's save after the game refuses to acknowledge that you plugged a power cable in properly, you will probably enjoy Penumbra: Overture whether it spooks you or not.    Also, pay attention to the store page's screenshots. They reveal some enemy encounters ahead of time while also picturing several that never actually happen in the game just to keep you on edge. Stuff like this is brilliant and I'm surprised there aren't more horror games that do this.  
2425	1	a	Story of this game is well-made but also full of cliche, still fun. performance is low and lots of bugs and crashes. If you still want to play this game, you must prepare yourself with lots of patience for reboot your computer. I played this game about 48 hours (+several hours for reboot and finding solutions for crashes) but do not regret with it.

1419	0	a	This is a horror game, in the sense that its horrifyingly bad. It uses some old mouse system of interacting with things, meaning to open something you click it with the mouse, hold the key, then move the mouse somehow to open something. Opening doors is a chore in this game, if real life was like this we would never be able to leave our homes. Then again the first room in this game is designed so badly many people never make it out of the room. Better off the games controls are some of the worst in the industry. This game has daddy issues, as in its about finding out about an absent father or some nonsense, yea its not that interesting.  Ha, I bet when the dev made this he was sitting there all like, man these controls are awesome, I'm so awesome, noone did this before, look how awesome I am. Too bad its not awesome, and the reason noone opens doors and things like this is because its annoying. That is the feeling you get from this game its annoying, this game should be called Annoying: Black Plague Edition.   Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00
1786	1	a	Literally and Metaphorically: RED Dead Redemption Great game, on to their next! 8/10 
771	1	a	Not bad at all, but a bit disappointing at the same time.   I must admit that I was never  that big fan of  Omen  movies, but I know them quite well, which made me wondering if this game will try to replicate and refer to it, as the main character, place and story seems quite, well, familiar for everyone who watched Omen.  As for the story - it's simple, slowly progressing as you make your next kills. Not much to say about it - probably could be a bit better seeing that all adults seem really clueless. But oh, this is the part of fun.   Graphics and music are also okay  - I wasn't experiencing any sudden drop rates or weird rendering bugs - it's alright. I don't pay much of attention to graphics as long as they are fine-tuned. Animations and cutscenes are good, but the fact that little Lucius is keeping his poker face all the time is weird, or scary either. As for music I wouldn't expect more. the single track that keeps repeating in background while playing is matching game's atmosphere.   IBut as for gameplay.  Eh, here we go. The game itself isn't that sophisticated, I would call it fairly easy, but... Yeah. I've been playing adventure games for quite a long time but Lucius left me annoyed at times. Looking for a small, few pixels big object to break, or item to pick up isn't the way. And this brings up another topic. There's only one way to complete game. Everyone's way to hell is planned by developers and you need to follow it. No exceptions. You can't lit on fire a cute lady that is supposed to be poisioned. You can't shoot her in the face and then mind control the cop who caught you into commiting suicide with the same gun. For obvious reasons - this isn't sandbox game and any non-linear deaths would cause the whole scripted story-line to collapse. As for length of the game - took me around eight hours to complete. Could be better. Why people aren't trying anymore? There are some bugs, some of them causing game to crash (picking up dad's ammunition for the second time).  I know that Lucius 2 is around the corner and it's promised to be different game, making up for some of it's precursor mistakes. We shall see.   6/10 - Original game concept, but disappointing gameplay.  + Game concept, because there's nothing better than killing your family members on cold, winter night. + Game length. Of course another hour or two wouldn't be bad. + Heh, son of satan.  - Too linear. - Some annoying gameplay stuff.

2106	0	a	The dialogue reads like it was written by an 11 year old boy, one of the first conversations describes someone as a 'weirdo' and the town as 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'  If you're writing an rpg game, your writing needs to be better.  The ui and mechanics are poor and the engine makes combat more difficult than it need be.  Theres no tutorial, not even a text prompt to tell you how to add spells, or use potions, see item stats etc, these are all forgiveable once you know but this game isnt polished.  Id give this one a miss if i were you.
2125	0	a	Game seemed alright at first despite obvious crappy graphics, annoying amount of reading required, weak storyline and lack of tutorial / control introduction. But despite this i still tried it, i circled a camp killing bats trying to stay close to the camp so the quick travel map wouldnt keep popping up, returned to guard to complete quest and it was ready to be completed, finished talking to the guy and suddenly im transported to a menu screen so i go back into my game and my character no longer accepts any commands except to look at his quest book. I try to complete the quest to enter the city which now apparently does not work and i cant talk to the guard now can i move my character or enter the city. almost 25 minutes into the game and im trapped in a bug on the very first quest. Cant recommend a game that looks and runs this bad to anyone.

2047	1	a	Saw this game on STEAM sale, got it for my steam collection played it, finished and reviewing it.   Graphically the game isn't ground breaking and it's nowhere near to any of the modern RPGs that we see nowadays. Combat system is also not very appealing but it does the job but skill system really is interesting and feels somewhat unique. Music/Background score is awesome it does feel eerie when you go to certain locations and changes according to the location and the mood of the scenario. The strongest part is the story. Yes if you wanna buy this game and wanna enjoy it to the fullest then you gotta read a lot. It has so much content to read in this game it can make a novel out of it. Thankfully I don't mind reading and enjoy reading if the content is good and definitely content here is no joke. There are some logical explanations too given but that'll be spoiler if I explain them here. If you wanna play a game that has interesting story and tons of quests to do which are mostly related to the main story arc then this game is for you.  Mind you this game is not casual ARPG fans. You will not get directions, no indicators to complete your quests and combat is painfully difficult at the beginning. But once you understood how things work then it is going to be a rewarding experience and trust me you would ask for more. I recommend this game to only serious ARPG fans , those who can invest some time and play it with patience or else just stay away from it.
2253	1	a	This game is truly one of the strangest games you'll ever play, but that's why it's brilliant.  It'll take some time to adjust to the clunky combat and annoying driving segments, but the story, the humour and the characters are all excellent.  I loved this game.  Not many people know about it, but don't be afraid to grab it! Highly recommended.

986	1	a	So far for my first 30 minutes this game trows me instantly into a zombie mess, after that there is no tutorial (-1 point) and you must learn the controls from the settings, the game mecanics are impresive plus the graphics are good enough and working good witht the blood decals, the weapons are ranked to bad to better like the flametrower, can do some damage to the big zombies but not for a long range but shorty it will ran out of amm and than we have the rocket launcher that has low ammo but massive damage and explosive radius. Upon this game basics, this gem brings you car and gun upgrades, not so good because they kinda are unlockables and that means they can be unlocked trough the story, the enviroment is very fascinating plus that weather and day/night system makes it look even gorgeous and they couldn't just leave the game only with zombies by their selves, they added freaking BOSS fights, the controls may not be that easy while trying to aim your weapons but it's worth the try.  I feel like I haven't payed enough for this game, still haven't enough money in wallet xd. 8/10 will run into zombies if I had the chance in real life, wish me luck.

First, it runs just in 720p, except you got the fix, and the in-game-mechanics aren't great either, driving physics from hell (and there are RACES, who would want to do that?). and it crashes so every often..my game is now broken to the extend that I can't play any further. It crashes after a cutscene, when it's loading...so, please, DO NOT BUY!! cheers, Sam
1881	1	a	This game is f****** scarry!!
2077	0	a	The setting and writing are very nice, and the mechanics on screen are interesting, some variation of d&amp;d games like baldurs gate, yet the game fails to deliver badly due to combat mechanics being broken beyond repair. Specifically stamina. All the rest of stuff could be forgiven somehow, but stamina is a deal breaker. You burn stamina like there's no tomorrow, and constitution doesnt help much beyond increasing your initial stamina pool by a bit, which again, burns after the first mob you face. After that you have to wait forever or be hopeful you brought enough dozens of potions, otherwise its a trip back to town. All of this on easy,  I shudder to think how crap the combat would be on on the hardest difficulty, the designer only played the game as a caster.  And that helped by the mobility issues that can be tolerated: Your character acts at a snail pace due to d&amp;d-like rules being applied in real time, it can be tolerated because for movement you can invest on speed, and for other actions it is not THAT bad although an attack speed attribute would have been cool to have.  All in all, once I started fighting less time than going back to town for supplies I decided the game writing was not worth the pain and bugs, and crap. Sad because it looked promising, check the forums, no more fixes to mechanics or bugs, game is dead. Do not play, it's a waste of time.

2282	1	a	A bad port of an already creaky game, the first enemy you will face in this game is the game itself. Google DPfix - the patch made by a saintly individual who also rescued the Dark Souls port - as this is essential. The controls will annoy you, the generally clunkiness will annoy you, and the combat will definitely annoy you.  But here's the thing: I'm recommending it, and rather forcefully. From a technical standpoint it's terrible, and don't get me wrong, it's shocking, but the actual content of the game acts as a huge counterweight. You'll get over the annoyances and get sucked in to this little town, in which you can get up to what you're supposed to be up to as an FBI agent, or simply dawdle, have lunch at the diner, go fishing, then get hammered a bar in the evening. You spend your time in this town however you choose to, and although the main plot is always there, waiting to progress and conclude, there's always time to just enjoy the town. This is one of the few games in which you, as an agent of the law, can make the active choice to just have a day off - and that doesn't mean just pausing proceedings, it means potentially finding interesting side-stories as you take it easy.  For all that it lacks in the technical department, it does something that the Elder Scrolls games are vocal about doing but have yet to actually achieve: a convincing town, with people acting as individuals with their own priorities and schedules. I can't think of another game in which this has been achieved quite so well.
1500	1	a	Fantastic game, I'd even say I liked it more than Amnesia. A very important note for everyone though: PUT THE GAME ON HARD MODE. Anything below hard allows you to survive 6+ hits and even KILL the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ monsters with little effort.  The atmosphere and setting are way better than anything Amnesia could hope to be, but the level design is mediocre at best.
226	1	a	An OK game. The gameplay is steady and fun. The achievements are quite easy to achieve (minus the 20 and 40 hour ones).  Unfortunately, replayability is not this game's strong suit. Once you have played it once (you can get all achievments on a single playthrough) there isn't any benefit to playing it again, since you know how to kill each and every one of them. The mansion's floorplan could have been better. It is very awkward to move around in and it is difficult to learn. Even after completing the entire game, I still don't have a good idea of what's where in the mansion.  7/10

2666	0	a	I've heard a lot about this game. This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.  I must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...  First of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these 'quests' are like 'find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM' (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), 'find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)', 'find sheriff's dumbbell', 'find sheriff's assistant's keys' and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY...  ...the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like 'guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff' and just push you through till the end. Seriously, â¥â¥â¥â¥ quests I didn't finish! â¥â¥â¥â¥ exploring! Surprise, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!  Another thing, last, but not least.  ATTENTION! SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this if you still decided to buy and play this game!     Imagine that you are playing first Silent Hill, you enjoy every second of it and in the end of the game Alessa turns out to be a giant Godzilla with rocket launchers and a big pink ponytail. This is what I felt during the bossfights with George and Kaysen. I understand, that this is a Japanese game, it is supposed to be odd and weird, but Swery, seriously, is it some kind of trolling or were you just high? What the â¥â¥â¥â¥, man?    Thank you for reading this if u did. I am not going to persuade you not to buy this game, I am just sharing my own opinion. For me this game is one of the biggest disappointments ever compared to other games I've played. It started so good and ended like absolute delirium.

1621	1	a	play penumbra or i'll let wild geese into ur room at night
1279	1	a	Well, as a second review, I want to make this as positive as can be. Penumbra points out the pefect imperfections of human nature. Dark areas with whispering, slithering, crawling and screaming in the background allows for a more 'intimidating' experience. Enemies are fuel for nightmares, conjured up from the fears of fellow humans. The general atmosphere will make your heart pound and make you sweat. The good ol' fashioned jumpscares (how few they are) will last in your memories and well, deep into your dreams. Nightmares* excuse me.    Now, the ONE (1) bad thing I had was not game-ruining; a simple lighting error with the shader. A simple fix of course. Lower the shader resolution to medium. Bing, bang you're back in action! If you left in the first place.   My computer is nothing close to a gaming rig, however, Penumbra runs at above 60fps with hardly (meaning none) any lag ingame, don't be deterred if you're using a less-than-perfect machine.    10/10 would rebuy, reinstall and replay it over and over.

2433	1	a	Filled with a patent strangeness not unlike that of Twin Peaks, Deadly Premonition provides an incredibly memorable cast of characters and an excellent story that will keep you guessing until the end. The game is thrilling, suspenseful, intense, cheesy, and ridiculous, with the right balance of each. It has relatively low production values, but it's almost endearing, feeling akin to cult B movies. This game has solidified itself as one of my favourites. I have no doubt I will come back and play this game again many times in the years to come, reliving the story and getting to know the citizens of Greenvale all over again. Right, Zach?  A quick disclaimer: This game is a relatively poorly done console port, so at the time of writing, there are some technical issues. I found the experience was greatly enhanced by using DPFix and JoyToKey to play with a controller with better looking visuals. Crashes were rare for me, and I was able to play the game without too many problems, but some others have had trouble running the game. The developers have expressed intent to fix these issues, though, so we will hopefully see an improvement soon.
2811	0	a	You can't really fully enjoy the game when the crashes keep you from progressing. Yes, there are a lot of them.
2542	1	a	If you're like me, you'll walk into this game blind. You'll have to fight with technical issues and endure some unpolished gameplay. If you're like me, you'll find yourself loving the characters so much that whatever issues the game has takes a back seat to the experience and you'll want to know what happens next.

515	1	a	I love the premise behind this game, and I was excited to play as a serial killer. But I can't seem to figure out a way to play this game that isnt low low graphics settings or normal graphics with very laggy gameplay.
2410	1	a	Though for some reason I get terrible frames in this game (not optimized still?), I can't not recommend this game to fans of old Sega Dreamcast openworld adventure/mystery games (Shenmue, Blue Stinger, etc.). The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10
1705	1	a	This is the first of a trilogy made by the makers of Amnesia, so if you've played Amnesia then you will find pretty much a lot of similarities from that franchise in these games in a more modern day scenario (amnesia was set in the middle ages, this is modern, so instead of a lantern with oil, you have a flashlight with batteries, although you also have a glowstick with unlimited power, but obviously not as powerful as the flashlight) with a somewhat interesting (and honestly confusing) storyline. If you're looking for a single player game that is cheap and will have you thinking to solve puzzles and that you'll play around 10 hours on (in each game) I recommend the Penumbra trilogy!

2085	0	a	Well I definitely agree with all the reviews that say this is a potion drinking simulator. Any problems? Drink more potions until you win. Combat is somewhat clunky, weapons break very fast, game doesn't really teach you how to play. The story is interesting enough except due to poor colour choices and layout of the dialogue boxes its a pain to separate one part of a convo from a different one. hos game doesn't give me quite the hard on i wanted and there are plenty other isometric rpgs that do the job better than this one unfortunately. I will continue to play and update this should be be warranted but first impressions are important and that is what you get.
1870	1	a	Penumbra's brooding and downright compelling atmosphere will suck you in from the moment the ladder below the hatch breaks down and leaves you trapped in the lugubrous mining shafts. Give this game a try.

1812	1	a	I love horror games, especially first person horror games, and I REALLY wish I could write a better review for this one. I understand a game where the atmosphere is important, that's what gives the game immersion. All Penumbra: Overture had was immerson techniques used by lights, textures and audio. I thought that in itself was really cool, and halfway through playing I was wondering when the 'scares' were going to happen. They never came. It took me four hours to get through this game because I wanted to get everything I could out of it. Overture is not a bad game in any means, but it lacks what every horror game needs: horror. I'd still recommend it, though. Just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it won't hopefully scare someone else's socks off! If you choose to get it, have fun! However, if you're aso wondering why there aren't any scares, play through it for the experience. 4/10 for me :(

Those that don't like this game and those that were birthed by the divine womb of Deadly Premonition to rise on high during endtimes and sit in judgement of those that are unworthy in both earth below and heaven above.  I count myself as the latter. Are you mortal or are you divine?

460	1	a	BEST GAME EVER ~_~ STEAM TRADING CARD ART IS THE BEST!
2312	1	a	I played this game years ago, and to this day if someone asked me to name the craziest game I've ever played, or the most annoying game, or most surprising game, OR even one of the best games E-VER - you guessed it. This one right here.   I've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.  I admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did.   I remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself 'I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!' I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.  It was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!  Thank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort. That was rewarding). And thanks for keeping me awake and for completely exhausting me with your twisty plotline. For that, you earn a special place on my lifetime gaming list.

2476	1	a	This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game.   Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.  But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.
2305	1	a	Terrible but also good.
2567	1	a	This is a game you have to appreciate for what it is. It is the tropic thunder of video games. its a spoof of spoofs while spoofing itself and then somehow still is taking itself seriously in regards to the overall story. Its also worth noting that this game is actually a movie in a videogame. There is a universe of movies where the characters in game are really just actors. Spyfiction is one of the other games that is actually a movie in the universe. Forrest (a character in DP) has the same 'actor' as another character in Spyfiction.   But onto the review. So while you get bad repetitive music (which is a joke on purpose and actually kind of catchy) and characters that are laughable yet deviously insidious you find yourself caught in a confusion of emotions regarding the game. It catches you and sucks you in with it's hard to take serious yet super serious dialogue. I played this originalyl on Ps3 and i kept laughing out loud at the game because it was so bad... but then i found myself going to houses and asking questions and being a detective because i needed to know what was happening. The numerous time specific side quests that give more insite that are only found by what would seem to be chance give more back ground and much of the games nuance for the story is missed if you avoid them by accident or lack the ability to find them. And the story is actually so... well i wont give anything away but its WORTH the time and effort and the annoying car noise that is satans fingernails on a chalkboard.
2790	0	a	 2/10   At first I struggled with the game crashing. After fixing that I realized that crashing is actually better than playing this game.
2981	0	a	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.   
1093	1	a	This game is a lot more fun than it has any right to be. Top-down view, drive around the city (and other environments in the different game modes) and slaughter zombies. That doesn't sound like it should be anything special, but this game pulls it off especially well to make it a fun game.   It's definitely a great little time waster, and definitely worth getting. :)

2997	0	a	Deadly Premonition. What can I say? This game is known for being a Twin Peaks-esque cult classic that is easy to overlook as being horrible in every way, yet somehow pulling it all together perfectly.  Unfortunately, it's also notorious on the forums as being nigh unplayable by most people. I unfortunately am faced with the problem. Even after running a mandatory fix for the game, that only got me as far as the mandatory unskippable 5 minute opening cut-scene. Only after this part is over does my game crash every time. After trying a few different methods of fixing it, I concluded that this game is completely broken and not worth the time.  This is a game that I wanted to fall in love with and recommend to all, but I just can't in good conscience do. If you're absolutely determined to play this game, then by all means purchase it for 90% off, but DON'T pay the full amount, and DON'T expect this game to work for you.

929	1	a	Lucius reminds me of Hitman: Blood Money; you have a target, now find the best way to kill them. Generally I enjoyed the game dispite it being released in 2012. The game starts off by explaining that since it's your birthday you inherit the unholy powers of your father(the devil). Through out the game you must kill poeple in the manor to gain more abilities. Each chapter, you find your target and are given hints on how to kill them; the way some characters die in the manor are pretty grim, from being    crushed by a piano to being shot with a nail gun.    The game is not afraid to show it's true colours.

The main game mode is great. The story is amusing.  The only part I absolutely hated with a passion was the blood race tournaments, and no event worse than the race mode. Every freaking corner or turn just becomes a friggin mess.   The cars don't have the handling to take the insane turns and cornering and you just end up spinning out or getting stuck in some random obstacle. Gotta hand it to them, they didn't ease up one bit. They really put the chaos into those races. I only put up with that madness for the achievements. I got all the steam achievements for this game, phew...  The elimination mode of the blood race isn't as bad, but is still a pain. The endurance mode just has a trick to it.   The real fun though is the slaughter mode. Just endless waves of zombies.  After a while it becomes so dense it's like driving through Times Square on New Year's Eve.

2430	1	a	Just finished this game and definitely want more. Its storyline keeps you so wrapped up in what's going on and the characters that you don't want to put it down. I couldn't stay away once I started it! I highly highly highly recommend this game.   Didn't have some of the computer problems others are posting about, however it would crash once in a blue moon, but enough save points to where it didn't make me backtrack.   Get. This. Game!
2264	1	a	So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.  Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic 'who dun it', story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.   The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,  bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.   I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.  Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed. In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

1185	1	a	The game is solid for the price point. There are few things about it that are irritating, but nothing major. Just minor nit picks.   A full review for anyone interested can be found here, but the short version is it's worht the $10 dollar price tag if you don't mind lack of any substantial narrative.   https://basedgamer.com/review/2934/zombie-driver-hd-zombie-driver-is-a-decent-way-to-spend-ten-bucks

2566	1	a	An hilarious game, played it about 10 times on the PS3, but now I dont have that, I bought it on PC. Really random game but good story and gameplay. Personally I think its better for PC. There is one bug, but its only when you boot it up it doesnt load, but this can be fixed by going into the game folder and reinstalling DirectX. A must

2889	0	a	I'm loving this game, having a lot of fun, the weird kind of humor, the tense atmosphere, but still I don't recommend this game. It crashes frequently, and since the game doesn't have a auto-save system, I lost about 2-3 hours of gameplay. I hope they start fixing this crashes, because the game itself (storyline, gameplay) is great, but the crashes can be disappointing.

571	1	a	Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution.   Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.

926	1	a	  This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5â¬

2165	1	a	Deadly Premonition is my favorite game of the entire generation. It's plot, characters and setting are just that engaging every time you come back you still have a great time. The story may sound familiar if you have watched twin peaks in that a girl is murdered in a small town out in the boondocks of america and its up to FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to solve the crime (Call him york by the way, everyone does) but as he arrives in the small town of Greenvale things are not what they seem  with strange phenomenon involving red seeds and a legend of a killer in a red raincoat that only appears on rainy nights. The game bursts and ozzs with personality and charm from the music that plays in the opening menu to the way that York interacts with Zach (his special friend) about b-movies. The directors cut that was originally released on PS3 boasts a new scenes that expand the games ending and also tell the story in a different way. The PC version however brings very little to the table by only offering halloween themed suits for York, Emily, The Raincoat Killer and a car skin and even though the game now runs past 30FPS it just doesn't feel right at that speed as it feels to fast... Another issue is that since the directors cut features reworked movement it feels clunky on the pc without a controller while if it used the original versions tank style controls (which I actually liked) then maybe it wouldn't feel so wierd on PC. The last issue that I have that wasn't addressed in the directors cut is the timing of certain music I will give you an example You're examing a dead body and this forboding unerving music is playing then suddenly it changes to light hearted jazz I will admit I got a laugh out of it the first time around and this is the only time I can really remember this happening.  All complaints aside Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is a game that you have to own Everything about it feels right and it was the game to renew my faith that games can exceed the bar in many aspects without needing multiplayer, graphics with volumetric lighting (otherwise known as WANK) You are a fool to dismiss such a fine game and even more of a fool to insult it One of the generations top games 100000000000/10 
74	1	a	Well, this game is pretty awesome.. I mean killing people, worship Satan and stuff. But, there are also some annoying things such as broken controls, sometimes I couldn't pick up an item and had to reload. And one more thing which made me hate this game for a moment.. it's the mother of Lucius. I hate this stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, she used to follow me every step while I was playing. So sad I had no chance to kill her in a first hour of playing :\

2745	0	a	This game runs poorly, even if you install DPFix. It doesn't look very good. It controls poorly. The combat, hiding, and evasion scenes are even poorly designed, before you get to controlling them. I've had it crash several times. I've only played a short bit on PC to see how it would run, after completiting it on Xbox 360, and I've had force-quits multiple times. I've even heard of bugs that can prevent you from completing the game, which is the entire reason to play the game.   But this game is enchanting. The story and characters, as much as you can say they are stolen from Twin Peaks, are fascinating and engaging. You will likely have numerous fits of laughter as you experience the quirky animations and dialogue. And the plot goes into perhaps even stranger and disturbing depths than Twin Peaks did. It's worth your time to stick with the game, even if the game is not to your liking, because the story is not to be missed.  That said, if a game that has numerous technical issues is going to bother you, then you shouldn't play it. You can experience the story elsewhere, and get most of the enjoyment from watching it as you would playing it, without having to struggle through what most people would consider a negative experience of completing the game's often tedious 'dungeon' segments.   I would say to absolutely wait for sales, even if you really want the game, and know you will enjoy it. This game goes on sale for as much as 90% off fairly regularly, such that I've purchased extra copies for others on several different occasions in the last few years, so you won't have to wait long to get a deal. I first purchased it for $15, as the original release on the Xbox 360, and didn't regret it one bit, but not everyone will get that same enjoyment, or have the same feelings. I can't recommend it at normal price, but cannot recommend it enough for $2.50-$5.
976	1	a	(Updated 29/10/16) ... Added Video.  There are two fundamental flaws with this game...  1) It's not multiplayer. I say flaw because if this game was multiplayer, I am pretty confident none of us would ever play another game ever again except this one. Explosions, endless bullet spray, flames...flames at the corner of my brain, fodder, more flames and a laser which basically just punches a hole through an entire city block. Now all that control in one mans hands is fun, place it in three, have a timer and endless enemy spawns and you have a pixelated armageddon catering for an endless maniacal laughter.  2) There is a scientific equation law here which is never broken. The equation is this... Zombie + Speeding Car = Tomato Sauce. Problem is not everyone likes tomato sauce. Some like Bbq, others go for mayonaise, some like wasabi and some boring people dont want any sauce at all. Since the developer/s do not want to limit their audience they should really provide an option in game where you can either change color of sauce, or even have the option of 'no sauce'.   Maybe modders can come to the developers rescue on the second point since the game has been completely opened up for them to run mayhem. Personally i like to place several sauces at the same time on my fodder, so give me white, red, green, in fact even make a rainbow sauce please so i can really paint the town.  Basically the story mode is rather linear in the way it plays out like carmageddon, so that you run over various zombies picking up people from various locations in the city. Each time you pick someone up you get treated to a small dialogue of the story which more often than not pokes a bit of fun at itself and the zombie game genre providing some laugh out loud moments. But it does become a bit stale after a while because most of the levels are basically the same thing over and over. You just grind away making money so you can buy more cars and upgrades.   Most of the zombies really do the same thing, they just cause your car's health meter to go down when they hit it while your standing still or if they throw a projectile at it. It doesnt take much intelligence to find the zombie spawn points which are usually a converted zombie bus, or a massive zombie hive and blow it up first. There is one zombie which really is a major pain though and thats the fat zombie, which is somewhat parroted from the 'boomer' in 'left for dead' if he gets close enough to your car he will explode causing massive health damage to your car if your still within his blast radius.  The HD graphics in this game are TRULY AMAZING. I found myself a number of times just parking and looking at the beauty around the place regardless to the fact that I was being pounded into the concrete. I just had to look at the houses and green houses and go 'isnt that pretty, go away zombie leave me alone i'm admiring this flowering bush'...  The other grand mention of this game are the two other modes. This is where the game REALLY shines.   First there is a Slaughter mode where its your job to last as long as possible driving around a small map collecting upgrades and money as the waves of zombie spawns slowly get worse each round. There is an achievement to last for 30 waves. This is really challenging and more often than not personally found that my car was exploding into tiny debri even around wave 10. Place this mode in multiplayer and it would be awesome.  Second there is a tournament mode. The tournament caters three events. 1) Blood race. Race around a track against challenging ai racers poling for first position. 2) Endurance mode. Race around a track by yourself, trying to hit the checkpoints in time against a devilish timer. 3) Elimination mode. Race and blow up as many AI cars as possible.  Again if all this was in multiplayer it would bring back the feeling of the good old days of 'rock and roll racing' google it.  Seriously enjoyed the graphics and the fun of the modes, just really, really wish it was multi player and could turn off that damn red color and change it to pretty rainbows. Still recommend, but if you don't like tomato sauce I would give this one a miss until modders or devs give more options.  Finally here is an interesting video which shows the evolution behind Zombie Driver HD so far...         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Making of Zombie Driver&nbsp;

56	1	a	This game was a birthday gift from a great Steam friend, always wanted the game and always wanted to try it but I was always unsure about the game if it would be good.  Well im glad I got to play this game because it is truly an amazing game yes it's from 2012 but the story is pretty cool, It does revolve around one house and one family but the developers have made this work in a good way, you play the game as a child coached by the devil into doing some pretty evil things.  The gameplay was great and I will play this game again to get the last achievements, the graphics are great and it worked well on my 5760x1080 resolution which I really liked.  controls are pretty basic but for this game and it is ok  To me the Steam write-up does not help sell this game and the metacritic score I don't really understand people's low ratings I guess we all see games from different prospective.  I will finish this off by saying if your thinking about buying the game buy it you wont regret it if your into horror.

2759	0	a	Recipe:  3 Parts mediocre Twin Peaks rip off (that's high praise for a Twin Peaks rip off, most don't even qualify as mediocre) 1 Part Silent Hill A pinch of Resident Evil 4 (NO, NO, YOU GRABBED CHRIS' SECTION FROM RE6 YOU FOOL!!!!!!!) Enough bugs and glitches to make the game almost need to be called Deadly Premonition Unity And just a touch of Red Dead Redemption near the end  Honestly, I enjoyed 90% of this game, but no game made in 2013 should need to be run in Windows 98 Compatibility Mode if you want to beat the final boss (who, by the way, is so completely out of place from the rest of this game that it's half the reason I'm not recommending it). I had to spend most of the time in XP Compatibility, but that still crashed occasionally and prevents you from aiming up and down properly which is needed rarely, but when it's needed it's needed. When it was crashing or aiming was required I switched to 98 which had enough load times that my hair turned grey. Occassional... dungeons?... are full of QTE which is thankfully only in those specific chase sequemces. The driving of any car faster than the free cop car involves spinning 360 degrees if you hit a pebble as 90% of vehicles handle like turbo charged bath tubs.  On the other handle, I liked the story and characters. Once I finished with the atrocious final boss I went back and finished all the side quests to learn more about the citizens of Greenvale (hence my 56+ hours of play). Of course, a bug involving quest items and replaying missions caused me to have to restart the entire game to get the second last achievement and the last one won't unlock despite patch notes saying the issue was fixed. If you've got the patience and the weird mind this game aims for, by all means play it. I just can't recommend it with a clear conscience without warning you first.
2071	1	a	A bit Glitchy but if you like an immersive and original rpg, this is your game. Buy it during a sale. It's a shame about the graphics and sound, but not bad for the price.

1582	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague picks up where Penumbra: Overture left off, but with a mild twist; you're playing as Philip from the first game again, but this time, the game is presented as a flashback. After discovering what became of Philip at the end of Overture, we find he has an entirely new set of problems to deal with, and as it turns out, they're much larger in scale. This time around, Philip is joined by a voice in his head that goes by the name Clarence, who simultaneously makes things feel a bit less lonely and increases the general menace of this new realm to explore.  Set mostly in an underground bunker of sorts, Black Plague is a welcome change of pace from all the rocks, rocks, and more rocks of the first game, but has equally ingenious puzzles and challenges to its predecessor, albeit with more modern tools and components at your disposal. This time around, encounters with enemies are a bit more frequent as well, and given the higher intelligence of the area's enemies, these encounters are also a bit more frustrating.  Despite being slightly more annoying and less looming-fear-based, Black Plague goes a long way toward explaining what's going on in Penumbra's setting, and what set off the events that drove Philip underground in the first place. The explanation for the primary force in motion is tied into real-world folklore as well, adding a tinge of realism to an otherwise fantastical situation and making it feel uncomfortably close to home.  Interacting with the world around you and the world itself both feel a bit more polished this time around, with visual upgrades to all your environments and a more responsive set of controls. Music in the game tends toward the ambient end of things and is well-placed, managing not to step on Black Plague's excellent sound design. While it seems to be the standard for horror games, do try to play this with headphones (or really good surround sound) to get the full impact of the audio, as it's clear they put quite a bit of work into it.  Included with Black Plague is Penumbra: Requiem, a puzzle-centric expansion of sorts that ties up a bunch of loose ends still dangling from the first two games while not quite being the third entry in the trilogy Frictional intended. Despite its short length, it's a good end to the series, and finishes the Penumbra games' slide from the real to the absolutely surreal.
1112	1	a	This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to. Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!  Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.  P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.

2005	1	a	Hardcore. Not for those with short attention spans, no time, weak willed or the illiterate. The amount of text and pace of the game might rankle some but persist and you'll find yourself enjoying a very well written and awesomely atmospheric iso RPG that while unforgiving means you feel genuine satisfaction when progressing the storyline or clearing an area of enemies.

A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.' This is the only game that has this problem.  Oh, and the time (69 minutes) I spent 'playing' the game was me trying to get it to actually start.

363	1	a	The good first: Lucius is interesting, macabre, and keeps you wondering who you get to kill next. The storyline is pretty good. A couple of twists keep it interesting (even if you sort of see them coming, you get to say 'I knew it!'). I really did enjoy this game, and it's a game that I would reccommend... if you get it on sale.  The bad: The game gives you literally no options. You have to do everything in EXACTLY the way the developers intended, or you can't complete the chapter. Personally, I'd prefer a little bit of an option on how to kill my victims... I don't want to complete elaborate schemes with no choices. Often, quick timing is required with skills that are less than precise, which can prove to be incredibly frustrating. I do not recommend it to those who rage easily. One scene alone I played for about 45 minutes before I could beat it, and had to continuously kill myself to start the chapter over. Furthermore, there is no 'save' or 'load' option. If you lose a level, you start at the beginning of that level. The levels aren't too long though, so it didn't bother me too much. Some of the cutscenes are very long; I was almost late to work because I was determined to get through the cutscene(s) that were playing, and it took 14 minutes (I had figured itwould only be 2-5 minutes). It's pretty glitchy, and some of your 'powers' are very difficult to control.  Overall: I do recommend this game. It's an interesting premise. Although it could have been better executed, I took it for face value and thoroughly enjoyed it. If glitches or elaborate gameplay irritate you, this may not be the game for you. If you can work around the glitches and enjoy games that are more like movies that you interact with, it's 100% for you.

2475	1	a	It's good.
2153	1	a	On a technical standpoint this game is one of the worst ports of all time.   You will need a lot of patience to get the game running and to actually play it. Through the steam discussion thread that the dev posted I managed to get the game as stable as it could ever be. It would still occasionally crash after long sessions but it could be solved by saving often and restarting the game every now and then.  If you cant be bothered fixing the game, buy it on the console or watch a playthrough on youtube. Skipping this game entirely would be a real shame since it has a cast of interesting and weird characters with some cheesy B-movie moments.   One of the best scenes is the opening scene that shows agent Morgan smoking, on the phone talking about tom and jerry's S&amp;M relationship, reviewing the evidence on his laptop and even holding a bag of evidence in front of his face all while driving through a curvy forest road on a rainy night.  The absurdity of that moment was one of the things that hooked me.  Without going too much into the story, you play a FBI agent investigating a murder case in a small town. This is the best part of the game since you get to interrogate the weird and interesting townsfolk and the identity of the killer is something that will keep you guessing throughout the game.  The gameplay is nothing special, car controls are bad and so is the map but by the middle of the game I found myself knowing the full town layout.  Shooting has been improved for the director's cut giving the gun infinite ammo and having a button that centers on the enemy. Yeah it removes some of the horror survival aspect of the game but makes the game way easier and less frustrating since shooting was a weaker part of the game.  You will need to manage a hunger meter and keep your clothes clean, its pretty trivial and would only become a pain when you try to skip to to do side quests.  In conclusion and a TL:DR for some people: This game is a gem, very raw and unpolished and I hope you wont skip it just because of the bad reviews.
574	1	a	OH GOD ITS SO EVIL. Yet somehow... I really liked it. I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10

2839	0	a	it is a great game but one of the laziest ports in existance, game is a broken mess and the devs knew it.  it might better on console untill either that magic patch arrives either by the lazy doubtful dev team or more than likely fan patching .  as at the moment there is far far far to much to do to make this game work and far to much to do outside of the game to make it finishable
1190	1	a	Its a good game if you have a very short attention span and purchase all the dlc. running over zombies for the first 2 or 3 missions is fun but gets old fast.  If you have any kind of motion sickness like i do and get headaches from too much headbob or unoptimized games, skip this title. Not saying this game is poorly optimized, it runs fine. If i didnt get a migrane from looking straight down, and only seeing 10 feet in front of the vehicle then maybe i would consider launching this game a second time

It's a top-down view (so it makes it hard to navigate unless you stare at your radar 24/7) action-packed apocalypse slaughtercity of bullets, fire, explosives and plasma. A very entertaining game for when you just want to chill out and blow everything up. And for some reason be satisfied with such a bloodfest.   Well, if you have a huge bloodlust and like cars, then this game's probably for you.  The only con I have for this game is the forced top-down view and the voice acting.

It's not only an excellent sequel to Penumbra Overture, but it also manages to stand on its own legs as a really competent horror adventure game. Getting rid of the awfully clunky combat was a good idea, now this game focuses on hiding and evasion more-so than its predecessor. The game doesn't last very long however, so don't expect a grandious adventure like in Amnesia, but damn, the story might be short but it's a good one.

You must lead your character throughout an abandoned underground military base while thwarting the horrors that dwell there and discovering clues about your past. This game is unique from others in the way it creates tension. It is not so direct as other horror games, but I guarantee it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

2028	1	a	Recommended for fans of old CRPGs from Infinity Engine era and beyond. The developers really managed to make a game resembling that golden age and keep it highly playable. Story is slow, but interesting, adding the fact that it mixes true history with fantasy. If you've heard this game has tons of text in it, then you've heard it right: huge amounts of texts and little to no voice acting to give it that extra flavour we got so used to. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that many NPCs say essentially the same things with different words regarding specific topics, you'll want to read it all if you're really involved in it. Combat is your regular d20 and functional, but as all things in this game, visuals incuded, it feels a bit dated. Still, a wonderful nostalgia trip.

This enables the user to turn this horror game into a comedy by throwing random stuff at the monsters. The puzzles are tricky, but not too hard. I would recommend this to gamers that want a rich storyline, with horror elements, and challenging puzzles. Overall it is a great game.

269	1	a	Good storyline Has a surprised and emotional ending There are many secrets But this game has lots of bugs/glitches and no one fix it. Overall: 7/10 
1841	1	a	10/10 would kill dog with pickaxe again.  Pros: -Eerie setting -Great audio -Interesting enough to have me do a playthrough in one sitting -The puzzles can be pretty interesting -Lots of collectible notes, some necessary, others just for story/info  Cons: -Short enough for one sitting (But then again, it's only episode 1). -Running back and forth between areas for puzzles got repetitive. Would have thought this would make it longer... -Story seemed interesting at first, then it just went off track and had nothing to do with the intro.  Overall this gets a 7/10. Enjoyed it :) Looking forward to playing the next episodes (in one sitting).

2266	1	a	This game man. This is one of the only games that I can't really explain to people at all. You either 'get it' or you don't. It's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, don't get me wrong. However, behind all the cornyness, jankyness, bad voiceacting, bugs, terrible gameplay, terrible driving, etc. There is something so god damn geniuine about it, something with all of it's elements mixed together creates something beautiful and emotional if you are the type of person that can connect with it. Perhaps similar in a way to all the b-movies York seems to love so much.  It feels like all the very odd, surreal, quirky, sad, and happy aspects of life enhanced by the even more odd, and quirky low-budget japanese game design. And you take that, and you put Swery's special b-movie twist on everything. What comes out is a true, very long, adventure with some of the most memorable characters and stories in gaming today. If you are the kind of person that can really connect with it. I don't want to sound insulting, but I don't think most people will 'get it' without having a certain type of taste and perspective on things.

I realy enjoyed playing the game and knocking off the characters one by one in increasingly elaborate designs. The 1980's graphics/coloring also made me feel like I was watching 'The Omen' and added to the overall feel of the 1972 setting

838	1	a	The game was pretty, engaging &amp; overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, &amp; exploring is a bunch of fun.   My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.

156	1	a	As Lucius, you're tasked with systematically slaughtering a mansion full of family and staff without getting caught. That also means you cannot attack your target directly by conventional standards. Because of this limitation, Lucifer himself had endowed you with various abilities and powers to assist in your work. Naturally, the more souls sent to your father, the stronger your powers become. These powers involve telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and combustion. You'll mostly be using telekinesis throughout the game, while others are used in specific areas or chapters. The only ability I thought had any growth was telekinesis. From lifting cups for a few seconds to starting cars and killing power to the entire mansion was the only time you felt like you were getting stronger.   When it came to the murders, I was a little let down. I had expected more freedom when planning each kill. Something closer to the Hitman games than what we got. You're presented a scenario in each chapter and you have to figure out what is expected of you to meet the criteria and proceed forward. Each scenario is interesting and satisfying in their own ways and involve homicide, suicide and accidents. Yeah, it's some pretty gruesome stuff, too. One example is using water on snow to ice over and having a character slip on it, then using telekinesis on an icicle to finish the job. Almost all of the murders involve an extreme element of puzzle solving instead of force to accomplish your goal. If you're into that style of game, it's pretty damn fun. I wasn't complaining too much after I got the hang of things.  OH yeah, you have to appear as a good boy to the house hold, too. You're actually given chores like cleaning your room and brushing your teeth to complete. Upon completion, you're given good behavior points and will receive gifts that may make your work easier. And it's kinda fun. A little. Maybe. What? It works and so does this game even if it's not the game I had expected. It's pretty damn close. And I cant think of another game that's really like this. It's far from perfect and can be very frustrating, but it's a neat experience and an interesting perspective to take on. It's a slow horror game about plotting your attack, without any threat of being attacked or having to hide in a closet. It's a liberating horror game in that sense, having so much power with nobody suspecting a damn thing.  After my first playthrough with Lucius, I was reminded of games like Destroy All Humans, Stubbs the Zombie and, well â¥â¥â¥â¥, Grand Theft Auto. I wasn't reminded because of gameplay similarities, but of the theme of playing as the villain or âbad guy.â You see, there once was a time when the ability to play as the villain was kind of a hot topic among various circles within the previous decade. Ultimately, the conversation didn't go anywhere and most people seemed fine with this idea. The most controversial moment was in a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 segment that allowed you to play as a terrorist and shoot up an airport full of American civilians. That segment was so upsetting to some, it gained attention from national news networks. If that was something that got under your skin, playing as a seven year old spawn of Satan tasked with killing a bunch of people in horrific ways might have the same effect.
609	1	a	I would recommend this game,though somewhat reluctantly,because of it's very linear gameplay and 2 annoying stealth missions. Still,the premise is original,imo, it succeeds in mantaining the creepy horror atmosphere and playing a game where good guys don't have to win in the end is refreshing (Though it was amusing to watch Lucious getting successfully exorcised.'Hallelujah!') .  Worth buying , when on sale with a big discount. Oh and it probably won't take you more than 7 hours to complete it,so there's that too.

The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.

2424	1	a	There is always a director in japanese videogames: a director masterly chooses perspective in cutscenes and uniquely introduces stupendous characters, whose skeletons in the closed give you 15 hours of enhanced gameplay.   But first, make sure you caught enough breath, because authors will knock the stuffing out of you by all means and throw you in a great sea, that contains amazing stories about each inhabitant of Greenvale. This sea has hundrends of freshets, and, for example, zingy York is unquestionably perfect in all ways: in actions, gestures and facial expressions.  Every single  local freak is perfect in that ways too. Thus, youâll never want to leave these boondocks on the edge of civilization.  And the most enjoyable aspect of DP will help you capture dozens of seconds spent in that mysterious place. It is the soundtrack: atmospheric music and your guide in endless mind-voyage.

373	0	a	This game makes me sad. It's a classic story of 'so much potential.' You basically play as a little devil-spawn kid (ala 'The Omen') and run around the house plotting and executing the murders of various occupants in your house without getting caught.  The gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are. It would be a lot more fun if you could wander around exploring and gathering and then choose an execution method based on your inventory, rather than having to find the items for the single available method.  The other problem I had with this game was that it has far too many cutscenes which last for too long and happen too often. It interrupts the gameplay. At one point, you have to sneak out of your room to get some rat poison. You have to sneak around without being noticed, which is actually a good deal of fun. So I picked up the rat poison and expected to have to sneak back, but instead there was a cutscene that had me waking up the next morning. One of the best parts of the old Thief game was trying to get back out after you've accomplished your goals. No such 'extra drama' here. Just do your task and watch the next cutscene.  I was very happy I was able to give this game a try, but I can't say I recommend it. It's just too frustrating, the voice acting is poor, the characters are either unbelievably mean or oblivious, your actions are too limited, and worst of all, the story isn't compelling.
1199	0	a	I thought this would be a great game, going around using your vehicle as a weapon and killing all the zombies. However, everything in the game is against you. When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die. You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors. Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged. Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car! At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car! The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful. You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more.

946	1	a	You play as Lucius a little boy who receives orders from the Devil himself ordering you to kill various people in the mansion in where you live.  In order to do this you will have to roam the huge mansion in search of items which you can use. Figuring out which items to use on a person and how to perform the execution without being caught can be tricky and you will have to use your brain to figure out the best way.  Overall a pretty fun game grab it when it's on sale, it only takes around 9 hours to complete and the achievements are easy.

117	1	a	The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic 'Omen,' and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents. The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!

Hour 2 - I arrive at Greenland and start freezing to death. Hour 3 -  I found an abandoned mine shaft, so I climbed down but then the ladder broke. No turning back now. Hour 4 -  I found a rock, I called it Dave. Hour 5 -  Found a dog, I panicked and threw Dave. Hour 6 -  Dave shatters into pieces and makes the dog lose it's sense of balance.  rip dave

1509	1	a	This game is really scary not on the level of Amnesia, which by the way is made by the same people.Horror games i am very used to i have played many horror games and i am used to the concept but this game scared me at points especially in the beginning where you have to hide from monsters, along the lines of Amnesia u have hide in this game. The atmosphere and sound work so well together it kinda had alot of puzzles that's the only negative thing i buy a horror to get scared not to do a bunch of puzzles but still worth the buy u will get freaked i promise.

818	0	a	For the price, its not a bad game. A little clunky but you get used to it after a little bit.   Edit:  Bugged achievements have really made this game obnoxious. As an achievement hunter, this game would normally be an easy 100% completion. A lot of achievements will unlock as you play through, and also a lot will trigger without doing all the requirements. But when you play and play and play and the time achievements don't trigger(see my play time) it pisses me off to the point i'm glad I got this game for free from an auction site. Don't buy it outright. Find a special or a bundle if you feel you must play this.

I read the reviews before buying, and everyone complaining about how broken this is, and i mistakenly thought to myself that it was overblown by the community.  Lesson learnt, it is unplayable on my rig. i did every fix on the faqs, and official troubleshootting guide, compatibility mode, fan-made patch, physX.... and the game crashes as soon as it launches  at least i got it on a bundle, so not a lot is lost, but this game at 24.99e is a ripoff in it's current state, in a win10 up to date environment, as of August 2015  update: it starts in win10 with latest nvidia and physx drivers as of date of this edit still plenty of bugs, and 30 seconds black screens i understand by the amount of reviews, that it is a really good game, but the current state of this port is unbearable, so i killed the process in about 15 minutes of broken 'gameplay'

2237	1	a	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

I did still enjoy the game however, even with these flaws but would not recommend it at full price.

It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.
928	1	a	10/10 The Omen: The Video Game 
1619	1	a	Really good. This was my favorite of the first three games of the series. It has a good story, good atmosphere, some nice puzzles, had a good length and had a great ending. Definetly worth a try.
877	0	a	Got this for $2 on a Steam sale, not worth more. This is an incredibly frustrating, glitchy point-and-click I had to consult a walkthrough for on almost every level, because you are given almost no clues and controls are not straightforward (ex: really hard to lift objects with telekinesis and get them where they need to go). I frequently got clipped between front doors and cabinet doors and had to restart. Other reviews made it sound like there was more of a story; characters repeat the same line of dialogue every time you approach them each chapter, so you don't care about any of these doll-like creatures. 'Chores' are a fairly meaningless function unless they're central to the person you're supposed to kill that chapter. Since this is obviously an homage to The Omen, I was really hoping for all-out 70s references and decor, but there is none. Only thing I got a kick out of was Lucius's resemblance to Mads Mikkelsen and the soundtrack. Kept playing just to see all the ways he would kill, and because I try my darndest to complete something I've paid for, but Lucius has no replay value and little payoff the first time around.
2301	1	a	Great game, great story not so action packed gameplay but really nice overall if you like mistery. I liked it very much 
2639	0	a	Deadly Premonition is a game you need to play, For Director's Cut on PC, though, you should not pay. So says Mr. Stewart.  Deadly Premonition is one of my absolute favorite games. The Director's Cut, however, and especially the PC version are something to avoid.  Deadly Premonition was a flawed, but amazing game full of charming personality with every of it's lots of characters. What it needed is some additional polish, some rebalancing, some QTE removal. Ideally an engine port to make the world feel even more complete by removing the loading screens or at least making them less frequent. It needed something that will make the original strange beauty preserved for generations to come.  Instead it got The Director's Cut. A version that is worse in pretty much every regard. With slightly better visuals in some parts, worse in all others. With all the game breaking and lighter glitches, typos, mistranslations and other issues intact. With next to no changes to actual issues. With one non-issue made better (the controls). With pointless DLCs. With horribly voiced and animated new cutscenes that break the flow of the story, spoil things and add nothing of value. And, especially on PC, with countless crashes. Crashes that you cannot avoid no matter what you do, just make them slightly less frequent.  If you can, find the original for 360, play that instead. If you absolutely must play Director's Cut, do it on consoles. But this version? This version is the one to avoid at all cost. It will ruin the game for you. And the game is very much worth it.  P.S.

I can't even get past the first area because the game decides I want to delete my melee weapon and can't break down a fence now. This port is utter garbage and a total scam that the publishers offload unto steam. As they are publishers they do not have any QA or vetting process restrictions and can drop whatever scum they want directly unto steam and clog up the store with shovelware.   I have given this game a few tries just to get it to even run and now I can't get the control pad to actually do anything when I play. Total rip off.

809	0	a	The concept of a young devilish child reaving havoc was one that definately piqued my interest, however, sadly dissapointed with the gameplay. One of the many problems I found with this game that I don't usually have with many others is that I have to constantly refer to other sources for help. You will find yourself looking for quest items that are often way too subtley hidden in a mansion where you will pace back and forth, room to room just looking for something to get by. The problem lies in the lack of the games ability to aid the player without necessarily giving anything away (Note: You are given a tool to find items but even this is given 6 limits and can only be used in a room so it is nontheless wasteful unless you know the item could be in a specific room). Even better yet this could be solved with a non-linear format, one which provides players the ability to use multiple killing methods. This would increase replayibility and ease the painfully dullness of searching items. Some of the game mechanics lacked sense, for instance why give certain abilities only to be limited. The game sacrifices player free reign with a linear story line which isn't that great to begin with. You'd think that with multiple deaths in one home would peak the interest of the media (besides the one journalist) and feds or perhaps even motivate the family or employees to move out, but the characters all lacked sense regardless of how 'strange' or accidental the deaths are. It's no surprise that the sequel, (yes there's a sequel) didn't do well. Once the intial pique of the concept passes, theres hardly anything else that holds you there. The game needs to be rebooted, everything but the concept out the window.

2015	1	a	I do not usually play isometric RPGs, or in this case, aRPGs. I have tried to get into Diablo and Diablo 2 back when they just came out, but it was something about the game relying on loot more than storyline that gave me the wrong feeling about it.  Now, this game is similar to Diablo, I agree, but that is only at the first glance. As you look deeper, it actualy is very true to the roots of proper Medieval RPGs. The atmosphere is grimdark enough to be comparable to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout 1. The world is very hostile, and you will get your a.s.s. handed to you on hourly basis.  The art and overall design is done with great detail. The developers have lovingly and beautifully drawn every little bit of scenery, monster part and menu art so graphics-wise the game is quite pleasant despite being two dimensional.  The quests have good depth in terms of narrative and plot twists and there is no right or wrong ending for majority of your investigations (main quests are very non-linear in this aspect, it is quite similar to L.A. Noire - you never feel 100% sure about your decisions). You can easily accuse the wrong person of heresy or behave in a non-christian way and face the consequences of your actions later in the form of a reward or an enemy ambush.  All in all, I never thought that I would like this sort of old-school aRPG style of games, but this one is done so well, that its atmosphere conveys the roleplaying aspect much better than most FPS shooters with RPG elements. I'd say that you truly feel like the character you are playing.   The only real disadvantage when compared to modern RPGs that I've noticed, besides the obvious aged look, would be that the inventory system isn't designed to be user-friendly. For example, your potions take up sometimes 2/3rds of your inventory space, and that is just for a single trip to one level of the dungeon on lower player character levels. It gets better as your character gets more experienced, but the need to buy a few dozen potions just to safely roam PvE areas never really disappears.

Despite the fact that it isn't a scary game, it's atmosphere is a suprisingly unsettling one that gets more insane and intriquing the longer you play. Despite the fact that it is just a lazy PS3 port the PC version is still the best version of this game you can buy but it's recommended you use the DP fix fan patch to fully enjoy it.

2376	1	a	This is a game where the villains definitely need a hug Zach.  OK, now I've played through the whole game and it's the first game I've 100% completed. I love this game, I didn't want it to end. It's a good game and that comes despite it's inherent jankiness. Lets face it, the graphics are terrible, the combat is repetitive and boring and it crashes far too often. But those aren't what's important in this game. What's important and what makes this a good game is the story, the setting and the characters.  York is one of the most interesting game characters I've played. He's a pleasure to get to know as the game peels back layers of his personality and you come to genuinely care for him. The town, Greenvale, feels more alive than many game towns. It's full of personalities that while they may be one note quirks, are interesting and often have a reason or a story behind their quirk. I recommend you do the side quests which uncover these stories.  The game makes you care about it's characters and that makes the story have impact. I won't spoil the story because you need to play it yourself. Play this game, there is no other like it and that's the best good thing about it.

678	0	a	Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.

1511	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague, being a sequel to Penumbra: Overture, is of course a continuation of the same story with very similar gameplay. Considering how much I enjoyed Overture and that both games are on the short side (I finished this one with 6.3 hours logged in Steam), that was very much welcome. I got Overture with the first Humble Indie Bundle, and by the time I got around playing it the included offer to get the rest of Penumbra cheap had expired. Luckily it was part of the Halloween 2011 Steam sale and I finally got my hands on Black Plague and Requiem. If youÂre at all interested in horror and puzzles I highly recommend the Penumbra games!

It happened to me 4 times during playing so be aware  But the story, the way it is tolled, the idea and the idea makes those flows not really big. I have big hopes for Lucius 2 :D  Overall 8/10

1473	1	a	An incredibly solid follow-up to the first game. Puzzles are still fun, hitting the sweet spot of not being too hard or too easy, and the story and its twists are fantastic, supplemented by great characters/dialog. The combat from the first game is gone, but most of the time you're still finding creative ways to deal with the monsters, there's only maybe two or three that you just flat-out avoid. It's certainly very up there as far as Survival Horror is concerned.
1679	1	a	Deep in the uncharted planes of northern Greenland lays an abandoned mine. You start out the game as Phillip, a physicist who got a mysterious letter from his father who has been dead for 30 years. In the letter are coordinates to an abandoned mine, so you decided to go check out what your father has been trying to hide since his death. Upon arrival, you find yourself alone, scared, and   defenceless  . As you explore the mine, you decend deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Earth. Along the way, you slowly start losing grip on what is and isn't reality. I would give   Penumbra Overture   an 8/10. This game has a really great atmosphere and setting. The main down side to this game is that it can be a bit buggy from time to time, but 90% of the time it runs perfectly.

That all said, the game is amazing. The story, the characters and the dialog make the game what it is. Its a special kinda game that cant really be said why its so great, you have to play it yourself. 10/10 we need more games like this.

2926	0	a	Do NOT Buy!  I was lucky enough to get the game running but it's a disaster of a port. There isn't a resoulution option so you're stuck at the 720p console port resolution. It should run with a great framerate at least, right? Wrong. I was getting around 10 fps. When I wasn't moving the camera. When I was closer to 5 fps. I can't really review much else about the game. It's not playable like this..
995	1	a	Sooooo much better than the original. This one just feels so much more polished, and fun. There is soo much more detail now. Take my word for it, its worth 9.99 (or 4.99 if you already have the non-hd version)  I will admit, I was a little dismayed when I heard that owners of the original were not getting this HD free. However, after playing it (and getting 50% off to boot) I can see why they had to charge something, they kept what made ZD fun, and added much needed jazz to it.

1294	1	a	WIth the ending still fresh in my mind I felt like writing a review as I did with the first game. Frictional loves their psychological horror and it shows. If the first game dealt with the unknown and trying to understand what this is all about. Black Plague is about going about fixing what happened. Only nothing is what it seems and everything is out to kill you even the voices in your head. Without spoiling anything its a lot more puzzle based than I remember Amnesia being. Onward to part 3!

783	1	a	Lucius is a brilliant game, what other game allows you to play as the son of satan an offspring of evil and hate. Who doesn't want to play as a demented 6 year old child with an uncanny lust for murder.  The Constant dramatic Cinematics and Blood thirsty gory ways in which the player can kill someone just add to the puzzle solving feature to this game. Lucius gives players a Non-linear gameplay in which the player can be rewarded. Doing the chores in Lucius not only adds to the gameplay and story but also keeps this boys cover in check and rewards the player with items they can use later in the game e.g. a Trike which allows Lucius to move around freely throughout the house.  Murdering in lucius also gives the player rewards handed to you by the demonic figure of satan with help from these nasty abilities and the problem solving of the player, murdering becomes all that much sweeter.  So dive right in for the demonic and demented mind of Lucius I rate this game 8.5 DAX points out of 10

2998	0	a	I wasn't even able to play the game, the support is awfull, and the online help useless. I let the game run for 5 minutes just to warn you about this abomination. Dont buy it!!!  This is an update in my review. After some time I managed to solve the crash on start problem. The game is useful, just a pretentious game, with graphics from ps2. Is not a survival horror game in any way. You have infinities bullets, the enemies are really easy to kill, and not scary at all. The story is a little interesting but just for a couple of minutes, before it's pretentiousness kill all the mood. Above all it has a quick time event mechanics in the encounters with the main monster.  Do not buy it!!

The worse part of the game is the weird background music that destroys the immersion of the game. Just imagine that a happy and joyful music that makes you feels like you're playing arcade games with the scary moments in the game, which makes the scares of the game feels nothing.  The game suffers from poor optimization with makes the game running at 40+fps with i7 processor, GTX 960M mobile Nvidia GPU with 12GB of RAM. Sometimes it even drop to 20 fps.    I didn't even know who's Zach is. The male protagonist in this game makes me feel that he's some kind psychopath

329	1	a	If you're a fan of old school horror movies, like The Omen, then you'll enjoy this.
2516	1	a	I mean, to say this is basically  Twin Peaks: The Video Game  would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like  Twin Peaks , the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about  Deadly Premonition  is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.   Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should. The gameplay works sort of like  L.A. Noire . The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The 'game' operates much more like an interactive film or television show ('Previously in the investigation' or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)  I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale.  Deadly Premonition  is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.

This is the definition of a niche title, and this has a great story and a enjoyable experience overall and I highly reccomend it.

1854	1	a	Penumbra Overture is a pretty darned cool game. Frictional games, creators of the critically acclaimed Amnesia: The Dark Descent made this Penumbra a few years before ATDD, and it doesn't disappoint!  Scary atmosphere, and compelling scriptwriting make it a joy to play. The plot isn't particularly believable, but which horror game plot is nowadays. The controls feel a little clunky at times, and the combat system (which was thankfully done away with in Penumbra: Black Plague) is entirely optional, meaning you can attempt stealth playthroughs of the game.  Grab the collection if its on sale, its worth the price!   8/10!

2014	1	a	Wow, I just finished this game after almost 200 hours of gameplay, (197 to be exact). The game does not necessarily take that long to complete but I really enjoyed it and wanted to explore every dungeon, kill every enemy, read every detail of the story and lore of the world, and complete every side quest. Honestly, it could probably be completed in 140 to 150 hours. This very involved, isometric, action RPG offers a lot for your money and has a very engaging story. It takes place in a fictitious continent strongly modeled after medieval Europe, with a theological system loosely based on Roman Catholicism. The name of Jesus is changed to âThe First Prophet,â but there are crosses and crucifixes decorated throughout the game.   Without giving away any of the story, you are a paladin, priest, or thief, (your choice) who is asked by emissaries of the Holy Mother Church to investigate a gruesome murder in the northern territory of Hillbrant. From that starting point, you are drawn deeper into a dark, heretical plot that goes all the way to the capital itself. An evil centuries old plot is underway that involves black masses and demon resurrections. Heretics are planning to summon Satanâs four chief demons into the world who in turn plan to reek chaos as well as having other intentions that I wonât give away. The story, while quite graphic at times, dealing with such issues as â¥â¥â¥â¥, necrophilia, Satan worship, torture, ect., is incredibly engaging and gradually unfolds and reveals itself to the player over the course of three acts, spanning three areas of the continent. Each of the three acts is nicely balanced between combat and story.   In the story part of the game, you act as an inquisitor for the Holy Mother Church and you need to talk to everyone in order to gather clues so you can determine who the heretics are. Once you gather enough evidence, you can extract confession by means of torture and then burn them at the stake. The combat system is, in my opinion, the weakest part of this game. It is quite clunky and initially, (until your character builds some dexterity) will result in the majority of your strikes missing. It takes getting used to as it is not as fluid as other action RPGs. But once you get the hang of it and you build your character, it is just fine. Fortunately, one thing you will not have to do in this game is grind for experience points and gold to build your character. Each of the three acts is divided into various areas that you must explore and clear of enemies. Once the enemies are cleared, you do not have to wait for them to respawn and repeat killing the same enemies over and over again for experience, (only a very small percentage of enemies respawn anyway). Clearing each area once will provide more than enough experience to build your character sufficiently to progress through the game. But keep in mind, this game is HARD. The battles are not easy at all, especially the ghosts and specters that are introduced to you in act II, (which require magic to beat â since I was a paladin and weak at magic, I had to use flame sword and seals) and the werewolves introduced in act III. You will find that fighting monsters in groups is a bad idea and most of the time you will have to resort to hit and run tactics where you slowly walk up to a group of enemies, lure one or two away from the group at a time, and kill them individually. If you are anything like me, you will be using that tactics for most of the game. Also, even though this world is strongly modeled after medieval Europe, they also mix traditional rpg monsters and mythology in the mix such as orcs, trolls, ect., explaining them as hellspawns, remnants of a dark and foreboding pagan world long since conquered by the true faith, or monsters summoned in black masses, ect. Of course, there are also plenty of demons from Judeo-Christian and gnostic literature as well. It makes for an interesting mix.   I found the magic system in the game to be impressive, not so much because it was terribly complex, but for the fact that a world modeled after medieval Europe, where magic would be considered heretical, would have a magic system at all. On top of that, there are in fact SEVEN schools of magic in the game, each one consisting of spells that are each given their own history and background, (as are all the items in the game!) If you choose to play the game by the rules as I did and be obedient to the Holy Mother Church, then there are four approved and sanctioned schools of magic that could better be described as feats of faith and divine intervention. There is magic of faith, magic of miracles, divine magic, and inquisitional magic. If however you choose to dabble in heresy, (at risk to your own soul), then you can also learn pagan, heretical, or the ever dreaded Luciferian magic. Playing as a paladin, I didnât get to use too much of the later levels of magic, but what I used was quite effective in the gameplay.  So my assessment of this game is that it was very engaging, very involving, very well written with a fantastic story, and quite lengthy. Be prepared to invest some time into it. The mechanics of the game were quite rough around the edges and takes some getting used to. You will get stuck often, and when you do, the GOG and Steam forums will prove to be a God send. One thing that this game requires a lot of, (throughout the entire game but especially around the beginning) is that you carry LOTS AND LOTS of health, stamina, and (if youâre a priest) mana potions with you at all times. You will find that dungeon exploring consists of you getting as far into the dungeon as you can until you run out of potions, (which you will burn through quite quickly), making your way back to the surface, buying more potions, and progressing further into the dungeon. Get use to that cycle. Also, there are a few bugs in the game that have yet to be polished out, all of which you can find solutions for on the GOG and Steam forums. One bug in particular that effected some players, (including myself) involved a crucial NPC named Tinthan who is necessary to complete the main quest, not always showing up where he should be in act II, thus not allowing you to progress in the game. If that happens to you, itâs an easy fix that can be resolved by typing the following console command:  - Press ~ (next to 1) - Type \addbeing_afriend Tinthan -1 -1 - Press âenterâ - You can also find the solution here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/inquisitor/where_is_thintan/?search=Tinthan   This game has tons of atmosphere, lots of charm, and gives you many unique options and story driven tasks. Its soundtrack adds to the atmosphere very well and comes with the game. It sets the mood well and I even put it on my iPod. Throughout the course of the game, you will fight for or against Satan, defeat corrupt priests who sold their souls, perform exorcisms, summon the dead, summon genies, (save them for bosses â trust me), torture heretics, explore a continent, read a novel, and of course, (my personal favorite) rescue damsels. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and have fun.

549	0	a	Lucius is a fantastic concept but it does fall short of the promise of it's early trailers. Playing any game as the antagonist, let alone the antichrist, is a tough balance to pull off as we need to be drawn into the character despite their actions. Unfortunately the gameplay is so linear with no real choice over who dies/how we are entirely alienated from the main character and their motivations. They are a silent cipher unquestioningly carrying out commands. Whilst this is not dissimilar to many point and clicks, guybrush threepwood had a personality that carried you through.  There are other good factors about lucius such as clear intentioned level design and a dark humour that has great potential. These are not on their own redemptive enough and I would reccomend that you buy this game only in a sale or otherwise skip on to lucius 2.

1571	1	a	A fantastic game, it takes a step up from Overture by introducing two new characters and seamlessly contuining the story. Not only did it become an atmospheric horror game by taking away all weapons, leaving you completely vulnerable to the enviroment and your enemies, but introduced such a level of character depth that I began to feel and sympathize for the characters, becoming even more immersed into the game.  An absolutely amazing playthrough, I cannot wait to begin the last installment, Requiem, and to see what unfolds and happens to Philip as his story comes to an end.
2669	0	a	Let me start off by saying I adore Deadly Premonition. After purchasing it on xbox360 at launch I was super excited to play the game again with this Director's Cut. The story is still great, the characters still quirky and awesome, the combat still forced and terrible.  However. After playing for an hour I ran into a bug that forced the game to crash again and again and again. Community fixes didn't work, I'm completely stuck, and from what I can tell on the forums I am not the only one. It's bad enough that the community had to fix the screen resolution because the game doesn't even give you options to adjust those yourself. But game breaking bugs that still haven't been fixed close to a year later? Ridiculous.   TLDR: Game is great on consoles one of my favorite of all time, get it there. Pc version is a buggy mess that probably won't work for you or at the very least gives you headaches trying to fix it so it's barely playable.  Update late 2016. After installing the game again on a new pc I finally got past the part it crashed at on my other system... only for it to crash righ after at the next cutscene. As much as I love the game...there is just no excuse for the way they have handled this release.

561	1	a	Best game ever 10/10.  And this was the most usefull review in the history of reviews.
1979	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a solid survival horror from Frictional Games. Everyone knows frictional games from the massively successful and terrifying Amnesia: The dark desecent. While I have played some Amnesia I personally really enjoyed Penumbra. While the graphics are dated, and Amnesia is overall a better experience, Penumbra delivers scares and is a really good starting point for the studio. It's cheap and short, and it is 100&amp; worth it, even if you are going back to it. It's a great game.
540	1	a	Lucius is a guilty pleasure. Thereâs just something perversely satisfying about planning and committing murders under the guise of an innocent child for the sake of malice. The story is a bit predictable and sometimes implausible, even in a supernatural context, but its shortcomings pale in comparison to the thrill of getting away unpunished with serial killing and the supernatural powers acquired throughout are a lot of fun. Itâs so good to be bad.

2251	1	a	I played through this game on the Xbox 360 years ago, the play time listed for this version doesn't reflect that. Bought this a second time on sale because it's good and I like the developers.  When Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls. Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.  For everything this game seems to get passable or 'middling', there's something that makes you smile. Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it. You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.  Fans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players. I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks. There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series. The protagonist loves his coffee. The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.   This was one of my favorite games of 2010. If it's on sale I strongly recommend giving it a try.

1467	1	a	I've already played through this game twice before.  It's very spooky. I would say it's even better than Amnesia, being the high point of Frictional's horror games.
2025	1	a	This game supposedly took 10 years to make and it shows, firstly by how dated the graphics are. If you can't stand older graphics then stop right here and find another game. Another way it shows the 10 years, though, is by how much sheer content the game has in it. The dialogue in this game is almost exhaustive. So much to learn from almost every NPC in every town, all of it well written I should add. The combat is what you're expecting, simple, not too complicated. The music is great and thematic whilst the sound effects are mostly okay but can be offputting (women moan when you speak to them.) Overall I recommend this game to people who enjoy reading and being immersed in a game's world. This truly feels like a living world and if you decide to embark on this journey, make sure you have a lot of time on your hands and a willingness to take things slow.  TL;DR Version:  Graphics - 3/10  Gameplay - 8/10  Audio - 4/10  Replayability - 7/10  Story - 10/10  Polish - 9/10  Overall - 7/10
1382	1	a	This game continues where overture leaves off. You continue the search for your father while completing puzzles and problems. The only difference now is being stripped of all weapons you must run instead of fight.
1225	0	a	I take back what I said, this 'HD' upgrade isn't so great, a lot of the new content is just filler and the voice acting is so bad that it's awful, good thing it was cheap.

898	1	a	Before you buy the game, please not that it is VERY HARD. There are many components you have to think of before killing each person. Unless you look up a walkthrough/playthrough/guide, it is going to be difficult.  That being said, this game is also good, and it feels like you've actually accomplished something once you've completed on of the components. So, here is a crisp list of pros and cons to help you decide if you want to buy the game or something.  Pro: Gameplay It's very important that your gameplay is a pro, that is a MUST with the community, And luckily for Lucius, it actually has unique gameplay that is quite good at the same time. You really have to think and explore, which not a lot of video games take the time to do these days.  Pro: Amount of Content There are around 16 puzzling levels that feel like a game in themselves. And if you're a completionist like me, there are many achievements for you to collect. All of which aren't to difficult but aren't easy either.  Con: Unpolished The game feels like it's in beta, with the slighlty (quite slightly) long load times and the unsynced voices. It just feels slightly unpolished and could use that extra push to get it to the finish. I also ran into some door glitches on my joutney through the game.  Con: Tutorials The game doesn't do the best job of explaing things. Pure and simple.  Pro: Story Good enough story to make you acrually want to kill people. You don't really care about the people that you're killing, Which in a sense is actually GOOD. Becasue it makes you feel like a cold hearted killer.  Overall: Lucius is worth the full price. There are better games around it's price, but Lucius feels good enough to be worth the price. I got it for 1,45 when it was on sale, and it was extremely worth it.  Also Tom's â¥â¥â¥ is 10/10.
1730	0	a	This is the first of the Penumbra Series.  I was an avid fan of Amnesia: the Dark Descent, and wanted to try another Frictional Games piece.  This game is somewhat disappointing.   Without giving away too much of the story: - There is only one or two types of enemies during the entirety of the game, making their patterns highly predictable and once you find a way to exploit their terrible AI, they fail to present any challenges.  - The story is written as if an edgy teen indie team created it. The story must be intentionally vague, as (SPOILERS) the ending literally finishes with 'to be continued.' As a player, you never actually know what's going on. Sure, you know where you are and that you want to escape and how you got to where you are: the basics. The more you play, however, the more unanswered questions you end up with. - I want to give this piece the benefit of the doubt and consider the entire series in my review; perhaps the second and third games answer all of these questions and creates a fantastically crafted story. Unfortunately, the first game alone does not produce that faith in me.  Although the game is an older 'classic,' the story and mechanics are ridiculously simple, repetitive, and ultimately boring. Perhaps after the other games, I will feel better about the series, but this game is not worth playing alone.  --EDIT--  The remainder of this review is after I have completed the second game - Black Plague I will reserve my criticism for that specific review, but because the sequel answers many questions and is a good game, Overture is a necessary evil for the means of continuity in the series. Long story short, Black Plague is far better than this game, but you should play this too for the best effect.
1759	0	a	Primitive world interaction, clunky combat and an empty, mazelike level design make this a hard game to recommend. There's still an interesting sense of horror here, and it's great to see the Amnesia developers in their formative years, but there's not much value outside of that.

2212	1	a	Twin peaks simulator 2013  If you want to bash Deadly Premonition, just go ahead. There's plenty of stuff here to strike down on. Poor graphics, the ocasionally terrible gamedesign, wonky animations, weird soundmixing, awkward gameplay, the map, bugs and the list goes on. But you would miss out on a truly unique and great experience. DP is the best FBI-sim/Twin peaks ripoff that money can buy. The story is the games strongest point, a weird journey that's totally unpredictable and fascinating. The games protagonist is Francis york morgan, a schizophrenic fbi-agent sent to investigate a murder in the small town of Greenvale. He is by far one of the coolest characters i've ever played, and the story and game largely rests on his twisted persona. The relationship with his other personality, Zach, is interesting and in the end truly touching. One of my favourite things about the game is the contrast between the wierdness, surreal parts and the ordinary mundane small town life. You can just cruise around, doing sidemissions and talking to the people of greenvale. also you can eat lunch, every game should give you the option of having lunch with some of the games characters. The day/night cycle is pretty slow, so you have plenty of time to hang around. The dpfix mod fixes some of the worst graphics and will enhance the experience alot. With that installed, just enjoy this game. It's sometimes terrible, other times beautiful, but always worth your while. For fans of Twin peaks and X-files, this is essential. Don't you agree Zach?
2890	0	a	This game actually looked a lot better before I played it. The game has a fairly 'fear-like' storyline. The storyline is somewhat nice and fits it's theme, but the game itself is boring. The combat of the game is very complicated having to hold around 3 on your keyboard just to aim down when shooting. The game itself is fairly weak and could be improved greatly.

This is not, the developers really should be ashamed. corners were cut in development, graphically and mechanically. and it gave an underwelming performance that left me chasing bats in a tutorial phase. the story might be good, the mystery and world maybe fleshed out, but whats the point if the main character and combat mechanics are this bad?

2721	0	a	This port is absolutely miserable, and frankly I could have lived without ever getting to experience Deadly Premonition if it also meant never having to experience a port this bad.  I don't think whatever good there is to the game, and there's a lot to recommend, is worth tearing your hair out getting it to work. Even after getting it to run at its best, I experienced myriad problems. One in particular is that, without wishing to spoil, there are moments when the game will pull a sort of picture-in-picture thing where you're seeing the main game camera, and a second camera from another character, and for whatever reason my computer found this the most difficult to manage, and I have a pretty decent rig. I do not have any explanation for why this is so. Garry's Mod has no issues with a similar set-up. Split-screen multiplayer games in general on my PC manage this with no problems. Why, then, does this game have an issue with it? It's a pretty important effect as far as the gameplay goes, why would they code it so poorly?  Rising Star ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to make it to retail, and they should be even more ashamed that they have still yet to make any effort to fix it. Absolutely shameful.

1966	1	a	After completeing this title a little over 5 months ago (After putting it off for a long time) --- I can quite honestly say: if you haven't played it, please do... Being the same developer, it is the direct spiritual predeccesor of Amnesia and, quite frankly, brought Amnesia to it's success. Without the technology developed from this small series, we wouldn't be experiencing the horrifying, dark, immersive 3D experience that we know today. This game never got that much credit, where much credit is due. I would LOVE to live to the day where survival horror saw more games akin to this. If you REALLY want the pants scared off of you - I'd highly recommend it's successor - Black Plague. 10$, you can't beat that price for such a beautifully crafted masterpiece.
1096	1	a	Is this a good game? Well, you get to run over zombies... which is delicious.  What I am disappointed with though is the people behind this. Instead of just updating Zombie Driver, they went and re-branded the game as HD, updated and improved upon the game with some new content, and sold it for another $10-15.  So while I consider that a crummy move, the game is still good.

2937	0	a	As much as I want to recommend this game, I really don't think it's worth buying.  Many other reviewers give this a thumbs up because of the game itself, which is indeed fun and unique. But this port is so awful it's definatly not worth the money. It's crashing more consistently than any other game I've played. Playing it is an excercise in stubborness, and every time you do ANYTHING your first thought is run to a save point before it crashes and I have to repeat that again.  It doesn't matter how good the game is if it's unplayble. Do not buy this unless the devs fix this terrible PC port. If it gets patched then definatly get it. Not before.
3047	0	a	Game itself is great, this port is horrible. Those interested should play the original version on the Xbox 360 - it has better, warmer colours and more fitting textures. Directors cut version also adds few things to the game that make it worse than the original.   This PC port (- even with the DPfix) is filled with crashes, strange framerate issues and other technical woes. Beating the final boss is almost impossible due to the aiming bug that persists trough out the whole game (some might have luck with messing win98 compatibility modes or alt-tabing â I didnât).  That said, I enjoyed it but find really hard to recommend this version of the game to any one.
295	0	a	There will be some spoilers in this review. Read at your own risk.  Lucius is a murder centric puzzle game where you play as the titular Lucius Wagner, a child of Lucifer. The premise of the game is rather interesting. Lucifer visits Lucius in a dream and bestows him the unholy mission of garnering the souls of people around Dante Manor. This is done through rather unintuitive and lacking puzzles.   The story takes place in the painfully large Dante Manor. From nearly the very beginning of the game, most of all of the manor is open to you. With the mechanics that exist in the game, this is NOT a good thing. It does not reward exploration (save for the aptly named 'Explorer' achievement). Furthermore, the puzzle solutions are extremely unintuitive and, quite frankly, boring. At several points, there shows potential for many possible ways to kill the chapter's target, but as the game requires deaths to be the ones laid out for you, it does not help at all (for example, one kill requires you to set someone on fire, but simply setting them on fire does not work. You have to douse him in gasoline and then setting him on fire will allow the kill.). More than that, the way some of these events transpire, it will severely test your suspension of disbelief (if you were to light a ciagrette at a stove, would YOU stick your face into the stove fire?) and the game simply can't be taken seriously.   Even worse still, this game at one (potentially two) point(s) tries to hopscotch between puzzle and action game. The controls and camera for this game are already pretty clunky as is and making it into a third person action game with a terrible camera does not help the game's case in the slightest. Lucius also suffers from having quite a few bugs (several things can go wrong during some chapters and will force you to restart the chapter) and collision issues (getting caught on nothing comes to mind).  Other bugs that come to mind are broken achievements. Some achievements do not work at times and can cause potential frustration.  All in all, this game is NOT worth your time or money. I got it on sale for 75% off ($4.99 instead of $19.99) and I still feel like I got ripped off.

1938	1	a	I came to this game way after both Amnesia so I had a little idea of what to expect even if it wouldn't be as polished as the later game.  I wouldn't say the atmosphere is all that scary compared to Amnesia, but the sense of exploration and piecing the story together yourself is much the same. The certainly isn't a game you just blaze through. If you don't spend the time reading the notes and such left around and immersing yourself in the lore you'll find the game a bit empty.  The good: intriguing early story; some smart puzzles; manual interaction with doors et al for good sense of immersion.  The bad: a bit 'was that it?' at the end (though obviously this is only the setup to the rest of the series); lack of variety in enemies; controlling the tools/weapons can be a bit obtuse.

1446	1	a	Perhaps the most frightening game I have ever played. Though there is nothing particularly original in the design, it is executed extremely well. The game maintains a constant feeling of helplessness and extreme paranoia interspersed with moments of well-executed levity.  The engine is rough around the edges (though it is less apparent here than in Penumra's previous episode, in which the combat was poorly executed), I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to cower in a corner saying, 'Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!' and then have a sleepless night.  In fact, I'm writing this review because I can't play the game anymore because it's 9 pm and I know if I play a second longer I won't get a wink (of sleep or otherwise).  You may want to play Penumbra: Overture before playing this game, as the plot continues from where the previous episode left off, but it is not necessary: the game can stand on its own. And Penumbra: Overture isn't nearly as well-made.
1326	1	a	I'm really liking this so far! Making my way through this mysterious place by solving a series of puzzels, and being hunted down by some 'thing'. It's great! And there needs to be more games like this, but in coop mode! Ahhhh that would be awesome! Anyway! This game is a thumbs up from me!
551	0	a	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.   Game does not provide any hints of how to kill your victims. A lot of it seems poorly written, especially the reasons as to why Lucius is murdering some of them.   This game was boring, there is not a lot to it thart makes the gameplay fun. The 'boss fights' are the most type of oss fights I have ever played on a game. I managed to complete the game hoping for a good ending but it was cheesy and lacked any real depth. This game had huge potenial but it wasn't delivered wel at all.   I wouldn't recommend buying this game.

836	0	a	Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.

2735	0	a	I wanted to say something good about this game but I can't. This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually 'works' there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is 'improved' version.  Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this... Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw. Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)! My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best. This game is just bad at everything. Good thing I bought it for 2,5â¬ when it was on sale!
2802	0	a	This thing barely works.  And even if you manage to get it not crash at the start up, have fun watching it crash throughout the game too.

1968	1	a	With poor visual appeal, the whole game just screams 'LOW PRODUCTION VALUES' when compared to contemporary titles.  However, far from it for Penumbra to succumb to low-production values on every front, the voice acting of the characters is phenomenal. Coupled with the game's inherently interesting plot (for those who simply can't walk away from a narrative like this) Penumbra boasts a wonderfully well-written and well-made storyline.  It brings complex puzzle-solving gameplay with a pall of eeriness cast upon the game that leaves you wanting to take a few steps back every time you make one step forward.  In addition to this, right from the beginning, for those interested at all in analytics, the game harps, rather subtly, on human nature. Howard, Philip, Red, all well-animated characters (figuratively speaking... of course) provide the game with a less-than-subtle hint of humanity.  All in all one of the most well intriguing and captivating games I've played in quite some time.

2581	1	a	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around. (The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)  - Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic.   - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.

2248	1	a	7/10 - This game - much like our main protagonist - is split into two halves.   On one side, it's a mechanical mess. Dialogue sometimes cuts off near the end of a sentence, music suddenly stopping while driving around, awful car controls, from the game randomly crashing, the impractical purchasing system which makes you buy one SINGLE item over and over instead of in bulk, its lengthy driving around town sequences (although teleportation makes this bearable later in the game), right down to some of its spoilerific achievements (seriously don't read them).  But on the other hand you've got a weird and wonderful world with a host of fascinating quirky and cooky characters you'll be talking to, in order to unravel a mysterious murder that has happened in this quaint little town as FBI detective Agent Francis York Morgan, who in and of himself is a very unusual man. In this, you will uncover an intriguing storyline of who-done-it that never gets stale or boring and makes the game very compelling. There's also a host of extra things to be done in Greenvale, with its numberous side quests, fishing and racing.  It is because of its story and characters that this game belongs in the upper echelons of 'Weirdest game I've ever played', ranking up there with the likes of Gregory Horror Show.   If you can get past its technical faults, its definately one to experience. 'Isn't that right, Zach?'

760	1	a	Ok, so people that know me know I enjoy horror films, this was an...Intriguing concept to say the least, when it succeeds, it shines, when it fails...It crashes into a fiery wreck on the I-90. I'm going to continue to play it because it caters to my particular tastes but...Its not for everyone. It has a beautifully done open world, really crummy voice acting, an actually intriguing storyline, and for those that put up with its quirks they will find a satisfactory gaming experience which falls just short of how good it could have been
1818	1	a	An immersive and satisfying horror experience. If you like the core gameplay mechanics of Amnesia then this will be a treat. This first chapter of the Penumbra Trilogy blends a comptent and well put-together narrative with expertly crafted puzzles, and will scare the pants off you.           (Until you find out you can kill the monsters, that is.)
2006	1	a	Inquisitor looks old, plays like and a 90's RPG and will be spewing very long blocks of text at your face. If that doesn't turn your off, keep reading because there's much more to it than that.  You can kind of guess this game is going to take some time to finish from the get go and that impression would be right, I'm only around 20 hours in and there's a lot to do and a lot to see. In the first act, you're helping the local branch of the church to solve several cold cases of mysterious murders and unexplained disappearances, tracking down heretics and allies of the devil. The game takes the form of a really old school isometric RPG, not too dissimilar from Arcanum. You will be wandering into an original world mixing a middle-age central europe setting with medieval-fantastic aspects. Think 'The Name of the Rose' meets 'Lord of the Rings'.  The game will have you speaking to a lot of people to fill your journal with information and clues and to collect evidence, picking and using skill from your character sheet, selecting and equipping spells and managing your inventory. While the mouse driven interface can get a little bit confusing, hiding some vital parts of your character sheet under what looks like very small tabs on a 1080p monitor, you can use (and definitely should learn) the keyboard bindings for most actions.  The variety of items you will come across is just mind numing. From potions and spell scrolls, to weapons and armors, all items have different levels of quality, need to be repaired and maintained in working order, and combined to ensure your survival against the spawn of the devil and the creatures of the wilderness.  The combat, while on par with the 90's tech powering the engine, is nothing really exciting and can get quite frustrating if you're trying to use skills and spells on top of your trusty sword. The special effects (confusion, blindness...) while incredibly creative, can be very off-putting to say the least.  What really sets this title apart from the modern games that pretend to be RPG's today is the writing. Sure there's a lot of it but it's both well written (or should I say translated) but is also engaging an immersive. It's likely that you will want to know more about the world... and the NPC's will be more than happy to tell you all you may want to learn. I found the conversations with certain characters to be a reward in and of itself.  The music is nothing short of amazing, taking a really classical route with an early baroque feel, far removed from the generic post romantic and modern orchestral music. A choice fitting the universe in many ways.  It should be said that Inquisitor also does a better job at analysing the psyche of its character and reflecting some of the dark parts of the human condition much better than any other hipsterish indie non-game. Most of that exploration flows organically with the gameplay, the setting and the artistic direction of the game. Just for that I think anyone with a passing interest in character development in games should at least take a look at the first act of this game, just to see how to do it right.  I love this game and I would recommend it to anyone loving old-school RPG's, however, remember the introduction of this review, it might not be your thing and that's totally understandable.

1218	0	a	the game is ok, can be boring, can also be fun. if you like cars and killing zombies can get some power up - But very repetive, you have to do some quests or side quests to move on.  If u are into cars and into racing things, this might be for you, you will also kill some zombies in the progress but don't really expect too much fun from the game though.  i give this 6/10
2007	1	a	  âThe most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.â    Inquisitor is a classic role-playing game experience that stands out from the usual RPG genre, because it does not hold your hand in any way. The storyline and most quests in this game provide only a few clues how to solve them. It will be up to you to collect all the information from the locals and connect the dots, until you have a clear picture of the situation.  The characters you meet alongside your journey will test your integrity, righteousness and moral standards. And on several occasions you will find yourself in the position, in your role as an Inquisitor, where you have to decide between the right way and the just way.  The strong role-playing aspects of each of the three classes in combination with the religious &amp; mystical elements create an authentic medieval atmosphere, including fantasy creatures in form of demons and other hellspawns. What this game lacks in graphics it gains twofold in detailed descriptions of events and NPCs throughout the game.  While it provides the classic hack &amp; slash features, the combat is pretty simple and straight forward with little tactical depth. No voice acting, an inferior inventory system (e.g. no potion stacking) and the partially unbalanced combat mechanics should be mentioned as further disadvantages of this classic RPG.  Overall, if you are willing to get over the initial hurdles of an antiquated graphical presentation and some inconsistencies during combat, there is a very deep and enjoyable game with a wealth of content available for you. And there is something rather refreshing about being an Inquisitor that is not the good Samaritan.    Amusing quotes:    âThe worst monsters of all are the people, Father. Of course you could admit that orcs and other hellspawns are Satanâs brats longing to dip their fangs and claws into human flesh, but believe me, people are much more dangerous. The people who cast away faith and are worshipping idols, mammon, fornication and bloodshed. When you meet an orc you know your lifeâs in danger. But when you meet a man, you canât be sure although heâs smiling today, he wonât cold heartedly murder your own daughter tomorrow. Believe me, Father, beware of people!â    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.    Chronology:    Inquisitor (PC) Role-playing game + hack &amp; slash  (Dark Fantasy) â 2009

2541	1	a	Easily worth the 2,50 when it's on sale.
1543	1	a	Try it out. It's pretty good. They don't hesitate to throw you into a bad situation in the first half hour
897	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. The game itself looks great and I love the story. One of the best games I've gotten from the Steam sales. I would recommend it to other people.
2397	1	a	  This game is more campy then scary. For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.    This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.  A few hardware issues: #Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 &amp; 7.1 surround is a no-no) #Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all. This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.) #Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)  All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky. The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.  If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing. There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.
485	0	a	No fun allowed on this one  The game lacks everything it has promissed  Too much linear and too much hints, you don't feel freedom in this game at all
1721	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a first-person game about Phillip (the player) who ventures into an abandoned mine in search of his father. The game takes a dark turn when Phillip is trapped and forced to survive the horror of the mines while looking for clues.  Overture is only slightly scary in my opinion, but that's just fine. It's more about survival, and is incredibly realistic. What it lacks in scariness, it makes up for in realism.  For example, the main enemy is packs of demonic dogs that stalk the player. You can fight them, but it's hard. You aren't a superhero, and you can't just click to swing your instrument of destruction over and over. You have to time attacks carefully, and swish the mouse in the direction you want your weapon to swing.   Another example is the physics engine. Like Amnesia, you can pick up/throw/push almost anything by cicking on it and dragging the mouse in the corresponding directon. You feel like you're really there, like your character has wieght and realness. This makes the game totally immersive, and really heightens the 'survival' aspect.  You'll have to solve puzzles and escape monsters all the way through while feeling helpless and alone--so it perfectly captures what the survival horror genre is about.   The mad rantings of your only friend, Red, wrap it all up. Red is wonderfully voice acted and his insanity is creepy, eerily setting the mood.   If you want a dark, macabre, realistic, true survival horror game that doesn't pull punches or hold your hand, Penumbra: Overture is it. 10/10.

2207	1	a	Deadly Premonition What can I say?  The graphics are awful, the voice acting is bad, the controls are clunky, and the gameplay is iffy. There's really no real reason to buy this game from a technical standpoint.  But that's the beauty of it.  Ignore everything I just said. Ignore all of it.  Buy this game.  These guys deserve all of the awards for this game. Because even though it's a terrible, TERRIBLE game, it's a masterpiece.  Don't miss out on this game. Trust me, it's a once in a lifetime experience that you will NEVER forget. The story is worth it.  Do it.
1897	1	a	Penumbra Overture is a chilling first person horror adventure that utilizes creepy lighting, music, and sounds to keep the hair on the back of your neck standing. The story isn't grade A quality, but the presentation is where it shines--revealing pieces slowly while purposely withholding information. The game isn't continuously scary, although it does offer several moments of adrenaline pumped fear as you push forward into the unknown. It offers some decent puzzles, good physical interaction, and fabulous choreography of events with sounds. Keep the lights off, the sound cranked up, and immerse yourself into its eerie atmosphere. For the best experience, combat should be avoided.
1566	1	a	This game and its two sequels are the most frightening games I've ever played that are not Eversion. Heavily inspired by Lovecraft.
166	0	a	Frame drops and crashes almost all the time, I do not recommend unless you'd like a game full of lags and unpatched bugs.

3041	0	a	Fromw hat little I played, I loved this game. The charecters and the story are promising and reminiscent to the likes of twin peaks, the gameplay, while clunky seems to work within this context, the graphics and sound are not great but again, they seem to blend well with this game.  My issue witht he game however is that, as much as I want to enjoy and complete this game, the constant game crashes, bugs, freezes and sound glitches have tested and brought my willpower to the brink. I am sad to say that I have finally given in, I haven't even finished chapter 1 yet just because of how unbearable it has become. I've tried the durante patch, I have changed my sound from 5.1 to stereo to fix sound issues yet the random crashes still occur, at times making me lose quiet a bit of progression.   In short, I really love and do wanted to complete this game, but the constant crashes have prevented me from doing so.

3021	0	a	This is a fun, quirky, game that unfortunately got a miserable PC port. When I start it up, I'm greeted by a black screen - I can hear the intro playing but I can't see anything. Through trial and error, I discovered that it was due to having my gamepad connected. Unplugging my gamepad allows me to play the game but I'm stuck with keyboard controls in a game that was clearly designed for controllers.  You have to download a fan-made patch to raise the resolution beyond 720p and there's just a whole host of other technical problems. Play this one on a console if you can.
2587	1	a	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.

1906	1	a	It reminds me of the game Chronicles of riddick but with less shine and action, being both very nice looking games. It is more suspense than terror than Amnesia. Is short, around 4 hours but it is an episode, and the expansion incorporates elements of FEAR. Nice use of 'natural' mechanics to move objects, open doors, etc. And the riddles are nice but not too difficult. 3.8/4
2275	1	a	Heyyo, 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P  I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, 'But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.' Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.  The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think thatâs the biggest strength in this game. Itâs interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.  The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, itâs quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and donât flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5. The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as youâd expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.  Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1âs and those budget games youâd find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.  So yeahâ¦ vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I donât know the development cycle and I donât know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didnât focus inâ¦ but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you donât saveâ¦ so itâs up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).  There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods   Hope this helpsâ¦ so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)

221	1	a	An OK game. The gameplay is steady and fun. The achievements are quite easy to achieve (minus the 20 and 40 hour ones).  Unfortunately, replayability is not this game's strong suit. Once you have played it once (you can get all achievments on a single playthrough) there isn't any benefit to playing it again, since you know how to kill each and every one of them. The mansion's floorplan could have been better. It is very awkward to move around in and it is difficult to learn. Even after completing the entire game, I still don't have a good idea of what's where in the mansion.  7/10

413	1	a	this game is a yes but lemme tell you something ,  good: the graphics are good , 60 fps lock on vsync , mind games , easy achievements , chores and gifts ,  bad : after the last update (or so i noticed) : alot of bugs , if i ride the tricycle into the wall in the alastair stairs/backroom , it noclipped and i got out to the street , picked ivor's bottle on chapter 4 first time and i gave it to tom , now i restarted couldn't get it , i can take the one in the closet only , after killing alastair on christmas , he lived on tom's chapter , dunno how but he was standing there , driver smoke chapter the rug i am supposed to make him sniff didn't fall with him , stayed floating . i killed lucius' mom on chapter 6 by fault and no one noticed , you don't need to go put the plug to load the nailgun with air , when i killed susan she jumped from the bathroom and then everyone was flying including me and the house was underneath us , i have much more of these glitches screenshotted in my profile ..  flashlight lucifer's head and see what happens ,   all in all , 8/10 one of the best mind devilish games i have played    EDIT: would recommend this game when it's on sale ! not worth over 15 if you like playing long story driven games , the story is short but awesome gameplay

But, since the game is old, I find the controlring system kinda annoying and buggy sometimes... Still recommending this game for people who want to record for youtube or play with friends!
2199	1	a	This game from what I have played so far, is really really good. The story and investigation is interesting and really makes you want to think about what could be right. The port of this is as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but DPFix tool can easily fix a lot of problems and restarting your computer once you have installed it fixes even more. Crashes are pretty rare, but they give a lot of save points so its been fine so far. Driving in this game is like GTA but even worse control and every surface is made of ice. The talks you have in the car passes the time by pretty well. The game is suprisingly humours while still able to keep a very good feel to the horror parts.  The level designs are extremely atmospheric and the music in this game is great. The developers reference reality and themselves throughout the game and its pretty nice to catch on to them when they do make them. The game feels like a PS2 game should, its not something I feel on most games now adays and its really good feeling to go back in time. I strongly suggest this game even with the crashing problems from the port, most problems can be fixed with enough research and the DPfix Tool
2385	1	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan  Deadly Premonition is GOTY for sure If you're tired of boredom then here is the cure If you don't believe me just buy it and see Now you can play it on your PC  So says Mr Stewart.
2859	0	a	Broken from the start. After downloading the game it would not launch at all. To fix that you have to run dplauncher as administrator. Then i calibrated my wireless 360 controller and launched the game after that and set my control config to joystick in the launcher. Buttons worked fine and the game is advertised with 'Full Controller Support'. RIght when i gained control of the character i could not move but the buttons worked. I downloaded and installed the dpfix and it didnt do anything. I really wanted to play this but i only paid $2.49 and i wouldnt recommend buying it at that price. I guess i'll just buy the ps3 version.
1132	1	a	This game is fun to run over zombies and customise cars.  10/10
230	1	a	Honestly there isn't anything negative I can say about this game. It does have amazing visuals and a great story line although I must point out this game isn't for the faint of heart or people of the Christian religion. It has a lot to do with the Devil and Dark Magic. I as a gamer don't take offense to simple video games however I am aware that many people or their family members may not entirely agree with this this game and I respect that, therefore should you be Christian or have family members who are either Christian or believe heavyly into the Bible, this isn't a game for you.

I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.

18	1	a	  I think its a nice game. It's true that there is no one playing online but i think that if people talk about it and really put time into this game they would like it. Nice shooter and zombie combination. You should try it for yourself. I didn't play for long but i already see the potential.
2037	1	a	I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It has immense, richly developed lore. Every last God-forgotten potion, or minor item, has imaginative description, just like in Baldurs Gate. Dialogues are good and non-lianear, you can side with or against many NPCs, you can choose to befriend them, torch them in a Holy Flame or let them loose. General mood and gameplay are close to Diablo 1, very dark and intriguing. So, my concusion is that this is not some cheap attempt at depth, as it may seem simply because this game is being sold at 80 percent off very often. This is actually a finely crafred RPG, which may appeal to both BG and Diablo camps of gamers.  EDIT: This game is my nomination for first Steam Awards in category Best Unknown Game.

2675	0	a	I've heard a lot about this game. This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.  I must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...  First of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these 'quests' are like 'find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM' (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), 'find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)', 'find sheriff's dumbbell', 'find sheriff's assistant's keys' and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY...  ...the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like 'guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff' and just push you through till the end. Seriously, â¥â¥â¥â¥ quests I didn't finish! â¥â¥â¥â¥ exploring! Surprise, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!  Another thing, last, but not least.  ATTENTION! SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this if you still decided to buy and play this game!     Imagine that you are playing first Silent Hill, you enjoy every second of it and in the end of the game Alessa turns out to be a giant Godzilla with rocket launchers and a big pink ponytail. This is what I felt during the bossfights with George and Kaysen. I understand, that this is a Japanese game, it is supposed to be odd and weird, but Swery, seriously, is it some kind of trolling or were you just high? What the â¥â¥â¥â¥, man?    Thank you for reading this if u did. I am not going to persuade you not to buy this game, I am just sharing my own opinion. For me this game is one of the biggest disappointments ever compared to other games I've played. It started so good and ended like absolute delirium.
1246	0	a	Game doesn't work with my keyboard or PS4 wireless controller. Could only play a little bit going back and forward and using the emergency break a little bit.
1424	1	a	This game was great, you have to think thru the puzzles, out think the aliens and watch out for traps. The puzzles are not so much, move here, step here, but they seem like pratical things that you would have to do to acomplish a goal... really enjoyed this game and thought it was very creepy..
754	1	a	Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20. It is exactly what it says it is. A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist. Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.

3043	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I recommend any version of this beautiful game other than the pc port.  Deadly Premonition might be the greatest game of all time. While this review shall be focusing on the abominable pc version, I'll say this about the game itself: the graphics might be terrible, the sound effects were probably pulled from a free sound website, and it doesn't make much sense storywise at several points. But if you believe that games are about being immersed in a truly unique world, if gaming is not about getting an arbitrary number of points but is about telling a story in an amazing way that makes you care for the characters you see, I'd highly recommend you get this game for PS3 or Xbox 360.  Now onto the pc port, it's garbage. The problems are so numerous I have to seperate them into multiple catagories.  Crashes: Crashed 4 times in about 3.5 hours...maybe I could get a fanmade fix, but it's NEVER the fans' job to make sure the game works.  Controls: Space bar is draw weapon and aim (You can only fire and reload if you are aiming) I got used to this, but my problem is, while you can rebind many of the controls, you can't rebind aim to something resonable (Such as right mouse button) Also, certain buttons on the controller won't work if you bind them, for instance, I wanted to put the lock on command to left trigger. After I bound it, it did not work. Same as when I tried to put shoot onto right trigger.  Framerate: First half hour runs at about 10-15 fps, it ran fine for about an hour, now runs at a steady 5 fps. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not work.  Driving controls: They work fine (If a bit wonky) with a keyboard. When you use a controller, the physics speeds up so the cars, which only go about 60 mps in the game, can easily hit 150 on the open road and it makes the steering hyper sensitive. I thought at first the car's physics might have been locked to the framerate on consoles, explaining why on pc the cars go faster, since the pc version has a higher framerate. But why does it only effect controller?  In conclusion, the pc port sucks it's certainly not worth the bucks buy the game on PS3 or xbox, It will truly, knock off your socks.  So says Mr. Stewart.  Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, 'CultGamerAlliance'. Check it out if you get a chance!

1608	1	a	I think that this was the best Penumbra yet in terms of gameplay and story development. The first game set the tone, atmosphere and story really well and ended excellently. This picked up from where the first left off and really took off- the experience was terrifying and yet so fun at the same time. Frustratingly, a bug prevented me from finishing it on my own computer.

1077	1	a	Pretty good game, haven't beat it yet though. Fun and cheap...the way i like my games.
1701	1	a	Ok, after so many years I was finally able to play the whole chapter. I am very sensitive to horror games....I was never able to go past the first levelm, I tried many times and I always stopped. Once I got used to the 'fear' system of the game, the game stopped being too scary for me and I started enjoying instead of seeing it as a torture (this is a message to the chicken people like me who are scared by such games).  Anyway, the game is cool enough. First of all, keep in mind that this is a Chapter. The game has no end, it is a cliffhanger ending so if you are one of those (like me) that hate unfinished things, keep in mind that even if you don't like the game so much, you will have to play all three chapters (overture, black plague, requiem) to see the end of the story.  This chapter is quite short (6 hours are enough). Puzzles are nice, physics serve well that purpose. Graphically it is pleasant. Sounds is also still good enough for today's standards and controls are interesting. Can't say about the story because I have to play 2nd and 3rd chapter yet, but what can I say....so far so good ! 75/100

2386	1	a	I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.  A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:  I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.  Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.  There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer.   I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.

1551	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague is an excellent sequel to Overture.   The Penumbra series is filled with psychological thrills and creeps that doesn't rely on jump scares.  Black Plague fills in the lack of dialogue missing in Overture.   Requiem is an quick puzzle-like expansion on more information about where/who Philip and some ect. chatacters in the series, that include no monsters whatsoever.  If you enjoyed other games by Frictional, Amnesia You'll enjoy Penumbra as well.

622	1	a	This game was great. I really enjoyed playing the evil, vindictive little brat.   Pros: -Art was great. It felt natural some how, and yet eerie. -Good story. There were times the plot was quite obvious and other times I was a little surprised, which is hard for stories to do lately. -Even I got scared sometimes.  -I thought the thought put into the exploration of the house was great.  Cons: -Some of the characters were quite flat. -I would have liked more interaction with the devil. -The ways in which you go about destroying your enemies were all planned out. Left little room for planning the demise of your enemies yourself.  Get this game. And be the bad guy!
733	1	a	fun game but its just a story no freeplay but its fun
2438	1	a	  This game is more campy then scary. For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.    This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.  A few hardware issues: #Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 &amp; 7.1 surround is a no-no) #Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all. This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.) #Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)  All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky. The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.  If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing. There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.

The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.

1636	1	a	Having recently played Thief Gold, I was surprised to find more similarities between the two. Philip isn't much of a fighter, but can sneak pretty damn well. The game manages to surround you with an desolate and eerie atmosphere, as you keep descending ever deeper into the complex systems of the underground mine. The puzzles can also offer a good challenge that will leave you satisfied once you crack it down and the documents, scattered about in the mine, are also fun to read to keep up with the story and your surroundings. The engine to interact with your surroundings is pretty unique, as well.  On the other hand, having heard that Penumbra is a massive scare-fest, it was a big letdown. The only semi-real scare you can have is when you meet the first dog and at the very end of the game, which is also quite abrupt and will remind you that Episode 1 is in the game title for a reason. Once you manage to dispose of a few enemies, the horror part really goes down. For most of the time, you are in complete control of the situation, you can work out the patrolling routes of the monsters and ambush them, instead of the opposite. You can also utilize the terrain and various objects to your advantage.  I would recommend Penumbra: Overture as a good atmospheric adventure/puzzle game, but not horror.

If you don't have a lot of time to play videogames, this is great for a quick fix.
619	0	a	TL;DR: This game is honestly not that great. Took me 5 hours today to do the game entirely, including all the time I spent just running around the house trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do, which counts for most of it. For 20$, I would have expected more.  Full review:  Lucius isn't entirely bad, but it is far from great, and far from justifying the 20$ price.  You start the game having only 1 power, which is telekinesis. There are a lot of items in the game that you can move and swing around, which is great, but there are two down sides to this: first, you are suspicious because of items floating in the air, while you are just standing there (but turning those crosses upside-down isn't). Second, it's pointless. You can move vases, cups, glasses, etc but it serves no purpose whatsoever.  Second power you get is Mind Control, which is honestly not as great as it sounds. Just about everyone will be 'too strong' to be affected, so the use that they say about 'mind controlling them so you can do what you want'... not so much. The only ones that can be affected are the people you need to kill, but only under some circumstances.  Third is mind erase. Basically, if you get caught, you can wipe the person's memory, but once again, only in some circumstances. Caught at night walking around? Nope. Pretty much the only time it can be used is if you are caught swinging cups with your mind.  Final power is an incinerate power. Sounds cool, yet again, just like the previous 2 powers, can only be used in some situations. In fact, I think there is only 2-3 of those, maybe 4. Not much.  Aside from the powers, there are a lot of things that are lacking. I'm all up for a hard game, but at some point, give us some clues. One of the person to kill is the person taking care of the laundry (yes, that is ALL she does, for a family of 5 plus the workers). Only info you get is 'She takes care of the laundry'. That's it. You need to kill her in a way that won't incriminate you by only knowing she does the laundry (spoiler following) to in the end kill her in her bath.  A lot of thing happens, or are said, that either doesn't make sense, or the characters are jumping to conclusion too fast. The more you advance in the game, the more those things are obvious. And yes, the following contains spoilers.  ---  At first, there is a few things that bothers me, but it really starts with a confession from a cop to a priest:  Cop: I've been having nightmares, terrible scenes playing in my head. And this family are the players. Priest: It sounds to be like this family needs help, my son. Priest: It sounds to me like the church should intervene.  That is the exact text. What do they do? They try to contact the family to support them morally. Although it is 'helping the family, that is not an 'intervention'.   Second, there is actually a scene where you are sleeping with your shoes on, and you get woken up by your grand-father that punches you in the balls. And no reaction about this last part, obviously. About the shoes, all the other nights you sleep with your slippers on.  Third, you are told by your grandfather that your father and uncle never found the hidden door in the basement while playing there as kids... Really? They played there for years, in a room about 5m by 5m (max), with one of the walls being nothing more than a curtain and they never wondered what was on the other side? They never even noticed it?  Fourth, a journalist that was unconscious, wakes up to you throwing a fireball at him. His first though? It is the reversed crosses on the walls that gives you your powers! Forget trying to run away from the 7 years old, fireball throwing kid here, let's instead try to put back those crosses in the right way.  Fifth, your 'father' finds a book about satan on your grandfather's desk. First conclusion? Your grandfather used a ritual to curse your family, and you are the source of that curse! Don't think that the grandfather, which was already sounding partially senile, could just have been weirder, or that all this is just stupid, noooo... 'It's the only logical explanation!' (actual quote from the father)  Those are only some of the points that I find illogical. There are many more.  ---  As for the achievements... Most fit in one of two category: 'play the game' or 'do useless stuff to get this'. Examples:  Play 20/40 hours. With a 5 hours game, yes it will be hard, but not for the good reasons. Break X objects. Doesn't have any purpose, but you can get it! Get caught X times. Be rewarded for failing! Kill X persons. Basically, one per person that you NEED to kill. So 20 achievements right there Run 26 miles. Yes I did get it. That's how much running in circle you do. Take 20 pictures. You only need to take one in the game, but if you click 19 more times...  Finally, you would expect a horror game (or at least a game about satan and the antichrist) to have a dark atmosphere. Well, the only thing really dark about the game is the corridors, lacking lightning. All the murders are so cliche and msot are so predictable that the atmosphere it's trying to create just doesn't work.  In conclusion, if the game was between 5-10$, it would be acceptable. But 20$ for less than 5 hours of gameplay, without replay value and with how the game works, it is not worth it in my opinion.
1321	1	a	Like the first part, Overture, Frictional Games again manages to capture the true essence of survival horror improving from last time by incorporating better sounds, atmosphere and a somewhat tighter story with memorable characters. The voice acting was superb throughout but while the humourous moments helped lighten the mood faster in order to regain that 'SHOCK' moment more often, I felt that this rushed approach wasn't well executed nor received. The total removement of the combat system is what I think makes this game far superior than its predesseccor. You have to run and hide rather than club your enemies to death. The best thing about Black Plague was by far its script, it never fails to keep the player both captivated and horrified. The end message was well thought out and delievered although the overall shortness of the campaign may disappoint the die-hard fans who were looking for something a bit longer. Overall, this game is superb and fully deserves your time and money.

I can't really recommend/not recommend this game because I haven't played it. Just a word of warning though, if your computer struggles with SOME games (not necessarily all, I can play a lot of games on my laptop considering its not a gaming laptop per se) like mine does, it won't be able to run this. I wish I didn't waste my money.
1658	1	a	An awesome survival horror game, though short. With the package of Black Plauge for 10$, it's work it. Only downside I could think of is rather low replayability and it only took me about 5 hours.
1195	0	a	Right, well it's miles better than the first one anyway! Which is to say, it's not a great game by any means, but it's certainly... playable.  Basically, y'know Micro Machines: Military Madness? What's that, you don't? Oh, it's this really great (as I remember it) Mega Drive tank racing game! Well anyway, this game is like that game... but not nearly as good. Go play that instead.

2211	1	a	I love this game to death. (100+ Hours XBOX360) I'll be honest, this game is not for everyone. Should you choose to buy this game, one of these things will happen to you.  1. You'll immediately fall in love with the game, and the mood SWERY sets.  2. You will hate it, uninstall it, and DP will be one of those games in ur list that has only 30 minutes of total playtime and last played in years.  3. You slowly force yourself to play the game because it's 'CULT' and you inadvertently fall in love with it and become a fangirl/fanboy.   If you love this game, i recommend checking out SWERY's next game  'D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die'   10/10 IN SWERY WE TRUST.

1324	1	a	Perfect blend of horror, puzzle solving and irritating atmosphere. Attention: Probably will cause heart attacks.
535	1	a	Lucius was honestly one of the best games I've ever played. Granted, at times, it felt like an adventure game with a set path, but the satisfaction of independently finding out how to brutally maim someone while making it look like an accident is something no other game can match. There are a few bugs and glitches here and there, such as me spawning outside of the bedroom at the start of Chapter 4 and being able to walk freely outside the mansion, but it was fixed by me reloading the chapter. This game is worth it. There is a certain charm about being the son of the devil that just hooks me. 
1267	0	a	It honestly just feels like a mobile game. The game is so bland and uninteresting and it's so fast paced you don't even know (or care) about what you're doing, whether its finding a survivor or just running over zombies (basically the only two things you can do in the game). That being said, all you really do is    run over zombies and    try to steer a car with a wonky turning system. This is literally a game about driving, they could have at least gotten that right. The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes. It tries to tell a story but 20 minutes in you'll be scratching your head at the pathetic dialogue and nonexistent 'plot'. You just drive over zombies. It's not god-awful, but even on sale for $3 I want my money back.
2159	1	a	It's the game Alan Wake wanted to be, but with quirks and wonderful B-movie taste.  But be warned: it's bad, it realy is. It won't be working without fan patches, and it's very rough around the corners, and the story's ludicrous. But it has style. It has a character. It's like an old geeky friend with strange tastes. Not creme de la creme, but interesting one.  Reminds me of an old game named Harvester.

But unfortunately for me, I could not get the game to run without incredible lag, like many others have experienced. After tinkering around for a fix, it now just crashes at startup. Your chances of getting this game to work for you on PC seem to be 50/50. You'll have to decide whether it's worth the gamble.  I am hoping the devs eventually get back to this with some bug fixes, but it's not looking good. As it stands, I can't recommend what looks like an otherwise great game.

Another thing I personally love about this game is how much lore there is around it, so if you like that sort of thing, this is for you. Overall, I reckon this game is around a 9/10, but it's hard to judge it on just one aspect of it.

952	1	a	For when it is discounted by atleast 60%, i'd suggest buying it for a fun little mess around when all your other games dont seem to be filling your needs. Great GAME but only worth it on discount!

2635	0	a	I've not played a pc game as crash prone or broken since the original unpatched s.t.a.l.k.e.r.  Even with all the fixes and remedies you're going to need some luck to get through it.  I suggest just getting the console version even though that version isn't exactly stable neither but it's at least playable in some respects.   Only because how poor the original console version does this game actually gets excused from being the worst pc port ever.
119	1	a	6 year old kid killing his whole family for the glory of Satan. And you are that kid armed with demonic power. Each murder has to look like accident so they wont throw your â¥â¥â¥ in asylum, or yet worse, catholic church. The concept actually sounds better than actual gameplay looks like, but it is worth trying.
154	1	a	This game makes you think you can get away with murder... NOTE: YOU (probably) CAN'T GET AWAY WITH MURDER  Pros: fun puzzles to solve, murder, b00bs (yes, it has b00bs), descent play time, gory, not terrible graphics, good story  Cons: Not enough people to murder ;)

1055	1	a	put guns on your battle cars so you can kill zeds while you kill zeds. f#ck yeah!  i loved the original release of this game and the 'HD' steam release is even better.  now there's not only the story mode but also race, destruction race and survival. i focused on the story mode and only played the other modes for the achievements but the other modes certainly aren't bad. it never hurts to have more options to extend your playtime and increase the value of the game.  the story mode includes quite a lot of levels and they offer a decent variety of missions and side missions. plus you can finish the missions and still drive around for a while to kill some more zeds and increase your reward. with a fine selection of cars and weapons it just never gets boring. the other game modes are pretty much self-explanatory.  there are some DLC for this game but they are not essential and you don't need them for the achievements. i completed the game 100% after little more than 19 hours and it was just as big fun as the original release.  if you like cars and guns and want to kill some time and zeds then you really can't go wrong with this game.

Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.

2619	0	a	Really wanted to play Deadly Premonition.  Everytime I launch the game it crashes immediately. Tons of problems with the port after that.  Very disappointed.  Edit: After installing DPfix, changing the compatibility to Windows XP, nearly â¥â¥â¥â¥ing my OS, and uninstalling VLC and MPC-HC, I finally got the game to work. Still not recommending because I don't really want anyone else to go through all that bull â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1711	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the little baby of the horror-game 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent'. If you like horror games, buy it.
2260	1	a	I would give this game a 10/10 if it didn't randomly crash on me. It's very unique, the story is great, the voice acting is good, gameplay is fun. The music is a little weird at times, and it doesn't seem to fit the situation. I get a good steady 60fps at 1440p using DP fix.
201	1	a	I absolutely loved this game! The story was interesting and had me hooked the whole way. It was gruesome, fun, and paid homage to some of the greatest possession movies and stories out there in a fantastic way. Once I started it up I could not stop playing until the very end, nothing beats a night of plotting diabolical acts for a six year old demon to perpetrate!

The gameplay however is at times just moderate and a bit clumsy bot most of the time it's interesting to figure out how the next murder should be done. The gameplay, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack and finally the setting - all go arms in arms and create a wonderful charme of spine-chilling scariness. Overal this game is simply brilliant and I'm not aware of any other game with such a deep haunting atmosphere.  Not recommended for weak nerves, otherwise try it out.

1550	1	a	To start: I used to add a header to every one of these reviews, but it oftentimes made the review too long to submit, so I've left it on my Backloggery page. Also, since this game comes with Penumbra: Requiem, I'll talk about that game in this review as well.  Gameplay (Black Plague): Truth be told, you should probably refer back to the Overture review if you wanna know about the mechanics of the game. Since this is a sorta episodic game, I won't go into too much detail again about the mechanics. Just know that they remain largely unchanged. What has changed - and definitely for the better - is the atmosphere. Oh man, it's a lot better this time around. Again, it's not quite Dark Descent territory, but it's pretty dang good. The extra enemy variety helps out a lot as well. Another thing that has changed for the better is the puzzle design. They do require a bit more thought than the average puzzle in Overture would, but the puzzles still make logical sense and are less prone to breaking. All in all, it's the same from Overture but a lot better. 8/10.  Gameplay (Requiem): If ya like puzzles and not being scared... go play Portal 2 or something. Seriously; I don't even know why this became a thing. This game is mostly puzzles with some platforming here and there, but there's no monsters. There's no atmosphere. It's pretty much Myst if you've turned the Gamma down to 0.1 or something. That's not a bad thing, though; a lot of the puzzles in this game are quite good. It's just not a Penumbra game. Also, the atmosphere... they're just taking the â¥â¥â¥â¥ at this point. There's a Donkey Kong parody in there. No, I'm not joking. There's even chippy music. As if the game wasn't far removed enough from the Penumbra atmosphere. Again though, the puzzles are pretty good. It's just not a Penumbra game. 6/10.  Story (Black Plague): A lot tighter of a story than Overture's. Clarence is a pretty neat and genuinely terrifying character/concept. Likewise, there's actually a couple of pretty heavy moments toward the end (for those who know what I'm talking about, pun well intended). Everything's pretty well explained and the ending wraps things up quite well. No need for a sequel. 8/10.  Story (Requiem): ...and then this thing happened. Again, just... why? The story doesn't even take itself seriously. For anybody who bought Requiem from retail; I'm sorry. I apologize on behalf of Frictional (not affiliated). The characters are just silly, the premise doesn't make any dosh garn sense, the payoff is underwhelming, and it's just generally a mess. At least Dark Descent redeemed them. 3/10.  Graphics (Black Plague): Again, a lot more of the same but better. Enemy design is the biggest standout as far as graphics goes. As for the technical side, same engine; same reliability. 4/5.  Graphics (Requiem): None of the enemy design from Black Plague. At least areas are pretty varied, even if the framing device doesn't work. Again, for the technical side of the things, it's the same as Black Plague. 3/5.  Sound (Black Plague): I'd say it's about the same as Overture's, which is to say very good. Enemies sound a lot more terrifying now, so that's a plus. Clarence sounds proper mental this time as opposed to cartoonishly mental. Good stuff. 5/5.  Sound (Requiem): Way too try-hard. So much attempted atmosphere for so little worth fretting over. It gets kinda ridiculous, honestly. Ah well; it's not like anything else in the game was cohesive. 2/5.  Overall scores for Black Plague are 8/8/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. Good stuff.  Overall scores for Requiem are: 6/3/3/2; 4.7/10. Not good stuff.

1771	0	a	The game looks good, but when I open it on my pc it is very bright, even with gama and all other settings either on low or off. I also have tried playing it on my mac (version 10.9) only to find that it opens to a black screen and then quits. I have tried looking for solutions but to no avail. Until I can even play the game, I must not recomend this game, for a game that does not even work is not worth buying.
2679	0	a	It's like Twin Peaks and Silent Hill had a baby with one of those immunodeficiency disorders where they need to be stuck in a plastic bubble. After downloading DPfix so I can run this game at a semi-decent framerate, setting it to windows 98 compatibility mode so it wouldn't crash about an hour in, and finding workarounds to keep the loading screens from freezing up, I got about halfway through. Now I'm in the middle of a quicktime event where none of my keys register, and nothing I can find will fix it.
59	1	a	Lucius is a game where it puts you in control of a 6 year old boy whos grandfather has a deal with Satan. Where he and his family well gain everything they could want, in return his first Grandson, Lucius. Satan comes to claim what is his on your 6th birthday, where he proceeds to instruct you on your new fait. You must kill every one living with in the house hold (maid, cooks, mechanic, family members, and your teacher) with out being caught by the investigator that is trying to piece the hole mystery together.   The killing is a little linear when it comes to who and how you kill them but it still makes it interesting trying to figure out how to do it. The story is good and the graphics are not to great but over all its still one of my fav games. If it goes on sale for $10 its a must grab if you enjoy Horror Adventure games from the killers point of view! 8/10

I came home from school, and spent the whole day, trying to finishing the game. And I did!  Other reasons I love this game, is because theres no jumpscares!

Puzzle, find the maguffin, use maguffin, GET SCARED, proceed.  There is combat, but it only hurts the game, I think. It is my only complaint. So if you'll let that slide, it's a great buy.

The dog then blasted through the door and the two barrels blocking it and ripped me to shreds.  11/10 would face zombie dog John Cena again.

1275	1	a	This is the kind of game you'll have to play with a pair of headphones and no source of light because only then you'll experience its true power.   The game's overall story is deep, unpredictable and intriguing, making it very interesting, which is a big plus for a horror game. (It even has a few emotional moments!) Even though at the beginning there is a short recap of the events that took place in Overture, I highly recommend playing the first game first in order to have a full understanding of the story. (You can only buy the package containing both games, so why not give it a try?)  Both games are similar in terms of gameplay, but Black Plague improves a lot on about every aspect of the first game, making it more solid. There is no direct way of fighting with the enemies in this installment, so the combat system, which, in my opinion, wasn't that awful, should no longer be a problem for those who complained about it. Another important aspect of the game are puzzles: being the second episode, Black Plague is also filled with intelligent puzzles that require reading (in-game 'notes') and thinking, but this time they are just a little easier than those found in Overture.  The graphics may be a little outdated, but there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't break the immersion; they are decent and have successfully created a terrifying atmosphere that will constantly make you scared of the unknown. (For that to work at its full potential, I recommend lowering the gamma a bit, until you can't see anything in places without any source of light.) With its impressive sound design and voice acting (at least for a low-budget game), the developers managed to create their own world filled with few, but believable characters.   For such a low price, I can recommend the Penumbra games without a doubt! This package is a must-have for every horror enthusiast, as it delivers a frightening experience!
306	1	a	Good game. Think Hitman, but it takes place in a Mansion and you play as Lucifer's son. I Love the detail on Lucius, he looks like a ....devil.  Performance could be better, I was playing on a lower end laptop and it ran, but stutterd every now and again. Would still rec for good story, setting, and very immersive.  7/10

1634	1	a	I consider Penumbra: Overture to be one of the first 'true' horror games I've ever played. It fascinated me by taking an entirely different approach to the subgenre of survival horror, removing nearly all elements of violence or gore, while concentrating on a terrifying atmosphere and environment. Frictional Games manages to create suspense by solely focusing on the feeling of isolation and helplessness in a most hostile environment. Instead of just throwing one jumpscare after another at you, Penumbra plays with the fear of the unknown, and knows exactly at which time to strike. This combined with the puzzles and sophisticated physics engine ensure a perfect pacing between tense and relaxed parts. The music and sound design is remarkably well done for an indie game and can compare to genre classics like Silent Hill without doubt. Penumbra: Overture is a real insiders' tip for me if it comes to survival horror games, and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.

2840	0	a	So somehow this game magically decided to work after hours of trying to get it run, it still crashes here and there but at least I can actually play now.  Amazing, amazing game but save yourself the trouble and get it on console, if you can't then go ahead knowing you may not be able to actually play it properly with dozens and problems, bugs and crashes. It ruins the experience of this amazing game.   I still think this game shouldnt be allowed on Steam with how broken it is and should be looked at again. Overall, it's not worth going through the trouble of getting this game to work during the early stages of the game, despite how amazing the story and characters are.
1420	1	a	You play as Phillip in the second tame of the Penumbra series. This one was definitely my favourite, I loved the story to this game that I still remember it very clearly months after finishing the game. I found that the game was lovely, had an interesting atmosphere, with fitting sound effects and mediocre graphics.  There were a few little puzzles included here and there that you had to complete to progress in the game, but I liked that most of the puzzles weren't pressured by the presence of monsters/dogs. I like to take my time on puzzles.   Once again, a very good buy and game from the Penumbra trilogy

1882	1	a	May not be as scary as say Amnesia but this is one survival horror that you shouldn't miss. Its fun, challenging and very very creepy. Combat is difficult so you can't always rely on the 'weapons' you get, which makes the game interesting because a game isn't a horror game if you can easily fight your way through all your enemies. This game was great. I hope to get Penumbra: Black Plague very soon.

2206	1	a	Like many people, I played the tutorial section of Deadly Premonition on the 360 and dismissed it as a cheap, ugly, unwieldy, cheesy afterthought.  It's not. Boy, is it not.  Imagine a game made by someone who watched Twin Peaks, loved Resident Evil 4 and doesn't have a cynical bone in their body. The jankiness of the PC port evaporated along with the essential widescreen patch (YMMV however) and what was left was something that was in equal parts charming, kooky and memorable. It's an action adventure that wears its influences with pride and revels in its clunkiness.  I get it now. Swery intended *everything*.  Can't recommend the game at full price though because although it chimed with me in a big way, there are going to be people who hate it (and I can't blame someone for having a different taste to mine).  With a large reduction, everyone should at least try Deadly Premonition - Just promise me you'll play past the prologue.

593	1	a	It's a horror game where you play as the horror, and I've been wanting that for ages. Games where you play as the villain always intrigue me, and this game embraces the concept. Throughout the entire thing you're either plotting your next evil deed, enjoying the result of your work, or just using your hellish powers for giggles.  The game feels like a horror movie all the way through. You got a narrator talking about your progress, cutscenes to give the story more depth, and an impressive climax. The voice acting is decent; it ranged from superb to not so bad as to ruin the immersion. The characters are actually intriguing for the little time you know them and I almost felt sorry for some of the poor victims.   The whole puzzle theme of the game is intriguing since it forces you to think a lot. Sometimes you might get stuck for hours because you can't figure out you need that tiny thing in that room and put it in the other thing. But the cutscenes at the end of each chapter are rewarding and satisfying enough to make the frustration worth it.  The set of powers you get to wield with your character are also fun to use. I would have preferred some more freedom to fully enjoy your awesome powers of Antichrist, but as it is, the game takes great advantage of what it gives you. Especially in the climax, where you truly feel like a demonic badass with the help of great surroundings and an epic soundtrack. That too should be mentioned; the music in this game is really good.  If I were to point out flaws, I'd say that I did encounter a few bugs. Nothing so big that it damaged my experience, though. The characters' talking did get old really quickly as well. Especially the final boss, who has ONE LINE that he repeats the entire time.   To conclude, Lucius is the perfect game for the sadistic player who wants to feel like a villain and also enjoys puzzle games. The experience is enhanched by beautiful graphics for an indie game, great soundtrack and an interesting story.
1788	1	a	I bought this game and it's 2 sequels on a sale because they were really cheap. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. The combat in the first game is shoddy and hard to control at best. However, the story, the ambience of it and the beautiful story led to an experience I can honestly say I havent felt before.
2220	1	a	Positive: game is somehow unique in some way (like Braid, Limbo, Alan Wake and etc.). I love those 'unique' games which you can't see every day.. So I try to play them all.. This game is based on Twin Peaks (main plot almost the same, some characters are very similar in some details) so if you're a fan of TP you must play. However, before buying please read negative side. I bought it for 7 euro and still think price for this poorly optimized game is still too big. If you played Dark Souls (which is titled as one of the worst ports) and thought that DS is worst port try this gameâ¦. DS only problem was locked frame rates and resolution although no other problems I noticed... Negative: ou boy... where do I even begin from..? Well, I guess Iâll write about everything what I didnât had positive opinionâ¦ Sound: music and other sounds is nothing awesome. Problem is that it may stuck and loop again and again at some point (had a car brake sound loop). Problem is that IF you save (stupid that I did it) when this problem is occurring you're stuck with it even after PC reboot. Strangely enough it fixed itself after I progressed 2-3 chapters. Thank god... Unless you want to hear everywhere stopping car sound (even through cutscenes!). Ragdolls/textures: during my gameplay I noticed few graphical issues (main character's tie was sticking from his belly to the back, sometimes his jacket mysteriously disappeared). It's nothing major although it annoys a little. Graphical look: this game looks like 2005 game. Well at least it is at acceptable levels. Enemies: during the whole game you encounter only 4 types of enemies (sure they have different appearance or carry different weapons, but the fact is that it is SAME enemies only they carry or looks differently): shadow, climbing shadow, birds, dogs. Not to mention that 2 types of these enemies you can even not to notice (I barely noticed them myself and never killed or had to kill one of those 2). Boses: during the whole game you encounter X (I wonât spoil exact number but itâs only a few) bosses and they all are a joke once you know their weak point.  Cutscenes: although it occurred to very few people but the cutscenes may be shown to you upside down. I was one of those unlucky people. How do you like that? I browsed internet and some other games had this issue. Itâs related to codec problems. Tried to install CCCP and K-Lite mega pack codecs but the problem persisted. (Good side is that there arenât a lot of them + subtitles are displayed correctly so if youâre as am I more interest in a story it wonât bother you a lot). Dungeons: once youâll play your 4th or 5th dungeon youâll realize that there is no benefit to kill enemies (except few times when they drop not ammo or medkits) because money is not an issue in this game. So you begin just run through them. These âdungeonsâ are boring and annoys a lot when you have to repeat them (if you want to collect all trading cards). Loading times: I store all my games on Samsung 840 PRO 500GB SSD drive (which is one of the fastest in SSD at the moment) and believe me when I say that you have to wait a LONG time to load this game different parts. I have to wait around 1 minute till it loads âPress Start buttonâ (if I had simple HDD I probably would think that game is crashed), for every cutscene to load (if the game wonât crash) Iâll have to wait around 2 minutes before cutscene and around 1 minute after cutscene, if I enter somewhere (i. e. house) Iâll have to wait around 1 minute too (this is especially annoying because for example in L4D2 I have to wait around 10-20 seconds to load next map and graphics there are at least twice better, hellâ¦ I can even compare this games loading to Windows 7 booting timeâ¦ AGAIN 10-20 secondsâ¦).  Optimization (crashes): why I said that 7 euros is a lot for this you ask? Well everything above I mentioned is forgivable if not the OPTIMIZATION problem (yeah I wanted to type in the uppercase letters). This game crashes whenever it wants: it crashes during the loading screen, during the driving, when you try to open your inventory, on really rare occasionâs game crashes right when you launch it, hell it crashes before or even after the cutscenes (I really enjoyed this when I finish chapter and there are a few cutscenesâ¦ It crashed 5 times till I got to the words: âDo you want to save?â I saved the game and it crashed AGAIN. Good thing that I could continue from the save). Soâ¦ In summary it crashes whenever it likesâ¦ Donât forget that this game starts to lag after 30 minutes of gameplay. During constant crash you even canât replay some chapters (I couldnât replay chapter 7 even after 20th tryâ¦). Not sureâ¦ Maybe crashes related to AMD card I haveâ¦ For those who gonna BUY THIS: use ALL available and possible fixes: Increase game launch exe file max RAM memory access to more than 2GB (yes, the game has memory leaks due a bad coding i. e. after 30 minutes of playing it increases ram usage from 200MB to more than +2100MB and starts to lag a lot). Note: this âincreaseâ method works only on 64-bit systems Use DPFix for desirable resolution (yes same story as Dark Soulsâ¦ Devs couldnât add support for high resolutions). SET DP.EXE and/or (I used same on both files) DPLAUNCHER.exe files to use Compatibility with Windows 98/ME and check mark âRun as an Adminâ. Shutdown your antivirus (at least for me it helped and crashes decreased even though whole Steam folder is added to antivirus exclusion listâ¦). And yeahâ¦ Never do anything to stress your computer during this gamesâ gameplay or you risking with crash (for me even once occurred a crash while I tried to make a screenshot with steam integrated feature). For those who doing all side quests: do them as soon as possible unless you want to experience more crashes (during chapter replay you cannot save) and to lose all your progress..  So if you still want to try your luck with this super SLOW and constantly CRASHING game be my guest. Just make sure that you apply all (or at least as much as possible) my suggestionsâ¦ That way your game may become almost playable (you minimize crashing number as much as possible).  And yeah although it annoyed me a lot I still liked game mainly due to it's story and gameplay :)

Game is somewhat limited, you kill everyone the way game wants you to. You can roam in the map pretty free, and it has some stealth elements to it. Little bit clunky, but after a while you get used to it.   If you can get through the rough edges of this game, it can be really fun. Or at least entertaining, as I don't think killing everyone one in your family should be considered fun.  Pick it up on a sale, or in a bundle
1614	1	a	A really great horror game, but considering that it's pretty short (took me 4h to complete), you should get the sequel Black Plague at the same time. If you like Amnesia then this is definitely the game for you.

1685	1	a	The original Puzzle Horror game from Frictional games, Penumbra: Overture is the start of a trilogy to remember. I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent first (having learned of it through youtube hype back when it was first released), and then when I found myself craving more and searching on Frictional's website, I came across this gem. There is a free demo of this game available from said website, and I recommend playing that if you want a taste of the game before you buy. It is very much like Amnesia TDD, although in a slightly brighter yet just as grim underground mine. The atmosphere is eerie, and the story is captivating and can really make you emotional at points (it did for me, anyway). I definitely recommend this to those who want horror games that play like Amnesia: TDD. Or, for those who are just discovering Frictional's work, Penumbra:Overture is a wonderful place to start.

1592	1	a	This is by far one of the best survival horror games I've ever played. The first Penumbra game was pretty good, the third was mediocre, but this one was definitely the best of the three. The atmosphere is chilling, the soundtrack is excellent, and the story is pretty interesting. I think it's mostly the soundtrack that made me like this game so much. The music that plays when enemies are around and/or are coming after you gives me goosebumps. It's that kind of music that you randomly remember in the middle of the night and become terrified, and it's those kinds of aspects that I look for in a good horror game. The only complaint that I have about this game is that there isn't any way to skip the dialogue that plays throughout the game (from Clarence) and sometimes it gets rather annoying hearing his voice every couple of minutes. For someone who is playing the game for the first time, I can understand why they'd want to hear the dialogue. However, for someone who is playing it again after having beaten it just to experience the atmosphere again, it gets rather old hearing his voice. Nonetheless, this is a fantastic game and is far better than any recent horror games I've played. If you're a horror fan, I highly recommend this game. You won't be disappointed.

Next go steal an obscurely hidden key in room #43 and get the water bottle from the second shelf in room #3 of a million rooms, then use that to access a draw in a study with bullets and then guess the combination to a safe and take out the gun and then load the gun and don't shoot it no you have to put it on an arbitrary desk near the teacher and tell him to shoot himself and he's like what and then he does it but you don't get blamed.

1975	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the first entry in the Penumbra trilogy. While it lacks a diverse cast of enemies, has somewhat repetative level design among other trivial flaws, it serves as a solid exposition to the plot. It has memorable sequences and requires the player to think on their feet to survive and solve puzzles. If you are looking for a game that mixes action and puzzle, all while telling a great story in a creepy setting, this game is for you!
2612	0	a	Great game, TERRIBLE port. Started out at about 5 FPS (unplayable/slideshow) on a computer that can handle Skyrim and the Arkham games just fine. With all the tricks and fixes you can find on the internet I eventually got it up to around 15 FPS, at which point the game was just barely playable. (First time I ever needed to use target lock with a mouse, though.) Then the first boss showed up. The QTEs were impossible at that low framerate.  Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews: almost all of them are from people who played this game on the XBox, where it actually ran properly. The PC version is a broken mess, and it's almost certainly never going to be fixed. I got it for $6 as part of a Humble Bundle deal, and I feel ripped off.

Pros  - Decent story - Interesting concept  Cons  - Bugs that cause you to restart whole chapters - Memory wipe power was worthless - Sometimes obscure pieces to the puzzle - Very linear - Chore concept could have been better - lose suspicion allowing more flexibility for being a 'good boy' - House design is a little poor - takes some time to figure out where everything is - Would have preferred using powers to make others do terrible things on their own instead of just killing them outright - Some controls like Telekinesis and the tricycle are clunky. Same with final encounter mechanics  Kept waiting for the game to shine and it just never did. Can't recommend.

Get the 360/PS3 version. Avoid this on steam.

647	1	a	Every were that Lucius walks death follows of corse when people start to be murdered no one points to a child. This charming young evil child has captivated my soul hes almost to cute to say no to. his handsome father (the devil) almost makes me want to sell my soul to him. though i dout the devil has ever look so handsome in a game correct me if im wrong. Lucius will make your sick little devil love heart come out this game almost feels like it was made for me. The sick and twisted way that Lucius thinks is almost to much to for my girl hood.   This boy pulls off murders better than most real life adults. This boy is what nightmares are made of.  though i only have nice things to say. i spoiled the game for my self by watching someone play this and the seconed one but there so good &lt;3

685	0	a	I wish there was a Neutral button.  This game feels kinda like an old hitman, but without all the different possibilities of killing. The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at telling you what to do or what can be done, so be ready to alt tab-watch guide rinse-repeat.  Pro's: -The idea of being the son of lucifer is fun. -Murders are often awesome.  Neutral: Graphics, It's not very ugly, doesn't look good either though. Animations... same as above.  Cons: -Most of the time you have no idea what to do. -I couldn't find any mods to make the above better, in fact I couldn't find any mods at all and it's probably not supported. -Glitches are plenty, within the tutorial I picked up an item before Devildaddy told me to, and that was it.... stuck there forever untill restarting the level. -Voice acting and lipsync often failes. -You cannot choose how to murder people, you have to do it in a single specific way the game wants you to, and the game often doesn't tell you what that specific single way is.   Conclusion: If you like the idea of being the son of the devil and killing of everyone in the house one by one, then maybe get it.  Play it in short bursts, and prepare to read/watch lots of guides..

1992	1	a	I never thought I'd like a horror survival game, but this was great fun! The gameplay mechanics used in this game are fantastic and I wish more games used that style.   The storyline was quite good too. You get led through an underground mine by a man at the end of a radio transmitter. There's enough new things to find to keep you interested.   I didn't find it nearly as scary as I was expecting, but that doesn't mean to say I didn't jump every now and then. :P

2511	1	a	At the technical level, this thing is a travesty, frequent crashes, barebones gameplay that barely functions, visuals that seem to belong on the PS2, a lot of segments that seem to be pretty much filler, and at times the situations make so little sense that it would normally kill all suspension of disbelief, and yet I can't help but love the game, it might sound strange but the game has charm out the â¥â¥â¥, quirky likable characters, a plot that is mostly interesting, even if it times shoots itself in the foot occasionally. But the quirky characters, sheer ambition, attention to small details, and town that in some regards feels more alive than the cities in your typical Open Sandbox game make the game an experience unlike any other, though the original Xbox 360 version might be the best one from what I can gather.

1887	1	a	Dude... This game is awesome. Well, it's awesome, if you like to get scared. This game ACTUALLY made me go 'Oh god, wtf... oh god... OH GOD! GET AWAY FROM ME! GODOGDODGODGODGODGODG JESUS CHRIST HOLY-- holy... jesus.' Then there was this time where I was running and way like 'GOD OH GOD!' and screaming and stuff, then my friend decided to say in my ear in that creepy a** voice of his 'Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't escape me, I'm the gingerbread man!' and I was like 'SHUT THE HELL UP!' This game... is... in my opinion... SCARIER THAN AMNESIA. Amnesia is more of the psycological horror, and there are those zombie things, but it's just... unsettling. Penumbra, is that, PLUS a freaky a** dog that is HALF MAULED, AND creepy notes everywhere that say things like 'I came down here with four of my colleges and learned a few things...' then later it says '...and humans are tasty.' And you know what is next to that note? A big stain of blood... alright?... And two pairs of BLOODY BOOTS! NOT COOL MAN! And when you read this note, guess what you're hiding from? THE FREAKING DEMONIC HALF-EATEN DOG!! So yeah. Creepy atmosphere, freaky scary creatures, and it ACTUALLY managed to scary me. ME! I'M the one, who laughs at people when they say that Slender is scary. I'M the one, who reasons with people to say that Amnesia isn't very scary, but it's pretty startling. The devs knew what they were doing. The story is pretty good, too. The graphics... They're good for what they use it for, and for 2007, but it's really not that great, and I notice texture glitches everywhere. Bottom line is, if you like to get scared, this game is for YOU.

1028	1	a	TL;DR: Take the fun of Carmageddon, the viewing angle from GTA (the original ones) and strap weapons on your taxi and you're good to go on a quest to save the city.  In Zombie Driver (HD) you are some dude who drives a taxi. Military ('if they even are the military', says the random hippie) enlists you to save a bunch of civilians in a zombie infested city. Mow those zombies! Mayor will pay you a bonus for their smashed bodies! Gruesome, silly kind of humour is cultured in the overly dramatized monologues everyone else gets to give you when you meet them.  Zombie driving gets a lot more fun once they strap a machine gun to your car. Later, you'll get equipped with flamethrowers, rocket launchers and even experimental rail guns that shoot blue, helical rays of mass destruction. Not to forget, a tongue-in-cheek car game wouldn't be complete without a turbo booster. Between missions you get to upgrade your cars (new ones unlocked every few missions) and weapons.  There are no surprises in the zombie varieties: in addition to the regular, shambling corpses, there are legions of zombie dogs, wailing slingers of industrial junk, bloated monsters of the exploding variety and of course the hulk. Naturally, it is more difficult to ram the bigger ones and especially in large groups.  Story mode has two kinds of basic missions: 1) taxi missions: go and save people from buildings around the town (usually with generous time limits), and 2) slaughter missions: go somewhere and kill everything. Here,  everything  includes the zombie spawners (introduced by the HD version): enormous Jabba the Hut creatures that blurt out more of the monsters (it figures that these are not your average zombies after all). In addition, there are the awesome cleaning and destroying special missions where you get to drive e.g. tanks, with infinite ammo of course. HD version also has a couple of bosses that add nicely into the game's limited lore.  Story wasn't the strong part of the original Zombie Driver and it has only been patched partly by the HD upgrade. It ends abrubtly but rather appropriately although leaving your contribution vague: it is unfortunately never explained why the army (or whatever they are) needed a random taxi driver to sort their mess.  Two other game modes are more like what the game was designed for: there's the copy of Death Rally called Blood Race (though you can't destroy your opponents permanently) with several different tournaments and challenge missions. Unfortunately, career mode is missing. You'll get money for winning races and can then buy limited upgrades to your car. On the other hand, Slaughter mode is an endless killing spree of perpetually spawning zombies for higher points to show off in the leaderboards. Here only death ends the level.  Game is fun and pretty awesome. However, it is easy to get stuck in corners and sometimes it is not clear what items can be driven through resulting in further stuckiness. Mob spawning can be ruthless and illogical, especially in Slaughter mode: zombies tend not to walk as fast (or at all?) when you are not seeing them in front of you in the camera and the game considers it fair to spawn a group of exploding zombies right behind you when you are reversing.  Despite the few complaints, I can give it thumbs up. Graphics are nice, sounds are not irritating and gameplay is very nice (I used keyboard and mouse). Also, the improvements from the original Zombie Driver are very welcome: e.g. they made booster a separate item from weapons, added a map and made the story mode more interesting with the zombie spawners, bosses and special vehicles. If you have doubts but are interested, you can also grab it on sale for 2 euros or less.

I would suggest this game to anyone who likes horror games and amnesia definitely gets its gameplay style from this game.

394	0	a	I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said 'click this, put this here, someone dies', and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.

2618	0	a	This game is so buggy that even with DPfix you will run into trouble. Long load times, autosave doesn't work, crash when you enter a building (since autosave doesn't work if you did any side missions tough luck you have to do them again). The game crashed when I was gonna enter a critical mission building and I did some side missions before. The developers even acknoledged DPfix and said to install it rather than actually putting a patch themselves. And now they are on the front cause of Recently updated but they didn't update the game it's just on sale. Don't let these companies get away with lazy ports.

I've never seen a game like this with such a large amount of small annoying problems that all add up to one big disappointment. I was constantly shaking my head and squinting my eyes in disbelief at the stupid little ways in which they did most things that they could have done differently/better. It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great. Or actually probably not since it's vehicle combat meaning you only fire in one direction: forward. Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and â¥â¥â¥â¥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again. lol.  There are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail. The bottom line is that this is just not fun for long because of poor design concepts and new flaws popping up constantly as the game progresses.  5/10

1603	1	a	I like the Penumbra series a lot because the atmosphere in the first two games is always haunting and scary. Another good aspect are the several puzzles that keep you busy, so it's not hiding and running away all the time troughout the game. There were moments, where I seriously thought 'What the hell?!' and some dicisions you have to make in the game, make you feel really bad/sad. I started playing Penumbra: Overture, the prequel, with low expectations, but the story had me drawn under its magic spell right from the beginning. For a low budget game, this game truly stands out of the crowd, it really deserves more attention. I highly recommend trying the Penumbra series for yourself.

The best part about these games is the gameplay mechanics. The physics puzzles are great and even something as simple as opening a door is immensely satisfying and adds greatly to the realism and immersion into the creepy, frigid underground world. If you like the Amnesia games, get the original!

2711	0	a	Ok I'm done. I'm done trying to get this to work. For as ambitious of a game as Deadly Premonition is, this port completely ruins whatever might have been a good game. I spent almost 30 hours of my life dealing with crashes, glitches, and other glaring issues and even removing all of that from the picture the game still has its problems which makes it completely unforgivable.  If you have any interest in playing this game whatsoever I would recommend you try and find a way to play it on the original platform(s) (360/PS3) as the port is just awful. Even after applying the fan-recommended patches the game has a dice roll for every area you load as to whether it will crash the game. Loading times can vary from 15 seconds to 2 minutes depending on factors you cannot control. Without the graphics patch the entire experience is blurry and ungratifying.  Even after patching the game and overlooking most of the porting issues. DP has fundamental problems with the aiming system which is very camera-dependent and glitchy at best. Vehicular controls are equally shoddy and the mapping system is more of a hinderance than it is a boon. The profiling sections serve more to cram ridiculously obvious information in your face than to reveal anything new and the chapter review quizzes are basically an insult to the viewer's intelligence ('HEY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED 5 MINUTES AGO? HERE'S A QUIZ!!'). I really, _really_, tried to make this game work because it came off as highly recommended but the truth is it's just a mediocre silent hill clone with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ RE4 controls and a lamentable open-world system.   I'm going to spend the rest of my 'time' on this game watching a longplay just to see how the story ends. I recommend you do the same.

103	1	a	It's entertaining, short, adventure, puzzle quest game with many gruesome deaths, little bit of nudity and few plot twists.   Game is straight forward - there is only one way to kill each person and you must find all items to do it. Even with all quest items, it may take some time to understand what and where is required to do, but luckily there are guides for that.  Don't expect open world here - mansion and garden is all you can explore.  Graphics even on Ultra High left me unsatisfied. You may encounter some bugs, restarting chapter will fix that.  There are 2 endings. First is easy, 2nd takes some time to do it right, but will reward you with more satisfying ending, a la horror movies.   Don't expect too much, this is no AAA title, but good for indie developers. Buy it on sale and you won't regret it.  P.S. Don't let your kids play this.

It is neither difficulty nor nerve that prevents me from going forward in this game, it's dreading more of those unskippable cutscenes. I bought this game to play a devil child, not watch some cgi re-enactment of 'The Omen'
1647	1	a	This game does right where all the games that have been trying to copy the Amnesia formula do wrong. Granted that's probably because it's by the same devs who made Amnesia, before they made it, but still.  The atmosphere of the abandoned mine is absolutely fantastic, and combined with the music perfectly captures that feeling of being alone, and being watched. The puzzles are nice, you have to actually pay attention and think stuff out, and it doesn't delve into 'just spam every item in my inventory'. Another huge plus for me is the combat. Against more than one enemy you'll easily be overwhelmed, but if you get creative with your approach you stand a fair chance one-on-one, and it's a welcome change from the now-standard 'see monster, hide from monster, wait for monster to leave' approach horror games tend to use. Finally, the story, or more specifically, the main other character you interact with, is fantastically written, and if you get emotionally invested in your games like I do the twists near the end will hit you like a wrecking ball.
914	1	a	So I'm not one to play games with a linear storyline from beginning to end. But Lucius was one of those games, though could use some work, had me entertained throuhgout... I mean how often can you play the son of the devil and go around killing people?   I do recommend this game and even though it's not a huge game it's still very enjoyable.  I did a full playthrough of the game, just in case you get stuck at some points. Here's the first episode to taste what the game has in store for you.   https://youtu.be/yeizmSoOvsM

1129	1	a	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.

164	1	a	I got this game on sale a little while ago, and I had such a great time playing it. The game follows a strict storyline but allows you free reign of the house to explore. It does glitch at times, which can be frustrating, especially towards the end, but I would say that the gameplay itself makes up for that. The dark plot and graphic murders are definitely an enticing storyline, although I would say (without giving too much away) that the story seemed very rushed towards the end. But overall, a brilliant game, very enjoyable to play, would definitely recommend.

141	1	a	At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.  The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid 'Lucius'. Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.  Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.

Oh and botched controller support to put it bluntly it doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work!!!! so ignore the store page. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you rising star games you theiving â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, you might aswell have mugged me in the streets. Never buying any of your stuff again as i know it's a brand of lazy developers who can't be bothered to fix their own mess.

1799	1	a	I love this game. As someone who played Amnesia before Penumbra, it was nice to see the precursor to Amnesia. The controls are identical, the atmosphere is terrifying and it's quite fun to imagine yourself in the protagonist's place. The main thing I'm slightly iffy about is how the story starts off. The warning that is shown when you first open the game is vague, but it makes you want to know more.    Would play again and again and again.

2647	0	a	This game is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. It's nearly unplayable, even with the DPfix installed. It crashes randomly so I had to replay parts of my missions several times. That remains only fun for so long. After the crashes the game suffered from terrible slowdowns, most likely related to a memory leak. I can only take so much before I get frustrated and stop playing. Deadly Premonition is one of the few games I will never take a look at again. And that's disappointing, because I usually love mysterious stories and Resident Evil styled gameplay. But please note: the game is slow gameplay wise: with every door you open, every car you enter, everything you climb on the game will trigger an animation. Boring... And it removes you from the experience at the same time.   I can hardly recommend this because of the poor port, but as a game it's not all that terrible. Heck, it can sometimes even be enjoyable. Provided that it works...  [Rating: 65/100]
2150	1	a	A game that understands the player, and uses its entire design to promote both its understanding of player experience and atmosphere. Contests with The Stanley Parable in making player choice contextualized in a way that matters and acknowledges the player's motivation without compromising it, unlike many Triple-A titles that garner more praise. A truly amazing game, and one worth playing at any cost. If more games were like Deadly Premonition, the world would be a better place.   Unlike almost any game before it (with the exceptions of The Stanley Parable and Demon's Souls), Deadly Premonition understands the unique and powerful triad of Player, Character, and Narrator. At no point in the game is any of these functions invalidated.  Many users comment on how 'weird' the game is, or how the graphics are outdated or the controls clunky, and this is important. The game's major aesthetic is that exact cognitive function: It means to play like a PS2 game, look like a PS2 game, and even ape PS2 games. Secretly, though It does all of these things the best way possible: By actually constructing and improving upon the foundation it attempts to make fun of. Deadly Premonition is the unique and rare game that actually constructs on, as opposed to strictly deconstructs, what came before. You may hate the controls, and you may think the graphics are outdated, but if any of these things were changed its own aesthetic would clash with itself. These choices were deliberate, intelligent mirrors for the game's internal design and direction.  Deadly Premonition is surprisingly one of the most intelligent games I've ever played. No matter how strange, unexpected, or uncomfortable it might be it is a game that understands what games can do. It fully utilizes the medium, and for that, it deserves a perfect score.  10/10

Found the game can only be played at 720p, forced resolution, no way around that using the vanilla game software.  Tried DPFix to change that. All ini file parameters were WELL within what my PC and vidcard can handle, which, for this game isn't a heck of a lot. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Did the PhysX reinstall again. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Decided I'd already used up $2.49 worth of my time and uninstalled this piece of crap game.

1746	0	a	Penumbra Overrated. The atmosphere is great, the puzzles are ok and the enemies, plot, and stealth elements fall flat.   This is not a spooky game. The atmosphere builds it up to be, but disappointing enemies and trial and error game play takes all that away. Your enemies are guard dogs &amp; spiders, and very rarely a big worm thing, that's it. Some supernatural or especially fierce enemies could have added a lot of tension, but nope, just doggies. If you were dropped in the middle of the game with no explanation you would probably guess you were playing a poor wolfenstein clone.  Certain parts of the game are only possible to complete by reading a walkthrough ahead of time or by dying over and over until you determine the correct sequence of events (especially the rockworm at the end). This repeated trial and error type game play replaces any feelings of suspense with ones of frustration.  The plot starts off strong and mysterious, falls a bit flat in the middle and leaves with a confusing ending. This game had potential but at the end I was glad I had finished it just so that i can say i beat it and don't have to touch it again.

3026	0	a	Deadly Premonition sucks. Ultimately, it fails on all levels. The setup of the story is actually pretty good. It's obviously biting off Twin Peaks. A weirdo FBI agent is sent to investigate a murder with supernatural overtones in a small town filled with wacky characters. The obvious inspirations for the game play are Silent Hill and Resident Evil. There are parts where a location transforms into a twisted nightmare version of the place and its filled with monsters and the player has to make their way through the nightmare version of the location to find clues to help the investigation. So, the combat takes place really in the protagonists mind. The combat gets really repetitive and boring really quick. There's really just one type of enemy to fight for most of the game besides bosses. Later there's another type that's even more boring and repetitive to fight. Every location ends up being the same thing. To gather the necessary clues you gotta wade through a series of narrow corridors fighting the same boring enemies over and over again. The combat is really clunky too like a Resident Evil game. There is one interesting part of this, though. At some point the legendary supernatural killer of the story, The Raincoat Killer, will track you down and the screen splits so you can also see through the killers eyes and your own point of view simultaneously. You need to hide from him for a certain amount of time before he gives up and goes away. Usually, right after this section there will be a chase sequence that's kind of like an on-rails quick time event where you need to escape from The Raincoat Killer. These encounters were fun the first few times, but even these interesting parts get repetitive as they are used over and over again. So, the actual combat portion of this game is a big dud. There's also a lot of driving that needs to be done in this game. It is also no fun. The cars handle terribly and they can even run out of gas. This is supposed to be an open-world exploration adventure game, but the fuel tank keeps a leash on you so its an annoying concern that made me not want to even bother with exploring the environment. Really, all there is anyway is some random collectibles to find littered around and also some side quests. So, the driving portion is also not any fun. The PC version is a really bad port too. It crashes ALL the time. I lost several hours to stupid crashes that can and will strike at any time. There was even one cut scene that would guaranteed crash the game. I had to change the compatibility mode and some other options to get past this stupid bug. The game is originally capped at 30 fps and 720p. Ridiculous! The same guy that fixed this outrage for Dark Souls did a fix for Deadly Premonition too, but like the DS one, it seems like it just plain wears off after a while and the game reverts back to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics and frame rate. I had to re-start the final boss because the game was running so horribly it wouldn't even register inputs from the controller. One thing I did find at least amusing is that if you don't have your clothes cleaned every so often, flies will start buzzing around your character because of your stinky clothes. I got a chuckle of watching cut scenes where these big fat (white?) flies were swarming around this guy. Now to the story. The setup is intriguing. There's a serial killer on the loose which brings the FBI to the small town and while there, more people get murdered. I was hooked on the setup. However, once the story starts to explain what's going on and who is behind everything the story just falls completely apart. It's just plain â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's like a ten year old's idea of a murder mystery. It's unbelievably bad. It's so dumb! I'm shocked and baffled that this story isn't completely ripped apart by everyone that has reviewed this absurd game. This game is also not scary, AT ALL. It fails in that department too. On the technical, atmosphere, narrative, and game play levels this game fails across the board and I definitely recommend you avoid this game.
2000	1	a	This is Amnesia's big daddy. Without this, it probably woudn't have happened (well, later). Some people like this more than Amnesia: The Dark Descent because of the story alone. But some people don't like (since the metascore is 73/100) because some people believe that the enemies encountered and how you can actually combat them back are... not good enough? Pretty bad reason to hate this game.  Buy it. Don't care about the other's opinions, try for yourself and see it is worth. Awesome atmosphere and experience.

The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
948	1	a	Ready to play the Omen, I mean, Lucius? Learn powers that you'll literally never use until you're told to and kill people in so many limited ways! Thinking of a creative way to pick off the maid? Well stop that right now! You've got to do it step by cryptic step. Half the time you won't know what you're looking at/for!  Ready to be sucked into an in depth world filled with emmersive characters? What are you doing here? There's none of that! You have an uncle and more than one maid! If you say you knew you had an uncle before chapter seven you're clearly lying.  Who can forget such amazing dioluge like 'Now Lucius don't forget to brush your teeth. Don't make me tell you again.' And 'Now Lucius don't forget to brush your teeth. Don't make me tell you again.' Your mother won't say anything else to you so you better brush those teeth (teeth brushing optional)  11/10 would walk in on uncle again.
2136	0	a	Ostensibly an old-school RPG, but it was too old-school for me (and I played Ultima III when it came out).
1873	1	a	While the first half of the game is extremely scary, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. I think that imagining what was going on in the game was much better than the actual reveal.  That said, this is a fantastic game. The atmosphere really draws you in and gives a sense of being alone in the dark. The level progression layouts are well-designed, allowing you to visit the same areas multiple without it feeling repetitive. The enemies are tough without being impossible and some of the puzzles are real dome-scratchers. The weapons system is neat but has one drawback- each attack is super slow and it's easy to get killed by an enemy because you couldn't swing your weapon in time.   For people who don't want to go head to head with them, there are also multiple ways to incapacititate or evade enemies. Much of the game is stealth-based, making the creepy, ominous atmosphere even more tense. You never know if you're about to walk straight into something that wants to kill you- and will.  The story was interesting, remaining a complete mystery until almost the very end of the game. The story setup was brief without being rushed, allowing you to get right to playing with a million questions you want answered already.  Great horror FPS, runs great on older laptops with integrated graphics, great voice-over acting, great game. For an especially sweet deal, buy this game during a steam sale for about $5. You won't be disappointed.

759	0	a	Okay, well, I wanted to play this game to have fun, but all it was is a linear omen rip-off with stiff stereotypical characters and voice acting that did not match the characters blank expressions and stiff body language. I have play indie games where the characters were more life-like than this and offered more gameplay. I don't see how you really can just go on a demonic killing spree. You have to do things in order and kill people in order. You can shoot people, it might get you caught, but at least it might count towards the acheivment. You're limited of how and when to use your 'demonic powers'. It would have been nice for the game to have been environmentally interactive other than the mission ojective items so as the player break glass, create disturbances, and just cause mental havoc.  I got this game on sale with a bunch of other games. After playing this game myself, it's not worth the $20 it's currently being sold for and find it's ridiculous. If one must get this game I suggest waiting for a big sale, maybe one that knocks it down to $7 or less, preferable $4. Good luck!  Note: I came across this site while looking at the news page for Lucius. Even though it's a review for Lucius II, it may help alot on describing the game as based on someone else's experience much like my own and the expectations of the game and what was really delivered: From RockPaperShotgun  http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/17/impressions-lucius-ii/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rockpapershotgun%2Fsteam+%28Rock%2C+Paper%2C+Shotgun%3A+Steam+RSS%29   NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.

Story is pretty good and interesting, event with really weird ending (at least the action one, the puzzle one is a much better). Graphics is nice with solid performance optimization. The problems of this game are the bugs... many bugs. Many times I was stuck behind some stuff and I could get out from there, once I even somehow fall out by the texture to the outdoors and could not go back to the mansion. Also the game is loading too long always and when you encounter a bug you have to load the game over and over again (at least I've encountered critical bug when I had to load the game again only about 3 times). Game is also pretty short, it took me only 7.6 hours to get 56/58 achievements and now to get the rest of them I have to be ingame for 40 hours total... Like WTH, it is not even counting to be in menu, so I could just let the game running and doing something else and now I have to add another monitor to have the possibility to do something else if I want that achievements.  But despite the game having some negatives, I still recommend this game. 7/10

It's can challenge the worst ports like DMC3 or original RE4 release and effin' win hands down. I'm not kidding. And you know, xbox and ps3 versions weren't really more of a better game. No, I'm not talking about story writer - the story is actually interesting, the Twin Peaks atmosphere mixed with Silent Hill in open-world detective horror with a whole lot of WTF moments. But you'll get r*ped with a baseball bat for it. Go on, you've been warned.

Try swinging a hammer...Come on, was this made so clunky on purpose? If so, then it's a lame way of making the game harder. AVOID unless you are some kind of a masochist and like reloading because a bloody basic thing like using a hammer makes you wnat to pull your hair out. The story seems so interesting, but the way controlling your character is made is just totally unacceptable.

1643	1	a	Just finished this game again after all these years; since I first played it... And it's my first game to critic on this blog: Almost forgot how a survival-horror felt!   Penumbra: Overture is a stealth-based game with some horror and puzzle elements. The creepy atmosphere's well done with other elements like stealth mechanics and combat system. The game is linear (thanks to god), it sticks with its teasing story, makes you feel like a detective, an escape artist and a very vulnerable person (this last factor distinguishes you from being Bruce Wayne lol).    Game's short critic may be like these:  Graphics: 5/10 Sounds: 8/10 Story: Nice  Atmosphere: Gives chills My Playtime: Approx. 5 Hours   CONCLUSION: The game offered us something new, a unique trial practice and it came out well done. My note for it: 7/10  P.S. I'd suggest you to buy these as a pack and please play it according to chronical order like: 1. Penumbra: Overture 2. Penumbra: Black Plague 3. Penumbra: Requiem  Have fear and good luck!

1742	0	a	Penumbra series are quite good games in general. THey are a bit old but the story and adventure part of it is done quite well and is engrossing to a degree. The puzzles and quest are quite well done though a little illogical at times and can be monotonous, but overall they get you thinking.  The horror side is mehhhhh! The game is predominantly in the dark and the creatures are from a B grade horror from the 50's but it does set the mood at times, especially with the audio effects etc. The graphics are very ordinary compared to modern capabilities but for the time they were okay. The AI of the dogs etc is appalling and quite comical but again its primarily due to the era of the game. The part that kills al these penumbra games is the controls. Its beyond bad. They tried to be clever and realistic by making the use grab item and swing in an arc to open boxes and doors, or try to line up items using the mouse but overall kill the game.  You cant actually line any thing up so when trying to smash one of these crazy wandering brain dead dogs you end up doing the cha cha and relying on pot luck. Luckily as stated the AI is near non existant so simply get on a box etc and just swing and mash buttons and eventually the job will get done. Its a pity really because I was getting into the game itself but it just gets frustrating and unplayable. It would be great if they ever revamped the series as it has the making of a good game, but unfortunately I think this game is long forgotten. If u can pick it up cheap and have the patience of a saint when coming to control etc then I'd say you could do a lot worse. If its a action adventure your looking for then give this a wide birth! Steam should put a star system as I'd give this game 2 to 2 and half stars out of 5, but can not recommend for most people.

919	1	a	Recommended, if it's on sale or bundled (and if you haven't watched a 'tuber play through it first as there won't be any more surprises for you.)  As others have said, it's just linear progression with only one solution for every stage, like an older point and click adventure, While it was fun enough on first playthrough, some parts of the game seem to hold your hand only to then suddenly push you down the stairs. Though only once did I have to check a walkthrough thinking the game had bugged. (It hadn't. An item was easily missed.)  You're offered three profiles when launching the game. I played through once, unlocking every stage (all in one location, a mansion) while paying no mind to inventory items. Started fresh using the second one after learning once you acquire a certain weapon early then complete the level, it will stay in your inventory for the subsequent ones. This is where I got most of my enjoyment from, failing over and over again because I found it simply hilarious to murder every NPC. This would sometimes cause ragdoll bugs for them that were almost as terrifying as the in-game death sequences. Several death scenes left me aghast as they're fairly well done and I hadn't seen footage beforehand.  I stopped playing just before the 20-hour achievement as it'll give me a bit more incentive to play again in the future. Earning the 40-hour 'chieve w/o cheating it is right out. With the Lucius de-make coming, some people might take another look at this game and I felt it warranted a bit of warning. If you have fun with that game, it might be best to leave it at that as the story and puzzles look to be truly identical. At least low-end PC users will get a chance to play now. I'm hesitant about purchasing said 'demake,' hoping the devs use that potential income to fix Lucius II, a game I'll never finish in its current state because I'm not into masochism. That said, I still hope to see more offerings from Shiver Games and (besides mocap and audio,) their staff of three.

532	1	a	this was a great game, some parts were a little challenging but thats what makes it fun, it also has a great story
2986	0	a	It's an incredible game, it's simultaneously terrible and amazing (beyond 'so bad it's good', you're going to have to take my word for it) making for one of the most unique, confusing, hilarious, and quotable gaming experiences ever to grace the face of the universe.  So why not recommended, you might ask? The port. Japan is notorious for their terrible PC ports, but this one reaches an all time low, it really is that bad. If you pick this up prepare to be greeted with such lovely features such as:  720p resolution lock (Can be fixed by DPFix)   15fps, but only half the time you start the game. Also note it's still running at 60 (evident by some of the camera movement and the pause menu, but the timing is messed up for everything else).   Bad controller support. This game was originally a XBox 360 game, which makes the dev's choice of DirectInput over XInput make even less sense. Editing controller binding happens in the launcher and is extremely limited &amp; finicky (DPFix does give you a few more options through ini files).   Random crashes, the game tends to crash randomly due to memory leaks or just bugs in the game code. There's some ways to lessen the effect but no way to get rid of all of them.   Not so random crashes, some parts of the the game just outright crash and you have to do all sorts of stuff to try to work around them (such as running in compatibility mode for Win98, or rebooting your PC), but even that's not as bad as   Save file corruption, save files can easily become corrupted, causing the game to crash soon after load, and usually in the same spots. Sometimes the only work around is to delete your save and start again. Save often and backup saves often.   It's a great game but it's just not worth the money they're asking for considering the state of the port, however if it goes really cheap it might be worth the gamble if you can make the port bearable. If you are a XB360 or PS3 owner then I highly recommended you pick it up for one of those if you can find it cheap (might need to import the PS3 version however). If you just want your dose of SWERY then I suggest you go and pick up D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, which is cheaper and has a good PC port (Unreal Engine 3).

1470	1	a	I just gave Overture a negative recommendation due to the comparison with this game, which I feel is a huge improvement, and so I thought I should come and rate this one positively to reflect that comparison. In my opinion this game provides everything Overture has to offer and more. Even the story of the first game was explained in this one, making it complete on its own even without playing Overture.  The story and characters are great, and the game wouldn't be what it is without them. It's definitely scary and both the scare factor and story compliment one another greatly. The puzzles are a nice addition, especially when also combined with the other two aspects. Definitely recommended.

1530	1	a	Before Amnesia there was Penumbra.  Even though it was Frictional's first foray into game development, the team showed their almost perfect understanding of what makes a game frightening. Just like its younger brother Amnesia, Penumbra succeeds at making you afraid of the dark all over again with creepy atmosphere and that feeling of dread that hangs over you as you desperately fumble your way through darkness.  If you enjoy survival horror -- and if you enjoyed Amnesia -- then turn out all the lights and prepare yourself for Penumbra.  Don't forget to lock your door...

1448	1	a	This horror game is one of the three games there are in the Penumbra Series that I think is the best of all of them. In the first game, Penumbra: Overture, you set to find your father in hopes that he's still alive. Clues lead you to an abandoned mineshaft that is crawling with monsters, but you make a friend down in the mines, Red.   SPOILER PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PENUMBRA: OVERTURE!     Red dies.     After you leave the mineshaft, you were struck by a monster when entering a shady looking corridor, that event then leads to Penumbra: Black Plague.  Penumbra: Black Plague takes place in the Archaic Elevated Caste, a complex built deep underground connected with the mine to aid in archaeological research. Researchers have found a virus that wiped out the whole caste, except for  Amabel Swanson.    ( I don't want to talk anymore about the games because I think I will spoil the rest, so you'll have to play for yourself. I extremely recommend this series if you are into horror games, and or the Amnesia series as it's made by the same developers. )

1606	1	a	Black Plague is the sequel to Overture where the story continues. Everything is pretty much the same as the previous game. Some slight improvements on puzzles. By improvement I mean slightly harder puzzles. Sounds and atmosphere still take you to the thrill factor. The main storyline unfolds here in the end. However, for me, felt like I was left hanging.   Same negative comments as before, AI are pretty lame and weapon handling still sucks the same.   Game definitely deserves to be played if you played the first installment.
1593	1	a	Love both black plague and overture, Requiem is like it but shorter without any enemies, considering how little your paying for all of this i see no reason to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about requiem. Playing them in order and in one sitting is the best way to do it, turn off the lights and enjoy. Should take 10-12 hours for all of them.

Give it a miss or pick it up on console (never thought I would have ever heard myself say that).I really wish |Valve would clamp down on games like this as it's not my first time being left with a lemon due to what is possibly one of the worst pc ports (not forgetting Arkham Knight but at least that you can play for more than 15 minutes at a time)...  This game and many like it should be removed from the store, forcing the developers to realease a functioning product.I'm a huge fan of games like this and it pains me to review it in such a negative manner.  My specs are fine i7 3770k and a gtx 980 is overkill,so it's not my hardware holding me back..Fresh install of win 10 so its not that either.The game is just a terrible port,which is a real shame...

'Bought this game when it was on sale and I would buy the game if it wasn't. The Story and Gameplay kept me playing alone.  If you enjoy playing a dark twisted 6 year old demon child, that go around killing residents of the Mansion you call home in the sometimes sick and gorey ways a demon child can kill you.   Story isn't majorly long about 6 hours, well thats how long it took me. On each of the chapters of the game you kill someone but you have to go on a hunt to find certain items or objects to set them up to look like a accident and not a young speachless boy.  And for more creepy is unlocking the bicycle and go riding around from room to room like its a scene out of a Stanley Kubrick horror movie.

1921	1	a	The Penumbra series, created by four men from Frictional Games, and stands somewhere in the top ten of my favorite games.  The game starts off with you looking for your father, but you get lost in the frozen tundra and end up in the mine. Everything seems normal at first, just an old abandoned mine you thought? You're dead wrong. After exploring for alittle bit, you begin to feel safe, thinking nothing is in the mine, thats when it strikes when you're least expecting it. First the hounds, then the spiders, soon the worm will be coming after you as you make your way deeper and deeper into the mines, unlocking the secrets of what happened here.  You'll stumble across a radio, and a man named Red will become your light in the darkness, and guide you through the tunnels and mazes of what once was a military facility.  Even though the controls for combat are frustrating, you have a better chance at attempting to sneak past the enemies of the game. For that, I give it a  9/10
1635	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is arguably a prime example to the tired idea of 'It's not how much time, but it's what you do with it.' Throughout the 4 or so hours I took on this first playthrough, I experienced genuine fear as I crawled through the dusty abandoned mine that would set the stage for most of Philip's first chapter. It's not a stretch to call Penumbra: Overture a terrifying game. More terrifying than Amnesia: The Dark Descent and more on the level of Alien: Isolation, Penumbra: Overture makes you dread turning every corner for fear of a flesh-eating dog or deadly spider. The atmosphere is amplified by the well-told story and excellent sound design (especially the soundtrack). The gameplay is also done really well, aside from the half-baked combat system and few difficult moments (like the first spider cave). I will be coming back to Penmubra: Overture for years, but the atmosphere, story, and sound truly sell the game. It may be 5-6 hours long (maybe more depending on how you play), but it's a well spent time.
2224	1	a	Even with crashing during important cutscenes, crashing during gameplay, crashing when opening doors, and an altered color palette, it's still Deadly Premonition at it's core, and when you reach that core, with that sweet, sweet, beautiful nectar of Deadly Premonition, you will love it. Right before crashing and doing it again. So says Mr. Stewart.
3661	1	a	 Early Access Review
728	1	a	Decent gameplay and an interesting storyline, but vague puzzles, abilities being a bit confusing, and bad graphics bring the game down. 7/10. Still worth a try.  Gameplay: The gameplay worked out well and fit the game's theme. You had to pick up things and use powers while appearing to be a normal non suspicious child. If someone saw you with a gun, or psychically moving things around, you'd lose the level and have to start over. There were also side quests (or chores) you could do to get extra rewards to help you solve the levels. A weegie board to give riddle tips, a music box that gave limited use to see useful items around, but the last was a tricycle which was akward to maneuver through the halls and wasn't really worth getting.  Storyline: The storyline is well written and you can see bits of it happening while you walk around mid level. The characters all talk to you and will make comments about what all is happening which helped to expand the story. Add onto it the narrator explaining what all he saw going on and the connections he made after all was said and done being excellent really made the game worth while.  Puzzles: Not really sure they are puzzles, but the levels had you do a series of tasks you had to figure out to get someone killed. The first few levels were easy enough to figure out how to do them, the narrator explaining that something was learned from that death that was important for you to use during it. The later levels became overly vague on what you were doing, one of the levels being explained with 'She is doing laundry.' If you followed her around, she walked between a few places but you had to break something on the other side of the room to be able to kill her.  Abilities: As the game progresses, you get new powers. These powers level up as you get kills. There is no choice on what ability you level, nor is there an explanation of what these levels do. As far as I could tell, it was tracking progress through the game more than anything. To make things a little more complicated, some levels would start off with a tutorial on how to use an ability, then the level would prevent you from using it. The last ability even being removed from your ability choices after you get it. Though this was oddly done, each ability did get use at some point.  Graphics: Blocky and weird. I don't mind blocky graphics, aslong as I can tell what everything is, but a character would pick up an item in a video sequence and the object would move seperately from their hand. A little bit of effort would be appreciated in that, if it was part of gameplay and the other characters moved things around I could understand, but it was a predone video.   I had to look up walkthroughs for a few levels which frustrated me that the levels were too vague, but that could just be me. The graphics were still irelivant to my enjoyment and the abilities were easy enough to figure out the limits on my own.

3007	0	a	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.

2378	1	a	If there was a reward for Controls Worse than a Car with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for Wheels, then this game would have a shelf dedicated to it. Seriously invest in a controller for this game. The game at its base is bad. Like, really bad. There's a major issue with the game that prevents it from even launching 90% of the time and the game is stuck in a windowed view with no way to change it. There aren't even any graphical settings that you can change.  That aside, the game is still enjoyable. It's one of those gems that's so bad it's good.  Also, here's a link to a mod that lets you change the graphical settings, window view bs, and fix most if not all launch failure issues:  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438

2630	0	a	This is a tough thing for me to do, given that Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games I've ever played, but I can't honestly recommend playing this version of the game. I first played Deadly Premonition on the Xbox 360, and that version had its issues, of course, but it at least functioned out of the box. I installed the latest version of DPfix (0.9.5 as of this writing), and that helped, but it didn't fix the constant runtime errors that would pop up during gameplay, causing the game to stop functioning. Usually they'd pop up after an hour or so of gameplay, but sometimes later (if I was lucky), or sometimes much sooner (if I was unlucky).  Even if this version wasn't completely unstable, I still wouldn't recommend playing this over the 360 version. While this is the 'Director's Cut', the story by and large is exactly the same, with the exception of a few added cutscenes at the beginning/end of each episode. The storyline is perfectly capable of standing on its own without these added scenes, so playing this version of the game just for them (especially if you've played the original game before) is not worth it. If one really wanted to see them, I'd recommend viewing them on a video site, rather than playing through this version for the sake of seeing them.  There are some other things regarding the game design that have been changed; most notably the controls. The original game featured Resident Evil 4-style movement, in that moving up or down would move your character forward or backward, while moving left or right would turn your character in those directions; camera remaining behind your shoulder the whole time. There were also some parts of the game (very few; only a small handful) where the normally over-the-shoulder camera would switch to a completely different angle, again reminiscent of Resident Evil (in this case, the classic horror-style games). One complaint the original game did receive had to do with these controls, so in the Director's Cut you can instead move in any direction, while moving the camera completely independently of your character. As far as basic maneuverability is concerned, this is an improvement, though I would argue it's not really necessary, as the original game's movement controls were just fine, if not entirely self-explanatory. The aiming and shooting mechanics are virtually untouched in the Director's Cut, aside from moving aiming control to the right analog stick (if you're playing with a controller). You still have to stand in place to aim and shoot, so this aspect of the controls remains faithful to the original. Whether you consider that a drawback or not will depend on your preferences.  While general movement is improved by the new controls, I think keeping full control of the camera during every moment of gameplay was a bad change to make. This is most apparent in one of the side quests, in which you push boxes around a maze. This puzzle-like gameplay was shown from an overhead view in the original game, but here in the Director's Cut, the camera is moved closer to your character, as if you were in a normal area. This makes trying to solve this block puzzle unnecessarily much harder to do, as you can no longer see the entire playing field; thus making it much more likely that one will make a mistake, and thus have to restart the block puzzle from the beginning. This was much less of a hassle to complete in the original game. There are also some other scenes which originally had fixed-camera perspectives, yet now don't. These other scenes' original perspectives aren't nearly as important as the block puzzle's, but this was still a change that added nothing to the game.  This is a relatively minor change, but the green tint the original game had was removed in this version. This doesn't really affect the game that much; the graphics are mostly identical otherwise, and if you've never played the original game, you won't find yourself missing it. I personally miss the green tint, as I felt it helped add to the atmosphere, but I wouldn't consider its removal a deal-breaker on its own. The only other significant addition to the game is some bonus features, such as alternate outfits for certain characters to wear, as well as a house in town for the main character to rest at. This, again, is unnecessary, and the fact that time and effort was spent on frivolous things such as this, as opposed to fixing any of the graphical deficiencies in the game, or refining the level and quest designs, or even fixing some translation errors in the text or bugs that the original game had, is disappointing. The original Deadly Premonition was a pretty unpolished, buggy game, and this retains all of the bugs that version had, while introducing several new ones of its own. Over three years passed between the release of the original game, and the release of the Director's Cut on the PS3, followed soon after by this PC port. Were the developers really not able to fix any of these problems during all this time; not even the grammatical/spelling errors that are prevalent throughout the game's text?  It hurts me to write this, because at its core Deadly Premonition is a game I truly care about. Its story (which I won't go into detail about at all, as it's one that should ideally be experienced with as few spoilers as possible) is incredibly compelling and well-written, managing to mix multiple themes and moods in a way that fits well together; after my first time beating the original game, I found myself reflecting on the game's events and characters time and time again. Every character in this game is incredibly memorable, and the majority of the work by the game's voice actors is very well done. The actual gameplay itself... has its ups and downs. The game's world is very interesting and has a number of secrets to be found, as well as multiple unique characters who maintain their own schedules and lives as the game progresses, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sidequests are mostly good, and stand out from each other pretty well, while at times giving essential rewards for completing them.  The game's combat is often derided, which is understandable. Most of the combat areas in the game are terribly designed, being repetitive, dull, and often way too long for their own good. It's as if the developers spent most of their time on the main storyline and sidequests, and rushed to include some combat areas at the last minute, having absolutely no time to playtest them. As with many other things, none of this is changed in the Director's Cut; if you hated the combat in the original game, that's still an issue here. All I can recommend to deal with it is doing certain sidequests as soon as possible, and using their rewards to help make the combat less tedious.  To sum things up, Deadly Premonition is a very unique, memorable experience; one that as of now, I feel is best had on the Xbox 360. If Deadly Premonition seems like a game you really want to experience, and you have a 360, I recommend searching out a used copy of that version instead, and afterward (if you feel like it) watching the extra cutscenes online. If you have a PS3... I haven't played that version myself, but from what I have read online it at least doesn't crash after every hour of play. If neither of these platforms are available to you, and you absolutely have to play this game, well... then you might want to take a chance on this PC version; preferably during a sale. Remember to download the latest version of Durante's DPfix prior to playing, and make sure to save as much as possible, lest you lose your recent progress due to a crash. Also back up your saves often; fortunately they're easily accessible in their own folder inside the game's files. While it didn't happen to me, thankfully, I have read about instances where other players' save data was corrupted, forcing them to start over. With that in mind, enjoy at your own risk.

1406	0	a	When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.  High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.

2805	0	a	Honestly this game is Terrible, it's a stark reminder of the bad side PS2 era, it looks like a bad PS2 game it playes like a bad PS2 game. Just a reminder this is a 2010 release and LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM 2003. The facial animation for each character is just so horribly done its a joke. The developer thought it would be fun to lock the resolution so its stuck in 720p, had to go and install a 3rd party fix just to get it to run properly in the correct resolution. Then when it does get going it crashes every 15 mins, or freezes on the pause menu requiring you to restart your progress from the last save point which are few and far in between out in the town. Lets talk a moment abou the HORRIBLE town design, I finished a story mission to be told that I have more then 12 hours til the next mission, so does the game give you some directions on where to go to sleep/pass time? NO, it gives you a marker to that mission and keeps telling you to come back, so in order to get to the mission I have to drive half way across town to the only sleeping bag not behind locked doors over half my cars gas. Oh did I forget to mention that? Cars have gas, so if you didnt do what I did after about an hour of searching for the sleeping bag and look it up online, you'll run out of gas and be screwed. The Enemies are a complete joke they are ALL 'ghosts' that do nothing but bend over backwards like a haunted yoga instructer, never actually doing much besides walking slower than the earth turns towards you. They do get weapons but then all the do is just hold them up to thier faces and again never actually do anything. All in all dont waste your time, the game is terrible, the plot works mostly but the game is so horrible broken and terrible that you'll never want to get past the second case with out uninstalling it. 1/10
2661	0	a	When I played for the first time Dark Souls, I thought 'Well, that's the Worst Port In History, I'll never find something like this again'   I was wrong.   Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is even worse, locked at 720p, tons of crashes, control system oh...  Anyway, the plot is really nice and the location is cool too.   I recommend this game only if bought in a bundle.
2409	1	a	It's so bad that it's pretty good.  Beware though, pc port is not too good. The controls work out fine, but getting it to run at times can be a pain. It can be worked around though.  I rarely had some cutscenes (about 2) crash the game, this is extremely annoying, but again, it can be worked around.  I really enjoyed the game at first, until around like episode 4 it starts dragging out and becomes very repetetive. There is a lack of enemy variety, (only about 3)

2872	0	a	I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need. The cars drive like busses and topple over at relatively slow speed, NPC's aren't where they're supposed to be, some of the internal buildings have bad graphics - 'daylight' streaming in from windows is green. In my view, this game shouldn't have been released with so many bugs, is a waste of money and impossible to play due to constant crashing. Don't buy it and get the Xbox version instead.

278	1	a	Story: To start off, you're Lucius, the son of Lucifer. You're born in a rich family and only found out the truth about your true origin when you turn 6. Throughout the game, you murdered members of your household with several interesting methods to gain more powers, such as Telekinesis, where you can move objects or tinker with certain machinery with your mind.   Personally, I felt that the story is very interesting as most games that we play usually put us in the shoes of a 'I want to save the world and protect my friends' kinda protagonist. However in this game, we play the 'fk u, fk u, and fk u' kinda guy, where you simply don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the fact that you're just a 6 year old plotting to murder your entire household.   Gameplay: Similar to most sandbox games in areas such as where you can go around the manor and break stuff, explore around, talk to people, cycle around in the tricycle that was given for being a little good boy, but with a very huge difference. You can only kill someone in a set particular way. There's no other way around it. Nevertheless, it is still very interesting to witness the several different ways the game wants you to witness for the murder of each member of the household. However, due to the fact that you can only kill someone a certain way, the events and objects that you have to trigger or obtain can sometimes be fustrating to figure out yourself without looking at guides.   Achievements: All the achievements in the game are pretty easy to get. You simply have to look at guides while playing the game to make sure that you do not miss any, otherwise you have to replay the chapter that gives that achievement. However, if you want to achieve every single achievement from this game, I felt that it is pointless to try due to the fact that the last 2 achievements requires you to play 20 hours and 40 hours respectively. As mentioned before, the game only allows you to kill someone in a certain way. There's no flexibility in the amount of ways that you can kill someone, thus not giving any fun out of replaying the game again so that you can kill someone using another method. To add on, you can complete the game in 7 hours and you cannot afk in the game to achieve those 2 achievements. You would have to be 'playing' by moving around, and only that will make the game record the hours that you have played.   Graphics: Watching the gameplay of this game on platforms such as YouTube or twitch may cause some people to think that the game requires a very good graphic card to play, I have a NVIDIA NVS 5200M graphic card, which only allow me to run the game on low settings, but it still looks really good and it runs with a very decent fps of more than 60. It is still a plus if you have a good graphic card to play it on a higher setting though.  Price: Is it worth buying the game at full price? Well, $10.50 to entertain youself for more than 7 hours on average sounds pretty decent in my opinion. My call? Yes, buy it regardless whether it is on sale or not.

2772	0	a	I really tried to like this, but simply couldn't.  Not long after I finished binge watching Twin Peaks, I felt like the need to revisit the experience and Deadly Premonition seemed like it would be just that. A weird detective game set in a mysterious mountain town filled with quirky characters. Heck, even the female lead looked like Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr?).   There were countless reviews stating how terrible the game was, but no amount of bad reviews could've stopped me from buying this game. Man, oh, man were they right. The game's simply unplayable. And not simply because it's a bad port. It's a small game overextended to a massive open world with terrible writing and the worst soundtrack of all time. I played it for less than 2 hours and had heard the whistling theme song at least 10 times, so I tried playing it with the sound muted. Didn't help.  I really tried to like this game, but it's not just so weird it's good. It's so weird it's bad and not in a Twin Peaks way.  If you're looking for a twin peaks-esque game, try Fahrenheit (also abysmally terrible writing, but atleast I managed to finish it).  Sadly, not recommended. Not until I get myself to finish the game.

863	1	a	I was very supprised with this game. After finishing this game I look back and realize there are three things that makes this a game i can recommend. 1. The house is a character, the house has alot of detail and is layed out in a manner that makes it fun to traverse. 2. Not sure if it is intentional, but its like a bad horror movie you get to play. Some of the sappy things that you would see happen in 80's horror movies, make this game fun. 3. This game would be a complete disaster if it didn't control good, but the controls work great and make alot of sense, and the parts that are not that great make for fun to master like the telekenisis. If you can get this on a sale it makes it even better, but if not I would still recommend this game a purchase.

But despite it all this is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.   If you like a good story and enjoy well written characters then you won't want to put this cult classic down for a second. Don't forget to use DPFix!

2157	1	a	Got it when it was dirt cheap, and I do nÃ³t regret it. The whole story kind of has a twin peaks crazy vibe. That's what makes it so wonderful. Somehow it's a bit of a mix of fighting off zombies and investigating. It's really a great game, if you can ignore the awfully terrible port and the bugs.   Would've been worth the full price if it worked a lot better.  Right now it's kind of bad, no proper resolutions, sound is all over the place, and had to use compatability mode to prevent the game from crashing at startup. So there's a risk you might not get the game to work properly. There are a few mods and fixes around on the net tho.

2533	1	a	This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those 'gameplay is king' people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.

I dont care how good, how unique, how interesting a game may be, when its such an incredible hassle to get the thing working, and then, to have it stay working long enough for you to actually play it, its just not worth the price or the time, i wouldnt accept this â¥â¥â¥â¥ from an early access game, let alone a full price retail release (i bought it in a sale, and still think its a waste), it just shows incredibly sloppy work, and arrogance on the devs part, to expect people to pay for a game which they couldnt even make playable unless you fix it yourself (or durante fixes it for you).  Long story short, your better off not wasting your money or time on a game that takes blind luck for it to even work for you with or without the community fixes.

1000	1	a	Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto. Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.  Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over Â£2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.  In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best 'indie' game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.   Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.  Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.  Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.  Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.  Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.   I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.  Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.  If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.   ***EDIT***  Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.

2768	0	a	Cons: Obviously an awful port of a console game to PC. Terrible keyboard control. Sections of menu are unnavigable (options constantly scroll as if DOWN key is depressed). Terrible graphics/visuals. Trope: Game opens with murdered, naked woman. Trope: Creepy twin children. Trope: Awful voice acting and awful dialogue.  Pros: * Something vaguely like Twin Peaks in the theme (at least of the first 10 minutes). That's a far as I could stomach the cons above before quitting and uninstalling. * Game only cost $0.05 in my humble bundle purchase (all other funds went to other games in bundle).

1528	1	a	Penumbra: Overture's story and style were wonderful, but being able to just beat most of the monsters to death greatly undermined the horror element. The developer listened to complaints, however (which is something I wish the bigger companies would do) and produced Black Plague, which single-handedly fixes all the major problems with the original while continuing the intriguing story that I loved so much before. No longer can you expect to fight your way out of a tight spot, so your only options are stealth and pegging it. As a result, the atmosphere can get RIDICULOUSLY intense and your opportunities to relax become increasingly few later on.  It's not quite the masterpiece of bone-shaking terror that Amnesia would become, but it's still bloody petrifying and easily worth looking into, particularly if you've already suffered through Amnesia and fancy even more abuse.

2348	1	a	Possibly the only game where I feel the need to watch every movie mentioned by a single character.  
2785	0	a	I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is. No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually. Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues. The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch. This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently. If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play. I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene. This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again. Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying. I think the story is very intriguing. The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm. I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand. I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.
1576	1	a	Such a good sequel it made me scream. Twice.
2572	1	a	At the technical level, this thing is a travesty, frequent crashes, barebones gameplay that barely functions, visuals that seem to belong on the PS2, a lot of segments that seem to be pretty much filler, and at times the situations make so little sense that it would normally kill all suspension of disbelief, and yet I can't help but love the game, it might sound strange but the game has charm out the â¥â¥â¥, quirky likable characters, a plot that is mostly interesting, even if it times shoots itself in the foot occasionally. But the quirky characters, sheer ambition, attention to small details, and town that in some regards feels more alive than the cities in your typical Open Sandbox game make the game an experience unlike any other, though the original Xbox 360 version might be the best one from what I can gather.
1229	0	a	I had really high expectations for this game because of its awesome ideas and sweet trailer. I was sadly disappointed.  The game seems to be a cheap port of a mobile game, with car handling very suited for tilt controls, or at least a gamepad, but certainly not a keyboard. The gameplay is dull, and early on too difficult. The voice acted cutscenes seem too long and there is no way to skip them, forcing you to endure their pain.  Overall, do not buy this game on Steam. Even at 50% or 75% off, it is a rip off. It's probably on some sort of app store somewhere, go buy it there.

2691	0	a	Controller and keyboard control customization is horrible. If I use the controller, then the camera keeps on spinning fast around the character...which causes me to feel dizzy and makes me want to lose my lunch. and I can't even adjust for that sort of thing to prevent that from happening. Keyboard controls also suck hardcore for a lefthanded person like me... you see, I like using my mouse with my left hand... which means I usually use arrow keys to nagvative, not that WASD â¥â¥â¥â¥. so there's usually a delayed reaction for my character when I have to switch between mouse and keys.... that ends up with my character dying a lot. it's actually much more work to play this game than it is fun to play..... I actually wish I hadn't brought this game in the first place.

What the game lacks in control and gameplay it makes up for in solid story, quality voice acting, memorable characters, and a genuinely interesting series of plot twists.   The game frequently goes on sale for $2.49 so theres no reason you shouldn't own this masterpiece.  Isn't that right Zach?  (This is my favorite game. I have a 360 copy factory sealed in box which has already tripled in value since release.)

The puzzle solutions are not quite as clear as they could be in some areas, you might end up on a bit of a search, and I am currently stuck at a stealth portion that is very frustrating. I will go back and beat it at some point though, I would recommend this to any of my friends who like this kind of humor and puzzles.

1971	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the first horror game, and game in general Frictional Games made, and it's a perfect start!  Story- In Penumbra Overture you play as Phillip, a 30 year old male Physics Teacher. Phillip, after his mother's funeral, gets a letter from his father, which contained 'pleas of forgiveness', but also the location of a bank Phillip had no clue exsisted, including instructions to destroy several documents that are held in said bank. When Phillip goes to pick them up, but he reads them rather than destroy them, because of human curiosity, and due to this he investigates more, eventually leading Phillip to leave his home on a 'grand' adventure. I'm not going to say anything else, The rest can only be learned if YOU buy the game and play it!  Gameplay- In Penumbra you have a few 'options' to combat the enemies (mostly dogs) that stand in your way. The game tells you that hiding and being sneaky is the only real option, however depending on the difficulty you CAN kill the enemies (which is a BIG flaw IMO) with hammers, dynamite, and more. While trying to avoid the enemies (or jumping around because you killed them all) you have to solve puzzles, and go to different locations. The puzzles are usually easy, I rarely found myself looking up solutions to them, as normally the answers are told to you if you READ THE INFORMATION THE GAME GIVES YOU. Make sure you ALWAYS search a room/area indepth.  I can't really think of anything else to say about the game, It's an amazing game, and a perfect start for Frictional Games, there are 2 more games in the Penumbra Series... Black Plague, and Reqium.  I recommend you get this game if your a fan of horror, adventure, puzzles, or you are a fan of Frictional Games! Always remember 'If fate frowns, we all perish'

960	1	a	Pretty much the same thing as the non HD version so definitely not worth getting unless you can get it really cheap in a indy bundle which is just exactly how I acquired it. As far as I've noticed all it really adds is some boss monsters in the single player stages. That's about it.  If you don't have the original though it's a nice drive and gun game with some cool extra modes that's recommended if that sounds like your kinda fun.

267	1	a	Hehehehe I wish I had more time to play this game.... To cut a long story short I'm just gonna say it is 'THE OMEN MOVIE = LUCIUS'.... You play as the Son of the Devil, who's born into a rich family....your aim is to kill people while maintaining your innocent disposition... Do this by cleaning up your toys like a goodboy, then go downstairs, turn the crosses upside down and lock your nanny in the freezer room.....(accidently of course ;) Graphics are fantastic, the sound and lighting are sensational and the setting is spooky. As you're killing these people so stylishly, you cant help but grin from ear to ear....and you always feel great when you please your father (The Devil) I give this game a 9/10.... Nuff said..... I must for every disturbed player like me :D
1285	1	a	Like it's predecessor, Penumbra Black Plague is environmentally interactive, even being able to break glass bottles, throw boxes off cliffs, and play jenga with bags, barrrels, and books. Unlike the last game, the sequel seems to have gone more the paranormal route but still have elements of survival horror. I was glued to this game to find out the mystery behind it all.   Unfortuntely, I cannot say the same for the expansion Requiem. It seems it was just made for puzzle solving and adding a severe mind**** to everything you have just played/experienced. I basically just rushed through the puzzles in the hopes I would get something more from it. I don't know.    NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.

661	1	a	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.

2939	0	a	Fantastic story and characters with great music. Gameplay is completely busted at moments. I'd suggest watching a playthrough like the one from Video Games Awesome or Giant Bomb instead of actually playing the game. It's really not worth the hassle to slog through the gameplay.  I groaned everytime there was an action sequence (I counted around 6). The combat isn't really enjoyable, sometimes you needed to fight monsters before you could progress, sometimes they infinitely respawn. The levels could become mazelike and hard to navigate through. At some point you need to do a tailgating mission that takes way too long (5-10 minutes). The bossfights aren't enjoyable because of the combat. The map layout of the town is made by a madman. You will sometimes need to drive to the other end of the town and instead of having a straight line from point A to B, you have a gigantic swerving line (not exaggerated). At some point there is a new mob introduced that's very bulletspongy but you can easily take out with melee. The downside? Your melee grade degrade so fast it's not even funny. There is a sequence where you need to fight four of those monsters in a row and I pretty much ran out of usable weapons at that time. When your health is low, you'll start limping, have fun progressing through the levels like that!

Anyway, the game itself has an unique concept and storyline. +Very good for a puzzle game, and games like Penumbra and Amnesia, where you have to find items and know how and when to use them. -Bad optimization even for a game from 2012. +Graphics are above average of a 2012 game but poor customization overall. (No anti-aliazing, shadow configuration and I can't figure out if the resolution is actually the one I chose.) -Personally I expected more complexity from the game itself but the 'powers' you get you use them not very often, and they become obnoxious. +The idea of the game is spectacular and i'd love to see a sequel.
2143	1	a	Deadly Premonition is like the old cadillac you found in your grandpa's barn after he passed away.   Getting it to work will give you all sorts of headaches, and more often than not, you just want to lock the barn and forget all about the damn thing. But if you actually manage to put up with all the crap it throws at you and manage to make it work, you're rewarded with a ride that's both, unique and unforgettable.   Easily one of the best and worst games I've ever played.
2557	1	a	What an Experience I must say. I love story driven games and this one is nothing less than a Gem. If you are familiar with Twin Peaks you could pretty much relate to this story. You are set out to investigate a series of brutal murders that took place in a small hamlet called GreenVale. Be aware that this game is heavily story driven and loaded with Quick Time events while progressing to it. So if you are not fond of that style of gameplay then this game is not for you.  This game has an open-world free roaming approach to it that gives us some freedom of exploration although it fails miserably in rewarding you for doing so. The fact that you have to drive from A to B all the time is dreadful in my opinion and it breaks the momentum.  The game mechanics alternate from Quick time events to a third person shooter and action game which is appreciated actually. The controls are actually poor and most of the time you can't get your aiming straight however it does not punish you for it as it introduces an auto-aim button anyway. The graphics are substandard - I could not care less tough.  Had hours of fun and good laughs with it. It is funny, however it is not cheesy at all. There are a few twists in the plot towards the end. Bottom line is: This is great value for your money.

1700	1	a	The game ends in a cliffhanger. It is very clear that this is episode one, as it is stated both in the menu and by the main character in the end. Still, it's a very good game and I'd say it almost works as a 7-hour length demo of the Penumbra: Black Plague.  The story of a man seeking for his father in some vast and deserted area with mutants has been seen often before, but I think that Penumbra's story isn't concentrated on the things you hear from the main character, but instead hidden inside the articles and letters you find throughout the game.  I don't have a lot of time to analyze the awesome athmosphere or the great ending this game has, but I can say that this is a very considerable purchase. I haven't played Amnesia (yet), and this is a very good introduction to the Frictional Games' view of physics and story.  I recommend this title.

2267	1	a	Terrible shooting mecahnics, terrible gameplay, kinky animation, terrible(as for 2010) graphics and yet this game is a masterpiece. Storyline, soundtrack and style are all you need to fall in love with this game
745	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game. The characters fall a bit too much into the uncanny valley, which works for the creepy child protagonist but is not that great for the others. And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.
2026	1	a	This game achieves a more completely immersive atmosphere than most of the AAA, high-graphical games in my library. The limited color palette, the music, the sounds, the well-fleshed mythos and characterisations, even the somewhat bizarre UI- they all contribute to an overarching and deeply compelling feeling of doom. The setting is essentially an alternate medieval Europe in which demons and angels and monsters and spirits walk the earth, and the arts of magic and miracle-working are available to those willing to study. I chose the priest class, as I typically do when it's available- but this is no D&amp;D or WoW priest class. The character progression system is largely open. But its workings are esoteric and draconian, and I find it very rewarding to slowly understand and pursue possibilities. I turn and bless my companion before calling forth lesions on the skin of enemy: the process is largely invisible in-game beyond some floating numbers, but the narrative elements pull it together so perfectly that I am absolutely convinced. Yes, combat involves drinking lots of potions. And yes, the game involves a lot of reading. There are occasional minor mistakes in the translations but frankly the writing is far better overall than it is in most American games, and the mysteries and characters are more well-constructed than an any but the best point-and-click murder games, not to mention your typical rpg. This is NOT an action game. It is a brooding, creeping, sturm-und-drang literary roleplaying mystery game. And I highly, highly recommend playing it.

1262	0	a	Ignore all the positive reviews, this game sucks. I only played it because the steam trading cards this thing gives , have a pretty nice value regular cards about 20 cents and the foils over 2 bucks. if you want some steam money , then buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ while its on sale, grab all the cards , and never talk about this game ever again
424	1	a	Bought this game because my wife likes these type of games.. She seems to like it.. controls are a little frustrating but overall it is good.
864	1	a	This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary. So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10
616	0	a	Great. The game doesn't allow me to go into windowed mode or even get to actually play this. Spend your money on something else. It isn't worth it in my opinion.

As for me, well, I became obsessed with this game while I played it and while I didn't...so much that I went for the 100% completion.

2632	0	a	If you can get it on sale or cheap, this might be ok. However, charging 30 Euro for this is overpriced.  Technical problems: - Crashes and bugs here and there - Clunky controls - A fixed 720p 16:9 resolution; there is a mod that changes that, but that will give you more chrashes  While I am accustomed to clunky controls for console ports, the fixed resolution and the crashes are not acceptable.  This game tries to be so much at once, it ends up being not good at anything particular:  - It tries to tell a story, but that story is weird and has too many turnarounds and arbitrary events. Even after the story is finished, you could still turn it around again and no one would mind. - It tries to be a detective game, but it fails, most detective work is embedded into the story and there is not that much you can do wrong. Lots of suspects, but you don't choose the trail you want to follow, the main mission just guards you through - It tries to be open world GTA driving around, but fails due to extremely clunky driving, unusable map, and chrashes if you go somewhere where the game didn't expect you to go. - It tries to simulate real world needs: You have to eat and to sleep and to shave from time to time. But it fails: You cannot to go to the toilet, you cannot wash yourself (just the clothes), etc. - It tries to be Resident Evil, but it fails in its mediocre clunkiness and boring repetitions, including stupid quick time events - It tries to be episodic, but doesn't make sense there at all. Episodes 1 to 3 take forever, eposides 4-7 are rather short and should just have been episode 4 if it was ment to be comparable - It tries to incorporate psychological elements into the game, but fails miserably. Nearly all characters have psychological problems galore, they just stacked probably everything they thought they heard about psychosis and mutiple personalities. You will meet more psychopaths laden with stories from their childhoods in the small town of this game than in an average psychiatry of a very big city.  - On top of that all: It unnessessary slows down action and progress by long loading times, unskippable intro (which is a problem due to the many chrashes), opening doors very slowly, etc.  The store page tells 'Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games (...)'. Describes the game well: They threw together lots of things, all of them at mediocre quality and rather early-access-like than finished. So the customer ends up holding a mixed bag of everything a little bit in his hands, but nothing really usable. Just like someone added every spice available in his kitchen to some food, hoping for it to become tasty. Most times, it won't.  To sum it up, and to cite the main characters himself: 'Zach, this is a waste of time!'. Yes, it is, it kills quite some time playing it, always at the border between quitting due to all it's clunkiness but still providing something that makes you want to continue in the hope of it becoming more enjoyable, which sadly does not happen.

2299	1	a	This game makes me want to peek through every single window, despite long loading times between peeking in and getting back. It makes me desperately want to finish it despite the crash that forces you to play it in windowed mode. Its town feels alive, with real inhabitants, despite their quirky animations and weirdnesses.  I get lost driving with those horrible cars that veer right, and laugh to myself at the uselessly zoomed in map. And still, everything intruiges me to such a degree that I would call this a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I would never want to be withouth.  There is so much to do and see, that I found myself fainting outside of an ingame diner and woke up after being driven to the hospital. Surprised I realised I had let my loveable strange FBI agent go too long withouth eating. Similiarly I noticed flies started gathering around me at one point, because I had not changed clothes and sent my worn ones to get washed. I'm growing a beard as the game progresses, as I have not choosen to shave.   The story is full of twists and turns. Every character IS a character, with motivations, secrets, a backstory... They all seem to have lived their lives up to the point you join them in the game. The side quests, silly as they may be, seem to fit in the world. Seldom does one come across a game that can make the gamer so immersed, it has the ability to frighten, make one laugh out loud, as well as puzzle and feel sad.  Cult classic: The mystery, the music, the ugliness, the beauty, the people, the humour, the dialouge... This Japanese tribute to Twin Peaks and movie trivia is beyond words. With all it's flaws, it's simply genius.

3004	0	a	Crash on start.
1340	1	a	What can I say, this game is terrifying and had my blood pounding through my viens every step of the way.  This game uses an awesome item control system that makes opening doors and draws easy and fast. Items can be moved in the way of doors to give you time to hide and the leaning was actually useful in a game for once. I also really liked the whole sanity system where you lose your mind looking at the ... things?  The graphics are not the best but considering time of release thats expected and also I found the quality gave the game a scary feel and atmosphere. The story was deffinatly good but confusing at times and I found it did not fully explain the concept of the ... things?, where thay came from, what they are, why they are here and why they attack you. However this could just be me being an idiot.  All in all I think this is one of the best horror games there is and even if you don't like a scare get it anyway and scare your friends when they come over.
977	1	a	Simple premise - zombies have resulted from a large explosion at a corporation trying to cure cancer, and everyone is infected. You are a talented driver (I guess) and you are recruited to help out the army as they try to evaculate or establish a base. Missions are fun, fast and filled with satisfying gibbing of zombies everywhere. Typical mission is going to pick up a few specific survivors to help build the base (Doctors, Shipcrew, etc) or going to defend a specific objective. There are secondary objectives, and the game does a good job of mixing up the mission objectives.   Simply put, this is a great game to sit back and relax with, slamming into a billion zombies. I have only played the Campaign so far, but there is two additional modes to the game! Really excited to dive in further. Absolutely worth the price paid.  TLDR; Fantastic fun arcade driver game, in the vein of Carmageedon and others. Splatter zombies, equip and upgrade vehicles. 8/10
614	1	a	Lucius is one of those games that tries to present itself as new and unique, but it's really just a point-and-click adventure game delivered in a 'horror' RPG package. There are some parts of this game that try too hard to be edgy or shocking, such as the couple (unnecessary) sequences of low-censored nudity and sex.  Chapter after chapter is just a simple 'Use item X with location Y until Success' puzzle. Most of these are adequately explained or hinted at, but you will have one or two that are so ridiculous and make no sense that using a walkthrough is almost a requirement. Occasionally you will have a time restraint, but these chapters are rare. Each chapter details an individual murder of someone living/working in your mansion, usually by some bizarre and unnecessarily complicated chain of events (well, the difficulty has to increase somehow).  This game is technically 'open world', with the player having access to the entire mansion soon after the first several chapters. Regardless of where you go, each murder has to take place in the same location with the same objects, and it is typically set up that you don't need to wander too far to find key pieces of the murder.  Lucius is a puzzle game for those who like a little bit of a challenge, or for those that harbor an unsafe anger for childhood authority figures.

1563	1	a	After completing Penumbra Overture, I decided to play this game to further adapt myself to the horror genre found in games such as these. Unlike the first one, this was f***** scary. One look at that monster and I knew that this wasn't going to be easy. Of course my desire to finish the game got the best of me so I continued onward and became used to the creepy environment and that monster, so much in fact that I didn't even try to be stealthy and just ran for it. Great gameplay, great story, and great environment.  Overall: 9/10
1694	0	a	TL;DR - Starts strong, good atmosphere but quickly becomes repetitive. Some great puzzles, but most are frustrating, and don't seem to make much sense. Worth a play if you're buying the whole collection. Not worth a buy on its own.  This is a hard game to review because it's one of those in between games. I don't want to thumbs it up, but I don't want to thumbs it down. The first couple of hours of the game were pretty good, the build up and atmosphere was done really well. But when it got into it I wasn't scared throughout the entire game which is kinda disappointing. I think it's due to bad AI; once I realised with the dogs you can just stand on top of a box and beat them to death they no longer became any sort of threat. The game very quickly became boring and repetitive as each section of the game is pretty much the same. Big area leading to smaller areas, guarded by dogs with some sort of puzzle to solve to continue. That was pretty much every area in the game.   The puzzles in the game are hit and miss. There was a puzzle fairly early on that involved Morse code and the way the game got you to solve it was excellent, I felt like a complete genius after solving that. It wasn't a frustrating puzzle, took a little while but solve it. But then most of the other puzzles were absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Later on in the game you grab 6 chemicals which you are supposed to mix in some sort of order to create something (I'm trying not to spoil anything best I can). Right, and literally nowhere is there any clue in what order to mix them. I'd grabbed all the notes and everything, read carefully, and couldn't work out anything. So, I passed the puzzle by trial and error. Mix this with this, nope. This with that, nope. 5 mins later... Yay I solved it!?   Also, there is this really annoying worm creature that you occasionally run into where you have to run away and escape from right. Well, it's one of those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ chases where it's literally impossible to solve first try. You have to die, get a little further by working out what to do, die again. Progress more than you did but die again. Until eventually you know exactly what to do to get away from the creature.  The way I see it, if you're going to buy the whole package of the games, then it is worth a play. I wouldn't recommend buying this to be honest, or at least buy it in the sales.

1622	1	a	My recommendation: Try it/Get it on sale.  Pros and Cons:  + Great atmosphere + Interesting puzzles  - Small variety of enemies - Not as scary as some of the later games from Frictional  You play as Philip, a 30 year old physics teacher. After his mother's funeral, he receives a letter from his father, who has been presumed dead ever since Philip's birth. In his letter, he asks Philip to destroy certain cryptic documents, but out of curiosity, Philip decides to do some research and finds out the location of a mine in Greenland. He then goes on to investigate the mine on his own, which is where the game begins. Penumbra Overture is a blend of survival horror, psychological horror, and adventure game. You will solve puzzles to progress further, while avoiding and outsmarting enemies. While there is a combat system, the game encourages you to be stealthy and cautions. Combat is pretty clunky and ineffective, mainly because Philip is just a regular guy, not an action hero. Puzzles are interesting and done well, but I did get stuck once or twice (however, I was never good at puzzle games anyway).  What makes this game shine is its atmosphere, sense of tension, immersion and isolation. Mysterious story only enhances that, but since this is the first episode in the series, not much is explained. Most of the information comes from notes lying around the place, and you better read them if you want to get the full back-story of the area. In the terms of technical features, the graphics and sounds are solid and do the job, and the physics engine works well. Level design is decent, but since you are in a mine expect to see a lot of similar areas. Voice acting is not the best, but it's not cringe worthy either. Music is pretty good, it really keeps the tension going on and improves the overall atmosphere.  Because of the nature of the game the AI is not that complex and that's perfectly fine - enemies patrol the area and if they spot you, they'll chase you. My complaints would be that after some time, enemies started to annoy me and get in my way. Probably because the enemy variety is pretty weak - there are only three different types of them and two of them are encountered only once or twice. Also, I didn't find this game really scary, especially in comparison to some of the later games from Frictional.  Overall it's a solid game, worth your time if you're a fan of adventure games with horror elements. It does a good job of setting up the basis for the series.

1547	1	a	I think that people ignore this game and give all of their praise to Amnesia is CRIMINAL... Okay, it's not, but it's really annoying. Sure, Amnesia may have been a more polished experience (albeit with a convoluted story), but Black Plague introduced literally every noteworthy game mechanic that people think Amnesia invented. I also liked the story and characters better. I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.  Don't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds. Some of the physics puzzles may get you stuck, but it's nothing a walkthrough won't help. If you liked Amnesia at all, then you'd at least like Black Plague.

The first game I'm aware of to use the FPS 'grab and interact' style of gameplay which later made Amnesia such a firm favourite (this being the predecessor). I just complated it today, and it really does sell atmosphere incredibly well. The graphics are really dated at this point, but it didn't stop the scares coming thick and fast. Lots of really clever twists, and a story that didn't disappoint me at the end. I absolutely recommend this to horror genre fans.

2527	1	a	For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning:   The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.  Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)  The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.  TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.  In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.

2628	0	a	The PC port is a nightmare. I've tried just about everything - and I mean   everything   - to get this game running. Probably the most hilarious fix I've found has you going on a mini purge of all third party video software, uninstalling LAV filters and setting Windows Media Player as the default app for video files (because y'know, apprarently that works sometimes!?). Unfortunately, like every other fix, it had no effect on my system.   Nobody should be jumping through this many hoops just to get their game running. When the desperation is so bad that the only option is to start deleting other programs from your system,   something is seriously wrong.

439	1	a	When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced &gt; Conflict Arises &gt; Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy &gt; Oddball Makes Friends &gt; Oddball Gives Up &gt; Friends Rescue Oddball &gt; Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, 'BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!' Adam Sandler's all like 'This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?' Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like 'I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol' but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.  8/10 Needs more Adrian.

744	1	a	It's entertaining, but starts to get a little repetitive after a while. Eventually, the novelty of essentially playing as the kid from The Omen wears off and the simplistic nature of 'gain a new psychic power, kill a person with it' starts to get old.

2481	1	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan,  Technically,  DP  is a charlie foxtrot It's ugly, and crashes a lot  You'll have to wrestle with it to play Set compatibility and back up your saves  The port to mouse is cause to frown York can aim neither up nor down  It makes attempts to be realistic But lays the uncanny valley effect on thick  E.g., a map to some godforsaken hole Costs 71 times the fine for destroying a telephone pole  And you can subsist on cans of tomato paste Open them first? But that would be a waste!  The presence of zombies is never explained (Save that without them, revenue might not be gained)  Gameplay has a few minor flaws Like the crazy handling when driving cars  Even so, if you're playing for the story Buy it (on sale); you won't be sorry  You control a federal investigator Tracking a supernatural serial killer  The fourth wall is cleverly under attack York is schizo, and thinks you're his friend Zach  You'll travel to a small town and meet the residents Who have lives of their own (and don't always make sense)  Question them, and learn the local folklore Might it be real and connected to the recent gore?  You'll find there's more to this case than meets the eye If at the Raincoat Killer's hands you don't die  Still, no need to rush in investigating the deaths Goodness knows, there's always time for sidequests  So says Mr. Stewart.  Note for pedants who have already played the game:   I know York has dissociative identity disorder, not schizophrenia, but it looks like schizophrenia until episode 6, and I don't want to spoil that reveal.

2103	0	a	i wish it were good.  released years ago and still so many basic problems im sorry that i ever paid money for it.  have to play in 800x600 or else the UI is so small you cant see anything or click on anything.  but when you set it to 800x600 it doesnt scale things properly so most of your spell/item slots are pushed off the screen along with the inventory/game menu buttons etc.  supposedly was in development for ten years. if thats actually true i feel sorry for the devs who have spent so much of their time creating something so infantile and pathetic. seems more like it was in development for ten days.  ive been playing crpgs since eye of the beholder on the snes so im not totally clueless to these issues. 3 classes, cant choose skills or weapon proficiencies for any of them. leveling consists of upgrading 1 of 10 or so skills you can never change. plot/storyline full of holes and unexplained things. dice rolls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and weird whereby bats are killing the guards of cities. your character feels pre-made essentially. the game dictates to you how you should play it and you are not allowed to deviate from this set path. the six types of magic have absolutely no distinction between them: 'Divine Magic', 'Magic of True Faith', 'Magic of Miracles', 'Inquisitorial Magic', 'Heretical Magic', 'Pagan Magic'. it doesnt really seem to matter which ones you choose, you can do it with your eyes closed or while looking the either direction, because the descriptions of what they do are almost identical. just depends if you want to be 'evil' or 'good', something that is determined by a mass effect style slider in the center of the character menu. you are at the very least allowed to set your attributes although this has a very blunted effect on the actual game. a char with 5 strength and a char with 20 strength dont have that much difference in unarmed.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.

2043	1	a	This game is Called Inquisitor or by the player name: Potion chugging simulator and you also get to torture heretics in dungeons and later burn them in the pyre! The story starts with a mysterious murder of a merchant in a small village called Hildebrant and you lead this investigation under the command of the local Inquisition and church.  
2720	0	a	This is an amazing game that is completely hobbled by one of the worst PC ports that I have ever seen. I've tried it on two different, fairly beefily specced systems and both of them get roughly five frames per second. Going by the forums, the developer has apparently abandoned the project entirely, so unless the community gets together and fixes the myriad of bugs still left in this terrible tragedy of a release, it will never be worth purchasing.  Stay away my friends!
1080	1	a	Honestly, really fun and really well done, a perfect time waster and looks great for a top down driver.
1748	1	a	If you like Amnesia you will like the Penumbra series EVEN BETTER!  Just trust me on this one. It's scarier at times, the puzzles are a little harder, and there is just such a fantastic story that goes along with the series.

65	1	a	In this adventure game you are Lucius, a son of the devil. Daddy likes souls so he asks Lucius to go kill people for him. He rewards Lucius with special powers that make him an even better killer.   Lucius shouldn't get caught, of course, so he makes murders look like an accident or frames someone for them. This means that each murder is a mini puzzle for which Lucius uses items he collects throughout the mansion and his special powers to 'solve the puzzle' and kill the target without getting caught.  Meanwhile, the story in the game is about the adults in the house: a bit of background for each target, how they react to the murders, the police detective investigating the deaths, etc.  For me, the puzzles were neither too hard nor too easy, so I found the difficulty perfect. At the start of each chapter, you are pointed to your target either via your note book or via the in-game map. Sometimes you may feel a bit stuck because you don't know what is expected, but when you look at the clues (you can get a cryptic clue from Daddy in your room, but you should especially look at the items you collected and at your notebook) the solution always comes to you because it makes sense.   Lucius' special powers like telekinesis and mind control are explained very well by Mr. Lucifer and they make the puzzle solving a lot more fun than your average 'point and click' adventure slash puzzle game.   The options in the game menu are: - adjust resolution, adjust graphics details (low, medium, high or ultra high), toggle full screen, toggle Vsync and adjust gamma - adjust sounds and music volume  - toggle 'invert mouse' and adjust mouse speed - re-bind keyboard keys or controller buttons  You should expect to get about 5 hours gameplay. About 7 hours if you don't rush and hunt most of the Steam Achievements. On that note, I should add that two achievements are absurd i.e. 'play the game for 20 hours' and 'play the game for 40 hours'. This means running the game as your active window, so running it in the background doesn't count. This is such an obvious and cheap way for the devs to try to get higher numbers of playtime for their game in Steam. Moreover, these two achievements appear to be bugged for me because the counter for both is still at zero.  All in all, I had fun playing this game and would recommend it but only when it's on sale at -50% or better.
1796	1	a	It isn't often a game as polished and riveting as Penumbra comes along at all, let alone from a debut effort by an independent studio. A lack of weapons makes enemies far more terrifying than most survival games, demanding some ingenuity rather than an itchy trigger finger, a feat few games succeed in pulling off so well. Along with a tense, immersive atmosphere that is equally unmatched, Penumbra: Overture is a spectacular, uniquely engaging experience. The less that is known about it before starting it, the better the experie... I've said too much.
1450	1	a	A fitting end to the series.
789	0	a	Inventory is only usable with the scroll wheel. When the game even bothers to respond to the scroll wheel, it scrolls to the very first or very last item, making the game completely unplayable. Waste of money.
1650	1	a	This game was really quite a treat to play and had a lot of very subtle nuances to it. The atmosphere in general was very moody and held a lot of unease and anxiety which was really nice to see from a horror game. The game itself is not 'scary' but it's most definitely horrifying. The plot is also really good and I enjoyed reading all the notes and figuring out what happened to poor old Philip's father.

2671	0	a	I had this game in my library for about a day and a half when It first dropped on Steam. When I tried to play it, it was all stuttery and unresponsive, so I asked for my money back. I have no idea if that's still the case now, but I'd recommend checking out the pcgamingwiki page concerning this game before making the purchase.  On console, that's a different matter. The game is a gem, and it's weird as hell. Definitely check it out on a stable platform. I usually champion buying the 'good' version, but in this case, like with Dark Souls 1, this is definitely not the good version.

2298	1	a	A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC! Play it on console!  I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue. Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied 'Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize' .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.  ..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.  Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.  The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.  Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 - get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...
234	1	a	Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by 'The Omen' movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&amp;click- and 'Hitman' -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)
2065	0	a	This fell short of the 'epic' old school rpg it promised to be. The combat and spell system was generic and clunky. Everything seemed a little out of balance from combat to level progression to economy. Visuals were sub par and buggy. Couldn't quite make it through my requiste 10 hours of gameplay.  On an up note, the mood and setting was dark. The writing, though nothing amazing, had a gritty edge to it. The idea that you are and old school detective working for the house of God to uncover satan worshippers held promise, unfortuantly it didn't hold water (tap nor holy).

828	1	a	  This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5â¬

518	0	a	Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...  Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).

1909	1	a	A bold, unique adventure / horror game. Well-written, well-designed, well worth the price of admission.
2171	1	a	I wrote a short 'review' a few years ago and i feel i like didn't do this game enough justice it deserves. What exactly is this game? That is a really good question. If you really want a better review just   read   this.   This is supposed to be a survival horror game, is it though? It's a murder mystery, you play as York (everyone calls him that) an fbi agent that investigate a serial killer leading to a small town. Once you start this game, you'll know that this game is bad. The story doesn't make sense, the dialogue is horrible, the cutscenes are attrocious, the gameplay are horrendous, the control is the worst. But it is also a wonderful experience that you'll never forget.   You'll dread the shooting so much with all the bullet sponge enemies, You'll accidentally press the a button and see the 'get out of car' animation a million times. You will also ask questions, a lot of questions. Why is the raincoat killer stopped chasing me after i evade one time? Why is there an old dude on a wheelchair wearing a gas mask? Why is there a jazz playing while i examined a body? Who is whistling that mario theme?!?   please get it out of my head.   And also    Who is zach?    Not all of that question will be answered. At the end of the game, the character will grow on you, you'll no longer ask the unecessary question, because it's deadly premonition.   But if it's all so bad, what makes it a good game, you ask. Deadly premonition knows that it is a bad B-movie and make it their strength. Sure you will be frustated, but that frustation is wiped by the laugh that you'll get. You'll laugh at it, thinking that it's bad, but that's also what makes it so good. It's also possible that you will hate it with passion, that is also fine. Because you gotta have a truly twisted mind to enjoy it. It's a genius of swery.  How exactly are we supposed to enjoy this game, ironically? Unironically? That is a question that will never be answered. Perhaps the saddest part of this game is this will probably be the one and only that ever comes out.
