0	I liked the original Death Rally game, it gave you a feeling of beeing submerged in the world of the Death Rally circuit. You started with some wierd kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ized (b4$t4rd|z3d, wordfilter lol!) rusty VW-beetlecar with built in machineguns and armorplating welded on to it. The car was crap, and you knew it, but that was the point. After many many races where you sometimes knew very well you had no chance in hell of winning the race, you soldiered on, staying out of harms way of the neo-corvette juggernauts that you hoped of one day obtaining.  This game has missed the point totaly. After playing the game for an hour and unlocking cars and weapons, I'm sad to say that this game is not a worthy remake. It's got a cheap plastic feel to it in many ways and here are some examples of what went wrong:  You're not at liberty to save money when you repair and upgrade your car after a race. All acquired money has to be spent there and then, therefore it effectively removes the economic dimension from the game, and with that removes all strategy from the game.  Gear and cars are not bought, they are collected on the race track as parts and once all parts are collected you get your mines or machinegun or new car. What was given to you will not be valued. Therefore the game is not about upgrades since new gear doesn't come from you spending your resources to get them.  Your car has auto-fire on the built-in machinegun, you dont even have to pull the trigger to use the weapon and ammo never runs out. I shouldn't have to explain how wrong this is. There are other secondary weapons though that require ammo and triggerpulling, but thats beside the point.  There are some other points that I could make about thats wrong with this game, but what has already been written will suffice. Technically this game might be well made from a programming point if view, the problems is that the designers of the game had no idea what they were doing.
1	(Disclaimer: I do probably have nostalgia for the original) It makes me sad to have to not recommend this. I was honestly excited by the idea of the Death Rally game being remade and hopefully expanded. Instead what we seem to have is essentially a mobile game scaled up that has a lot of the words in common with Death Rally but feels like it misses on a few important cylinders.  Death Rally was a half race and half car-carnage game and it pulled it together well though sometimes a bit cheesy. Fun could be had as the races really felt like skill made a big difference and timing your mines and machine gun fire to destroy opponents in your way was rewarding though not trivial. Through the game, you got money which you needed to restock supplies like ammo or armor, upgrade your car a bit or buy new cars/weapons.  This version feels like the dumbed down iOS port that it really is. Money now only is here to buy upgrades to the car and repair it. The upgrades feel like they make almost no difference in gameplay (except armor which did actually seem to prolong life). But as a racing game, getting better cars or engines did not make me feel like I was going faster. I've read that even the best car with the best engine does not go faster than the initial car an opponent drives in a beginner race. It makes the upgrades feel definitely token.  There is also no real money management. In fact, after a race, the game seems to expect you to just spend all of your money since ammo is restocked at the beginning of a race anyway. New weapons and cars are unlocked after collecting a certain number of pieces scattered on tracked on dropped from destroyed opponents. It feels like progression in this game could be substituted for attrition. I remember in the original sometimes being in a bad place because I took a loan I couldn't pay back. This made decisions feel like they meant something. Also, additional objectives in the original again meant something since money mattered. Here, they are a yes/no box you click periodically and see if it works. It feels sometimes like an Office product had a pop up with the title 'Fun' and boxes that just say yes and no appeared with no real context or consequence to the action.  Yes you do advance faster from placing higher, but it still doesn't feel significant enough. After all, winning a race seems to come mostly down to well placed nitro boosts at the end.  The destruction of opponents seems like an area where this could shine. Unfortunately, there are things in the way of allowing you to really get the full enjoyment from the experience. Your base machine gun automatically shoots for you (after you add your 1 additional gun upgrade). This feels annoying at best since you have unlimited ammo and it's not always shooting, but you have no control over it. Even better is in-race bonuses (repair, money, ammo) are in boxes that must be shot... so you have to hope an opponent is in front of you near a box so you could happen to shoot that (and they not just take your bonus) or you waste some of your limited ammo.  This is a small gripe, but the in level bonuses do need to be shot and all appear at the beginning of the level. Since shooting can be wasteful and feel a bit random, this means that upgrades you need later are hard to get and running into repairs within seconds of the race starting is common. It just feels like a bad decision. The original randomly spawned them on the track, IIRC, and that was fine. This isn't a realistic game; why must we pretend periodically that it is?  Opponents suffer from what a lot of games have with enemies that don't have the same limitations as you. I've mentioned their cars are always fast enough to rival yours no matter what. They also have unlimited ammo in their nicer weapons compared to the 4 shots you get in some of your weapons. This is especially terrible in the deathmatch sections where destroying cars is the goal yet they don't have to worry about ammo limits. Additionally, they have health like you do. When you hit 0%, you explode and are done. When they hit 0%, their health bar flashes... and they continue to race for a while. Some number of shots into them later (or maybe it's time? I couldn't definitively understand the logic but it seemed inconsistant and like I wasted a lot of ammo trying to kill a single target), they will in fact explode. You have no real indicator of when this is going to happen though, so I frequently found myself passing them and hoping to get their drop on the next lap if they happened to blow up. Though they can still shoot you in this state.  Speaking about laps, one of the biggest places this feels like a mobile game is in the race length. I'm not saying I need long races, but I do feel like the fact that most races take &lt;=1 minute to complete takes away from my enjoyment. That could just be a preference, though.  All this is not to say there is no fun to be had. I was entertained for a while. I could see this being more reasonable on a device without a gamepad or keyboard (I never did get my 360 controller to work with this game) like a tablet or phone where simple games are more acceptable. I at least wanted more. I wanted to feel like I had consequences or choices. I wanted to feel like my ability mattered. Instead, I was watching a nice looking (not amazing by any means, but it does look nice enough... if you don't look too closely at the textures) but repetative and short car chase scene from various movies. Things happen, but the ending never seemed to be directly related.  You can get the original for free from Remedy which runs on Windows (re-released in 2009); I feel that is a better use of your time and money
2	When I first bought this game, I was expecting the same game as original one with better graphics. So my first experience was a huge dissappointment. My memories with the original one was so fresh, so I couldn't see that this one (although shares the same name) is a different game for a different time.  In first game your motivation was climbing the ladder to fight with adversary. This game has no ladder, so if you are an old fan, you hate the game from the begining. But this time it is more about cars you have to get ambitious about. Upgrading cars and guns are your main goal in here. Races are faster and harder (in my opinion) than original one. 3 Laps is too short to kill everyone in the game (if you have a new car), so it really takes more dedication to win any race. Graphics are much better than the original one (it has to be after 20 years :) ). Cars are the same (which is a plus :) ) with cool upgrades.  Of course the game has its downs. Like story is not going to get you. Races are too fast. Race ends till you get the idea most of the time. Gameplay is not very smooth. Enemy AI is not very bright.   But, in the end, you should see this game as a casual game as it is an adaptation from mobile game. So if you take games too serious it is not a game for you. But if you wanna open a game, make a few race, collect some stuff in your free time, this is right game for you. 9.99$ is a little expensive for the experience, so if you catch a sale (2.99 or less is ideal I think, but 4.99 is not bad too) don't miss it.. -- PS: If developer reads this; the thing I miss the most from original game is the enemy characters. There are bosses in every race but in the original game as you move up the ladder you fight with harder characters and before adversary you compete with hard characters like duke and sam speed. This time bosses are just normal cars in normal races. If this could be added to game it will be great. (like adding special voice over, small ads for the boss of the game, may be a history and stuff).. Thanks.
3	If you're searching for the renewal of the good old time Death Rally you were in love with when you were a kid, just go away, this is not what you're searching for. Not the same mechanics, gameplay only average, background away.  In fact, this game took all the good stuff of the original Death Rally, throw it away, then shot at it like it was clay pigeon shooting. Replace the void they made by average stuff they had in stock. Then sell it under Death Rally name.  And, in this final game version : repetitive, way too easy, lack of creativity, average gameplay, lack of fun.  Don't, just, don't.
4	First off, when I was a kid I played the original, with every possible options and on every difficulty level, etc. So I loved it. Even though I know I have romantic (sentimental?) feelings toward *that* game I wanted to give a chance to the remake but it was still very, very disappointing.  Maps are redesigned a silly way so they lost their charm (e.g. 'shortcuts', 'booster areas', etc), as well as 'unlocking' new cars, weapons, etc. This game, instead of giving options for the player on how to spend their money, forces one into dumb achievement and 'on the road objects' farming until the nose starts running... What about the money you earn in the races in the mean time, you ask? Oh, that money? It goes to neverland! YISS, it is lost. Money in this game is nothing you collect or spend. It is just points to fix the car and fill the rest of the bars (armor, etc). So, e.g. want some mines? Good. 'Unlock' and 'equip' (otherwise it is free), as soon as you unlocked all the dumb stuff before the mine (like 'shotgun' as a weapon instead of the auto-gun...).  I am saying all the above by not giving a cent for the game, as it came for free with a game magazine. It is sad. Super sad. Even the 'free' version does not worth playing it :/
5	Pros: Several weapons, including rockets and a flamethrower. A couple of rulesets, such as Deathmatch.  Cons: Far too little freedom, with no money retained between rounds(it's either spent upgrading your current weapon or discarded), etc. Upgrading feels like grinding, as it barely matters whether you do well in races or not. Once you've completed it once, you'll probably never play it again.  Recommendation: Look for the original, or find a game that was initially developed for actual gaming, and not for playing on iOS/Android.
6	This game cannot win the original, it doesn't even match with the original. If you played the original game back in 1996, you will dissappointed with this game. But, as a separate games. It's fun enough.   Why its fun !?  Because, you can choose to won the race in 1st place in competitive race or .... Kill all your opponent with your weapon. You can let them to overlap you, and wait in the U turn. Place mine and let the Gatling Gun do the work for incoming opponent.   KISS BOOM BANG ... you're a winner.  10/10 would be a Road Warrior again.
7	If you were a fan of the 1996 original Death Rally, and are hoping this will be a revisit with nicer graphics, you'll be be sorely disappointed.  Remedy have simply changed far too much. About the only stuff it has in common with the original are a few names scattered around the place. It feels like a completely different game which a ten-year-old has modded to add a few references to his favourite game.  It's a remake of Death Rally in name only. If it didn't have the Death Rally references, I'd say it was inspired by it and would mildly recommend it. As it stands, however, I don't.  If you want to play Death Rally, play the original in DOSBox. You'll be much happier.
8	If ever there was a game I would urge people to stay away from, it's this one.  I expected it to be mostly like the original. Seeing Remedy Entertainment mentioned as both a co-developer and publisher for this title my hopes that it would capture the magic of the old title were pretty high. But within no-time this game managed to squash all that.  Controls are just an awkward mess. I played mostly with controller, where the car follows the direction of your left stick based on your overview perspective, rather than allowing you to control throttle with a button and steering with the left stick relative to the car. Sadly, it doesn't get all that much better with a keyboard. All cars have a tendency to feel like a stick of soap on a wet bathroom floor. You want to go round a corner? Nope, the car is going to stop in its tracks first, then go for a big half circle in the other direction, before turning the direction you want, as if to underline that this is not a racing game. No, this is a shooting game, with cars.  Sadly, when it comes to shooting there isn't much fun to be had. The standard weapon is controlled by the player, only so long as you don't have a secondary gun, at which point it starts shooting on its own (why? Not a clue!). While most secondary guns at least look nice, they are not very effective (nor is the standard weapon, to be honest). Sadly, you get nothing more for fighting off opponents that are behind you than 3 mines - per race. Those 3 mines by themselves are, however, only capable of dealing enough damage to take out 1 enemy entirely. Unless he upgraded his armor. So in other words: in order to get rid of opponents there is nothing for it but to drop back and shoot them from behind. Even though you actually should want to be in the front in order to actually - oh, I don't know - win the race.  Upgrading your cars, weaponry and obtaining new cars is no longer done by saving up and spending money. Money has to be spent immediately after a race in its entirety on upgrades, or more precisely: towards upgrades, as you probably cannot afford it in 1 go (again: why? Not a clue!). New cars and weapons can only be obtained by collecting parts, by shooting down opponents. Yet another reason not to make an effort to win a race, but rather to fight your opponents.  It's almost as if the developers sat around the office challenging each other to come up with gameplay elements that did not benefit the game. In actual fact, I hope they did, because then at least they would have had more fun making it than I did playing it.
9	Haven't played the original Death Rally, but the remake is a good game in its own right. Short, fast paced races, 3 car add-ons, 6 upgradeable weapons, 7 maps, and 8 cars. All in all, a decent bag of fun.  Sure enough, it's not a triple-A title, and nowhere near as complex, but it can be fun. The short races mean you can play a race or two whenever you have a minute and get back to whatever you were doing. Gets even more fun with a few buddies in online[1] play.   Gameplay in Death Rally doesn't offer anything brand new, but gets the basics right. Controlling the car is simple, either via a single stick or wasd, and there doesn't seem to be any problems with responsiveness[2]. Steering does take a bit of getting used to, but in the end is not much different from other console-like top-down racers - after a few races it should feel natural. Main gun auto-fires at any targets dead ahead and within range, and secondary guns/mines/nitro are activated by pressing the corresponding buttons.  The visuals in Death Rally are quite pleasing to the eye. Race tracks and cars look good and offer a lot of detail. The garage view (main menu) shows a nicely-rendered model of the curently selected car (with any selected add-ons/weapons visible) and the UI is clean and efficient. All the necessary elements are visible on one screen and laid out without making the screen cluttered and messy. The UI is designed to be controller-friendly (looks tablet-friendly too) so race selection and car upgrades are quick and easy.   AI opponents do offer a fair challenge, but that's mostly beacuse they tend to drive slightly better cars. The regular mob racers have decent 'driving skills' and their cars are slighlty better upgraded, but only up to what's achievable by players. 'Boss' racers (of which there is up to one per race), on the other hand, tend to drive real well and their cars are often better than anything the player can achieve. While this does make the game more challenging early on it just breaks it in the very late-game -- most bosses will just speed away right from the start, and only generous amounts of nitro (in-race pickups, random chance) can help catch up. The worst example of this is the 'finall boss' - the Adversary - who can't be beat without constant use of nitro, or a lot of ammo pickups.   For the above reason, among others, Death Rally suffers in terms of replayability. Starting the campaign from scratch does not offer anything new, and will in fact play out nearly the same anyway (up to choice of stages). Playing a single campaign is a much better option, especially in small doses. A few races a day can offer a lot of fun and will delay the somewhat broken end-game long enough to diminish its impact.   The soundtrack is a good enough generic composition, fits well and doesn't get too annoying or repetitive. Sound effects are good too.
10	There were several years in the mid-2000's that you couldn't find Death Rally anywhere on the internet AT ALL. Trust me, I looked.. a lot. It was somewhat surreal when I heard Death Rally was coming back with updated graphics. I didn't want it to spoil how good a memory I had of the game to begin with. This top-down racing/destruction game was one that truly dominated our Grade 7 computer lab (well this and Test Drive 5). To be honest though, they didn't change a whole lot, which is a good thing. It doesn't feel quite as good as the original, but it's very close.
11	This could have been the return of a classic. Instead this isn't a bad game... but in no way a better game then the original death rally. Only recommended on a sale!
12	The Limited Tracks are the only downfall, but the Acheivements through steam &amp; progresseve difficulty make it a good game. Highly recomend if its under $7.00 . I find it easer then the origional DOS version, wich was ahead of its time.
13	Many years ago, I played the original Death Rally for MS-DOS. It was a game that defined my childhood and gave me a lifelong love for automotive combat. High-speed racing, deadly weaponry, awesome music and clear goal- to overcome the demon king of the race, the Adversary. This new incarnation brings all that and more, now featuring cooperative multiplayer and many minor tweaks the orignal lacked, given the hardware limitations of the time. This is the kind of game we could use more of in these troubled times- a game about pure, unadulterated fun. Listen to the Captain, racer boy. Things can get out of hand real fast out there. Now ride your machine, your motor-war-chariot. Hear it's sublime roar. Strap it, fuel up, reload, and ride out. It's time for death in the fast lane. It's time to race. Welcome back.
14	Very nice game! This is a good challenge for drivers. Game is very hard, but its awsome! :D
15	This game reminds me of my fave retro game IGNITION. :) Almost the same but more bad â¥â¥â¥ than ignition.  You would enjoy it playing for hours only if its not that costly.
16	What I like: Racing, designs of the cars, the selection of weapons, especially the flamethrower, and the game looks nice.  What I didn't like: Not as gritty as the original Death Rally, and having to spend all your earnings on upgrades and repairs.  My recommendation: Going into this one expecting the classic may lead to disappointment, as a combat racer on its own, I'm having a blast with it. Nice for some casual racing.
17	I have played the earlier DOS incarnation all the damn time when I was younger. It was one of the best rally-type games, and, in a personal matter, it still is. Every day, I see all these rally games via Flash game sites, and it never met my standards (comparing to the DOS game). With this newer version, I find it as fun as the original. To be frank, however, it's a bit more casual, as you don't have to worry about losing lives or anything. Within the first few hours, it's an easy achievement grind for the hunter in all of us... at least for me anyway. If you're a fan of rally games, or have played the original, get this.
18	Well, I guess this game is like Classic Returns It`s funny, you should try it
19	It is a remake of a 1996 game which was quite long ago so making a comparison would be pointless, I think. And while the remake - according to many claims - could be different or even 'dumbed down' it still has many hours of fun in it. The game looks good, plays well and offers hours of fast-racing carnage. Also, there are not many top-down car racing games out there on PC.  While somewhat repetitive, Death Rally is a fun game, so grab it with your friends once on sale!
20	If you ever did or still play the old Death Rally, and loved it to the fullest, this is a terrible remake to boot. There's little challenge, and I got the game finished and 64% of the achivements done in 6 hours, and felt like I had wasted my time doing it.
21	Right along with Rock &amp; Roll Racing, this game is fun guaranteed.
22	(Â¬ â¿ Â¬)
23	At first the controls are horrible... but if you update the handling points of your car it starts to actually do what you want it to do. And then... then the retro feeling kicks in. I loved the original and I fell in love for this remake too. Just one more race, only one. Okay, that one too. And maybe another one. Is there time to do one more?  The not so great parts is the difficulty of the 'last boss' and the requirements of the last achievements. That's where it starts to get frustrating and repetitiv. But even if I have to talk me into start the game again to do the same races on the same courses all over... once I'm in I can't stop because there's just enought time for one more race. And maybe one more...
24	Bad phone game port charged at 10 times the price. Might look fun from the screenshots but this is not the classic death rally, at all. Races are over in a minute, sometimes less, gamepad controls are atrocious and can't be reconfigured (instead of proper racing controls the car just goes the direction you point your thumb stick, wow...), no control on your weapons, they just autofire when drivers are in front which is incredibly annoying since you can't shoot item crates most of the time. On top of that the game is missing a lot of features and is generally dumbed down from the original. Also, they took out Duke Nukem. Srsly ... Also no sense of speed at all in races and i hate how they did the car damage for AI drivers. at 0 life they get invulnerable for a few secs before they can be taken out, ugh...  I bought this blind upon seeing it show up on Steam, do yourselves a favour and read a bit more reviews ect before deciding if this game's for you. Worst impulse purchase ever.
25	The Remake , It is hardly beat the original Death Rally in gameplay... It feel like in the remake it doesn't matter what car you got you still gonna move slow like in your very first car... In the original Death Rally if you get the last car you r moving so fast Beetle Cars can't beat you and not only they can't beat you but you can run over them twice if not more , The only thing that is better in the Remake from the original Death Rally are the graphics... The Remake require a Big Update that make a big different between the cars you own , In the Performances of each car and In the Performances of weapons on each car ,like firepower... In the original Death Rally , Beetle cars didn't had the firepower of the last car or 2nd best car... The Remake is alot shorter than the Original Death Rally... I recommend playing the Original Death Rally !
26	Death Rally is yet another indie game that I want to like, but find myself feeling unentertained and even frustrated while forcing myself to play through the campaign. The arcadey driving is overly simple with hand-cramping controls that lack finesse required in good racing games â even arcade racing games. The RPG element is weak but somewhat addictive. The multiplayer is basically uninhabited and limited to random online-only matches; sorry, no beer-fueled buddy matches. The story is trite and drawn out via ridiculous story-mission level requirements. The only reason I put as much time into this game is because of nostalgia, since Death Rallyâs gameplay was 100% lifted from the NES classic R.C. Pro-Am. Overall I say avoid buying Death Rally, which is a shame because it only needed a few things to make this a great game, namely: playable multiplayer, better controls, and deeper RPG / customization choices.
27	4/10. The game should have been named 'Grind Rally' instead. Do not expect a proper PC game if you buy this, but an iOS port meant to be played as a means of spending time while sitting on the toilet.

29	Dayum. Played the original 1996 version as a shitkid, so I picked this up from nostalgia. Wasn't disappointed.
30	Loved the original game, which was first and foremost a racing game with weapons and sabotage mechanics added to spice it up. This version is all about the weapons and sabotageâracing skill is more or less irrelevant. The original is easily (and legally) found for free online. Ignore this and go play the 1996 version.
31	The intention to revive this game was good, but i think they could do better. Few cars and just half dozen tracks. You get bored quickly.   But the thing that drove me nuts is the fame level. If you don't play regularly, it will drop to zero. And the game don't even warn you. It's almost like you have to start all over again. What gets worse is to achieve the top fame 'The 42' you must have 42.000.000 fame points, which is almost impossible for PC version (on mobile you can buy with real money multipliers upgrades).  Thus, there's multiplayer achievements that is difficult to get just because people get bored so quickly that nobody plays online.  So, have to play a lot so don't lower your level while trying to get to the top and no multiplayer to try to shake things up a bit, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! So why don't Remedy point a gun in my head and take my money instead?
32	I remember the first day i played DEATH RALY on a PENTIUM I with 266MHZ , i was like : OMG THIS GAME (crashing cars , shooting at them and the best RACING IN THE SAME TIME) , was like a dream come true 2 me. When i played this game with modern graphics and modern movement , i was like OH MY GOOOOD , how far did they go witht his game. I recommend this game to all that love racing and destroying and shooting in the same TIME and GAME.
33	One of the best bird's eye view racing games!
34	Played the whole game through in couple of days or so, maybe less. Personally, I liked it when I played it, but I think after one playthrough, it's pretty much enough for me, so no thanks anymore.  If you like these kind of games, then sure, this is good. If not.. well, then not. Can't say whether I'd recommend it or not.
35	A good game to kill some time with, with an array of achievements (if that's your thing). Not sure it works as well on PC as handheld devices, but I enjoy it. Pick it up on sale and you shouldn't regret it.

38	Death Rally has been lovingly re-created and provides the same high intensity arcade adrenaline rush as the original but with full HD support and updated sounds and visuals. There is something satisfying about destroying all your competitors in a nail biting race to the finish. Miniature cars that can have armour, weapon and handling upgrades. On track arcade bonuses a-la Super Sprint. Some races have more Death than Rally but that is where the fun lies. Kill competitors, buy upgrades, kill more competitors, buy more upgrades, then leave them choking in your dust. Regardless if you are new to this game or getting it for nostalgia value, Death Rally will provide many hours of fun and enjoyment.
39	I haven't played the original Death Rally, so I can't make a compair to that one. But this games totally lives up to and exceedes many topographical racing games. The only downside is the lack of levels...if they ever added more and maybe a little more variety of vehicles, then I think this game would be perfect. Overall awesome game, but since there is a lack of content I wouldn't recommend buying this unless it was under 5 bucks.
40	Awesome Spiritual Sequel to the original MS-DOS/Windows 95 Death Ralley. Not particularly great controls but the series has never been great on controls(its part of its charm). I would recommend this for those who remember the original title. Probably steer clear if you have never played the original
41	A modern remake of the original Death Rally.  Follows the same basic forumula as the original, but packs a whole bunch of extras into the game. Things are changed, updated. Over-all it doesn't have as much charm as the original Death Rally, but it's still a pretty good remake.  Definitely give this a try if you were a fan of the original game.
42	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game wtf remedy make proper death rally 2
43	Plays pretty much the way I thought it would, and it's fun for some time, but the races are just too damn short and there are waaay too few tracks! Also multiple players multiplayer matches would have been nice. All in all not bad, but a little soulless and needed some more substance.  5.5/10
44	Where is the death rally? I win a race without shooting a bullet.. Deception is really the right word. Might aswell pick up the original and sell it instead of this crap.
45	Not even close to original.... Kinda Meh.... sadly....
46	They have killed the fun so i canÂ´t recomend the game. The old one was challenging as you had to win every race if you want to unlock new weapons, get better positions on the general scoreboard and get new and fast cars. It was the kind of racing game that made you feel proud when you win and mad when someone kill you in the last lap.  If you want to revive the experience this game is not for you. Why? Is really easy to win, and there is no point for doing it. You can just get new cars and weapons by killing your opponents and picking the parts they drop, and that is very boring. So there is no challenge, there is no fun, just an 'meh iÂ´m gonna play it' game.
47	I played the original death rally and loved it! I thought this game would be just as good and MULTIPLAYER. Turns out no one plays multiplaer or the multiplayer is brocken. It sucks, when playing this game on IOS it is much more popular with multiplayer and im not saying that IOS death rally popular im saying that its more popular. It will still take you about 30 mins to get on a server.
48	I consider myself as a great fan of the ORIGINAL Death Rally game. This is just some kind of worse copy of it. Some names are identical of the old one, so the weapons. Oh, and The Adversary. And that's it. There is a guy, named Tex Harris, who totally looks like George Lucas for me. So this guy wants us to get The Adversary. Wow, that's the story of the game! For the second time it took me about 4-5 hours to complete the game, but the achievement system is horrible. For 3 fame level achievements you have to collect a millions of fame level points which is going to force you to play with this so called 'game' hours and hours more. Trust me, you don't want to. So that's a huge disappointment. The game is just MEDICORE.
49	This game is *terrible*. Play the 1996 version instead.
50	Dumbed down version of the original. Practically no replay value.  Avoid this and play the original DOS game instead.
51	In most games when you die, you restart with full life. Not in this game. You have to spend the money you earn in races on fixng your car up. Doesn't sound like much of a bother, unless you die a few times or finish fifth and don't earn much. I spent all of my money from one race just fixing my car up. Then I turned down a sabatage offer, and I guess they sabataged my car instead, and I exploded before the race even started. I already had no money to start with. So I get $100 for participation, which lets me fix my car to only 10%.  You can't be in lead because you will always die at 10% life and staying in the back for five races just to get enough money to fix it 100% just to repeat the process is just too much for me.  
52	I won't pretend to give an in-depth review for this game, because I obviously haven't played it much. However, my lack of play time is indicative of my opinion about this game. I loaded it up and immediately realized that the controls were terrible, the camera was wonky, and overall, the game was nearly impossible to play. I'm glad I picked this up on deep discount.  System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7
53	If you hoped this game would give some of the same magic as the original - You are in for a disappointment. The game is nothing but a grind, there really is not any choices to what cars, weapons or stuff you wan't. Sure you can actually decide which weapons are on your car, but you get a choice of 3....  This is one more of those games that is just a massive waste of money and was intended to sell by it's name by the creators. Waste of money if you ask me
54	PROS + Graphics, sort of? + Maybe 10% of the atmosphere of the original (announcer, some sounds, and vaguely familiar music) + Guns on a car (thats always a plus) + Cheap, when in a deal  CONS - A very flat game, just select a race, press some WASD, go back to menu, press some upgrade buttons, loose all cash, repeat. No real consequence for loosing many races in a row. - No challenges and almost no reason to actually win races (we found that its more benefitial to just stay back, shoot and collect stuff) - Too easy to win (if you want to win), even on the icy track - Basically just a grinding game, but with little reward - Weird multiplayer at best (played with a friend; often we would get different races/disconnects; there wasn't any lobby or ready check to make sure we both are in the same race and ready to race) - No online competition when playing with friends, it seems - It's tagged as Co-op, but we didn't find a way to play cooperatively anywhere - I couldn't change the controls for some reason  VERDICT: A simple casual racing game. It would be good for kids, if there wasn't so much shooting in it. To appropriate audiences however, it offers no excitement a no real sense of reward or incentive to keep playing, even though there is some stuff to unlock. If you remember the 1996 Death Rally, and feel nostalgic, play the original. If you want some wacky racing fun with friends, look elsewhere.  In the screenshots and the video, the game looked like it lives up to the legacy, it promised fast paced, on the edge racing, filled with adrenalin, excitement and rampage. But sadly, it doesn't deliver. Which is a big shame, it definitely had potential. Sure, the game was probably ment to be just a mobile app and it might be fun there, but for some serious gaming or even just some multiplayer fun, it is, as Jeremy Clarkson would say, a mild cheddar.

56	This isnt even worth my 1$
57	I played the original Death Rally when it was fresh off the presses from Apogee. It remains to this day one of the best arcade racing games ever made, right up there with F-Zero. The controls were precise, from the art of cornering with bad tires to the science of cutting the shortest distances on the track. The cars were distinguishable; while it was just a system of upgrading from worst to best, it made sense for the goal at hand and always kept the challenge fresh. It was a game that worked through the limitations of the age.  This remake, however, is abominable. The controls are bad, the camera angle is worthless and removes one of the core elements of the original (namely the top-down perspective), and the cars all feel the same. The character is just... gone. Given all the advantages of the modern game engines, Raven has grabbed for everything and missed the point entirely.
58	Great concept, poorly executed. As for gameplay and control wise, absolutely horrbible, not something worth the price they ask for it.
59	Where is the death rally? I win a race without shooting a bullet.. Deception is really the right word. Might aswell pick up the original and sell it instead of this crap.
60	Not even close to original.... Kinda Meh.... sadly....
61	They have killed the fun so i canÂ´t recomend the game. The old one was challenging as you had to win every race if you want to unlock new weapons, get better positions on the general scoreboard and get new and fast cars. It was the kind of racing game that made you feel proud when you win and mad when someone kill you in the last lap.  If you want to revive the experience this game is not for you. Why?

So there is no challenge, there is no fun, just an 'meh iÂ´m gonna play it' game.
62	A mix of Micromachines and Destruction Derby. I didn't play the original but this remake is ok. Extremely repetitive but also addictive with all upgrades and stuff that gives it that 'gotta catch them all' feel.  3/5
63	A simple yet fun, fast racing shooter. Death Race is the kind of game best suited to being played when you don't feel like deeply immersing yourself, the controls are simple, the difficulty is pretty balanced and the gameplay is enjoyable. Featuring an isometric camera the game lets you keep an eye on everything whilst making it easy to lineup weapon shots, besides the races the game lets you customise your cars with upgrades and weapon selections adding a slight level of depth to what is otherwise a casual game. With a low entry price and simple gameplay mechanics, this is a great game to play if you want something to wind down with.
64	Like the original Death Rally, this game is all about short bursts of play and upgrading your car / weapons on the way. However missing in this new version compared to the original is the ranking board, pedestrians (no blood in this version), good music (albeit this can be changed to your own tracks I believe) and the option to choose your own sabotage on your opponents in the store. It also would've been handy to save up money as you will need to spend everything earned after each race. (even if your current car is fully upgraded, the money is lost in that case)  All in all I still like the game alot, even tho it's been a bit toned down.
65	A really fun and addictive game. Great for a bit of intense action that you can pick up and put down as you need.
66	I enjoyed 1st hour of this game, you drive around on small laps and destroy opponents with weapons to unlock new cars. But then you realize it is just repetitive work, drive, unlock new car, drive-win, unlock new upgrade and in the end you just drive around to unlock new car and the enjoyment slowly dies. Not for a long playthrough.
67	You see everything there is to see in the first ten minutes of play. Losing a race doesn't knock you out of the game, and you still get money from it. Getting wrecked isn't a game over, just a minor setback. Stripped-down, barebones. Kinda like this review!
68	I wish I could give a 'thumbs sideways' rating.  I put a lot of hours into this game, but honestly it was for the sake of completeness. I'd already played pretty far into it by the time I got seriously bored and decided just to power through.  There are very, very few tracks in this game. Get ready to play them over and over and over. There's a good variety of cars, but they all have exactly the same kinds of upgrades. Their handling characteristics and stats are different but otherwise their capabilities are identical. The AI is rarely challenging, and when it IS challenging it seems like that stems entirely from being given unfair advantages.  It's a fun game to kill a little time in, but not really worth $10. It's not a patch on the original, I'm sorry to say.  If you can get it for less than $5 and you just absolutely must have a bird's-eye-view driving game with shooty cars, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your time/money.
69	I loved the original Death Rally. I posted many hours playing the game with friends over LAN. When I saw this on sale a year or so ago, I gobbled it up. Unfortunately, I did not do due dilligence to see how the game works. Instead of earning money and saving to buy cars/upgrades you are forced to find the parts in maps that you play. I kept trying to get into the game, but at the $5 or so I paid for it I don't want to spend any more time with it.   The graphics are nice, and the explosions are fun. The items to destroy on the maps are great, and add some excitement. It is auto fire, which might be able to be turned off but still turned me off. I mostly didn't like the career mode, but if you didn't play the original it could be fun. I wouldn't recommend it based on what I was expecting.
70	A simple premise leads to a simple game... Not exactly complicated, though nor was the predecessor. Get it if it's cheap... otherwise, pass.
71	Original seemed better and i only had the demo.  Was looking forward to this game short lived 4hrs max and no replayability
72	Not something I would want to play again, but after a about an hour, I realized I was wasting my time on the wrong game. It's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ and repetitive. 5/10
73	 Summary[/h2] Really, it's a pretty good game, and the gameplay is fun, but it's nothing compared to the original. It's got some glaring issues in immersion and progression that other reviews have pointed out, so I don't recommend it. However, I recommend the original, and it's free on Remedy's website.  So here's what I suggest you do:  Go here:  http://remedygames.com/games/     Find Death Rally   Find the line: 'For a touch on nostalgia you can download the original Death Rally for free.'   Click on 'for free'   Enjoy original game, because it's way better than this one.   After loving every bit of it, buy this game to support the developer.  
74	+ kinda fun (at first) + MP is (was) fun  - chance to win based on luck (loot from crates, shadowman, ) - game makes impression to be abandoned half-way (just several tracks, no additional value, ... ) - abandoned MP (nobody plays anymore) - achievements based on luck and grind, not skills
75	collecting parts to get new wepons and cars is fun, but the controls are painfull and non intuative, the goal of the game is almost up to luck as you need to get the correct pickups to kill the last target and if that was not bad enough, the story missions are almost all greatly favoring your opponents. I played a lot because it is addictive, but by no means is it a game I would recomend.
76	I have fond memories of the original Death Rally from the DOS era. With that in mind, I have mixed feelings about this remake. It wasn't really a bad game, but I have a few issues with it. I didn't like how you had to spend all your money after a race. I didn't like how you had to collect different resources for different unlocks, because that removes your choice in favour of a (sort-of, but relatively even) random element. I didn't like that nitro cannot be bought before a race (I'm not really sure if it was like that back in the old days though). This particular design decision turned me away in the end: you have no way of preparing for the last match, it all depends on your luck of finding nitro/ammo in the boxes.  In the end, it was fun, but come to think of it, I didn't really enjoy the races either, I only did them to progress with the cars and upgrades... So, in short, I wouldn't recommend this.
77	Not sure when or why I bought this game, but I'm really hoping it was on sale for a buck or something when I did. Just trying to clear out my backlog of games on steam when i came across this pile.  I guess it's not so bad for a dollar, but not for the normal asking price. Controls are very poor, the story is... well there's not really a story. It's just not a very fun game.  Took 4 hours to play through the main missions, and I won't be picking it up again.
78	A couple of years ago the masterminds at Remedy Entertainment released a revamped version of their old classic racing game: Death Rally. Once I started playing it I had incredible difficulties to quit it until I beat it. The driving and purchasing upgrades and weapons was super fun! There was a story mode but I guess I didnât get how it worked. I just played the regular races until I was at the end and then I got a picture of George Lucas talking some smack at me. The game is really fun but repetitive. Itâs also quite easy except for the end boss that is extremely difficult. I donât know if I really appreciated that but I beat him so thatâs all that matters at the end.
79	I love this game, mostly because I loved the original one. I can assure you it's loads of fun.  However, I think it's a pity that they don't have the old shop-like hiring system (sabotage or others are all random propositions); and most of all, I think the online/multiplayer part of the game is a high potential totally wasted in this version. Maybe in the future, they will come up with another more complete game.  Overall, I'm still a big fan and defininitely recommend it as a standard MUST-HAVE game.  Enjoy ! ;)
80	It's a fun game on steam. Yay!! Well it isn't bad. I liked the missions, the tracks but the controls took quite a lot of time to get used to. The rest of the game is fun, addictive and magnificent. The graphics are great and the explosions just look right. I give this a 8 out of 10.
81	Probably the worst remake ever. Or one of them.  The original Death Rally was 100 times better than this. Do not buy!
82	Didn't play for a while ... all stats reset &gt; uninstall.
83	This game is very blatantly an iOS game, with little accommodation made for the PC users. If you can get it cheap (or free), it's a fun little way to waste some time, but it's not worth the asking price, which is jacked up by the all too common 'PC tax' on iOS ports. If you don't mind a lot of short, repetitive races and a slow grind on upgrades though, it's good enough mechanically. I would recommend using a controller to play it.
84	Garbage. The handling is beyond terrible. The difficulty is just... wrong. The game is not a worthy reboot of its predecessor.
85	no... wase of time like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a grill and nameing your new recipie dave.
86	.
87	Both Death Rally games are great! Their Roots came from the Apogee Software DOS Version of this awesome Game from my Childhood &amp; Teenhood Days. Can't wait for the Original DOS Verison of this game to be on Steam.  With 8 Different Cars, 3 Special Add-Ons, 7 Different Weapons, a Nitro Boost, Online Mode &amp; a Story Mode, this is NO Sunday Drive when it comes to the Enhanced Remake of Death Rally!
88	What's more fun than looking down on cars murdering each other? Not much! For those that want to indulge, Death Rally delivers. The control is good (with a gamepad), the graphics are full of eye candy and if you can find someone else to play with, it makes for some intense MP racing.   I reviewed the game at Techgage:  http://techgage.com/article/top-down_racing_destruction_death_rally_review/ 
89	$3 well spent! Awesome little game. Easy to pick up any play a couple hundred rounds. Wish more people would play multiplayer though.
90	For a Super Sprint clone, Death Rally is pretty impressive. The car handling actually feels right with an analog stick, but it does take a little getting used to around the hard turns. There is a standard assortment of weapons and vehicle types. Plus, each vehicle has three basic upgrades which includes speed, handling, and armor. The unlock system for weapons and vehicles offers an incentive system that isn't overly challenging.  The game is not deep by any stretch, but it manages to include a nice little short story along with the races. Races typically last only about 60 seconds providing a quick fix. There aren't too many maps, but what is included is fun and the game has a nice variety of challenges and achievements. Super Sprint was one of my favorite race games back in the day and Death Rally helped me revisit some of those lost memories.
91	I remember the original game from my childhood. It was a real classic and one of my favorite games. I bought this remake immidiatly after I found out it was made. Played it many hours and noticed that it was still the same old game I knew from my childhood. For anybody else who remembers the old game this new one will remind you of the fond memories playing it. Its action racing game as its finest.
92	As a fan of the 1996 original I'm very happy with the way the new version turned out. Really fun!!
93	A pretty good remake of the original. It goes 3D while keeping a very similar feel to that old DOS version. It could've done with more cars and tracks though. The sound effects from the original are also not present. Most importantly however, where is Duke!? Recommended but don't throw away your original Death Rally because you won't be 100% satisfied with this one.

95	$3 well spent! Awesome little game. Easy to pick up any play a couple hundred rounds. Wish more people would play multiplayer though.
96	Not a bad purchase. I grabbed this as soon as I saw it just because of nostalgia, the original death rally is one of the best games i have ever played. It would probably still be fun to play today, and i recommend you check that out also. This version has upgraded graphics, and lasts about 5-8 hours max to beat on single player and get 99% of achievements. Multiplayer is supposed to extend that time, but so far there are no other players... you just keep waiting for other people to join and they never do. This game has less character and a bit less snappy controls than the original, but nonetheless it is good value for the price and I do recomment it.
97	Its fast, its fun, its addictive, remember the good old classic 'Super Cars'? Death Rally brings the memorys back to the good old Amiga days. A must have, buy buy buy!
98	Very good game. And it's good to play with a controller!  But why i can't feel the good old feeling, what i had with the original one?  oh yeeees....there are no humans on the streets......i want to feel the blooooood unter the tires..... :D :((((
99	this is a fast, fun game. My only complaint would be that the levels are much too short , with the tracks being short and only about 4 laps max. Maybe they get longer later on.
100	Great as ever
101	This game is not an AA++++ title, but it brings a f*** lot of fun if you play it with your friends. must have party-game! :D (the first 30 minutes you think 'omg what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, controls are bad - but once you can play it, it makes fun ^^)
102	Classis remake. Looks easy, but is actually hard to master. The top down driving makes a comeback with this game. Try beat those bosses, in any class and you are truly a Death Rally fan!
103	Used to play this on my phone..its ight 3/5
104	Simple and disgustingly addicting. Loved the original (and played it to death), same formula works even 15 years later. :)
105	It certainly resembles the old Death Rally, but the controls are harder. I liked the old one better.
106	Mindlessly awsome!
107	was a fan of the original and admittedly still prefer it but I cant deny that this one is still fun. glad death rally wasnt forgotten like so many other classics.
108	Really fun racing game has plenty of customisation as far as a racing game goes, has a decent amount of races that if you're able to unlock the right weapons can be easy to win because you're destroying the other racers cars. The visuals aren't great but they're ok the audio as far as a racing goes is ok, I think I beat this game in like a day so it's not hard haven't tried it on hard beat on normal though and that difficulty was at least for me made the game not to hard but not to easy either so there was enough of a challenge to make it fun but it wasn't so easy that it was aggravatingly hard so that it wasn't fun.
109	Get the original for free at  http://www.joystiq.com/game/death-rally/download/death-rally-for-windows-full-game/  , buy this one to support Remedy, then never play it. The original is so much better it's not even funny.
110	Mindlessly awsome!
111	Fun remake of the 1990s classic that brought back a lot of memories. Decent presentation and good value, don't expect anything too revolutionary though.
112	If you have nice memory from the Original(?) title this could be your game. However a littlebit short :)
113	Cool, classic game, plenty of playability, reminds me of Supercars on the Amiga, upgrade your cars with weapons and mods as you go, good fun game.
114	Awesome, this title is a perfect rework of the classic death rally. The same style, the same playability, the same atmosphere but with new grapichs. If you played the original Death Rally this game will make you feel the same way. Totally worth it. 10/10
115	I remeber loving the old death rally and this is just an updated version of it. which is fine by me, still love it.
116	I played this game on DOS, I always wanted to play it in current generation graphics. Well, here it is. If you were big fan of the DOS version (even if you'r not), never miss this one. This is one of the best games ever, when you start, you will never stop playing until you finish the game, and you may want to play it again and again, it short though.
117	I tried the free weekend and went ahead and bought it. If you liked the original its somewhat similar. You can watch the video to see what the game is like, I got it because of the weapons on the cars, I've always liked that combo in games. After you get to the snow mission in the story section, you can keep replaying it to unlock and upgrade everything (you win about $5k a pop, and since its 5 laps long its easy to just kill everyone on the track). I got my moneys worth at $3.50 its fun for what it is.
118	This is the remake of classic game 'Death Rally' and it does all what remakes are about: better graphics and easy instalation for modern systems. Only problem in this game is death community and while computer AI is better than averange it still does not give the same kick as YOU would do! (Suomessa tehty)
119	Cool top-down vehicle combat game, I got it hoping it would be cool to do some MP games but it seems to have issues all the time and hard to synchronize with others.
120	Very fun and good game! Mix weapons and upgrades with cars, now who wouldn't want to play this?! Nice Visuals too! Recommended!
121	As a fan of the 1996 original I'm very happy with the way the new version turned out. Really fun!!
122	Its fast, its fun, its addictive, remember the good old classic 'Super Cars'? Death Rally brings the memorys back to the good old Amiga days. A must have, buy buy buy!
123	Brings me back to teenage memories playing LAN parties with friends to the original Death Rally, Duke Nukem 3D and Warcraft 2. Great game. Thanks for making this remake. Same good mechanics but better graphics, better GUI. 
124	'Rip-off of Death Race' 'Not as good as the original' 'The xbox controller settings suck'... I don't care this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun game!!!
125	I bought it for the nostalgia. Go exactly what I wanted. 5/10
126	Eight hours of fun. I miss the ladder from the original game. Quite repetetive.
127	Death Rally is pretty Cool! Good graphics, good tunes, and a all round fun game. However it's very hard to get first place even on easy mode. Now if you keep playing throught the frustration, this game gets better and better. Oh! Almost forgot, WEAPONS, lots and lots of destuctive WEAPONS.  So get out there, and blow up somes digital cars... lol
128	This is a fun pick up and play game with an okay amount of customization but no shortage of unlocking and endless replayability with all the different vehicles and weapons. This game also supports a controller even though it doesn't say so on the store page. I play with an XBOX ONE controller and I can say without a doubt they work and the controls are good but cannot be remapped for the controller, but you can remap keyboard keys. Also when using a controller you can switch easily between the mouse for choosing races and editing cars but you don't necessarily have to as the controller works very well throughout the menus.
129	This game is not an AA++++ title, but it brings a f*** lot of fun if you play it with your friends. must have party-game! :D (the first 30 minutes you think 'omg what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, controls are bad - but once you can play it, it makes fun ^^)

131	Death Rally (this is the new version) is a fun racing game designed with a simple and direct premise. Drive, kill everyone or win the race.  It is not a top game. Just a pastime. Something to play when you want to destroy something or when you only have 30 minutes before leaving the computer.  I recommend getting the discounted price, since this game has been sold for only 1USD.
132	Great game. Simple, addictive, classic!
133	You run... you jump.. you shoot... you wall jump... you... do a lot of things in this game... its part racer, part platformer all... abstact awesome coolness as you race through landscapes that are once at home in the mind's eye as in grand old imagination land no texture edition. The tunes that accompany you seem quite well suited for the game as well.  Just try it out, it's pretty fun both by yourself and with friends and the game has quite a skill ceiling. You just need a few races to get the hang of the game and its quirks but overall its a winner, especially at this low price point. The later tracks make the game more of a platformer than a racer but it's all good fun especially after you master them and can do them at a good clip.   An overlooked and underrated gem.
134	inMomentum is a fast-paced Speedy reflex running game. the world itself looks cool looking, all these platforms floating. reminded me of Super mario galaxy. Great art style, Great music Can be very frustrating especially in harder difficulties. some of the levels were impossible to beat in higher difficulties. Its a game that can be beaten in a short amount of time 
135	Poor controls and very boring. Feels like an early access game that was abandoned before any content was added. Also, multiplayer either doesn't work or nobody plays, probably both.
136	  Step learning curve, Fun when you learn. Fast paced!
137	Fun game movment is nice with plenty of air control. the music is very nice give each level a wonderfuly zen feeling. however this game has alot wrong, leaderboards can only be veiwed at the end of a run and only show top ten in the world. settings must be changed everytime you change level, to get to the next map you must quit back to the main menu. The list gose on but nothing here actualy breaks the game once you are in a game you wont want to be anywhere else.
138	It has a Xotic kind of feel to it, but doesn't offer anything remotely that good. There's supposed to be a multiplayer element, but without any people playing it, this game doesn't have anything to deliver, except disappointment.
139	I've had dreams like this game. If Oculus-Supported in the future, then a definite must-have. If anything, just freerunning in the Freestyle level.  EDIT: Want this game to be easier, or Freestyle to be more fun? Play some AAAAAaaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaa!!!! (For the awesome) and learn how to fall (as in, learn how to aim your falls, especially at/beyond terminal velocity); and achieve the highest Ninja achievement in this game (the first level helps to learn), and it'll be a level you'll lose track of time in (didn't realize an hour passed while inside Freestyle until I wrote this review/recommendation, and saw the in-game clock).  Being a 300/kph ninja that doesn't hit the ground? It's possible, and fun as hell. I can't wait for Oculus-Support for this. This is a pretty underrated gem.  EDIT EDIT: As a suggestion to the developers (if still active), we need the ability to make maps. Although the vanilla set is fun and all, I want to check out other maps others would make, or come up with my own crazy-â¥â¥â¥ parkour maps.
140	inMomentum is one of those games that is a crebral feast of a platformer. Visually intensive as well as staggering in scale and scope. It makes you put every ounce of your capacity of lateral thinking into dancing and skipping across the massive, suspended maps in the fastest times possible, and punishes your dumb â¥â¥â¥ if you messed up a jump.  This is a GREAT game. But sadly.......inMomentum is a huge disappointment.  The game's trailer touts its 'Competitive First-Person Racing', 'Various Game Modes' with 'Over 30 Achievements'. But at time of writing the online multiplayer does not work, this in only one mode of play, and the achievements might as well as place holders because they have no funciton. Basically the game is not finished, and this almost throws me into a rage, because this is a FANTASTIC game, but if I can't play with other people Its nothing but a pointless time sink. I had bought this game with one steam friend specifically in mind who would go bananas for a game like this. But I can't play with them because the online is essentially broken.   So until the developer fixes it, inMomentum is an awesome, paid beta.
141	This game is cool gets boring fairly quick for me.. i do reccomend it though! its cool, its different and its fun to play with friends.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp7vzusrRes 
142	I want to like this game, but there are a few things holding it back:  1) It just doesn't feel tight enough. Slipping at the same hurdle for the hundredth time is fine if you have a solid system where you can count your mistakes and rectify them--think Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy et al--but when you're slipping here and floating there it makes for a very frustrating experience.  2) There's nothing to the single player. Honestly, it's not worth bothering with unless you're aiming to practice for multiplayer, because what you get is a set of empty arenas.  3) They've made some strange graphical choices. In places it's borderline beautiful--a cross between Mirror's Edge and Marble Blast--and then you've got this horribly saturated collection of glares for an avatar.
143	I am not normally a fan of jumping games. I tend to get frustrated easily and don't usually have the dexterity required to be very successful at them. That said, inMomentum is a jumping game, but it shifts the paradigm somewhat in that the jumping is tethered to the mouse rather than the keyboard. Initially this seemed like a strange choice, but in reality, the game is so focused around jumping that it makes the most sense and gives the player the quickest control method. inMomentum features clean and bright Unreal engine graphics as well as a nicely made tutorial. I was especially impressed by the excellent soundtrack that matches well with the action without resorting to a pounding bass line. I liked the music so much, I would purchase this game just for the soundtrack. That said, if you enjoy games like Mirrors Edge or Prince of Persia where acrobatics take center stage, there is a lot to like in inMomentum.
144	Feels like a poor version of Mirror's Edge. In this you have no sense of weight or presence and the controls just feel too floaty for my liking. Shame because graphically it certainly feels like a mix of Rez and Mirror's Edge. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this.
145	It's like a bad Mirror's Edge.
146	I was like what is this game about to a friend and he told me im just supposed to go really fast then I started to really dig it. Well it is good and you should play it. The end.
147	The default controls are really awkward and difficult to get used to. They can be customized, but there's just so many of them it is not really worth the effort. Just expect a steep learning curve if you play. This flaw could be easily fixed if the game just had controller support.  Once you do learn the controls, you realize the game doesn't have much to offer. There are only 12 levels and you do exactly the same thing in all of them. The two solo game modes are literally identical, and the 4 game difficulty levels create no perceptible changes to the levels, so they might as well be identical too.   The game clearly tailors to multiplayer races; however, no one is every playing multiplayer so the main source of content the game offers can never be accessed.  Solo is boring. Multiplayer is impossible. inMomentum is an all-around failure of a game.
148	A nightmare. Feels like they took the Xen platforming sections of Half Life 1 and based a whole game around them. Clunky and awkward and miserable. Certified Bundle Crap.
149	For all strafe jumps lovers from CS/HL/Quake/etc. must have. speed.jumpimg. precision. In nuttshell, Also usefull for people who just started playing FPS as its helps geet use to movement/jumping/etc (approoved by my gf).
150	I wanted to like this game. The videos made it look like great fun. However in practice, the controls were abysmal.  I instantly struggled with them, and even after a few minutes of trying and patience, the situation didn't seem to be improving.  If the controls were made more intuitive, then this probably would have been a fun game. As-is, I honestly don't know, because I gave up in frustration.
151	inMomentum, a 1st person platformer based on running around a level collecting spheres. There is a large focus on speed, as you are encouraged to blast though the levels as quick as possible; as you are only fighting a timer. Unfortunately, the game feels very clumsy. While I'm sure you could master it in time, any time I tried to pick up any speed or do anything interesting I would fall into a pit (the levels are made of very small platforms and 90% pits). The only way to complete the level is to slowly walk though it in order to be careful, which in turn becomes very boring.  Would not play again.

153	Really fun game. Bought it when it first came out and even now I still find myself playing it from time to time. Great soundtrack and awesome graphics.
154	I DON'T REMEMBER IF I ACTUALLY PAID FOR THIS OR NOT BUT IF I DID I TOTALLY REGRET THAT
155	Absolute garbage. I went into this with the thought that it would be a freerunning super speed simulator. It isn't. It's clunky, unresponsive and just through-and-through terrible.
156	I bought this game from a bundle and this game looks nice for me for once.I play this game and I disappointed. Gameplay so bad, running and jumping mechanics not good.If you big fun like this game maybe you like it but you dont like kind a this game you dont buy it.
157	dude more people need to play this.
158	This game is about as close to pure fun as you can possibly get. If you liked Mirror's Edge in the slightest you'll melt over inMomentum.
159	A very pure racing platformer. Looks nice too.
160	First-person platforming. Just let that sink in. A game where you can't see your own body and have literally no point of spacial reference is going to create some problems. A game that lacks any kind of polish or feedback on top of this is going to create more problems. A game with poorly-placed checkpoints on top of depth perception issues and a lack of shimmer is going to create exponentially more problems.
161	i wish this had controller support
162	I've craved this game for a long time, and when I finally bought it, I was left very disappointed.  In a game where the gameplay it's uniquely about jumping and running around, if you built a physic engine that makes you feel as heavy and agile as an elephant, you did it wrong. Terribly wrong.  If you like jumpmaze things buy DOOM2, then play the Jumpmaze mod with Zandronum; it's easier than you think, full of tutorials and, despite obvious engine's limitations, you can fill it up with HD textures and fancy effects so that even if it will never look as good as inMomentum, it will be an enjoyable jumpmaze experience. Definitely better than this.  Average aesthetics, not remarkable, not despicable.  +Sound Effects &amp; Music -Physics Engine +Concept -Execution  If you need ratings:  Graphic: 7 Sound: 7 Longevity: ? Gameplay: 2 4/10  I am aware that a 2 is a very low rating but... As I've already said: if it's all about jumps and the physics are bad... They did it wrong. I recommend you to try the demo before buying it, if you like the game and feel comfortable with its physics, I guess that 10$ could be a fair price.   http://store.steampowered.com/app/284460  Deadcore does what InMomentum tried to achieve, but does it right. Buy this instead.
163	Played for 30 minutes and never felt any momentum. Very floaty and unprecise. Better stick to Defrag!
164	If you expected a game similar to the Mirror's Edge Time Trial mode; prepare for (major) disappointment. The idea is there, it's just isn't executed in a fun way. The graphics are clean, which I like, Mirror's Edge used the same sort of style, but besides that it really can't be compared. Do like me and go play Mirror's Edge instead of wasting time and money on this thing.  How many times have I used the words Mirror's Edge now ? Mirror's Edge. I lost count. Mirror's Edge !  [Rating: 67/100]
165	Slightly bruised Mirror's Edge methadone. If you like jumping first person platformers with annoying tutorials, then give this a shot! Right after you're done eating raw fish and redecorating the cave you live in, Gollum.
166	I do not recommend this game
167	For such a basic game it really isn't as bad as I thought. The game focuses soley on movement and is great for training your patience and planning. It presents a new and interesting way of moving across an environment similar to Mirror's Edge with the exception of a few twists. It's very refreshing and addictive if you can get past the boring tutorial :P I'll be playing this one for a while.
168	Forrest Gump in steroids?
169	The controls are awkward, unusual, inadequate, badly implemented, and nearly impossible to use properly. Even if you rebind the keys, there is simply no way to execute multiple commands while using both the mouse and keyboard to move about the game world. Sometimes it is necessary to use power-ups, and having five fingers in each hand is simply not enough for inMomentum. I am certain that after excessive amounts of practice, it becomes possible, but I am not sure if the trouble is worth it. There are barely any sound effects of any kind. You will hear the occasional beeps and bloops every once in a while, but that is all besides the continuous uninspired music. The game does not give you any indication that you are actually running around and jumping. There is no feeling involved with the movement and game physics. It is as if you are gliding from place to place, then floating, gliding some more, all with odd physics that do not blend well with the game's setting or anything that makes any sense at all. Timing your glides and floats so that you land on the platforms requires mostly luck, as the controls are incredibly imprecise, and do not allow for the player to develop any real skills or techniques in order to accomplish each level rapidly and properly. inMomentum does not have any story or introduction as to why you are doing this gliding and floating around on platforms collecting orbs and doing time trials. There is no campaign of any kind to speak of, and the only aspect of the game that provides feelings of accomplishment are found in online leaderboards for the two limited game modes available. The game is so bare bones, in fact, that you will wonder if it was actually finished, and if the developer should actually be expecting money for it. inMomentum is a cheap, unfinished, unpolished, bore. Play it every once in a while for five to ten minutes at a time in order to maximize your fun with it.  inMomentum is mediocre.
170	Someone took the worst part of FPS games, jumping puzzles, and made an entire game out of it.
171	pretty first person freedom-of-movement racer. speedy goodness for tribes fans
172	Reminds me of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Not the easiest of things to get the hang of, but once you get into the flow it feels fantastic.
173	Won't lie I'm a little bit disappointed it's very multiplayer focused and because it's such an unrestricted game can only imagine the level experts completely destroying the noobs. On the plus side the time trial and general mode are great fun, really does cure a Mirrors Edge itch, it's also quite weightless and fast too when you gain momentum.
174	Wonderfully addictive, and well put together. I can't however, help but feel that the developers(Digital-Arrow) skimped on gameplay and plot, and let Unreal Engine do the work for them. With the Unreal Tournament dev kit, blender and music, this probably wouldn't take too long to make yourself.   On the bright side though, InMomentum is fun, and encourages multiplayer play, even though there are never any servers to play on and I've yet to see multiplayer at all.

176	Awesome timekilling! Jumping from walls to walls, running around towns and trying to be top1 player!  5/5
177	I hope you're good at bunny hops, wall jumps, and pixel perfect timing, because thats what it will take to get a reasonable time on the levels in this game. This is for speed running fanatics. Others need not apply. I highly recommend.
178	I seem to be the only person who actually enjoys playing this game.  Give it a try, it's pretty neat, trust me. Once you get a hang of the controls, it becomes really fun.
179	Excellent game, recommended !! - but, Iâd say maybe torrent it or something first because my friends donât seem to like it at all. ~ So much potentialâ¦ I hope these guys can get a bit of money behind them and develop it further..

181	really fun parkour style game
182	I seem to be the only person who actually enjoys playing this game.  Give it a try, it's pretty neat, trust me. Once you get a hang of the controls, it becomes really fun.
183	I see that user reviews has mostly positive, which is not fare cause this is an,  AWESOME  game highly recommend it
184	I don't recommend this game if you wanna play online, but I highly recommend it if you're playing alone/with your friends/family @ home. If there was a sequel to this game and the anti-cheat is powerful, I'd buy it. Lots of hackers there in the top 10 leaderboard, winning stages with impossible timings. Good game but weak security.  Edit: This game should have traps/anything to slow you down in the stages. Just a suggestion.
185	Fun and challenging, though seem no one play it online now.
186	needed over 7 minutes for the first course - looked at the leaderboards and saw that someone managed it in 23 seconds...   nice soundtrack, nice graphics. Controls are good but it certainly takes time to get used to them.

190	When I first saw snuggle truck in my steam library, I asked why? Why was there a game called snuggle truck in my steam library? This question haunted my very existence for days. Did I buy it? Did I get it in some humble bundle I spent ten cents on? Was it a sigh from some great cosmic God? I hesitated to play this game because its name had suggested such unimaginable terror. Would it consume my very soul? Every time I opened the steam client I would see it there, waiting for me, waiting for a moment of weakness where I would finally break down and play it. I fought off the urge for weeks, but deep down I realized that one day I would have to play it. The day finally came, I could no longer fight against it, I clicked on it and installed it. So trucks, such ponies, much physics.
191	Plays well, no issues and fun. Some levels trickier than others. Lasted me 48 hours getting everything. Pretty fun and worth it. Clean HUD.
192	I have no idea how I got this game or why and I don't care. Its a truck of snuggles and happiness. Seriously though this game is alot of fun once you get into it. A small and simple but fun concept.
193	I think that's a good game but like a flash game don't waste your money like this games in steam there are lots of games.This is 2D ancient game you can like this but don't give it too much money..  GÃ¼zel bir oyun ama sanki kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kken oynadÄ±ÄÄ±mÄ±z kral oyun oyunlarÄ± gibi bir oyun o yÃ¼zden bence para verilmemeli koleksiyoncular alabilir veya benim gibi 5-6 yaÅlarÄ±nda kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k kardeÅiniz varsa...
194	A ridiculous game. Colorful graphics. Animals. Trucks. Explosives(?).   Tons of fun for a game that is pretty wacky in it's own right.
195	It's lit
196	The most wicked time you will ever have in a singleplayer game, you will be on the edge of your seat with the stiffest boner to have ever been seen this side of the galaxy. The graphics were just wonderful, all those fluffy little â¥â¥â¥â¥s just looked fabulous and the physics in this game were just superb to what real life has to offer. Another well executed asset to this game was the DLC, you can quickly and easily customize your game to whichever playstyle you prefer. Want to be a patriotic American saving starving African children? You can, now, only on Snuggle Truck. I highly recommend buying twelth copies of this game, and just play the night away, I promise you, your â¥â¥â¥â¥ will burst into flames and you won't regret it. Just come prepared with a couple dozen bottles of lube.
197	This game was named 'Smuggle Truck' before; a game about delivering stowaways from USA to Mexico. that idea was fun and the games was good when i played the DRM-free version.  In this version, the passengers become dolls and the destination is to deliver them to the zoo! the question is why should we go throw dangerous roads and valleys to arrive zoo?!  I've played it on Windows 8.1 64Bit and there were some bugs in game but they're not really affect gameplay.  but beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay made me really enjoy it and that's why i recommend this game.
198	list this under the games i thought would be dumb and throw-away and then also list it under games i was completely wrong about. THIS GAME IS FUN! if you like games like Trials then you will like this.
199	Think 'Happy Wheels' only you lose if you drop all the stuff you have in your car.
200	YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAME WHO WOULDN'T ITS AMAZING!
201	I haven't actually played this yet, but the concept is so entirely awesome I just tried to buy it a second time.
202	Oh. My. GOD - this game is teh AWESOME!!!!!!! It's like Thief, X-COM, Baldur's Gate, Deus Ex, Planescape Torment, Wing Commander, Fallout, X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter, Warcraft 2, Metroid, Super Mario, Privateer, Quake 2, Prince of Persia, Day of the Tentacle, Unreal Tournament, Simcity, Populous, Doom, Elite, Grim Fandango, Zelda, Civilization, Starcraft, and the Half-Life series all rolled into one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I also will never forgive Creston for trolling/gifting it to me, the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Now everyone thinks I like trucks and snuggling. Which i don't. At all.
203	Greatest.. game.. EVER
204	This has got to be one of the most beautiful, artistic games I've ever played. Not only is it positively morally influencial on the new generation by saving cuddly animals, in a modest transport vehicle. What differentiates Snuggle Truck from the other modern games, is the generous lack of over-sexualised women. Over-sexualised women in today's videogames is what's ruining the industry, and this is a breath of fresh air from the otherwise disgusting misogynist priviledged men in our videogame world.   Snuggle Truck is a gender-friendly game that I highly reccomend you let your children play, and even you play!  Games need to be more like this game, long live Snuggle Truck.  9.5/10
205	Buyer beware Cuteness overload may cause diabetes and unfathomable desire for plushy squeeks.  After this went on sale for only just a dollar there is no reason not to get it. It has very simple concept to keep your truck steady as you race towards the goal with plushys intact through various obstacles. The game difficulty gradually increases with each tier level to the point where my OCD to achieve all medals becomes rage inducing. Soon I found playing this game in small doses was for the best.  Overall Its a must buy for anyone that wants to kill a little time its a game to play inbetween games.
206	GAME OF THE YEAR
207	Nice little physics puzzle game that seems like a racing game but isn't.
208	Said There Was A Brony Mode.  Wasn't Lying.  10/10

210	If you like games with cute graphics, catchy music and simple fun gameplay you could do much worse than this.   With only accelerate, decelerate and tilt as your controls, the objective is to take your truck through an obstacle course without allowing your cuddly toys to fall out.   I really like it. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes and then put down, and the upbeat music puts a nice big grin on my face.   What more can you ask for?
211	Game of the year.   Get on its level.
212	Play this with kids! They'll love it and you won't get bored!
213	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based 2D racing game. It feels like a constant balancing act between speed and accuracy... PC version of 'Up Hill Racing: Hill Climb'(available in Google Play) but far better than it... :)
214	Snuggle truck was a good game. I liked it, but it was hard at some parts. &lt;3 YOU SHOULD GET IT CUPQUAKE DID IT!!!
215	Emphasis on MANLY.
216	OMFG this is actually a fun game.  OK when I first saw this in a bundle I though ... it has cards. Install -&gt; run -&gt; cards -&gt; uninstall. But this is actually a fun, and at times annoying, driving game. Smuggle, see other reviews for the original game, a bunch of toys to the finish line. Bronze, Silver &amp; Gold based on min time and # of passengers Ark medal if you get everybody there Speed time to get at least 1 there in a minimum time (he's the one full of .... ummmm .... stuffing. Sniff Sniff)  Pro: Fun Alternative vehicles / looks Lots of awards &amp; achieves for good &amp; bad driving Steam cards Tons of fun Cheap ($1.50 on sale - free in some bundles) Level editor and community Tutorial level Small install Low system requirements Fun to play when your .... (drunk, stoned, medicated, whatever your choice of impairment)  Con: Bronie vehicle Limited replay once you get all 5 awards for that level Limited controls Harder levels just suck. I'd say the difficulty and skill required ramps up too quickly but just sucks says it quicker.  This is s silly fun casual driving game. If you want to waste a few hours for a few bucks, get it. It's not Asseto or even NFS, but it is fun. PS I prefer the Mexicans. 
217	Euro Truck Simulator with soul.
218	It really is a game about farming demonically possessed pigeons with an unending appetite for human flesh.
219	It really is a game about farming demonically possessed pigeons with an unending appetite for human flesh.
220	this game good
221	Ever since I started playing Snuggle Truck I've considered returning my computer chair, because I only use the edge now. The first fuzzy you get is like main lining heroine, your eyes go wide, you think your heart stops, and you know you can never stop after that. The rest of the game is like walking a balance beam between two motorcycles doing wheelies in a cage full of tigers. Don't miss out on the excitement, get to snuggling today.
222	Snuggle Truck, formally 'Smuggle Truck' is a fun little game where you are tasked to safely deliver the animals to the zoo. Basic controls: W,A,S,D and space bar make it easy to pick up. Great to kill some time and the carnival type of music gets your head bobbin'. This is one of those games that you would play at work when bored. If you can pick it up cheap enough (sale or coupon) it is well worth it as there are something like 20,000 levels!
223	Euro Truck Simulator with soul.
224	
225	It looks cute, but then again, practically all casual games look cute these days. The game works as a handheld game, but unfortunately not as a PC game. I'm not talking about the technical aspect here, but the gameplay aspect. It's fun in small doses, but there's no real depth. You drive a truck (really, really) with stuffed animals in the back and have to reach the end of the level with, if possible, all animals still in your vehicle. Sounds easy ? Well, it's not. So that's where the replay value kicks in. With this many levels (thousands !) it will take you quite some time to perfect them all. It's a good game, just don't expect too much from it.  [Rating: 65/100]
226	What a fantastic kids game! Found myself getting addicted.   I will need to get my kids to get the harder levels completed for me LOL, I dont have the skillz.  This is actually called 'SMUGGLE TRUCK', description taken from the website;   http://smuggletruck.com/    Smuggle Truck was inspired by the frustration our friends have experienced in trying to immigrate to the United States. With such a troublesome issue being largely avoided in popular media, especially video games, we felt the best way to criticize it was with an interactive satire.  In Smuggle Truck, players are driving a truck with passengers in the back, bringing them over a fictional border. This idea originated as a result of learning that the process of legal immigration was not as straightforward as we had assumed. As we lived through a painful 12 months of our friend struggling through the absurd legal minefield that surrounds U.S. immigration, we felt that we should create a game that touches on the issue. The comment was thrown around that 'it's so tough to legally immigrate to the U.S., it's almost easier to smuggle yourself over the border', and thus Smuggle Truck was born. A two-day prototype eventually turned into an iPhone game, with the plan to reach as many players as possible.  Throughout the creation of the game, we maintained a meticulous eye to avoid depicting a specific stereotype or location, instead opting to generalize smuggling to its most basic abstract form. Through user testing and feedback from fellow developers and even random strangers, we worked to maintain a light and humorous representation of a subject that is normally avoided.  With a satirical angle on a real issue, we want to create a game that is fun to play but also stirs up discussion on ways to improve the problematic immigration system in the United States.   C'mon STEAM where is the smuggle DLC?
227	Its very good gaem plz buy
228	Lots of fun :D.
229	So cute SO awesome and its SOOOOOO FUN to play
230	need couple of times to pass the tutorial and got achievement as horrible driver! damn this game is crazy yet unique with it's own gravity style musics, images and backgrounds? 9/10
231	Snuggle truck is an amazing game, would buy again.
232	need couple of times to pass the tutorial and got achievement as horrible driver! damn this game is crazy yet unique with it's own gravity style musics, images and backgrounds? 9/10
233	  Yay, smuggle truck! Better than expected! Of course, it remidns me the Hill Climb Racing. Hard and extreme levels are fun. Remember, small rocks are evil.
234	Snuggle Truck is a strange little game that I purchased because I was dumb enough to buy something simply because it featured something related to something completely different. That is not to say that it was necessarily a bad decision in the end, rather something that I have learned not to do. None the less.  The game is a simple physics game requiring you to get from point A to point B while still keeping your cargo inside of your truck. There isn't really much more to it than that. It's a bare bones game that is great when you feel like having some stupid fun, but is definitely something that could use a little more polish. It gets boring if you play too much of it at once. I suppose in the end it is worth the price of $5.00.  Also, for those curious of the origin of the name, the game was originally named Smuggle Truck and required you to bring foreigners past the border. See, learning can be fun!
235	An ok game, I wouldn't recommend paying more than 2â¬ for it.
236	I like it because it helps to temporarily ease the ceaseless depression that has consumed my life.
237	Snuggle Truck... Just go buy it! It's fun and addictive! I got it for $1.25. It's freakin' Snuggle Truck!
238	What can one say about Snuggle Truck that hasn't been said about life's great events? This ranks right up there with those big life moments. First haircut, first heartbreak, graduation, marriage, your first child, first death of a loved one. Roll those all up together and you barely begin to touch the pure awesomeness that is Snuggle Truck! It's saved suicidal people, it's ended criminal and terrorist standoffs. It's brought comfort to the weary and hope to the hopeless. If you ever needed proof that the Universe is actually a benign, loving place than Snuggle Truck will make you believe!
239	This game is AMAZING!?!?!!: {rqltÂ£FEKOESPGO;KSGRA  So much fun. I hate the giraffe though, long-necked get. Always the bloody giraffe...
240	I've never had so much fun being a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ before!
241	Delivering the finest furries to your location. Seriously though, a really chill game if you want to relax after a hard day of masturbating at home.
242	This game is one of the best games I have ever played. From it's deep and enriching setting to its complex and deep story line it will have you hooked the second you purchase it. The amazing gameplay help convey the amazing story line as well. From start to finish you will be at the egde of your seat wanting to play the next level. This is a must buy for every gamer out there. No other game comes close to the sheer quality of this game. Game of the year by far.
243	very good casual race game. xbox controller support. also android app is good.
244	A half done game, uses the controller part of the time and the keyboard the rest of the time, 110 buttons plus a controller is too much for what should be a simple game.
245	YES!!! this is the best game EVER!!! I COULD PLAY FOR FU.CKING DAYSS!!!! YOU DRIVE A TRUCK, FILLED WITH FLUFFY CUTE ANIMALS, BUT DONT LOSE ONE OF THOSE FU.CKERS OR THE MAFIA WILL BEAT YOUR A.SS IN!!
246	Great game or Greatest game? You be the judge, but only if you say Greatest game ever.
247	Funny jump and run, with all the little twists one would expect. :)
248	Not many games can boast that they'll change the way you view the world, but Snuggle Truck has managed to do just that.  With it's artistic portrayal of modern society, Snuggle Truck perfectly manages to capture the broken and corrupt society we live in. The colourful characters and cars really make you think about whether or not there's any hope left for the human race and, over all, the game delivers in every aspect.  I can't help but feel like the game is trying to make a connection between the teddy giraffe and Barack Obama. While fluffy and lovely on the outside, the giraffe hides something much more sinister. Just like the giraffe tends to fall off the vehicle, Obama tends to lure people into his web of deceit. It's unfortunate that this happens to people even in this day and age, but it shows that we humans have a lot to learn.  8/10 Would recommend.
249	I love this game, its a mixture of old school mario simple level design layouts with 2D racing elements. It is a ton of fun and a good way to kill time as well.   It might seem like a game that only appeals to the younger crowd but I have to tell you, the levels get really challenging and you really have to be good to get the silver medals let alone the gold medals on the harder difficulty's. The game also has a ton of content, it will take even the most hard core snuggle players to get gold on every level with each teddy bear saved.   I give this game a 4/5 with my only gripe that this game should have multiplayer.
250	Don't even get me started on how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tight as â¥â¥â¥â¥ Snuggle Truck is. It's cheap and fun.
251	this game is not as bad as you think this game is fun  worth it
252	Don't even get me started on how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tight as â¥â¥â¥â¥ Snuggle Truck is. It's cheap and fun.
253	From what you see from the screenshots on the Steam Store to the in-game thrill, throughout the game you gain love for the game and later forget that you're in a truck collecting teddy-bears which will later lead to advancing in levels and earning medals etc. Yes, it sounds baby-ish and maybe a little bit weird but hell no! Jump in the truck and grab them bears.  10/10 Snuggle-Truck &lt;3  On a serious note, the game is actually pretty good! The name of the game is admittidly weird and in my opinion it's a little mis-leading. If it wasn't named as it is then I believe this would be a lot more popular. Must buy. ;)

255	Got this game in a indiegala bundle for 2 dollars with other 9 games. Not regreted it ever since.
256	Funny jump and run, with all the little twists one would expect. :)
257	Literally the first level and they drop the see me rollin' bomb. They got balls, I'll tell you that.

259	Totally worth it
260	ok pass time and good for confusing your friends about your game choices
261	Super cute 2d speed-platformer
262	You will find yourself laughing each time these innocent animals fly from the back of your truck. It's really fun! There is also a Brony mode. What else could you ask for?
263	  The best way to sum up this game is 'silly, mindless, fun'.   The game revolves around a simple premise: delivering a truck full of stuffed animals to a zoo before the time runs out. You, the driver, are provided with an incredibly unstable truck with which you must navigate dangerous and uneven terrain. Along the way you will face mountains, mine shafts, and explosive boobytraps. Animals will go flying and your truck will go flipping and halarious action will ensue.   Why any zoo is in such a remote location with such hazardous roads is never explained. The fact that live explosives and life threatning obsticles litter the road doesn't matter. All that matters is that the animals get to the zoo.   Pros:  -Simple graphics  -Users can share and create levels online -Leaderboards  Cons: -Sound effects can get very annoying, very fast -The game crashed several times for unknown reasons  7/10 (The Pros just about outweigh the Cons)
264	Good life waster 52/42
265	This is such a great game. Don't be deceived by the cuddly looks!
266	Game were you literally not suppose to lose your â¥â¥â¥â¥.
267	I think this was originally a mobile game but it's made a good port over to the desktop platform. Like those old flash games that you used to play at school on MouseBreaker back in the day.  Good fun if you can get it cheap; but you won't be playing it long.
268	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. You should play it, if you're not, ya know, chicken.
269	9/10 Addictive iOS gameplay
270	Probably the best game ever made.

272	Kinda boring, but it's pretty entertaining, if you have a tiny pea-brain like mine. Bottom line: Don't get it if you don't like waiting...
273	Probably the best game ever made.
274	A great game to pass time with. It does, however, get addicting! The story behind the 'Snuggle Truck' and the guy driving it is never explained, so use your imagination. There is an interesting guide that you can read for it. It can take millions of trials to unlock just one medal for each level but I guarantee you will feel very satisfied after unlocking them all. You can also create your own levels, which is awesome. I am glad I came across this game.
275	Funny game, reminds of my school age when we played Gravity Defied on our java compatible mobile phones. And it has brony mode, on which I laughed hard! This game is an example of simple, yet classically challenging arcade, which makes funny noises when animal hits the ground. Cute!
276	The level editor adds a lot to this already cool little game.
277	A delightfully fun physics-based game. Don't let the name fool you; while it may seem like a game for children, it can get ridiculously difficult at times. This game can certainly entertain you or a group of friends, no matter the age.
278	What is snuggle truck? its game of the year material, thats what it is.  You're playing bruce, a cancerous truck driver on his last breath. you've decided to make a change in the world in few days you have left to live. to do so, you've enlisted yourself as a Stuffed Animal Transporter.  Its up to you to traverse the obstacle laden world to deliver squeaky stuffed animals to dying children in the most remote places in the world. plow through hazard filled forests, barren wasteland deserts, and underground caves never explored before. but you must be careful, you must not lose your cargo! or the dying children will be forever sad because of your failure.  Are you up to the challenge? are YOU willing to make a change in the world? do YOU have what it takes? did i mention that there is a LEVEL DESIGNER?!  Prove your worth. Be a man. Drive... The Snuggletruck.
279	Top trucking gameplay, if you ever wanted to do sick flips and tricks then this game might just be for you. However I doubt anyone wants that.  If you're looking for some 'ard MLG fun buy this game for a friend, then laugh at them because you forced them into it.  58/23 would get forced to play again.  kappa123

281	It's on sale for $0.29 right now, but you're better off just buying a gumball instead. It's four cents cheaper and you can blow bubbles.
282	I do not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 8. There is little to no challenge even on the highest difficulty, the voices are dreadfully squeaky and annoying and the music is barely tolerable. I bought this game for 29 cents and I still feel as if it was a complete waste of money.
283	This game reminds me a lot of games I used to play on other consoles..  It is a 90's game when they created a lot of these games ... still nice to play with your friends. Although no servers cause no one still plays it but you can do a LAN server or singleplayer. Nice game  6.5/10 -Diesel
284	Pro: Fun graphics Demo Low system specs Multiplayer Inexpensive   Con: Level design is inconsistent  Repetitive &amp; borning really fast No cards or achieves Audio may induce suicidal thoughts  Overall: 5/10 +1 looks, +2 demo, -1 no cards or achieves, -1 repetitive = 6/10  Of the Gumboys this is my favorite, partly due tot he multiplayer. $3 is not bad and if you can get it on sale, even better.  A fun way to kill an hour or two but $5.50 for 2 hours may or may not be a deal. Grab when on sale only.
285	I think that game is fun only wth friends, bots are too easy or very hardcore. But if you are bored, and you have 2 euros on steam wallet collecting dust, why not?
286	Fun minigames for killing time. Single or Multiplayer. Capture the flag, gather gems and races. I recommend you turn up the speed just a bit.
287	if you hate good games this is the game for you
288	I bougth this game at 39 cents and is pretty cool . THE BEST hardcore race game ever ( BUY IT )       7,5/10
289	Although Gumboy Tournament has no real game-killing flaws and is good at what it sets to do, the concept really isn't all that fun.Gumboy Tournament is a pretty average game.
290	the most hardcore racing game 10/10 should be GOTY
291	so bad i want my money back cant even play multi player
292	Best graphics, awesome story line..  10/10
293	Best thing since beds.
294	The best game ever! Rollin' with balls and â¥â¥â¥â¥. Doing more balls. Balls.
295	It gets boring after 2-3 days of playing it because gameplay gets quite repetitive.
296	great game for having fun with friends
297	Unless you enjoy talking balls that make engine sounds and jump around in a small arena, I would not get this game. I only paid $0.29 for it, but I just don't like it. I closed the game after 5 minutes and never played it again.
298	how did this even happen
299	Throwing your keyboard across the room because you lost to a pink gumball in a race simulator 2008. Get it while it costs as much as 5 Ethiopian Lifetimes.
300	10/10 Would reccomend i spent $0.30 on this game, boy was it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worth it. why isnt this game GOTY? multiple servers always up, easy to make one for you can your freinds, imagine mario kart on cocaine. Thats what thsi masterpeice is. â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. 15/10 would reccomend this damn game to every sole in the world
301	Finally! The mushroom simulator I've been looking for!
302	It gets boring after 2-3 days of playing it because gameplay gets quite repetitive.
303	Hey kids, tired of your overplayed dated UT and QDeathmatch?  *EXPLOSIONS* THEN TRY THIS BRAND NEW TOURNAMENT GAME. JUICY NEW EXPERIENCE IN A CYBERSPORT GENRE.

IT'S CALLLEEEDDD    actually game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and multiplayer is broken so don't waste money  
304	All i have to say for this game is: WOW. Gumboy junior offers everything that you would want in a game. Graphics, story and I have a serious emotional attachment to all of the characters. There is tons of replay value and enough choices to keep you entertained for hours. I sunk 128 hours into the story alone and another thing: IT HAS MULTIPLAYER! I thought this game could not get any better then it showed me its seamless matchmaking system to get into a competative game. It would be great with freinds but I lost all my freinds in the time I was playing this game. THIS IS A MUST BUY AND FOR 1.99 FOR 275 HOURS IS A GREAT DEAL.  I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH GEEEEEEEEEET IT.
305	A kids game that is not even better than Pajama Sam.
306	it is a funny game for some spare time
307	ACTUALLY REALLY FUN  LIKE  ROLLING AROUND AND â¥â¥â¥â¥  INCREDIBLE  
308	This game is great. Game of the year 10x for every year.
309	Got this for 19p  10/10
310	Great soundtrack!
311	Are those little balls on crack or what
312	When i first played this game i thought it was bad, but after my grandfather locked me in the basment and forced me to play it for 12 hours i started to like it.  -good game 20/10-
313	this game is good, but its not the best  ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
314	Again a bundled purchase. not somthing i like
315	Realy enjoyed the tournament mode. Would recommend this game for everybody!!
316	This game is pure magic from the moment you strap on your codpiece to the moment you blow up the moon 
317	Best game ever, I recommend that you buy this amazing FPS shooter, it has everything you would ever want in a game. It's a lot better than CoD:Ghosts.
318	Very Good Game... Ruined To My life!
319	IGN 10/10 good story. CanÂ´t wait for the GOTY version to release. Most annoying menu screen ever btw. Get bubble gum and stick it in your dark hole, youÂ´ll have more fun.
320	Gumboy Tournament is the multiplayer version of Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. You're a gumboy, which is basically a ball that can stick to surfaces, also the gumboy is able to jump.  Your goal in the game is to collect more diamonds than your opponent does. You can play vs bots, local vs a friend or online. Mind you though, there probably won't be any player online to play.  Gumboy Tournament is a neat party game, especially for kids but you probably get bored with it pretty quickly. The game is cheap (normal price: 2 bucks, in a steam deal it could be 0,30 cents) which is the right price for the game but in my opinion it's not enough to recommend this game.   
321	Being trained as a professional Flying Fox at the 'Military University of Foxes and Kitsunes' and having 150 confirmed potion victims i can honestly say that this game is one hell of a game.  It is hard, even for me, to roll that constant through the world like those marble like creatures. Trust me, that actually was part of our basic training, they are just too pro for me.  Although it is offered at steam our Scientist team lead by very talented Doges (it is hard to find good quality Fox personal nowadays) has found out that you can actually get the 1.8 release of Gumboy at CNET download legaly FOR FREE. (source:  Gumboytournament.com)   It is said that their Headquarter is in the Szech Republic and that their only connection to the glorious Fox connection (and no, we do not own Fox TV) does not work for anybody and that the named server probably is almost down.  But thanks for everything there is a Campset orderable for free to set up your own Military Base (server).  The commentator of the Game is none other than the famous superstar Squeeky Mc Squeek, also known for one of the voice actors from the Chipmunks Series and many many other quality internet videos. Rumours say, that you can gather the all mighty power of his voice by inhaling Helium. And no: That is not how we Foxes sound.  One of our researchers has also made a small visit to the culture of the Gumboys It appears that they like to race against each other who gets the fasted amount of Diamonds and can sell those for 50,100 and 200 Fox$ers to our intergalactic Organisation. When they shall not do so, they try to steal the Flagg of their other Nation and bring it to their own Flag. Apparently they do not like each other and have always to show which is the best Nation.  The Gumboys got named one of the most fabulous Creatures 2006 by the russian dancing men organisation 'Gametunnel'. We blame the capitalist pig!
322	Bust game so much bettah then cod and bf5 or hl2:ep3! THUMBS UP!
323	I have been playing since I was 5 yrs old. IF only more people would play this!
324	Does not work on windows 8.1
325	A friend of mine bought this game for me and another friend. All three of us loaded it up and played it for about 10 long minutes. Gumboy Tournament is the most worthless game I've ever played in my entire life.   We play a lot of games together .. we're great friends.. I mean we have fun just talking in skype. I used to think we could have fun no matter what the game was as long as we were playing it together. Gumboy shattered that belief and wasted 10 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I lost some respect for my friend and I wish I could erase it from my game history and my brain.
326	Great game very good, gave me a new meaning of life.
327	10/10 should buy
328	It's looking like good game for little kids but not for me.
329	i don't get this game.feels like im missing something.i don't  know,LSD?  W/E   Gameplay
330	after the success of Unreal Tournament 2004, epic games decided to take the series in a bit of a strange direction but in the end i think the risk totally paid off. 10/10, looking forward to the sequel.
331	Nope. Just nope.  I played it back when it first came out. Not sure if it's improved, but I'm not bother going to try. When you launch a game, you need to be prepared, and these people were definitely not. Matchmaking didn't work most of the time and they had one server somewhere in east europe to which I had a ping &gt;400ms.
332	7/10
333	10/10 Better than Bad Rats! Would recommend to all aspiring Gumboys.
334	stupid controls, bad graphics, hard to figure out. Still better than call of duty so 10/10 ign
335	  So I have a tale to tell about my experience procuring Gumboy Tournament.  It was a warm summer night, and I was walking to my local Toys R Us to check out the games . I hoped to find some hidden gems, but what I found was like discovering a brand new Ninjustu (I'm a ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village). As I enter the store, and quickly concentrate my chakra to my feet to zoom across the aisles to the game section, and see a new game 'Gumboy Tournament' sitting on the shelf. There is only one copy left, and I see some granny about to take it, talking about how her grandson would like it. I swiftly throw my kunai at her, and then dash up and chop her in 2 with my katana. At last, this game will be my sweet salvation. I take it to the cash register, and hastily give the cashier (who happened to be a pretty female around my age) the game. She attempts to scan it, when all of a sudden, an army of grannies start charging at us as fast as the can, their walkers squeaking across the floor, as they try to get the game for their grand kids. I start doing my tiger hand signs, preparing my self for the Fireball jutsu. As I build up my chakra, I say ' I will not let you assault m'lady in this manner .' I cast my fireball jutsu, and burn all the vermin (to the unknowing eye, it would look like I just took out a lighter and a can of Axeâ¢ spray, but this is just what non-believers see). I turn back to the cashier, and she gives me the now purchased game. She looks at me longingly and says 'Wanna go on a date soon?' I look back at her, tip my fedora, and reply 'No thanks, m'lady, you aren't my type.'  OVERALL REVIEW: It was alright...
336	It's a funny game,but i don't know why nobody loves it. I enjoyed it .
337	Good game if you get it work. Badly optimized garbage. Devs, don't make anymore games, ok?
338	Such Game Much Wow So Action A+/10
339	Very boring and dull game. Maybe fun for 5 year old kids.
340	I won this in a free giveaway and I now see why it was free. Just a few minutes and the annoying voices broke my ears. The objectives are pretty much pointless and not really fun. Dont even know what to rate so ?/10.
341	I'm single so this game suck,.. if u have friend buy this game , this is so interesting
342	This game is currently the best option to buy into steam economy and market.Cheapest purchase on store turning your account to premium :) No comment on gameplay
343	If you have a low blood pressure, try this. Instant cure.
344	It can be funny if youre looking for basic arcade game like haxball, pong etc. to play with your friends at one computer.  Otherwise; I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Don't waste your money. 
345	The AI dont even understand what's going on. Why are the eyes red on my version i dont understand
346	the stupidest â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've ever played. it was 74 cents and is a massive â¥â¥â¥â¥load of diarrhea
347	10/10 'Like Skyrim with... Whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ that thing was' -IGN 'GOTY every year!' - Notch
348	Eh its alright for what it is i guess...
349	Good game Good price :DD
350	I can describe this game with one word - sh*t.
351	So bascially its the best game North East Africa, i r8 8/8 m8. Full h8. So hopefully my Review helped you not buying this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Greets: Meaty M8 Blaze It  :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
352	Much game, many expensive I worked my â¥â¥â¥ off for this gud gaim
353	my head hurts
354	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥
355	Why it runs on 30 fps only in full screen?
356	Well first up, WARNING: This game doesn't work in fullscreen, it just locks your system up. Developers apparently didn't bother testing on anything but a junky old 1080p monitor.   Artwork style in the game rating out of 10: MSPaint. Seriously, the graphics are that bad.  Gameplay: Well it's like Wizball (kind of - instead of bouncing, you're sticky and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) from the 1980s but competitive and not particularly fun or interesting. There's no real story mode, you just go through levels competing against other players or the AI. You roll around the walls of the map and collect diamonds to get more points than the other guy. In the era of Grand Theft Auto 5, Ark, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Star Citizen, and so many other incredible games, they give us MSPaint with sticky balls. Correction, they ask for us to pay them for sticky balls, it's not even free. Even if it was free, you wouldn't want it.  Technical stuff: Absolutely atrocious - doesn't work on modern systems. Video options are limited to turning off the background and running the game in full screen. Bonus: If you run windowed, and switch out, the game locks up and stays stuck in foreground. Alt+F4 is your friend, thankfully. Kudos to the developers for allowing us to exit the game.   Don't buy this. Play one of the F2P games from the Steam store instead.
357	The lens flares will make you cry.
358	best game ever no questian asked 
359	If I had two â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game would suck both of them.

362	I dont like this game and i dont think you should play it cause the controls are bad and its just not very good.
363	this is a fantastic game to make fun of
364	this game changed my life
365	A racing game with a variety of different competition styles, all set on a miniature scale as the toys of children race around and around. This is the exact premise of Super Toy Cars, as one could easily imagine from the name. Going into the game, I was expecting something either trying to rekindle the days of the Hot Wheels PC games or something to compete with racing games based around cartoon style mayhem such as the Mario Kart series, or even the long forgotten Diddy Kong Racing. What I found was neither here nor there, but something in between.Getting into my first race was simple enough. I opted to do the Career mode to experience the game as well as gain the required points and coins to unlock new races and cars. The race itself lacks the feeling of high speed you would expect from a racing game, but with all the vehicles evenly matched, at the very least there was still that thrill of fighting for first place. Racing around through a course lined with children's toys, shortcuts, and sudden jumps here and there made up for the lack of high speed intensity; then came the power ups, which vary from game changing heat seeking rockets to mostly useless giant 8-balls that the other drivers always manage to avoid with ease due to the slow speed.The tracks themselves are interesting enough, but other than the default races and the elimination modes, there isn't much that grabs your attention to make the game fun. Luckily, the races and elimination modes occur often enough in Career mode to maintain that level of interest.There is the ability to upgrade your vehicles but the upgrades make little to no difference in the overall feel of the vehicles. At most you will get to the front of the pack a little more quickly, but when other vehicles can boost and use power ups the same as you it usually won't matter. Considering the way the AI is established as well, getting to the front of the pack without the upgrades is usually doable anyway, so it's purely a coin sink.Vehicle variety is very nice, however, relating back to looks overtaking the statistical aspects. Of all 16 vehicles, each with several paint schemes, each has a unique flair about it that appeals to someone.Outside of Career, Quick Race, and Multiplayer, there is the Track Editor. Simplistic but fun, it's easy for anyone to jump in and design their dream track within the limits set, of course. Players can adjust the size and shape of the track, fill it with props of their choosing, and, by being able to do those things, they can make a race as exciting and challenging, or as boring and mundane, as possible.Super Toy Cars is not a game aimed towards adults, and yet it was still a rather enjoyable experience even for me. Though it lacked the challenge of big name racers, or the finesse and quirky attitude of games such as Mario Kart, Super Toy Cars still manages to shine where it matters most: fun factor.

370	Nice, solid game with interesting vehicle variety,a good attempt at the Kart racing genre. There's a few map collision bugs and the Multiplayer lacks private sessions but it's still a very entertaining experience.

372	A fun game at first but posess really little challenge, I completed the game to 100% and now I don't know why I should really play it, maybe only if my friends had the game and we could play it together, but that's it.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game for all it was worth, I was happy to see that there is a track creator, but last time I played it the track creator was very buggy and confusing to use, with limited props and a glitchy pathway system.  The game plays like any other kid friendly racing game, Mario Kart, Crash Team Racing etc. You choose your car, you have the start boost, you get boost for drifting and you get power ups, nothing too special but it also lets you drive on a kitchen counter, there's charm to the game but it really doesn't differ too much from it's more successful counterparts.  During campaign you can buy and unlock new cars and skins for the cars to make your car more yours, you can give it upgrades until you upgrade all your cars and get the achievement, but that really is it, the upgrades are only for the campaign mode, not for multiplayer, which has it's positives and negatives, positives in the fact that everyone has an equal chance, negatives the fact that you spend your ingame money on upgrades that you will probably have a use in like once or twice, and then the campaign ends.  Oh yeah, the game also gives you a replay addition, cool huh? Shame that the replay A.I. sometimes forgets where you actually went and you end up crashing into walls during your replay, even if you have not crashed once during the actual race, greaaat.  Multiplayer: So the game is not popular, and you could probably see it if you played it, there isn't many people playing it, shame actually because the game is best when played with other people.  I'd say buy the game only if you have friends to play it with, it's not really a game to play on your own unless you just want to fill up your achievement pool with some more easily accuired achievements.  I recommend the game because it has charm and it's fun to play, but I suggest buying it if it is on a sale, don't waste Â£6.99 on this game, or like I wasted Â£10 when it first came out, it has it's charm but as a one off achievement grab game, it's not worth the price.  I rate this game at 5 out of 10 mini ferrarri's
373	Didn't regretted, got this in Early Access. Awesome game! In some way, reminds me Re-Volt and the 2D Micro Machines. Decent graphics, great music and that 'toy car' feeling.  But: - Needs more content. I mean from developer. Workshop is okay. - lack of other players (multiplayer)  But since it's in bundle at this time (Bundle Stars FullyLoaded)...go and buy it!

376	   Good for a kids racing game but as for a legit racing game, it falls flat. The collisions are poor, the turning is bad and if you crash, you are screwed. There a many better games out there. I just wish they had the number of vehicles and unlocks as they do here

384	This game had lots of design work. It feels great to pull around those corners while pulling down the hand break. The cars are fast and hard to control (compared to mario kart). The items enrich the game act as a boost for newbies. How many racing games let you say that you race in a jeep? In theory. I realise that that isn't technically complete, but mmmyyyey.  The problem is in graphics. Now I know that lots of you are going to get up a proclaim 'I don't need shiny graphis!'. You are probably mostly right. When people say this they are generally refering to detail and quality. The problem is in lighting. The lighting is fine in brighter levels. It's still kind of ugly and we've had better lighting on things for a long time (the early mario karts), but it's some thing I'll live with. On darker levels I end up with areas of my screen entirely black and the head lights don't help. It's immersion breaking and just rips you right out.   I recommend this game, but only if it's on sale.   Post Script: I haven't played this in a while, they might've fixed it by now. If you're reading this I will give an update shortly.

387	10/10  Want the perfect arcade racing game? This is it.  I started the game up to check it out after picking up the Fully Loaded bundle on BundleStars, and my ears were completely delighted. The game's soundtrack stands out above most others without a doubt. The menu music had me struggling to start the game because it was just so nice to listen to!  The gameplay is simple and to the point. Race and win by any means necessary! That's what arcade racing is supposed to be. Fact-paced, high-impact adrenaline fuelled fun.  Big shoutout to the devs and support team for this game. I think we'll be seeing a lot of Eclipse Gaming for a long time to come.  As a sidenote: I run my games on a 21:9 display, which some games have a hard time with. This game didn't even bat an eye, it just knew. I appreciate this attention to variety.

394	Nice racer for the price. The prods keep updating it too. :)
395	Great game! Fun on Solo, best on local MP! :D Decent number of cars with different stats and behaviours.   
396	I assumed this was going to be Micro machines by another name but its not. Its fast paced madness with lovely bright cartoony circuits. This game aims for cheap thrills and that is exactly what it provides, but who doesn't like some cheap thrills every now and again..?
397	Its a good game. That being said I honestly thought the game was going to be a lot better then it is currently. The Career mode should be diveded into classes instead of the any car can race in any race. Because at the later levels your gonna get pounded on if you use a slower car. I wish they would have done it like Little Racers Street and make them into classes. Like the A thru E class. I think it would make a lot more sense.   The handeling for cars is just strange. The truck is terrible at handeling it cannot take a tight turn for whatever reason. The drifting does not feel right. Its slows you down a lot.. Its just strange. It doesnt feel right. The tracks are fine but like someone else said a little boring. The powerups as some one said before are not very good. I would agree if your ahead then your more then likely going to stay ahead because all of the weapons require a car behind you. For example a missle or the 8 ball both need line of sight. Their are a few traps that stay on the track but are easily avoided.  I would have liked to see a system of drops that gave out turbo perhaps to the other cars behind to keep it interesting and every race would be close. Also it takes a long time to respawn weapon drops so if your behind some other car good luck on getting a power up. As it is the game is just ok. It could have been so much better. Graphics are good but everything feels chunky. Although that might be what the graphics guy wanted.  So their you have it. A good game but not great.
398	if RC Pro-AM had updated graphics, among everything else, cars tracks, track editor, and still in early access, this game would be it.
399	Good and fun game, no bug, great action, a bit easy but fun for casual game
400	This was part of a bundle I bought,and while I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it,It's a bit of fun If you can get it cheap/in a bundle. You're going to want to select the 'hold to drift' option,as not doing so means you have pretty much no control over the car whatsoever as it just auto-drifts all the time. I also recommend playing your own soundtrack in the background. Be careful for objects that look like you can go under/around them also,as some have invisible walls. Unlocking trophies and cars is fun,but it can feel a bit grindy after a while as the limited tracks and race types get repetitive. It's the sort of game you pick up every few days for a quick sesh,and community made tracks will breathe some new life into it. A fun,little time killer overall.
401	Great arcade fun. I always loved the settings in micro Machines so it's fantatsic to once again race around our world at a miniature scale. Fun power-ups and challenging AI will keep you trying to better your position in that last race.
402	Fun game but the wait time between online games is ridiculously long!

404	Fun little racing game. Unrealistic physics, mario kart weapons = a few hours of fun :) I spent a good few earning achievements. I would only get on sale :)
405	If you enjoy racing and drifting around at the speed of Super-Fast HotWheels cars this is the game for you! With different modes and car customizations too. The game is also easy to 100% Complete.  9.5/10
406	I went into this one with very low expectations, and it was better than I thought.  This game has abundant minor issues and feels a bit unfinished. It's got clunky hitboxes and glitchy hit detection; it's possible to drive right through stage walls in some places. Collisions behave really oddly. Powerups aren't too useful. There's not too many pre-programmed tracks, either.  Also, there's a highly overpowered mechanic called Drift; sliding around curves filles a boost gauge that can be activated for a major speed increase at any time; with a bit of skill, high drift cars will spend half of every race in turbo mode, and low drift cars will be left in the dust. This limits your car choice options.  However, there's positives, too. A variety of game modes keeps things feeling fresh. Races are fast-paced and don't drag on. There's a fully functional track editor. Vehicle handling is actually pretty okay.  As a MAJOR plus, computer AI does not feel cheaty - Cheating AI is my major issue with most other racing games. The game is fairly low challenge, but a large part of that is because the devs weren't seeking to add artificial difficulty with rubber-banding or any such rubbish.  The verdict: There's fun to be had here, as long as your expectations aren't too high. Fly through all those tracks with drift, buy a bunch of upgrades, snag a ton of easy achievements, and it makes for an enjoyable afternoon.
407	This game plays quite nicely for what this game has.  Car combat is fine and works in its wonders like a huge 8 ball that you can if your lucky hit and knock your oposition to respawn behind you if you get that lucky hit.  This game had a good concept however with supposed races over 60 plus races, you only find about 5 tracks or a little more if your lucky, the biggest trouble the game has is that it doesn not have a wide veritity of tracks to race on.  The Collection of $ to get the best upgrade in the game is $80,000 and even though that looks like quite a lot, to the game is not really that bad.  its got 6 levels of difficulty but once you have the best car its just a matter of staying ahead of everyone with your speed.  Great looking game, you can make your own tracks i did play around with this a little, and it got muliplayer but i would not trouch it if i was going to give thoughts to anyone else since if you click on this, you will find it hard to exit this screen.  steam support for people to make there own tracks is good but its really hard to tell how many people actually still play this game even for fun.  Thanks for the experiance of the game i did enjoy it and i hope others do but it does get very repetitive quicky.  Enjoy.
408	+nice very fun +good maps +good soundtracks  -gamepad configuration problem -multiplayer mode problems
409	Great game, simple gameplay and good graphics. A little bit of casual racing. Mario kart meets burnout
410	Mother? Is that you?
411	Simple, challenging and fun to play. This game is like any rainy day of my childhood. I LOVE IT!
412	Still ridiculously fun! Hope that âNextCarGameâ will push it far beyond Ultimate Carnage!
413	Awesome remake of FlatOut 2 with the better graphics and working on-line matches!  But 'Games For Windows Live' is HELL: 1. The game won't start at all (without any error message) if you haven't installed the 'support/XLiveRedist01.02.0241.00.msi' file from the game's directory on your hard disk (the setup wizard tries to install it automatically, but fails to locate the file and just skips it) 2. The game won't let you play if you haven't created an account at  http://live.com/  3. The game won't let you play (will show a weird message) if you haven't tied your  live.com  account to an account at  http://account.xbox.com/ 
414	I hate you Windows Live
415	Great game to play drunk to forget about my horrible live choices
416	Altough Next Car Game: Wreckfest is almost out, this is still the best flatout game out there, i suggest you buy this one instead of flatout 2. This version has improved graphics, more cars and game modes than flatout 2 has. but of course, as an flatout fan you should get all of them ;)
417	Ignore negative reviews, They're mainly about GFWL, Which can be removed with a very simple little patch.  Onto the game - It's classic flatout with TONES of mini games, but with prettier graphics and smoother gameplay.  If you've ever played or enjoy the flatout series, this has to be the best of the later games.  Until Wreckfest is finished or in a state where I deem it worthy of a purchase I recommend everybody to play this one for now!  You'll not be disappointed.
418	 Review of Flatout: Ultimate Carnage
419	I love everything in this game. But not Games For Windows Live.
420	Probably the most under-rated racing game ever. My favourite game. Since Flatout 1 &amp; 2 on PS2 (also available on PC), and no FOUC on PC! Do no purchase FO3: Chaos &amp; Destruction as this is not made from the same company. But yeah, this game has countless hours of fun, online and offline! Unfortunately will be going offline in a few months due to GFWL disappearing! But still, single player is always fun. Definately retained it's value for a reason.
421	The game itself is fantastic - best racing game I ever played. The focus on destruction is hilarious and fun. Some of the music is great too, especially if you like hard rock / metal.  However, when you first start the game, it won't work work. No error message, it just won't start. It deserves a thumbs down for that alone. To fix it, you have to install Windows Live Marketplace (WLM) a.k.a. Games For Windows Live (GFWL) first. If you sign up for an account you'll be disappointed, because GFWL insists it needs to download an 'update', but then says 'Can't download the update. Make sure that you are connected to the internet', offers a broken 'support' link, and forces you to sign out of GFWL. This problem is caused by Microsoft, but the game developers have refused to fix it for YEARS even though they keep trying to sell it!  Since you're signed out, you can't play multiplayer and more importantly, YOUR SINGLE PLAYER PROGRESS IS NOT SAVED on exit; you'll be left with nothing unlocked so you can only play the initial maps. I've experienced the same thing on two PCs, one running Win7 and the other running Win10, and before that I was completely unable to make this game run on another Win7 PC.  Edit: Edit: other reviews say Ultimate Carnage is the same as Flatout 2, but sadly it's not. The gameplay and maps ARE almost the same, with only minor improvements, but the graphics of FOUC are hugely improved over FO2, the user interface of FOUC is much more polished, and the soundtrack is new. I hate that I had to switch to FO2, though FO2 is certainly still fun.  A couple more things: (1) even broken I still would buy it when it is heavily discounted, as the initial maps are fun and there is a party mode (turn-based multiplayer stunts) which doesn't have any upgrades to lose on exit (but might be too challenging for actual parties). (2) The mouse cursor is broken in GFWL; use the keyboard to navigate it (Tab, Enter, Esc and arrow keys) (3) Microsoft somehow offers two versions of the GFWL installer (gfwlivesetup.exe) in different places and I tried both of them on Windows 10. One of them is 70 MB and is self-contained; the game is incompatible with this copy and WILL NOT START. The other is 628 KB and downloads the rest of itself. This copy worked for me on both Win7 and Win10 (Sorry for not offering a link, as I lost track of where I got it from). After installing it, don't worry about logging into the marketplace, it is not necessary.
422	First things first; I can't review Flatout 3 because I only played it for 3 minutes, and I've already uninstalled the game, and it's not worth re-installing just to play it enough to be able to review it. So I'll leave my review on that here to say that it's the worst driving game to ever exist.  But, FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is extremely fun! I remember a few years back, I was in year 10 at high school, and FlatOut 2 had done the rounds on people's USB sticks. So a lot of us were playing LAN (is that still a thing?) battles of FlatOut 2 demolition derbies, and I absolutely loved it.  If you've played that game and loved it, you'll love this... mainly because it's basically the exact same game, bar a few changes such as better graphics. AI players are the same, FlatOut mode is the same from what I remember. It's just updated a bit. Oh well, still a great game. Buy it! And don't buy FlatOut 3! Even ignore the ultimate FlatOut bundle. It's worth paying that little bit extra to say that you never owned that piece of garbage.  Oh, and also, I've had no loading issues or any crap with this game, even on Windows 10. Ignore what the negative reviews say.
423	'Fully supports Games For Windows live' As in, fully requires it in order to save your profile. Stick with Flatout 2, the 'improvements' in this game are not worth all the trouble with GFWL (even if you spend the time to set it up, it's going down in a few months and it seems the multiplayer has already gone down). Or just get a cracked version from, lets say, the corsair's cove. The exclusion of GFWL alone makes it a superior product.
424	Hands down the funnest racing game I've ever played. My brother and I spent a solid week with this on the 360 and had a blast. So many great moments. This version is just a bit prettier.  Mini-games centered around launching your driver through the windshield was an unexpected bonus. Pretty addictive challenges.  Just don't expect realism. Not what this game is about.
425	Seat belts are overrated.
426	Pretty addictive gameplay. Cars feel like they have real weight, to the point that my fingers hurt from steering after an intense session. I went from this to Burnout for a minute and it felt like going from driving hyper-fast tanks to toy cars.   Here's my complaints: -The color pallette is straight out of Quake. Wish it was a little less muddy.  -The music is awful. I wish there was an option to change it out. If you like radio hard rock you'll like this. I do not.  -It's sometimes difficult to tell what piece of debris is going to turn into a major wreck vs act like flying scraps of paper. Nearly everything in this game is destructible and debris stays around, which is fun but sometimes the physics are unpredictable. -Games for Windows Live. If the service is dead, why does it still sign me out of my Xbox when I play this game?  Other than those complaints, I really enjoy this game. I only tend to like arcade-y racers, like Burnout and Project Gotham. This fits nicely in there. I bought 15 games or so recently and this has gotten the most play.   
427	Cons:  1. It uses Windows Live.  2. You need to download Windows Live to even start up the game.  3. You need to use a Windows Live account to play.  4. It uses Windows Live.  5. Did I mention that it uses Windows Live?  6. See #1.
428	Flatout Ultimate Carnage looks better and plays better than any of the titles in the series. There is support for controller and it works really well with an X-Box 360 wireless controller. Great game and lots of fun to be had. The sound track is great. The variety of challenges is good. Highly recommended!
429	GFWL is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Game rocks! Real Ultimate Carnage.
430	THis is my favourite out of the Flatout games. Its a lot of fun if you dont take it to seriously. I find it works better with an Xbox controller than a steering wheel (G27). I highly recommend this one. IN fact buy all 4 as one package.
431	To me, this is one of the best racing/crashing games there are. I can say with confidence this game is a lot better than Burnout.   Although burnout paradise might seem like the best crash and do work games out there, Flatout Ultimate Carnage does give it a solid challenge. I like the unique approach that was taken towards the circuits. It is a little slow going at first as the cars do not have that much power, but over time when certain upgrades kick in and money starts flowing, so do the hits. I find the challenge to get to first place is fun. If your like me though and like smashing cars instead of racing, you still get your fair share of credits towards savings for a new car or improvements to a current one. At first (as I've said) when you play the crashing is slow, but upon purchasing your second car (venom for me) you'll get into some fun crash dynamics. If you go fast enough and hit a stationary object hard enough, your character will come flying out of the car. Yes, you lose time and maybe your place in the race, but you get turbo the more time you are air born! Unlike burnout, this game strives on continuous hits. In burnout, you hit a car once and you are able to send it flying.   With Flatout, you're going to need a better reason to send someone on their way. Hits are decent when racing throughout on straightaways, but coming up on a turn serves the best opportunity to deal a lot of damage. Nitro is available and refills every successful hit or jump that is performed. Nitro adds that sweet satisfaction when coming into contact with another car. The animation and feeling they have created when coming into a collision especially when holding the nitro button down, was done absolutely right. One player racing modes do not feel like a grind and the thought of boredom doesn't dare prod it's head.... until you complete the 3 racing classes and the last 'open' class is available. By then, unless you are a hardcore fan, you may stop playing with such a dedication. A great addition to the game was the mini-games section which includes derby's, launch your guy out of your car into bowling pins, launching your guy into a soccer net... you know the regular stuff you see in the news paper saying that video games take it too far. The mini-games add a great depth to the game, and offer an alternative to racing. Absolutely nailed it here. The AI is also a dangerous threat at any time. I thought I was crazy, but some of these buggers will go off course then come flying back in off a jump. They all feel different and they all feel like they want to race. They do of course, want to hit you, but it doesn't seem one sided to the point where the player is becoming frustrated due to being targeted all the time.   The  graphics  are appropriate for a racing game, neither over the top or too cartoon-y. The fact that they made it possible to destroy the starting gate is amazing. There is a lot of breakable and explode-able objects found throughout each map. This alone makes it stand out from a lot of other racing games.  Sounds  are good overall while crash sounds are seem to be on the spot while engine sounds are satisfactory (and vary). Music seems to be really heavy into the pop rock.  FOR FUTURE FLATOUT GAMES : The only way they could have made this game better is adding local co-op into the mix. There is a two player mode in the mini-games section, but no one likes passing over a controller to play. Having multiplayer online should be mentioned as it ran smooth for me when needed.    RATING : rock-SOLID 8.0/10        Gameplay   B+     Story / Campaign   B+     Visuals / User Interface   B     Sounds / Music   B     Replay-ability   B     Overall    B        ScreenShots :
432	GFWL, I repeat, this game has GFWL, do not buy it! Get Flatout 2 or something else instead. The developer has no visible plans to remove it, so it will be even less playable than it is now. Also bugs.
433	A crazy and high paced destruction derby game which keeps you wanting more if you don't mind the overly generic alternative rock soundtrack.
434	bowling and playing cards with cars  nuff said :D
435	Love it, great game
436	Dont work with windows 10, when GFWL died they dragged this game with them to hell.
437	get with -75%. Easy to play  always funny gameplay with friends. Normal graphics. Not the best, but i think still good. 
438	Really an amazing game. One of the best (if not the best) of the Flatout games. It has all the best things of 1 and 2 put together with better graphics, more maps, more modes, and a whole second story mode revolving around destruction. No doubt a great game for any gamer. 10/10 would recommend to everyone. (BEWARE FLATOUT 3 IS REALLY REALLY BAD)
439	- Awesome demolition racing  - Awesome soundtrack what fills you with adrenaline
440	Great GAME!!! I can waste hours on it.
441	Luck, Skill and Steel Nerves is all it takes to master it.
442	So I recently bought the FlatOut: Complete Pack which came with every FlatOut game. I had already spent a good 1/3 (give a retake) of my childhood playing FlatOut 2 on my PS2. I played all of the other FlatOut games that I had just bought and it came down to this game.   Now I have a fairly modern computer which can take most games fairly well on moderate settings with around 30-40 FPS easily and I was hoping to find a FlatOut game that was better than FlatOut 2. When I got into the game (after the setups) I was immediately lagging very badly. I went into the config and toned down the settings wondering why a FlatOut game was actually running bad on my computer because every other FlatOut game ran perfectly on extreme settings.   So I get it to a moderate frame rate and to my surprise I figured out that this was a totally  kick-â¥â¥â¥ HD remake of FlatOut 2.  . This game looks absolutely gorgeous and it kept it's same physics and everything from the original game. Although I don't like the lack of cars, this game feels like it was made for a next gen console, it looks that stunning.   They made the models and textures so amazingly gorgeous, the cars actually look REAL! I absolutely love how they kept most of the original cars from the original game. One thing that I wish they would have done is upgraded the player model, it seems that the developers just used the same model as the one in FlatOut 2. I also wish that they could have stuck with the original soundtrack as I grew to love that soundtrack very much so.   I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone looking for an HD remake of FlatOut 2 or just a great racing/derby/ragdoll game. I will definitely be playing this game a bit more often and I will give this game a solid 9/10.
443	Great game but steam and microsoft ruin it. You have to have a microsoft live account. Everytime i log in, it acts like its just been installed. Played 3 hours first time and nothing saved. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you steam and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you microsoft live. Just let me play the god damn game I paid for.  Great game though!
444	I really enjoy this game, it's a great arcade racer with beautiful graphics and some really fun physics.   You have a selection of different race modes to play, like demolition derby, time trial, race - and 3 different tiers of cars to enjoy as well: derby, race and street. Each tier gets progressively harder (and faster). I have only scratched the surface of it so far, but am enjoying what I have played so far.  It's similar to the older Burnout titles in the way it plays, with awards given for dangerous driving and smashes with other cars. When crashes happen (and they do - a lot), they look outstanding. It's far superior to the Burnout Paradise (also here on Steam) - so if you have to choose between the two, get this instead.  Jimbo Rating: 7/10
445	One of the best arcade racing games. Good career mode, great additional events and very fun. In addition, it has the best music I've heard in a racing game. Fun for some coop play with friends too! The only drawback is that online multiplayer is dead, albeit it never was that good to begin with. The whole series is my favourite arcade racing game for years, and nothing seems to change it.
446	This game is just GREAT! I devoured and 1000'ed it on the 360, but....GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE REQUIRED TO PLAY? .....please....
447	Awesome game, VERY fun.  Flatout mode (=career mode, ~15h for me to complete)  Great variability of maps, sadly not very many racetracks (only 30, +specials). Many and detailed cars and damage models. Carnage Mode is addicting but a bit short (max ~5h). AI is moderately hard so long as you don't have an overpowered car.  Good value for money.  [NOTE] ---For those who own Flatout 2: This game is basicly a remastering--- (I bought both without knowing this, but got Flatout 2 refunded)
448	Childhood memories &lt;3  7/10
449	Holy cow this game is awesome. I loved flatout 2 back on my PlayStation 2 and this game is just awesome. really brings me back too the days when I was a kid.
450	This is one of my all-time favourate racing games and considering that I played most racers on the PS2 and PS3, that says alot. Graphis still look good today, physics are the perfect cross between arcade and realism and, best of all: It is super fun to play. Totally recomend.
451	Still an awesome racing game. Unlike other racing games, even when you are losing, you can still get something from a race by smashing the crap out of your opponents for money.  It has GFWL, but rumors of GFWL's demise have been greatly exaggerated. As of time of writing, it still works fine and you can still play multiplayer.  Only bad point - the sound track is absolutely awful.
452	This is y i dont have a DL,,,,just kiddin. ...great game...
453	The most gripping thing were the destruction physics, but I will be honest and say that the game never felt very gripping. Don't get me wrong though, it's not a bad game. It's just that I kinda didn't are after a few hours of playing it.
454	  8/10  
455	Probably the worst FlatOut of the series.  It feels like a fail Burnout clone without any of the things that make Burnout fun.  The music consists of maybe 10 tracks of completely bland, forgettable rock music.  The challenge mode was ok, but it consisted mainly of boring time trials with a couple of the ejection challenges. Unfortunately most of the best career cars were only unlocked from from getting first place in some of the challenges.  In the carreer mode, you can get boost from jumps, ramming into debris (sort of), or other cars, but strangely enough, not drifting or near misses.   The problem is that ramming into things obviously makes you slower, with the chance that you can randomly fly off the road for each thing you hit. The physics are pretty bad sometimes, and combined with the stunning no-steer effect from hitting items or other cars can make things really frustrating.  When there's loose crap littered all over the road, do you drive through the large boulder, or the small cardboard box? If you chose boulder, Congratulations! Boulders usually plink harmlessly off the car, while small cardboard boxes can cause you to fly up into the air and flip several times before landing you in a nearby field.  Because boost is only gained in so few ways, it can make it hard to catch up to first place when in second if there are few jumps on the map. If there are no cars to slam off, and all the loose junk has been knocked out of its initial position (and therefore gives no boost when you hit it agian) and there aren't any jumps, it becomes amazingly hard to catch up to the Designated Winner (the suspiciously fast AI car that rarely gets touched by other cars and can go through most debris without losing any speed)  Now, I understand that stunning (hitting another car with yours and temporarily disabling their ability to steer) is pretty much a given on battle racing games that don't use weapon pickups. What I don't understand is why in this game, you get stunned as well when you hit them first. I can't count how many times I would tap another car, and we would effectively be stuck together, as we couldn't seperate unless either I hit the brakes (the AI never did) or we both flew off the road together. This happened with the AI as well, if they got to close to me, they would not try to turn or follow the track, they would just follow me off the edge of the road/into the wall/field/whatever. At one point I had 3 cars stuck to me, one to the left, one to the right and a car that was sideways in front of me that couldn't or wouldn't move until the whole mass just crashed.  Even runs on maps I knew well and was winning would be ruined if I hit some random thing like a trashbag in the road the wrong way.  Another problem is that 'Reset Car' only worked when it wanted to. Sometimes I could reset right after getting spun backwards or flying into a pole, other times I would have to sit and watch my car flip 20 times in the air for 10 seconds because I ran into a tiny bit of debris.  During the final hours when I was truly getting bored, the game consisted of driving a bit, getting completely jacked by the AI cars or some random trash, and restarting the map. Over. And over. And Over.  It felt like the debris added lots of randomness without adding any fun.  The game is probably more fun with people, unfortunately, the MP is dead.  Combine all that with the fact that the game is infected with GFWL, earns the game my final score of:  STAY AWAY!
456	EPIC racing GAME......for me this is better than Need for Speed. U will love to see STEEL smash STEEL, expltion, environment destruction,......and they have variety type of mode for multiplayer!
457	Very good remake of Flatout 2 with better graphics, new cars, and more. Very fun to play, but Games For Windows Live was a pain to set up. I also love the soundtrack, it really pumps me up while playing,
458	The game where you get to bang hot chicks (also some guys) from behind with your Blaster XL all hardcore-style. It does feels slightly off in terms of music choice compared to Flatout 2, but now you got your Sofie Martinez in full HD and it's still the same total porn of a game none other could ever outdeliver.
459	Without a doubt the best in the series!
460	Because ramming your lambo with a school bus cannot be forgotten :D
461	We are in 2016 and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage still is the best racing game !!! Fantastic gameplay, graphics, destruiction and more important: very funny. We need a sequel!
462	Pros:  Fast paced gaemplay with lots of action Cars can be upgraded Decent selection of cars Great variety of stages which include stunt stages like basketball, baseball, darts etc.. Graphics are pretty good Has demolition derby AI is actually fun to play with  Cons:  Upgrades for cars are basic, (muffler does nothing to the sound of the car, body upgrades are not seen on the actual car) Cars explode when they get fully damaged Cars drive the same when fully damaged as they do when not damaged at all terrain does not have deformation. Would have been nice to have mud pits that affects cars and slows them down The sounds of the cars are very muffled, even at full volume a V8 should be louder Would have been nice to have real damage, flat tires, blown rads, broken tie rods The controller is not customizable, reverse view uses the analogue stick.   All in all, great game 
463	Very nice racing game, one of the funniest ever made! On multiplayer it really kicks â¥â¥â¥! This cargame beats all the others because it got the right feeling, you can destroy the cars totally, when you are turning and handeling the cars they react like real ones. It's simply the best racing 'having fun with friends' game out there, still the best in 2014!
464	  This game took me a while 2 get it working, Ok basically this game is an enhanced version of Flatout 2, So its better &amp; has a bit more stuff, Im just glad i got it working :)
465	Amazing game, fantastic replay value and awsome soundtrack. One of the most entertaining racing games you will ever play.
466	Flatout 2's autistic brother. If you want to see a glimmer of a community, get Flatout 2 with the mods.
467	Great game but using Live was a big mistake
468	They took a game that was already pretty great and added to it making it excellent!
469	IT DOES work on Windows 10. Steam will not launch the windows LIVE install. It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and outdated, but if you manually install it from the files you can run the game.   The major problem is no controller support, but that is my only complaint. Great solid simple game from what I can tell.
470	Flatout 1 still my fav but this pretty good
471	It's a great game. I have never played a FlatOut game except for the HeadOn demo on the PSP. I love the destruction, and especially how the drivers fly out like ragdolls after a huge crash. You're gonna have a lot of fun with this one. However, the game seems optimized for Xbox 360, and ported straight from it. That causes performance issues, and confusing PC controls.
472	Everything FO2 was only better. People complain about GFWL, but it doesn't seem all that intrusive. Only annoying thing about it for me is that if you want to change your username you have to pay, so I'm stuck with one I really would prefer to change, but I begrudge giving Microsoft money for basically nothing.  FO1 is still my favourite, I prefer the handling in that one, but this is probably my second favourite of the series. FO2 would be third, and WE DO NOT SPEAK OF FLATOUT THREE.

475	Best Fun-Racer ever! Go get it, it's countless hours of fun!
476	deepest lore, true to the table-top version of the game, utilizes aspects of the main story very well. A must-buy for fans of the series. Don't let it slip through your hands.
477	needs games for windows live... therefor dosnt work... therefor F*ck it
478	Minimal PC support, Port from xbox, Windows Live required, no LAN play.
479	I really loved Flatout 1+2. They are definitely my favorite racing games with fun driving physics, a great rock music soundtrack and hilariously funny mini games which involve throwing your driver out of your car into pins or use him/her as a dart.  In principial Flatout: UC makes nothing different concerning these points but it needs a registration on Windows Live and yeah that's it: That's just plain stupid.
480	A really great car game, with a lot to do! =D
481	A game like Burnout with realistic vehicle damage, there are tuning options for your cars, and a lot of tracks/cars to have a look at, it runs through Live.
482	The game itself is very good. Windows Live just kills this game. I had to install 'Games for Windows Marketplace', then the 'Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant' and it is still not working.  Microsoft is s**t when it is about good customer support.  Uninstalling the game and getting it from 'other sources', without these FEATURES.  Thanks MS, you blew it again.
483	Crash cars, get nitro, speed past cars, rinse and repeat until...  a) You are so far ahead there are no cars to crash. b) You crash your own car. c) You lap the car in last place  If a)... Win race or change to b)  If b)... Start again. Keep playing until you win.  If c) Smash all the cars!!!!
484	This is the only good flatout other then the first one
485	Awsome just awsome.
486	FlatOut UC is by far the best part of the series. This game is a lot of action and fun, it just doesn't get boring. The campaign will give you 8-10h of gameplay, and then there's still more to do. The game is based on Flatout 2 (basically the same, but with better graphics, more opponents and a few more things), so if you already own it, better wait for a steam sale to buy UC.
487	Might be a good game. Too bad it requires GFWL to play. Don't waste your time with this one.   Maybe steam should add this one to steamworks?
488	ENG:  The best scrap of rally car game car games, and wrecks are interested in motoring, testimonials.  FIN:  Paras romuralliin liittyvÃ¤ autopeli autopeleistÃ¤ ja romuautoilusta kiinnostuville, suositteluni.
489	Instant Classic! fun game. look up graphics upgrades. ;^)
490	Can't save my progress because of GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE  Want my money back. Flatout 2 is way better   Edit:  Fixed this sh*t (i think so)
491	Can't believe I spent my $4.99 USD for this crap.  1. Failed login to GFWL, it keep asking to update. 2. So, I decided to update to the latest version of GFWL 3. After updated, next problem occurs. The game wont start, error message 'Live initialization failed'. 4. And now, the game cant be started at all.
492	Crappy Xbox port to PC. Except for slightly better graphics no advantage over Flatout 2. No lan support, still 8 players max multiplayer. Oh and the turd called Games For Windows Live. Don't bother.
493	GAME DOESNT WORK I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK, I HAVE TRYED TO INSTALL ALL THINGS LISTED IN FOURMS BUT STILL NOTHING
494	This game is awesome, but i cant recommend it, it requires Games For Windows Live, and that sucks!
495	I was debating a long time wether to give this game a positive or a negative review. Decided to go for a negative after going through all the bad things, here are the pros and cons.  ___________________________________________________  ** CONS **  * Dumb AI - It will constantly â¥â¥â¥â¥ itself over, and sometimes take your poor soul with it. It has basic 'rammimg/disabling' tactics, it doesn't consider other AI's, so 2 or 3 AI's might try to block you from both sides by driving steering to your path, and create some sort of useless triangle of infuriating, frustrating blockage that will keep you all at 70KMPH or less. It's easily fooled in derby mode, you just drive around in circles and watch them destroy eachother, and then butt in for the win.  * Heavy and wonky props - for some reason there are big @ss props on the map, if you're unlucky to hit one of them, you will probably stop to a halt/sub 20KMPH, and should probably press R to restart. It could happen any time, no matter first or last place, first or last lap, you will get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by it. If it's not big enough to stop you, it's small enough to bounce like a feather OR jam under your car and SEND YOU FLYING/SPIN YOU OUT OF CONTROL. These are way more common than the heavy props, and just as annoying.  * Bad physics in general - Let's say you master the evasion of props. Congrats! now you probably want to slam people the hell out of your way. It will probably not end well for you. Steer clear of people. ( Ironically ) especially in derby mode. If you try to steer people out of control by slamming to their back sides, they will rotate 90 degrees and you will stick to their T bone like a MAGNET. Don't try to slam people from behind in lower speeds - you will have no effect, and you will stick to their back side like a magnet until you slow down or pass them somehow.  * A terrible difficulty curve - 1st level is easy. Picked the Mustang, left all my opponents in the dust, no upgrades, no nothing. 2nd level? â¥â¥â¥â¥, I couldn't even catch up to them. Had to buy another car and heavily upgrade it to stand a chance, and get mostly 2nd/3rd places ( thanks to props, too ). I'm dominating the side challenges because all I have to do is drive in circles, if not, AI will gang up on you and will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up in a minute.  * GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE - The world's most terrible, teeth grinding, usless sack of â¥â¥â¥â¥ DRM makes an impressive comeback to this game. If you can't run the game at the first time, it's probably because you need to install Games For Windows Live. It's that terrible. The installation for it is in the game's library somewhere in your Steam library - common - steamapps - FlatOut : Ultimate Carnage. When you enter the game, just go as guest. I couldn't remember my ancient account. You probably wouldn't too.  * Mediocre graphics - This is a 2008 game. 2008. Having played the 2009 hit Burnout Paradise, this looks like a bootleg from 2003-4. At lease it got impressive 'destruction' mechanics? kinda. It just creates more crappy glitchy props. No thanks.  ________________________________________________________  **PROS**  * Easy to get driving mechanic - Gotta give it to them, at least the driving is pretty fun. Drifting is easy to master, all is arcadey as it should be.  * Great soundtrack - Classic 'let's **** some â¥â¥â¥â¥ up' rock music. Fits in great, some of the songs I will be listening to again outside of the game.  * What looks like 12-13 hours campagin - It's kinda good for an old game. Yeah, you will spend most of the time trying to redo failed races thanks to stupid AI and terrible props, but it's arcadey and pretty fun.  * Good maps and nice scenery - well, nice 2004 looking scenery, but you get the point. Maps are well designed ( better without the terrible props ).  _________________________________________________________  CONCLUSION  Rating - 4/10  Recommended price - 4$ or below ( on deep sales ), usually 20$  Shoud you buy it? - If you're into arcade racers with ( potential ) derby elements, sure. I couldn't do any derbying because it's all bugged to hell. I wouldn't get it if it was above 5$.
496	I honestly feel the original version of this game is better. Sure, it has a few extra additions and slightly better graphics, but the original just feels better for some reason. I'd ACTUALLY recommend the original FlatOut 2, you guys should go check it out, it's pretty great.  Really, i feel that 12 player is a bit excessive, and its not like there is gonna be any racing competition because everyone is smaking into eachother in the back of the track. At least in the original, i was usually competing with 2 or 3 other people (Jack and Sofia mostly, i swear they had some good AI), in this version, i usually see only 1 person on the minimap keeping up with me.  I also think the soundtrack of this version is absolute trash, while i thought the original had a fantastic soundtrack.   In all seriousness, the only thing i thought was better in this version was the graphics, but not by much. Go buy FlatOut 2 instead.
497	Yea. So I gave this game a second chance since my last review was negative and I wanted to see if I was wrong.  I caught the game cheating so many times i have forgotten them all.  For example in one of the race tracks on the left side of the road is a ramp on a truck that you hit and the jump gives you a turbo boost. I'm in last place, i hit the ramp and get boost, none of the other cars hit the ramp but somehow they all stay ahead of me and im still in last place with a heavily modified car.  I want fun not frustration. just deleted this from local content. 
498	I love this game, but I hate GFWL ... but you can't have everything I guess.
499	Pretty fun game and decent graphics for being from 2008, things looks really nice at 1920x1200. Its strange actually going out and targeting people instead of just trying to drive fast and keep away from them. This game is certainly well worth the money.
500	Love this game!!! &lt;3  9/10
501	One of the best racing games ever made. No disadvantages.
502	Do not buy this. This game requires Games For Windows Live, whose servers have been shut down.  Multiplayer is not possible. Single player works, but you cannot save any progress. If you close the game, you have to start from the beginning again.
503	Flatout Ultimate Carnage gives you the opportunity to create absolute mayhem in what is a decent racer. As well as racing, you build nitro by crashing into the scenery and anything in your path. Including your opponents. It is easy to forget about the racing and just cause carnage for the sake of it. It won't win you many races mind. This game is a mix of styles. Similar to Burnout, handling is more rally style (quite a bit is off-road) and the power sliding and nitro not unlike Ridge Racer. Whilst this makes for a good fun racer, some of the racing can get a bit 'flat' after a while. The AI in this game is mighty impressive, Each car has its own driver and personality and it often feels like you are racing against humans. They are totally unpredictable, and you will find yourself having great ramming battles on the track together with head on collisions, flip-outs, wrecked cars and some wild manoeuvres.  
504	Gameplay is exactly as good as Flatout 2, but the graphics are better and the soundtrack worse.
505	Loved to play this before, they made it impossible to play....damn shame. Too bad Windows Live isn't alive, and is necessary for this game. It might as well be called â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t von â¥â¥â¥â¥ pants. It's no longer a game, just a reminder of how much I hate 'games for windows live'
506	Shows just how much fun you can have if you get in a car crash and you don't wear your seatbelt
507	People that have been Thumbing down this game because of issues with Windows Live, you can fix this issue by just downloading it from the main website  here  [www.xbox.com] .  This game is great, so dont let Windows Live stop it.
508	Really awesome graphics and music. Highly recommend I really like the carnage mode where you drive around and try to be the last one standing
509	A fun destruction derby racer, lots of intense moments and a good soundtrack to suit its carnage. Highly Recommended
510	Played the game on xbox - was great. Played the game on pc - was perfect. A cool game, buy it while its on sale.
511	FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage how do you play online or lan anymore now that the server went down,and said it has coop to you can't put bots in it just players vs players l don't see that in any of the flatout games i use to play with friends now i can't am l doing something wrong we all love these games what happen to them
512	flat out 2 with upgrade to graphics, whats not to love
513	The game looks great; it is practically FO2 with upped graphics. HOWEVER, the INSANE LAG just kills the thrill for me.
514	I wanted to love this game and for the majority of the game I did. It has a lot of the right elements, done the right way, which result in a great racing experience, very playable.  Then you get to the difficult end of the spectrum.  In the dictionary, under the term 'nerfed' should be a picture of this game. Regardless of whether you manage to get the top cars, the level of AI, physics and performance changes that occur during the highest races drops the playability level down to all but unplayable. If you have learned the way to properly play and control your car through the various races and levels to get to the end races, you understand the elements around you and the other cars, how they behave. Unfortunately most of that information will do you no good, as the laws of physics suddenly stop applying.  Enemy cars will go from wrecking as you pass them to rocketing past you at 200 mph+. Pieces of paper in the road transform into massive obstacles able to flip your car high into the air on impact. Your car begins to perform like a ford pinto missing a few cylinders: One moment, it handles fine, the next it has no throttle response, no turning control or no brakes, or slides radically sideways if you so much as look as the hand brake button. Step on the gas pedal....it might respond, it might not. If you are really lucky, the wind from a passing car will make yours veer into that oncoming building corner or tree, stopping you instantly.  Don't worry, however, as things will revert just as quickly back to how you have come to understand them, once 3 or 4 of the opponent AI cars have passed you by, leaving you wondering just what the heck happened. You will have time to think about it after you lose the race again.  In playing this game, or any game, it is understandable that things get progressively harder. However, the 'playability' of this game goes way down when the changes that make it harder are such that they are so readily apparent and unfair. You end up thinking 'whoa, what the heck just happened?' a lot. Things happen which are beyond explanation and which are beyond you have any effect on whatsoever. There is no counter move you can do, no way to affect change in the situation at all. The outcome just changes, and the only thing you can do is keep the gas pedal down and watch the other cars pass you by.  The advantages given to the environment and AI cars in this make it a very different game at the end. I loved it up to that point, but there is no way to play against what you know about the game being useless to you when you are playing it. How do you race if gravity or the laws of matter change instantly for a few moments here and there, but never in your favor? There is no way to fight that. If you win, it will most likely be because of some freak bit of luck.  I don't expect it to be easy, but making it seem impossible by yanking victory from your grasp unfairly, and very visibly so, earns it a bad review. NERFED HARD, YO.
515	BOOM ! CRASH ! BANG! (If Games for Windows Live works for you...)
516	Recomended.
517	the windows live locked me out of my account and for the life of me did not even get past the sine in and we tried it is just not worth the time or trubble of this 10/10 ign windows live
518	Basically an HD remake of Flatout 2, so if you have a good computer I'd reccomend this, otherwise save $10 and get Flatout 2
519	WILL NOT Run on Windows 10 Machines!!!
520	A cheapened attempt at regaining the play of its predecessors, Flat Out: Ultimate Carnage boasts only better graphics. Car handling, and especially, Force Feedback, are pathetic.   The cars feel more like driving bars of wet soap... while the Force Feedback has been reduced to 'rumble' in your steering wheel or joystick... A pathetic excuse considering the fun its former incarnations yielded. Buy at your own risk. I did, and regret it still... $5 or not.
521	That windows LIVE â¥â¥â¥â¥....
522	Rubbish console port.
523	Good game, bad port.
524	flatout 2 is better and bassrain is noob
525	Great game, good graphic, but you can play it only if you have MS Games For Windows - you can't play without it and you can't save game without account in it. Because of MS forcing me to use their sht, I cannot recomend this game...
526	Very disappointing compared to the other games in the series it seems like just A revamp of textures.
527	Tons of fun, great gameplay. Definetly but it on the SALE!!!
528	This game is ok i guess but flatout 2 is better.
529	Not only does it use Games For Windows Live, but it also does not even start on my computer. Just get Flatout 2, it's the same game without the â¥â¥â¥â¥.
530	If you have 99.9% stable connection then go ahead buy this game, otherwise stay away.  When you in the mood for playing this game, then the internet goes unstable GFWL won't let you play with your saved game. even it asks you to enter the serial number again sometimes. mood ruined
531	this is just Flatout 2 with worse music ok it has online play but if your just looking for a fun racing game with great music Flatout 2 if the one + its Â£10 cheaper I really wish I had just got a new copy of Flatout 2
532	Horrible Microsodft Games For Windows Live is preventing me from playing or even signing in. Can't play on my windows 10 home laptop.
533	This game......is TOO DIFFICULT TO PLAY. It's games like this that make me hate racing games, there's no difficulty and the enemies catch up to you within' seconds of you going into 1st. Imagine Dark Souls...but for racing and you'll have this game.

535	A disappointing rehash of the previous 2 Flatout games. If you haven't played them already, it might be more fun for you, but it didn't hold my interest whereas I completed the previous two in their entirety.
536	Am i understand it correctly, Live requires Gold subscription to be able to play online on PC?
537	Do not buy, the game uses Windows Live which has been shut down, so it won't even start on your PC.
538	A pretty dull arcade racer, with an execrable nu-metal soundtrack. Avoid.
539	This game will no longer run on any platform as windows live in=s no more. thanks for stealing money steam (valve)
540	Windows live is a reason not to buy this. another reason is that this game just os not that good. i prefer flatout 2 above this.
541	BallsOut: Ultimate Shartage
542	If it wasn't for the fact that I have an unhealthy obession with cheevos I'd have tossed this game in my 'Never again' category a while ago.
543	This game is a wreck. 6/10
544	Steam sells broken games... criminals
545	it wont open i tryed but no still nothing that was a waist of money for me it use to work but now it just stuffed up so its CRAP
546	beautiful acard racer but way too easy,so does the play no fun if you do not exhausting must defeat around the ki.
547	Hands down one of the best racing game I've played. The feel of smashing AI cars into walls or objects is one of the best feeling you can get in a car game. You're also rewarded for doing so which is just lovely.  Has GFWL though and the MP part is dead but for me the SP was enough. Lovely driving game.
548	Best in series. A must buy for fans of the previous games.
549	Destruction, fun,drive and cool music. Must buy
550	shoot the driver
551	Remake of The second with new graphics, new characters and vehicles and the gameplay is really good. New soundtrack sucks and Games for Windows Live... nononono
552	drunk driving with the pimster, YES PLEASE! pretty game, excellent control of vehicles, fantastic soundtrack, i need say no more, just try it for yourself, you will LOVE it!
553	Awesome Game Awesome Destruction and when windows live is gone hope all the bad stuff is remove but I have loved this game since I got the steam version and the DVD version love it love it love it! With it being on sale its a great buy!
554	Bought it when it was on sale at 2$. It's tons of fun at that price. Just wait for the next sale and it'll be worth it.
555	You can play bowling by throwing your driver through the windscreen  11/10
556	This is a rather good racing game. I like the destroyable environment and the destruction in general. The Force Feedback is pretty cool, too. It's just made me a little bit mad when it forced me to create a Windows Live account, which was not necessary in Flatout 2. I'll give it a 9/10
557	Really nice driving game, but if you do own FlatOut 2, I don't recommend this because the game is almost ident-copy of FO2... Too bad, the missions are running at the same order, cars are nearly the same, there is just some minor changes...  Still, this is the game for ultimate &amp; funny stunting &amp; crashing!
558	best racing game buy now
559	Great remake of the FlatOut 2 classic - improved handling and physics making racing much more comfortable, and I really enjoy having 11 competitors instead of the original 7.   However I have a few specific problems, firstly being the reset input. In races it can theoretically be used at any time, however in derbies it takes upwards of 15 seconds to reset after being flipped or getting stuck on other cars, leaving plenty of time for other competitors to smash into you multiple times. I was hoping this would have been an improvement from FlatOut 2, but it wasn't.  Secondly, health seems to have been decreased, or smashing and crashing deals more damage. I'm not sure which one it is, but it's too simple to wreck an opponent. In 4 lap races on wide and open tracks, a third and sometimes a half of the racers are wrecked long before the race is finished.  Finally, this game is way too easy. The improvements made were necessary, but it's also taken away the challenge of the game. I'm halfway through the Race Series with 100,000CR, enough to buy a new car and all the upgrades with 40,000CR in the pocket. With health decreases and damage increases, I average around 15 slams and up to 3 wrecks per race, while finishing in 1st place and 10 seconds ahead of 2nd place, and with the rewards money is very easy to accumulate.  FlatOut 2 was my childhood so it's great fun to play through these games again. I'm thoroughly impressed by Ultimate Carnage and will continue to play it for hours upon hours, and others should too. Recommended for mindless smashing, crashing, explosions and complete destruction, this game doesn't disappoint.
560	Brilliant and Fun Game! But can be fustrating at times when your in 1st position and your car flips over for no real reason. But other than that a addicting and enjoyable game!
561	This is a fantastic game. However, be aware that this is simply an upgraded version of Flatout 2. If you already own Flatout 2, there's not much that is added in this one aside from better graphics and a few extra modes and vehicles. If you're trying to choose between the two however, get this.
562	If you dont own any of the 'Flatout' series I can save you some money. People buy 'Flatout 2' and then 'Flatout ultimate carnage'. Thats a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing no brainer as 'Flatout Ultimate carnage' IS 'Flatout 2'! 'Flatout 2' was awesome but the graphics were nothing to write home about. So They developed 'Flatout ultimate carnage' to bring the graphics up to date. So 'Flatout ultimate carnage' is basically Flatout 2 'HD' version. The graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome and they have tweaked the mini games. When Steam does it's deals you'd be crazy to pick Flatout 2 over 'Ultimate carnage' Dont say I didn't warn you.  Damage(in all aspects) is a huge part of the game and is what makes it stand out It has enough customisation that actually makes sense to add to the game and to keep pushing you on. But thankfully unlike a sim it never takes itself too seriously.  Fast, fun and addictive. not a sim, thank â¥â¥â¥â¥&gt;CHUCK
563	Al options are open in multiplayer.
564	awesome game still play it to this day, the ebst in the serious without question. I hated racing games my whole life until i stumbled onto the orginal flatout many years ago. The sound track and just pure fun level of this game is addicting. I enjoy other modern racing games also, but in terms of just plain fun this still takes the cake.
565	When first playing Flatout: Ultimate Carnage, there was a lot of similar feel to Flatout 2. The interface is the same, the driving mechanics are about equal, maps are the same (for most of them), but the graphics are improved and a lot of little things were added. I feel like this is a better and updated version of Flatout 2. And I would say that this is the best of the series, and next in line is Flatout 2.
566	Great game but it requres Windows Live which was discontinued. Without signing in to Window Live you cannot save. The game is unplayable.
567	Still, it will not work without an online account at GFWL. How is this still legal?
568	fun for a while ..
569	I hate racing games. Gran Turismo and the like. But FlatOut: UC, is the best racing game I've played. It's Burnout 3 levels of fun. Everything is just so breakable, and I adore that. You smash your car into the one in front at full speed, and one of you is guarenteed to fly out the windshield. You hit a wall at full speed, and you car is going to be much worse for wear.  Soild 9/10. Music is awesome, gameplay is awesome, car damage is gorgeous.
570	7/10  Golden game! both flatout mode (racing) and carnage mode (stunts) are awsome.  Has games for window's live, so yea...  
571	This game. Nuff said.    Really though, it's got awesome physics, awesome racing, and awesome minigames. All around good and fun to play. Surprisingly easy to run too.
572	Great amusing Single- and Multiplayer arcade racing games. The main goals are race and wreck, and it works pretty damn well. The time of the single player is very good. And then theres a good multiplayer. You can also get 50 achievements using Games for Windows Live. Good graphics fun game modes, and you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the mini-games aswell.
573	One hell of a game... in a positive way
574	â¥â¥â¥â¥ off GFWL!
575	The best racing game i ever played!!!
576	not really recommending for the price of 18. get it while on discount, just a hd remake of Flatout 2. but i still prefer the original
577	good game, destruction derby owns
578	I recommend the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the game  - Wyatt Chode 
579	FlatOut Ultimate Carnage is a driving game for people who don't like driving games. It doesn't allow you to tinker with your gearing ratio and your spoiler angle. It doesn't offer accurate simulation of the performance of real-world supercars. It doesn't even pretend to have realistic physics.  What it does do is let you go fast and smash into other cars. A lot.   I enjoyed this, not quite so much as I did the competitor BurnOut series, but enough to give it a thumbs-up. It's easy to get into, and dishes out over-the-top high speed mayhem for the non-gearhead.
580	it did not even open for me ..................................so no i dont know anything about how it plays ..................................
581	Best flatout ever, nice graphics and gameplay, I recommend it ;)
582	!!!! WARNING !!!!!   I bought this game today 11/04/2015, it DOES NOT start due to the 'Live Initialization Failed' error. Tried both options below, neither worked. Seems I am out of options, and lost my money.  THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY, AND THE GAME WON'T WORK!!!!!!  Buyer beware !!!  - Installing the Neither the XLiveRedist01.02.0241.00.msi file in the \Steam\SteamApps\common\FlatOut Ultimate Carnage\support directory.  - Installing Windows Marketplace client from  http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/pc/downloadclient .
583	I bought that game with Complete Flatout pack and i can say this one is the best of all four... Looks like Flatout 2 but with a improved graphics... I love it! Flatout 3 i unistalled after 5 minutes of playing xD
584	Its a whole lot of fun. Great arcade racer.
585	eh, it was on sale and is worth 2$
586	This is currently my favorite, 'racing,' game on the PC. When I'm in need of some mindless destruction, this is typically where I go... This or APB.  When comparing this to Flatout 2, I have mixed opinions... This is certainly more pretty than Flatout 2, but Flatout 2 doesn't require me to have Games for Windows Live running in the background.
587	How Kryten from Red Dwarf would put it: 'A superlative game, sir, with just two minor flaws. One, Games for Windows Live, and two, Games for Windows Live. Now I realise that, technically speaking, that's only one flaw but I thought it was such a big one it was worth mentioning twice.'
588	This game and Flatout 2 are the same thing, but this one has better graphics and a bad soundtrack.
589	this game is best ... ok i will start on how good old school gaming is meh it useless to explain,it cant reach people positively with words anyway .... experience will do,i cant say anything,tbh this recommending thing is stupid imo
590	With this version of Flatout you get all of the Flatout fun without any of Flatout 3.
591	Flatout Ultimate Carnage: Well installed this game and to my delight was blown away with classic racing game, It should be Flatout 2 Ultimate Carnage Reborn: All that i loved about Flatout 2 is here with new gfx and awsome gameplay. My playtime is short at this time but i dont think i will ever un-install this game, its got replay, replay, replay never will i get fed up of this fantastic fun racing game :)   My Score  GFX 10/10 Fantastic new look :) Sound 10/10 Cars :) Music 10/10 Like Flatout 2 Fantastic Tunes :) Gameplay 10/10 Feel and drive like they should awsome!! Replay 10/10 Will never un-install :) Fun 10/10 :) :) :) Would recommend this to all Flatout Fans &amp; those who like racing games.
592	  Amazing game!Too bad nobody plays multiplayer no more.
593	A downgrade in beauty and a downgrade audio from the original Flatout 2. On top of that you have the horrid Games For Windows Live experience. Just get Flatout 2 instead. I love Flatout2, so I wanted to check out the 'upgraded' version of it. All this seems to offer is more simultaneous cars on the track, but so many nice little touches are missing, it feels like a downgrade for sure.
594	unplayable now....
595	Even though this game has been out for years and years. I still recommend it.  This is just one of those games where the developers just say screw it. And do it right. Cars drive well for what it was meant for and the gameplay is downright fun. Multiple race types, demoliton derbys. Rocket car stunts. Is easy at first. But as you progress through to the different classes the game becomes alot more difficult. Even for an experienced racer like myself. Cars will go from very tough but slow. (Derby) to crazy fast but very brittle. (Street) A modest selection of cars for its age. And a multitude of tracks and challenges. Not to mention the cheats in non-story mode races which can spice things up.  Its just one of those undying classics you rarely find these days.
596	Just buy a rust bucket, add parts to make it better and go for the destruction. I've played this game a lot when it launched long time ago and still find fun today playing races or challenges. Has some hilarious crashes and fun (sometimes frustrating) mini games that you can play with friends (hot seat, since multiplayer does not work because of infamous GFWL).  To me it is the best of the Flatout series, after you find a fix to the annoying GFWL it runs fine, just don't alt-tab :D  Recommended if you like casual racing destruction
597	Carnage to the full! Nice graphics destructable enviroment and damage model that until wreckfest came about was top of its class. Pass on DiRT showdown and go straight for this.
598	Fun flatout game, once you get past the pain in the â¥â¥â¥ part, getting GFWL if u didnt already have it. After that it is actually fun. It really is just an improved Flatout 2. Yes it is actually like a flatout 2.5. But there isnt anything wrong with that. Graphics are better, and this seems to be the only Flatout game with working multiplayer...
599	This game is amazing
600	Any of guys remember Destruction Derby? Those boxy cars with first ever destructible physic. That thing was off the hook. INSANE. I used to get lost in that game for week. Police would come looking. I'd hide for one more race. It was awesome.  Guess what, Flatout as savored some of that taste will serve it to you on silver platter. Yes, this is road rage at its finest with fast nitro fueled racing, cars shattering into pieces and derbies taking place around every corner. All of this is garnished with pop rock and served with a side dish of a very entertaining car Olympics type of game mode that could in fact serve as a standalone game.   So what you have in there is very sturdy racing game with an acceptable career mode where you upgrade and buy new vehicles as you progress into faster tiers.  A party game where you can take turns in driving your car into a wall and seeing how far or how accurately you can launch the driver through the front window (a lot fun! there is bowling, curling, ski jump and tons more); this works in single player as well. And last but not least a multiplayer game where you can race your friends and/or trash their cars on the parking lot. Fabulous stuff! So if you are in for a solid arcade race and appreciate good destruction. You pretty much canât go wrong here. NB! Shortcuts and destructible environment is included!  8/10
601	Just Buy It.....You'll Love It!
602	ok game it doesnt have the best damage and is not realalistic      ps; i like the bus     also you need to have a xbox live account for this game to work
603	A very cool game, amazing destruction and graphics, this game plays and looks like it was made in 2012 with medium budget, but sadly multiplayer is quite dead. Hopefully more people will start playing it.  
604	I personally feel that this is one of the best racing games currently out. It may be a few years old but it looks great, the damage mod is excellent, and is fun as hell.
605	Wrecking cars without getting head trama.
606	crash and burn baby!
607	This is the latest edition to the Flatout series, I love it!
608	This game is the perfect balance between arcade accessibility and accurate-feeling physics. You can play it with the keyboard. Low maintenance destructive fun. I love that there are no weapons other than the car itself. Straight racing is rewarding and challenging and demolition derby is hilarious especially on a LAN. Skip stunt mode though, it's frustrating and kind of stupid. Overall I highly recommend especially if on sale.
609	Another fun game I wish some of my friends owned! Only problem is...Windows Live!
610	This is an arcadey classic that you should give a go round. Great fun and you can find it for cheap!
611	Vroom Vroom, crash, Bang, KABOOM 8/10 what more can I say?   Nah, regardless this is a pretty fun arcade racer, It has great visuals, an abundace of cars, an upgrade system, enough minigames to make a ninendo fan wet, and some kik â¥â¥â¥ crashes.  The controls are fairly well layed out, and the game runs great. It would be a 9 - 10 if It didn't have Games for windows live.  Pick it up while it's on sale, 4.99 for this game is a steal!
612	One of the best arcade racing games of all times with realistic physics.
613	I would totally recomend it, best multiplayer i've played in a long time, you can even do tournaments with your steam palls. ITS A MUST HAVE GAME
614	A lot of fun but,you must be one with a controller!
615	Do you like a good racing game? this is the game for you! chaos and destruction on the racing track, blast you fellow racers out of the track in a power blasting racing game! The game is just very good, every single one in the series (except for FlatOut 3, it has diffrent maker that just f*ck*d it up) Ultimate Carnage is the same as FlatOut 2, but then with more racers, 12 instead of 6. I give this game a 8.5 out of 10!
616	As stated in reviews, this is basically a port of Flatout 2 with a graphics update. Having said that, Flatout 2 was one of my favorite games on the PS2, so I am enjoying the view as I replay a treasured memory. I recommend this game to racing fans who like to rub fenders. The car damage is visually appealing, you'll know where you were hit, and personally, I find the game hilarious. 'Crashing out' an opponent, where one is ejected through the windshield of one's car, or even being crashed out myself, is some of the best laugh-out-loud moments I've had in gaming for some time. The addition of leaderboards adds to the replayability. The stunt challenges are difficult but addictive. The tracks look great, and have lots of destructible objects to ram through in order to gain boost, but I wish the tracks didn't overlap on each other so much. Farm Valley 1 and Farm Valley 2 will share sections of track, for instance, which doesn't really work for me. On the bad side, the soundtrack is short, repetetive, and, unmemorable. Sometimes objects will intersect with cars in an unrealistic way. Like any game we love, it's too short.  Overall 8/10
617	OK, first I want to make clear that I love the living heck out of the Flatout franchise and if there is one Flatout game to buy -- this would be it. But this game IS Flatout 2 with much...much.... better graphics. Not kidding. Same cars, same tracks... same people flying out the windows (I love that), just much prettier. Also they changed the soundtrack. Speaking of soundtrack the Flatout UC songs are nowhere as good as the old ones: I just turn the audio down and hum Alkaline Trio's Oh, mercy me while barreling through the Flatout UC's many detailed tracks. There are single races, cups, demo derbys, online play and even challenges involving hurling the driver from the car for distance, In the end, this game offers a whole lot of races, tracks, upgrades and cars to tear around in.   If you have a top notch PC this is among the best racers the PC platform has to offer. If your PC is aging a bit you may want to download the less resouce intense Flatout 2.
618	Ever played those so-called driving simulators and just had this ridiculous urge to smash your car into your opponents rather than race down the track like you normally would?  This game fulfills that need. That cars feels like they have a lot of weight to them, so handling is a bit on the slower end - don't expect to be doing Ridge Racer/Burnout Paradise-style drifts around hairpin turns. On the flipside, if you can't drift around a turn, you can ram your car into that of your rivals and use them as a source of Boost/Nitro to speed past them!  This is basically a '.5' expansion of FlatOut 2 and a far more complete PC version. You have much higher res textures, better controller support, a more configurable launcher and options menu (windowed mode is in without the need for DxWnd!), more game modes, more cars, more simultaneous AI on the track - basically more of everything. The ONE main thing that is the sore point of this game is GfWL, and knowing that Bugbear and Empire Interactive pretty much split awhile back, this game's days are numbered, but this game really is the best version of FlatOut from someone who just wants the main game experience.  If you like this game, please support Bugbear Entertainment's spiritual successor named 'Next Car Game'!
619	Best racing game i've ever played.
620	FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is essentially a high-definition update of FlatOut 2. There are a couple of new gameplay modes and some technical improvements, but that's about it.  Still, the game is enjoyable. It looks a lot better and the physics have been beefed up, which leads to lots of big crashes. The FlatOut 2 campaign was fun, and it's still fun here. The minigames return intact, and they're more addictive than they should be.  FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is a Games For Windows Live title (you can't run the game without it), and there are over 40 achievements to try and get. Some of them are pretty difficult to obtain, so if you like achievements FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage has them.  FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is best-suited for people who never played FlatOut 2. However, if you don't have FlatOut 2 anymore and want to play it again, Ultimate Carnage will do the job.
621	Flatout 2 for PS2 made my childhood, everyday after school i spent hours on that game. Now it has it's HD remake. Buy.
622	This is a great game. Super for lans. Get it if you want a break from the endless stream of fps games but don't want to play a strategy game or a nascar style racing thing.  Or better yet, preorder next car game from bugbear so we can have a new flatout.
623	this was one of my fav raceing games 4 years ago and it still is today
624	10/10
625	42 hours in total playing FLATOUT: Ultimate Carnage in Steam for now! What can I say? For me, the best racing/crash game I ever played, a lot of races, TOP graphics, a lot of cars that you can buy new engine, tires, suspension, brakes, and go on... This game was the best deal I made in Steam, for sure! VERY RECOMMENDED! TOP QUALITY!
626	This game didnt work at all for years after I bought it,what fixed it was I d/led ' microsoft games for windows marketplace' as per advice of sthe steam forum. didnt even have to sign it. It would've been NICE TO KNOW That when I bought it.
627	This re-release of FlatOut 2 adds a new Carnage Mode and gives you 11 opponents instead of 7, as well as a number of other improvements. They've made one of the greatest arcade racing games even greater. The main catch was that the game failed to start until I installed Games for Windows Live manually.
628	this game is just insane the physics are crazy and has a massive amount of replay value plus the side races and stunts are really fun. 8/10
629	Good arcade racer. Superior to Flatout 2 in graphics/gameplay. Lacks the mods that Flatout 2 has.
630	Great game to play with friends
631	&lt;3 that series
632	Have played pretty much all of the flatouts and they're flatout fun! get it if u like racing games.
633	More realistic than burnout even though they are no match. The only bad thing is that it uses GFWL and I would have no problem if it had steam cloud.
634	good racing game. entertaining and enjoyable. campaign is long enough and the achievements are good too. too ba the multiplayer is not populated anymore
635	Cars n crashes n splosions n â¥â¥â¥â¥
636	FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is a FlatOut 2 with some improvements but, you MUST INSTALL the Games For Windows Live (GFWL) to run this game.
637	Stupid GFWL or whatever. i bought this to play online with a friend but online mode doesnt work. why dont they allow us to open our own server like in every usual game? its so stupid. they just destroyed it  its a good game thou, i guess, felt good the 5 minutes i played it but i didnt want to play solo so i kinda feel ripped because it sais multiplayer but it doesnt have multiplayer :(  *edit* GFWL works again xD
638	Undisputably the best in the series. Lots of destruction, a variety of tracks and vehicles.
639	Another fine Flatout game, you race and wreck for extra points and money. Love the destruction derbies and HATE the dirt road tracks. Considering I paid 3 bucks for all of the Flatout Games in a bundle, I have to give the game a 7 out of 10.
640	I think the amount of time I spent playing this game speaks for itself. Great fun, great destruction, great multiplayer. It's a shame that Games For Windows Live is going down, and nobody really knows what will happen to this amazing game - we will see, I guess.
641	Love this game, great physics, cant count how many times ive played this game and completed it
642	Great arcade racer-loads of fun stuff to do
643	Simple, I love this game and always have.
644	FlatOut is an amazing title. After reading reviews and seeing people say the online no longer works. I am led to believe that is untrue. You need to download the Games for Windows Marketplace. It will enable the game to first start up... Now log into your hotmail account or xbox live account. Bingo bango... Lets crash
645	I recommend this game if you like next car game but make sure you can actually play it. everytime i play it something comes up saying live inilization error. I havent even gotten to play and non of the things people say seem to work.  I have windows 8 if thats the problem if anyone knows message me
646	I played the hell out of this game, and enjoyed it a lot. However, the issue becomes that, for seemingly NO reason, my save data was erased. I can only assume that Games for Windows Live is to blame, which means that if you want to make any progress, you'd better do it all in one sitting. Either that, or use cheat codes. But seriously, â¥â¥â¥â¥ having my save data deleted, or worse, reverted back to a FAR earlier point.
647	following up my reviews for flatout i have reviewed bot flatout 1 and 2 truthfuly in all ends meeting this IS FLATOUT 3 ! i bought the bundle and got all 4 games this is the best of them all the requirements are a lil higher then the rest but the gameplay is really that much more exciting in this one its pretty much flatout 2 with buffed up graphics and more cars to race with and derby with the mechanics are solid and i have almost 50 hrs into this game and about 100 hrs into the series if your looking for a great game or series to get into Flatout is the one on steam if u can get the bundle on sale its usually only 12 bucks i believe pick it up and give the series a try
648	Very good game, shame not so many people playing online though, much more fun playing live.
649	gameplay is fun but the windows live thing or whatever is really stupid
650	7 years after it was released and this game still packs a punch amongst racing arcade games, great game for a fun time with friends can be played for hours of fun or picked up and dropped just as a quick fix, still loving this game many years after its realease and the graphics are pretty damn good too :-)
651	I would of recommended this game being it's SUPER FUN buy can't due to the fact it doesn't save my progress! Also had to do a Google search in order the find out how to launch the game, which Steam didn't mention? Encase someone was wondering here's instructions for the launch problem,   Steam Folder:  X:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\flatout ultimate carnage\support  And install:  XLiveRedist01.02.0241.00.msi   
652	this game really is awesome but there is 1 big problem with it ..... games for windows live ..... so its nearly impossible to play online .... if u dont care about that and want a good Race / Derby Game get it ..... fun 11/10 ... windows live fun 0/10 ... enjoy
653	Hard to decide if I want to recommend this game. Here's why :  I've played FlatOut 2 for ages. And I love it. I'm playing FOUC these days, because achievements, 11 opponents (yay more victims \o/ ), carnage mode, nice graphics. And it's good. It's really a good game.  Unless you played enough FO2 to notice some details:  Let's start with the elephant in the room : no mods. Though I can live without it, I like my AIs with a bunch of muscle cars from the FOJ packs. I don't feel like it's that necessary because of all the cars I've seen in the mod packs, my favourite remains the Bullet GT (ultimate car in the game).  Until I made my way to the Bullet GT, FOUC was simply FO2 with better graphics and more AIs. Then, I unlocked the Bullet GT and lifted an eyebrow. Bugbear, Strike One for changing the visual design of my favourite car. Oh well, I suppose I don't care, I use the bumper view anyway...  Then I upgraded it to the max and noticed the top speed attribute is a mere ~6.5/10. Wait what ? oO Yup, that's the worst point in the game for me.  I loved playing FO2 because of this car. Because it was stupidly fast. 9.8 topspeed, 10 acceleration, 4.3 handling, 10 nitro 0 to 342km/h in a ridiculous number of seconds with nitro. Basically a rocket with wheels. And so rewarding when you master it.  So I went for a test drive with my new FOUC Bullet GT. Obviously, I nitroed all the way to ... 280km/h and sighed.  I'll also mention some tracks have been ... reworked (aka 'made easier to race')  Basically, I don't get my fix by playing the Street Grand Finals with my faithful Bullet GT as I did on FO2 on numerous occasions. Hell, I can't even drive on walls anymore =( (fixed physics or simply lack of speed, I'm not sure)  So, I guess I'll recommend the game because it is good in its core and has more gamemodes than the original. But I'll advise to also get FO2 (or only FO2 if you really have to choose)  I'm kind of sad that I cannot get the best of these two in one game...
654	This is an otherwise okay game, but is damned by G4WL-integration and a very poor match-making system. Add that to a complete lack of any sort of LAN play, and not even the updated graphics can save the overall negative impression of this title.
655	The only Flatout you should buy, new version SUX
656	Gameplay, Graphics and crappy windows live aside THIS IS THE WORST PORTED GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN!
657	The game is giving what is expected, but they've ruined the experience with the Microsoft Live. From the first 30 minutes of gameplay 25 minutes went on waiting for the Microsoft servers to respond and setting up a useless account.
658	I got my batmobile going so fast I broke the game when I won the race  Ranyard/10
659	Greatest racing game ive ever played, its a shame it doesnt work for me now if anyone has the same problem can u message me if u found how to fix
660	One of the best racers of all time! Too bad its online community is pretty dead =(
661	the best soundtrack i have ever heard oh and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you windows live.
662	A racing game that rewards, not penalizes you, for punishing opponents as hard as possible. I like. I like very much.
663	Warning: This will not work for Windows 10 users and even if you don't have Windows 10, It uses Games For Windows Live still.
664	Get rid of Games For Windows: Live. Other than that, it's a fine game.
665	You know, Some people think games like Need for Speed or Nascar are the Best Racing Games, Mabye, Mabye, But, I have yet to meet someone who could outrace FlatOut. This Game Combines Racing and Demolition Derbies like Cake and Ice Cream. This game, Is like a mix between Twisted Metal and Need for Speed. This Series is the Best Racing Series I have ever played to date and can say, without a doubt, I have never played a better racing game than this.
666	By far, the best game in the FlatOut fanchise!
667	windows live sucks cant play
668	This Game Is The Best Game And By Far Its My Favourite! Good Job BugBear!
669	I've played the whole Flatout series, and this one is by far the best. Best graphics, more cars. Race grid went from 8 to 12 cars. I prefer the racing modes over the 'novelty' stunt or demolition derby modes, but to each his own I guess. The cars all have unique characteristics as far as speed, handling, nitro, etc, and are nicely modelled. The crashing and environmental destruction is satisfying. The ragdoll physics are amusing and sometimes hilarious. Quite a fun game overall if you like racing and wrecking.  My few beefs with the game are as follows: -Car customization could be a bit expanded. I think you get a choice of one of six colors of the same basic paintjob for each car. -Car upgrades are a bit primitive and limited. -Multiplayer is dead, I've never found an online game -Could use more variety of tracks. -Object physics are a bit unpredictable and can be frustrating. You can sometimest plow right through a steel beam with no problem, ten seconds later you hit a potted plant or a lawnchair and it launches your car 10 feet in the air.  The biggest problem I have with the game is the following: Once you have earned and upgraded all the higher-end cars, it's not much of a challenge to beat the competition quite easily.  I often run the crappier cars just to have some challenge involved in winning races, with the better cars it's just way too easy. I wish there were a way to adjust the AI maybe 5-10% faster in order to get some closer racing.  In spite of the negatives I have listed, I still rate this game quite highly for fun factor. Learning the fast lines around the tracks and working your way up to earning enough money to buy better cars and upgrades is an engaging challenge. (although some cars can only be unlocked by winning special events).The problem is that once you've got all the cars and upgrades, you kind of reach a plateau and there's really nowhere to go from there, it becomes too easy. Bear in mind that this review is focussed on the racing aspect of the game, others might have a lot of fun with the derbies, stunts and special events.   Despite my review including a lot of negatives, they are overall minor in nature. The game is very fun, and can be quite humorous at times. I guarantee you will get some good laughs out of it. It includes easy arcade style car handling, enjoyable drifting, jumping, crashing, ragdoll physics and environmental destruction. It's crazy good fun, in spite of it's few relatively minor flaws. If you enjoy high speeds, crashing, explosions, and sending your competitors through their windshields headfirst into a concrete bridge abuttment, this is for you. I recommend it highly.  Edit: I've seen a lot of reviews bashing this game due to GFWL causing the game to not run. I simply downloaded the latest iteration of GFWL and have never had a problem with it since.
670	BUY THIS GAME It's easily the best FlatOut game in the series. I'd get the other games (except 3) too, but this game holds a special place (to me anyway) as a masterpiece of a racing game. It's essentially a better FlatOut 2. Get this game now! Stop â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reading this!
671	Ultimate Carnage was a port of FlatOut 2 for Xbox 360, that got ported back to PC with minimal changes in comparison with the original second one, but still amazingly fun. The biggest change was more drivers on tracks and greater graphical details. I would recommend Ultimate Carnage to everybody who loved the first two games and to people who just like to destroy stuff and enjoy one of the best PC racing games. It runs flawlessly even when it is, like I said, double port. Too bad it is the last FlatOut to this date.  NO! Just forget that there was anything like Flatout 3. IT IS TERRIBLE, PLEASE DON'T TOUCH IT!
672	Destruction At Its Best
673	Cooll:D
674	need somting to release your stress? then the flat out series is what you want, espechaly this one. This game is basicly a slight remake of FO2, but with more racers, Difrent songs and some gameing modes like beat he bomb and carnage mode. Plays great. their are only 2 problems i have, 1 is not really a problem but the sound track is kinda Meh to me but that is just my opinon, I created a custom sound track playlist on youtube to give it a more Flatout feel. the 2nd gripe is the windows live thing. it was a gauntlet for me to get the save feature to work. and with windows live i cant merge my offline save with my Online save. so be aware of that when your playing.
675	 FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage
676	You get scored on how much damage you can do, bonus points for removing competition from the race... Fast cars and explosions... What more do you need to know?
677	complete and funny game. buy it on offer sales
678	It's garbage. If you can actually manage to get it to work (Which I did after a few weeks of tweaking, not only with the settings, but with wires and crap too) then it's completely unplayable. The only carnage it does is to your CPU, might as well call it Flatout: Ultimate Garbage Get 'Next Car Game: Wreckfest'. Same company, better gameplay, works even in beta.
679	Really worth the money. Crash derbies, intense races!
680	This is such an amazing game! In my opinion, it's underrated and not as popular as it should be. The game is fun, action-packed, and so addictive! It's is similar to FlatOut 2, however, this game has more game modes and updated graphics comparing to FlatOut 2. And surprisingly enough, the online servers in the game are still running in Ultimate Carnage! The thing is that you will need to download the Games for Windows Live client (remember GFWL back in the days?) because the online servers are run by it. All you need is a Microsoft account, and you can play online. There are a few people playing the game, but I've never come across a time where there was no one playing at all, so there's always a lobby to join. Any who, the game is tremendously fun! It's like Burnout, but different in a few aspects (more realistic, but it still maintains the massive mayhem that it contains) It's an action racing game, and the crashes and wrecks are what the game are great at delivering. There is also stunt mode, which is familiar to FlatOut fans as this mode has been around since the first instalment in the FlatOut series. You are in a huge and vivid stadium, and you are to send your driver flying through the stadium and hit bowling pins, dunk slam them into basketball baskets, hit them with a gigantic baseball bat, and so much more! The stunts are so fun and addictive, and absolutely hilarious because the way the characters move like ragdolls and fly around are funny! There is also a derby game mode, where the cars are parked on the edge of the arena, and they are going to drive and wreck each other, which is fun and addictive too. If you are a multiplayer type of person, then I'd still recommend this game to you, because it's so awesome when it comes to multiplayer (servers are still online). You can do demolition derbies, races, and even stunt modes in online. And the best part is doing stunt modes with other people, as you can see each other flying like ragdolls XD The areas and tracks are also nice and interesting. You can drive on off-road tracks, or race on oval tracks... or even drive through trolleys in malls! The tracks are fun and entertaining! If there was a bad thing about this game... it would be that the cars are too sensitive and slippery comparing to other racing games. They can be brought to a halt by simply hitting traffic cones and chairs. But any who, it doesn't bother me at all, as there are simply too many pros. Brilliant game, brilliant franchise! I'm excited for their next game: FlatOut 4!!! :D :D :D
681	This will always be Bugbear's masterpiece, seeing as Wreckfest is stuck in early access limbo and nothing seems to be changing any time soon.
682	Flatout Uc is a great game. I have played Flatout since the beginning. I Highly recommend this game. YOU WILL NEED a windows live account to play. no big deal though. Hit me up if you wanna race GAmertag---- allen187foreal.
683	Really great game of my youth. Gorgeous soundtrack, good gameplay and a fun atmosphere. No, I'm not crying, just something in my eye...
684	Still fun to play :)
685	Oh man! Once I bought Flatout: Ultimate Carnage and tried it out for the first time I remembered why I completely fell in love with Flatout in the first place; the sence of driving. Ever since the release of Rally Trophy Bugbear Entertainment have been able to capture such a brilliant feel to the car that driving doesn't get much better than this.
686	Conclusion: Very great medium spec pc game  Pros: DESTRUCTION BABY, physics are better than flatout 2, great optimization  Cons: ONLY ONE, GAMES FOR WINDOWS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LIVE.
687	A classic truck driving game, especially fun if you're a fan of other truck simulator games such as ETS and ETS2 by the same developers! While obviously not as polished as it's more recent cousins, it most certainly has it's charm and can still live up to an enjoyable driving simulator, especially for the cracking price this gem usually is at sales. Naturally I recommend this game because of it's nice scenary, mission variety, controller support and just how well built it is. I haven't had a single crash with this game. If you have a gaming wheel like I do with my Logitech Driving Force GT then you'll be happy to know you can also use them with this game. So what are you waiting for? Get trucking!
688	to me this is a good game because i like driving trucks. if you don't like driving trucks maybe a truck driving game is not for you
689	Bought within a set a long time ago and decided to play it again, so price isn't a factor in this. Also, I do not normally play driving games (racing or otherwise) and have not played  Euro Truck Simulator 2  (newer by the same developer).  Pros: - Surprisingly good traffic AI (although not very realistic), they normally slow down for ya, but had a guy run me off the road after a weigh station. - Surprising depth and possible re-playability. - Decent graphics for a 7 year old game.  Cons: - Poor key bindings (did not have a steering wheel) - Repetitive (as can be expected I guess) - Difficulty entering cities from highways - Bad camera angles  To elaborate, I enjoyed my few hours of playing. My time was spent making a delivery from Dallas to El Paso (something), El Paso to Albuquerque (Coal), Albuquerque to Dallas (Explosives). I found the West and East legs to be easy and tedious, with the north and south legs to be more difficult. I noticed that there's a way to buy many trucks and trailers as well as have contracts created for companies. I did not investigate the business side of the game, but do know it's there for another play time.  I used a key pad which had most of the keys bound to and found that the bindings were not terrible, but limiting. I could not use the number pad to answer radio calls and had no idea what each of the codes meant.  All in all, my biggest gripe was the limited access road to high way connections. When heading south on I35 from I40, I had to go through Dallas and come back around in order to reach my destination. This was the most annoying of the destinations, but I had a similar problem in El Paso and Albuquerque.    tl;dr: In summary, I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of the genre, otherwise I wouldn't. 4/10 
690	Shows it's age a tad, but a very sold trucking sim, more so then Extreme trucker. 7/10
691	Good game ageing though. Best US truck sim out there.
692	I don't have much to say about this game, other than that its systems are very good - starting off may be a little hard but after 4-6 jobs you start hiring more workers and get more experienced - buying new cabs for you and your workers and new trailers for your company, doing contracts, etc. The scenery isn't the best but the game is old. The time it takes to get somewhere my be a little long, but it isn't anything too long. Some people say it is the exact distance in real life - but I am not sure to this rumor. Driving may be boring sometimes, but somehow you get over it for either unexplainable reasons, or watching the scenery and cars, or talking to yourself, or you look at your map, or just stopping at rest stops and seeing civilization can get over that boringness... Somehow...   One thing I partly dislike about the game, is traffic. Yeah, the traffic is low and you can get somewhere quickly, but I don't enjoy how there are not too much medium or high traffic occasions - Sometimes, the cars infront slow down to a speed causing all the cars to slow down aswell, slowing down the whole process for a while until the front cars speed up. I think how long you stay in the traffic and when/how it happens is just fine, I am just kind of mad at acctidents:   Very rarley does an acctident happen, and when it does, all traffic is held up because of the cars in the acctident turning on their blinkers, not letting any cars or trucks pass them. This goes on and on and on and probably never ends, just sitting there, I've never had the patience to wait. To resolve this issue you have to advance time so all the cars would disappear... I just dislike how nothing happens. I see ambulances, fire trucks and police cruisers around the city and interstates. If there is a crash, I would have liked to notify truckers, which might (somehow) notify emergency services, and they may come responding to resolve the issue.   But don't get your hopes up for any updates, SCS Software is NOT coming back to a game this old. With all the Euro Truck Simulator, Extreme Trucker, and the all new American Truck Simulator (as of this writing it is very new), there is no point coming back to this game.   Overall, the game deserves an 8/10 for its organzation, system on building up your trucking empire and other aspects I may or may not have mentioned. For more information about the game or other games made by the company - visit SCS Software Forums.  EDIT: I also forgot to tell you that you should be saving at least every in game day or every 30 real life minutes due to a 'Prism3D.exe' error. Basically - after playing around 30 minutes - 1 hour, the game crashes showing a file saying 'Prism3D.exe' error. I have seen negative reviews just because of this problem. I warn you to keep saving or you might just not like the game because of one technical error.
693	This was what i used to play back when i was about maybe 7 and i wasnt allowed on the internet. I played this game day after day until the disk somehow broke into peices while in the cd drive and i havent played it for 4 years since. Then i realized this was on steam for a price of 9.99. Then i bought it so much nostalgia. So on to the review  This game was made back in 07 and its impresive with how good it looks even for being 7 years old. There getting old but they still look good,  Pros. -Graphics look nice for a game made back in 07 -Good game to run on older pc's that cant run euro truck simulator 2 (or 1)  -Affordible -Many trucks to buy in game (with ingame cash not dlc)  -Single delivery mode (You have infinate money and you can choose any truck you want) -Pretty decent Ai traffic (But not very realistic though) -Capable of modding (No workshop support but online you can download trucks and other things and simply drop it in your mods folder in the 18 wheels of steel directory Documents&gt;18 wos american long haul&gt; Mods Cons.  -Hard to enter cities from highways (Or interstates) -Annoying controls -Minor glitches barely noticible though  So heres my rating  Graphics: 9/10 These graphics are good for a 07 game. Gameplay: 9/10 (Gets repetive but who would of guessed) Music: 7/10 Music was ok but in game theres a radio in your truck that you can add your own music to (Google it)  overal. 8.5/10  Bottom line.   Euro truck simulator 2 but in america and older graphics
694	Is very good game, plenty of fun to be had would recomend
695	This game is great for people who love simulators and driving semi trucks.
696	A good ole classic 18 WOS game.
697	Good Game You just need time to play 
698	Not a bad game. ALH shows its age against newer trucking games with over sensitive steering, poor traffic flow, and of course worse graphics. Overall it's still a good game with a lot of highway to drive.
699	An old predecessor to  American Truck Simulator . If you want to drive a truck in american surroundings, go for ATS instead.  It was well made game with wheel support, good physics, trucking jobs, traffic rules etc. Nowadays it is slow motion game (driving 55 mph looks like driving 15 mph) with old graphic and control. Good for collecting old games from our childhood, not good for playing theese times.
700	Somehow enjoyed it even for 10 dollars
701	I tried to run this game for the last two days. It will not go on because it says corrupted installation. Reinstall application from original CD. Error was: [config file has missing uset command [r_device]]. I am not going to pay the game again. It also freezes up when you play it.
702	its a fun game to play little bit redundant after a bit but its always intresting
703	 What is this game?
704	I'm not sure what would bring someone to purchase or play this game, but if they retain the same mindset I don't think they'll be too disappointed. This is a game about trucks for people who really like trucks. Recommended if you like trucks.
705	An old game that didn't age well.  With games like Euro Truck Simulator that came out with better steering and more enjoyable in the game, 18 Wheels just couldn't standup against the newer games unfortuantely.  Great to have for nostalgia, but that is about that
706	my game doesnt work anymore =(
707	An instant classic if you also enjoy bowel cancer.
708	I like the game for just about everything in it. except the driving should be a little easier and more sensitive to the button pushng because it seems that i am getting late reaction from the driving.
709	Good open world truck driving game. Also, nice on the only SCS Software game with snow effects which is not modded and lots of roads and HQs out there plus trucks and even trailers you can own. Drivers can be hired via hotels as long your rating is good enough.
710	*note i have played alot more of this game but in disk form*  It is an amazing game and extreamly addictiave if you like sim/driving games 8.5/10 would buy again
711	it is a great game i love it for the stress of dealing with loads and your cash
712	â¥â¥â¥â¥ is off the hook!
713	good game but its old but its a good start for a truck simulator but if your looking for something more extrime in truck simulator try euro truck simulator 1&amp;2
714	I was playing other parts of this game and they were better. In my opinion this is not the best one but not the worst one. Could be better graphics but was werry playable. Love this game like all 18 wheels of steel games. Thumbs up!!
715	The game was and good for passing time however its not perfected it's an older game. Expect to get random tickets for no reason, poor graphics, and the occusional traffic jam. It is a fun game for the most and good for anyone who likes tycoon games or just simply drivnig around on the free way. 
716	Surprisingly more fun than you'd think.
717	its old, and has bad steering, and no good mods, but it has america, and canada. Do i think its worth buying, Yes i do
718	This may have been a good game when it first came out, but it isn't really all the great of a game now. SCS software improved slightly with Euro Truck Simulator.   Controls are difficult, truck takes forever to slow down. Fatigue happens way too fast. Driving distances are ok, though. Graphics are definitely outdated. Dashboards and the trucks are very decent, but a bit squarish in shape.  Do yourself a favor and buy Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. They are lightyears better than this game is.
719	Its an old game, so thats its only defensive. The game itself isn't very good, but what do you expect from a value title? The game itself is fairly poor, bad AI - and bad controls with the brakes being especially bad making it far too easy to run red lights or slam into the back of other vehicles.   Supposedly supports controllers, but didn't pick up mine.
720	its a cool game, if you like trucking you will like this game 
721	Upon release, virtually every aspect of 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul recieved unprecedented praise. Flexibility of approach, depth of gameplay, a uniquely fascinating world and the rare gall to bring literary inspiration to a medium oft dismissed as 'low art'. Everything that was said was, and remains, true; you'll find few aspects of 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul that fall short of its monolithic critical reception. And yet, as if I need heap further praises upon this exquisite, immortal behemoth; the game is greater than the sum of its parts. 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul finds countless methods of meaningfully intertwining gameplay, presentation and narrative. Its true, emergent magic blooms herein; where all three facets strengthen one another. Every mechanic, no matter how innocuous, refers to, is given frightening new relevance in the light of, the game's themata. Tragic character has been breathed into each and every one of its objects, its powers,
722	The game is brill for people who love to drive big tricks and be able to deliver the cargo etc.. i 'd say this game is 5/5 for truck lovers.
723	It just doesn't feel the same as the old 18WoS games... namely 18 Wheels of Steel Across America and 18 Wheels of Steel Petal to the Metal. If you can't get access to a legal copy of one of those two games this game will do, but it's lacking.

725	Who knew that driving backwards into traffic was considered illegal? I didn't. I do enjoy driving for 6+ hours for around 30 bucks. This game has taken around 30% of my life so far.
726	Police Corruption Simulator  Cop cars are just everwhere on the road, Penalties are absurd, No mouse steering support (There is a work-around for this fortunately.) 
727	First impression.  This game ruled when I was younger and my father was a trucker. Right now though it will collect dust.  Manage your truck and make deliveries around the country. Remember, they got bears in the air.
728	Do you have childrens? Are you a Children? Your child (or you) don't know how this game was awesome, at least in the 'age of awesome games'.  Everybody who have a PC and were playing GTA:SA, have this game too.  Want to remember child memories? Buy this game. Want to have any 'remember' of the childhood that you never had? Buy This game. Are you a MTHF, than just look for graphics? Go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself.
729	Very nice! I love this truck simulator, and I really like that the menu, and truck controls for example, are like UK Truck Simulator, and Euro Truck Simulator! Very nice huge map available! This is great!
730	pros:   The CB talk is kinda neat I like how to cop will pull me over    Cons: AI is wonky. so many cars at red lights wouldn't budge after the light goes green. If i hit someone a lot of times the car disapears but i have to move around the area to get past   Graphics are ok at best and the driving handles terribly. Would not buy again. Luckily I got it in a bundle very cheap, I can't imagine paying 10 bucks for this game.
731	needs to be a patch for this game i found one but its for the cd version i tried it and it said put cd in
732	Sine when do you EVER get fined $9,800 for going halfway over a pedestrian walk in a red light??
733	Its a good game if you like truck simulators good money and good trucks. I would also say Euro Truck Simlator 2 is a nother good game but its high priced but better then this!!! Love it
734	It looks like a cool game but the controls are terrible and the graphics sucks! I'll wait patiently for American Truck Simulator
735	this game is a waste of time, i read the reviews for this game and played a lot of euro truck sim 2 and wanted to play a trucking game in the US. If this game wasnt so outdated it would have been good but on my opinion its too old to be worth anything. my opinion is dont buy this game.
736	SCS is releasing Eurotruck Simulator 2 to Steam. I couldn't wait for it having played the demo, so I bought this game for 2.50.  Don't Do It!  That is all. I'm not even going to explain why I want to play these games anyway. I don't know.
737	The mirrors dont work, the steering is sloppy, you have very little visibility, you get randomly fined, and there arent that many cities compared to real life
738	it was ok i am giving it a no go tho the most anoying thing is thier are no places to rest and if you do find one i cant rest. i cant rest in the parking lots i cant rest at the gas stations i cant rest at REST stops ( their are none) i wanted a US road trucking game this my friends is not it for the moment if they do some up dates then maybe. I cant even get or drive threw my state like i want they should have a job in every state - hawaii inless you fly thier or something but i could even see alsaska having a fun drops or 2. think ICE ROAD TRUCKER. so if they make a up date that i dont have to pay for for a drop in every captial and a coupple major cities in each state i would think that would be sweet i mean how hard could that be 50 state cap drops and companies and 100 or so 2 major cities or more per state even that would be great and buy a shop ..... make it like euro truck sim 1 and 2 more so on the 2 and please please please fix the grafics if the UK can do that good then the US can do at least that much right....will change this review when they message me and fix some updates 
739	This game don't look like best sim ever. But it should be after several years of production, previously experience and budget etc. They probably spend most of that time on think how much money get from that 'product'. It is all reason of where it lead to. This title is not worth any attention anymore.
740	This game is crap. The graphics are lousy. It just doesn't feel like you are driving a real truck. Got immediately bored. The problem is I got spoiled on Euro Truck Similator 2, which I could play for hours. Instead pick up Euro Truck Simulator 2 on sale.
741	Tutorial? nope. Set goals? nope. Good graphics? nope. Good voice acting? nope. Even google doesn't quite know how this game works. On the plus side, it doesn't take up much disk space.
742	Do Not Even Press Add To Cart
743	Buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. Same company. Same series of games. This one is just too old and dated.
744	I have to say that I am a bit disappointed. I didn't realize that this game was actually made in 2007 so that is entirely my fault. The reason I am putting that I would not recomend this game is because I purchased it at 9.99 and it's only worth about 1.99 for today's standards, if that. We have better options and a company that wants to put something like this on the market should actually continue to make new versions to keep up with the standards.   This is all based on Today's standards vs. Today's price, year 2014. So the actual review is that the graphix are low end on high settings, not worth the price. The game lacks good control configuration though has limited keyboard/joypad binding. The actual controls are horrid - no smooth driving wheel rotation to keep on the winding roads(compairing to current standards of games that sell for 9.99 keep in mind).  I like the idea of police on the side of roads, but the don't actually pull you over and a ticket is way high for the lack of any kind of justice system. Two thousand dollars for a red light run is too much for a first offense even if you are guilty.  I personally think that you could spend your money on their more current games and get a better value. I would just take this off the market and make a new one if I were SCS. They do have better games.
745	I'm really torn to say if I recommend this game or not, It's a good game, but at the same time there are games much like it that are better. Years ago I loved playing this game, but Euro Truck Simulator 2 basically ruined this game for me... If you want a alturnitive to ETS2 this is a okay one (much better than extream truckers IMO too). but if your looking for a really good truck sim, jump to Euro Truck Simulator 2 instead.  Also the people making Euro truck simulator 2 are making a America version too, so that should be fun. ;)  PS I just realized ETS2 and This are made by the same Developer.  Anyway I'm going to go with No, wait for the America Truck simulator (my name for it :P) or get Euro Truck simulator, it's better than this game, even though this game isn't really bad. Plus youre atleast helping the same Developers. :)
746	This game is batter form the cd, U can add mods, for haulin game. This u can't opean any folders to cheat in save folder can't update this game, game steam owens sticks
747	worst peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ i have ever played.
748	One of the worst games I've ever played... it caused me physical pain. 20 minutes at 35 mph to get from one city to the next... and yet there's 'missions' to drive CROSS COUNTRY! I only clicked recommend so I could type about my pain. I AM NOT ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING THIS GAME TO ANYBODY!
749	Very difficult to control the truck using keyboard. No controller support. do not own a wheel,so cannot comment. everything else seems fine. 1/10 stars.
750	Yeeehaawww....I'm a reckonin I jus wasted meh money on this pile of cow menure!! Daggnabbit.
751	I think this game wanted me to drive all the way from one state to another. It didn't have sound either. This 'recommend' malark really should say 'review'. It doesn't tell you the keys for things or give you any indication of what you are meant to do. This meant that 5 mins was spent driving nowhere because I applied the break or something and another 5 mins was spent working out what I'd to do. Eventually I pulled in at one of the Windows 95 graphics buildings and attached a trailer. Why isn't this a worse gift than Bad Rats??  e: and now it doesn't say 'recommend' it does say 'review' woohoo
752	Very radical political statement on immigration 9/11
753	this game has problems the screen blinks
754	This game harkens back to a time when truck games were super lame and only existed to fill a niche. Go get Euro Truck Simulator 2 instead, which is only sort of lame by comparison.
755	not worth needs a lot of work euro is way better.
756	Works on my kids old pc, keeps him happy..
757	Right off the bat I'm going to say this game isn't worth $10. I managed to pick it up and at an insanely low price of $3, which it then, becomes good value. It models most of North America, albiet smaller. Driving from Florida to Vancouver will still take you the better part of 6-10 hours, so small is an overstatement. You can drive a decent selection of big rigs, and the game's compatible with most gamepads and wheels. Get contracts, haul countless types of cargo and drive across country in the snow, rain and of course sunny weather. Everything works on the truck, indicators, fuel, cops will even fine you for infractions. Talk to other trucks via radio about the weather, traffic reports or whatever else is relevant. Though it's not particularly pretty it does a great job at mimicing the lifestyle of a trucker... though, who the hell wants to be a trucker. 6 / 10
758	Absolute waste of money, Don't buy it doesn't help the character in away way at the start it just spawns you in with a Truck.   0/10
759	I personnaly dont reccomen this game some say it can be addictive but I do like the way its setup and some on the gameplay its just that it dosent seem realistic I mean The AI just stop in the middle of the Interstae or TransCanada they r dumb and impatinent
760	i wanted something like euro truck sim.. this was not it.. the driving mechanics are terrible in this game.. do not recommend at all
761	TLDR: Fun for a few hours, car AI sucks, cops are unfair, driving is okay, hauls take too long, slow to make money, some very fun opportunites to jump your truck.   Its fun, but i wouldn't recommend it. The driving mechanics are okay, its annoying that there is no completely player controlled shifting mode. Turn signals don't do â¥â¥â¥â¥, but emergency lights will make anyone near you slam on their brakes, which can be alot of fun on a boring long haul. There is a decent amount of road in this game, enough that long hauls take a very long time. It is too easy to damage the trailer, and it is also WAY too easy to run red lights. Effective braking can be accomplished by using the pedal brakes (S), the jake brake (B), and the parking brake (Space). Cars will honk at you for waiting patiently behind other cars at red lights. Cars will also make sudden turns in the wrong lanes that will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up. Cars will also turn right into your trailer without realizing that it is there until too late. Cops are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and can ticket you without even chasing you. If you pass by a cop on your side of the divided highway, they will ticket you, if you pass a cop on the other side of the road, they will pursue you, It is surprisingly easy to outrun the cops, but if you don't have some speed built up before you start the chase, you are screwed. Also, it helps to have some heavy traffic when in a police chase, the cops aren't the best at avoiding crashes. The sleeping mechanic in this game is annoying, without checking your driving logs you really have no idea when you are getting sleepy. There are also some glitchy spots where you can fall out of the map, as well as some AWESOME jump opportunities.    It would take a very long time to make decent money by delivering cargo, so instead i found an alternative method. Buy CHEAP used trucks, i think trucks under $50,000 are ideal, then fix them up and sell them. This way allows you to make money very easily. Don't buy expensive trucks and try to do this, the profit dissapears quickly as the price increases.
762	This is the best game ever. The 1 metre draw distance really allows you to suck in the beauty of the gorgeous textures that burn your retinas. The pop-in is great because it gives you a nice shock when a car pops into existance and you crash into it, adds a layer of tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The legal system is charmingly weird, as carnage will net you a fine of about $4.50 but running a red light, well, be expected to pay about $8000. The cabins were expertly designed, it's almost as if the game designers were real truck drivers. The driving mechanics are spot on, never have i felt more like i am driving an office chair with three broken wheels. The choice of drivers is a bit unrealistic most truck drivers don't make me feel anyone near as hot as those vague outlines did. All in all i think this game has perfectly captured what it is like to be a truck driver in America and how thrilling every day must be. Buy it for someone you don't like.
763	This Fraps video I recorded accurately sums up my experience with this piece of crap. Not worth the $3.40 I got it on sale for.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjEV809cQZM 
764	WHY THE HELL DID I BUY THIS
765	 Got this to re-live the memories of playing Cross Country Canada, it failed. Couldn't figure out how to start a mission or go anywhere, and frankly didn't care.  0/10
766	Runs at some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ resolution like 640x480, graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing godawful, crashes a healthy amount, boring, stupid premise, tedious gameplay where you get pulled over for speeding, KB+M controls don't lend themselves to anything having to do with Serious Driving. Other than that though, I was expecting to literally be given a dilation and curettage abortion through my scrotum of every organ involved with my urito-genital tract upon hitting 'PLAY,' and that didn't happen, so I would consider this game a pleasant surprise despite its flaws.

768	I was drunk when i bought this cuz i wanted to be a drunk trucker. Mission accomplished. I will probably never play this again...until my beers tell me otherwise.
769	Thumbs up!
770	reccomend with a caution.  Probably the best American truck driving game I have played, but it is an aging game engine. Graphics are okay, but somewhat dated. The textures are colorful, but flat looking.  Cons ------ It took some work to get my gamepad where the truck is drivable. Fatigue seems to come on you to soon, but if you can reach the side of the road, and have a sleeper. You can sleep there. Camera angles make backing up in third person harder than it could be, roads are kind of bland. Resting system could have been better as far as what you do to rest.   Pros ----- If you run a red light. It is not an automatic penalty. If you can drive clean; your wanted level diminishes as loa=ng as you do not see the police parked on the side of the road. Many cargos to haul. Decent AI traffic. Not as smart as you would like, but decent enough. Short green lights. Based in America, and you can drive cross country. Inexpensive game to purchase.  SCS is working on a new American Truck Simulator, and it will be far ans away better than this older game, but we do not know the system requirments yet.   I give the game a mild recommendation. Accept the game for what it is, and not what you think it should have been, and you wiull be happy.    Euro Truck Simulator 2 is far more advanced, and polished, but sometimes you just want to us the American road rules.  
771	It's alright for an old game. Not a very easy game to figure out... I was hoping for something easier to handle oh well...
772	Its just a fun, time passing game. I like it since its based on the US and not Europe. You can tell its dated but for the most part, its fun. Easy to mod, and everything.
773	i am a truck driver and for the most part the trucks are accurate the game actually has my truck too the peterbilt 379 although in the game they call it a pacific and a kenetic is actually a kennworth only downdide is that you cant physically get out of the truck and walk around the truck stops and you cant go in the back to your sleeper and your log book is automatically filled out for you   
774	In 2014 I was able to play this without a problem, but now everytime I open this game it comes up with a virus. For the time i did play this it was a fun game.
775	love this game just i wish there were mods
776	Good game, but after a long time playing, it can get boring. If you would like to learn Northern America geography (cities wise), this game helps too.  Could have a better soundtrack. Just 2 songs =/
777	You take on the role of a wifebeater-wearing trucker who makes his living hauling animÃ¨ to children everwhere. The stunning graphics will amaze you and leave you tooting your horn and tapping the airbrakes!
778	Very good game, brings back a lot of memories. The map it's huge, you just need a lot of time to play it. There are some minor bugs but playable.
779	Amazing game, very realistic and fun to play. Guaranteed death by boredom in ONLY 5 minutes!!
780	I dont make any evaluation if i didnt play at LEAST 10 hours.  Its a cool trucker game like we dont see often, and to be honest, its a good one.  Graphic: 4/10  Okai-ish, but it look pretty old. I like the effort they put into the modeling of the trucks tho. The customization of truck is pretty cool too, got to say.  Gameplay: 5/10  The driving is not that intuitive, but still enjoyable  Story: 2/10  Really nothing to see here. You drive trucks after all.  Fun: 6.5/10 I was having good fun with this game, why? cause i like trucks game, as simple. It feel redundant after some hour tho.  Lifetime: 8/10 Pretty much endless, it really depend on WHERE you want to end. Do you want to have the biggest fleet or have the best truck ever, or have so many trucks that you dont even know what to do with.  Total: 25.5/50 So it is a old game, but i think that it can be very enjoyable for people that LIKE driving Trucks forever, even if the graphics are old, its still lookable at the very least. For a low price, i say do get it.  Have a nice day.
781	If you want 18 wheels made completely out of steel with no rubber or inner tubes, this is not the game for you. 
782	my dreams of being a real life american trucka have finally been fufilled
783	great game
784	Terrible game, brilliant soundtrack.
785	Could use an update
786	Its really amazing thanks for putting this on steam :)
787	
788	Great game. LOve it. I like the size of the map
789	This is the best speedway game i ever played also i would be happy if another gaming company makes a sprint car game which is better because not much sprint car games are out and not much company makes them. 
790	This game is absolute junk. Impossible to set up a controller and overall very glitchy. I wasn't looking for much, and despite that it disappoints.
791	its a good game. i know its amarican and i am in the uk, but.... its the closest thing i have found to 'stock car racing' (uk).   its a big fat yes from me!
792	GEAT MIDGET AND OUTLAW RACING JUST KNOW HOW TO SET UP THE CAR
793	I like it because a love racing
794	  That moment when you think you're drifting then you spin out of control.
795	This will not work with a wheel (G27 anyways) and most other controls are very clunky or not working in Win 7. I did have the boxed version of this years ago and, at the time, it worked with a joystick controller but nothing has been done it seems to get it working right before they put it on Steam. It's old and used to be fun but considering the many other racing games (old and new) that work fine with Win 7 without problems, this is not worth the time or money. I bought, tried to get it to work with no luck whatsoever so I got a refund.
796	Terrible shovelware.
797	a great speedway game
798	Buckle up â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is riddled with high class managering, driving in golf carts and floating saucers for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles or if feeling serious you put up your own team of class Ace drivers which will wreck serious â¥â¥â¥ in the field and tuning your sprint car into a kenyan car. GOTY must buy.
799	This game is fun, but gets old very soon.
800	Awesomely awesome!
801	Really fun game to waste boring days on.
802	Challenging. That's the word you want to read and remember. You drive a motorcycle and you have to do stunts to get to the finish line. The graphics are great, the sounds as well, and the puzzles are, well... remember that word I told you to at the beginning of this mini review ? Yes ? Great ! My job is done.  Excellent game though ! Great to play for a few minutes or a few hours.  [Rating: 80/100]
803	A true Classisc its hard, frustrating and adictive as hell . Did i say technically hard as hell but so rewarding when you pull it off. To me one of the best physics based trails games ever made. It doesnt have no bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ tricks. Just a pure challange to make the perfect run
804	I love all the Trials games but this is probably my favorite.
805	Yeahhh! It's a really nice game!
806	Very fun game to play but gets very hard near end,Very hard
807	If you are a glutton for punishment or a perfectionist any Trails game is great for you. Brutal difficulty, beautiful graphics and simple but deep controls combine to make a great game that will make you grind your teeth in pleasure.
808	Trials 2 is a great game, i had great times playing it. Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance.  ItÂ´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc! Also is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available.   You can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be. ItÂ´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.
809	A blast with a dark sense of humour
810	A great time waster / casual game where you can compare your progress and skills to those of your friends.  Polished, fun and addictive, great for whiling away 20 minutes here and there.
811	Alright game 7/10
812	This game is so addictive. You can waste hours on a single track just to get better scores. Some of the tracks are realy hard and you need a lot of practice to reach the end and more practice to finish it without falling from your bike. You can view the rides of everyone as a replay or use them as a ghost. Most of them are just amazing. A must have in my view ;)
813	PC version of Flappy Bird. Annoying when you die but you can't stop playing
814	Great game. Super hard and the crashes are very satisfying. Still better than any of the newer trials games that I've played.
815	So ur this dude on a dirt byke ryt,  u go VRRRRRRRRRRRRRM VRM VRMMMMMMM!!!! and complete obstacle course like tracks, the harder the difficulty - the more you will want to throw your computer right out the â¥â¥â¥â¥in window.  Fun game for a few minutes every day, great way to â¥â¥â¥â¥ away 20 minutes while you wait for your latest Blueray rip 1080p porno staring Sasha Grey and Lexi Belle to download.
816	A physics game disguised as a motorbike riding game, Trials 2: Second Edition is a great little title that's sure to keep you playing for hours. The task is usually to get to the end of the level without falling off your bike. It sounds simple enough, but sometimes, especially in the later levels, you'll really have to stop and think before revving off a ramp without knowing what steep banks lie ahead. It's a blast playing a level over and over until you finally pass it without falling one time. If it sounds like you'd enjoy this kind of thing, you would. I recommend that you try it out.  Oh, one more thing. The game has a decent crash system where your guy can flip off his bike and break bones and stuff. It's weird seeing him flail around after he's already on the ground, smacking his arms around and breaking them even more. It's absurd, but oddly hilarious. It adds a nice touch to humor you a bit when you've failed.
817	amazing worth every penny that i collected to buy it
818	Challenging and fun physics game!
819	This game is amazing and will suck many hours out of your life. I need more friends to buy it so I have more records to beat!
820	I am basically a FPS gamer, however just because the price was right I downloaded TRAIL 2 and I gotta say, the game is pretty cool, good graphics and pretty addictive. For a switch of pace, try this game, its only $2.50 (12/22/2010) and its the best $2.50 game, (other than F.E.A.R) I ever spent.
821	Holy heck.... BUY THIS GAME while it's $2.50 or whatever.... what a FUN game
822	i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love ragdoll physics.
823	Doesn't get any more challenging and addictive than Trials 2.
824	I love trials games, and Trials 2: Second Edition was where it all started for me. I played this game for hours at a time, on a daily basis, for months. Endless, minimalistic fun, with plenty of achievements and leaderboards to compete for/with. If you're just getting started with Trials games, this is the perfect game for you.
825	This is one of the most exciting and addictive game that I've already played. When you start playing, you won't stop until break your records, you'll want to be better in each track you play. And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!
826	this game is very hard so you must have great Patience to compele the task or else break your bone..ouch!!...yep bodybag..lol it's not a bad game at all.  the graphic is pretty good, nice to use xbox pad for this....
827	i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love ragdoll physics.
828	Impossible, dangerous and annoying so overall good.
829	Holy heck.... BUY THIS GAME while it's $2.50 or whatever.... what a FUN game
830	very addicting, tough to master and fun for hours, play with a friend in the room and take turns at beating the tracks. I use an Xbox360 controller it's very hard with a keyboard to be percise on this game WHICH YOU HAVE TO!! (you can play with a 360 controller on most games because 'PC is Microsoft' and you just bought another controller from logitech or something??)
831	This is the most annoying, time wasting and horrid game ever developed, but it's still charming in its own weird way, buy it!
832	â¥â¥â¥â¥ is crazy!
833	Cool little indie game, the game actually requires skills and it's hard to become good at it, worth it for the couple of bucks that it was during the summer sale.
834	I have yet to find a game more frustrating and rewarding than Trials 2. It's basically the same exact motorcycle physics puzzle platformer we all played as a kid, but with a shiny new coat of paint and leaderboards. Not a bad way to spend $10.
835	Trials 2 is a ton of fun to play in short bursts. It's challenging making tricky jumps and landing at the right angles. It's also hilarious to watch as your driver crashes over and over and over again. Even when the game gets frustrating it's more difficult to notice or care because the crashes are so comically terrible. There's a nice bit of satisfaction to be had when that hard track is finally overcome. I recommend just for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'n' giggles.
836	i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love ragdoll physics.
837	Be prepared to break every bone in your body, including your controller!

840	i bought this game and now it says i dont have it  
841	Great underrated game
842	Still one of my favorites games to come back to from time to time. I played this long before I had Steam and would play for hours on end. These days, I come back to it for perhaps just a few tracks at a time, but it's still fun. It's a great fix when you just need some Trials action for a bit and the newer games maybe aren't an option.
843	This game is only for kids.. under 5.. They shall love it.. !!
844	â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DO IT...IT RAPES YOUR SOCKS OFF
845	I didn't really enjoy this game but my 4 year old daughter does. She likes to play it because she can finish quite a few levels by pressing down 1 button... the 'forward' button. Ok, ok, you need to use 3 more buttons and a lot more skill if you want to win a gold medal on each course but she isn't interested in gold medals. She's happy if she can drive the car to the finish line... which she can by pressing that one button.
846	A very creative fun game that keeps you thinking. I loved this game and how fun it was to play. The monster trucks were awesome to play once you put in the cheat code to unlock them. I loved each level because they were all different and creative. There were times that you would fail and not understand why you failed so badly but just plain persistence and patients pays off when you beat the course record and get gold. If you want codes to help you out here are the best one's: Go to the Settings menu and enter the codes into the Unlock extra features box.  DEVHOSENAUTO: Unlock Formula Monster Truck PIGGYRIDE: Unlock Pig Monster Truck YELLOWMONSTER: Unlock School Bus DEVIWANTALLGOLDNOW: All Levels GOLD DEVIWANTITALLNOW: Unlock all levels   I loved this game and all it had to offer, just make sure to find this one on sale because then you will get your money out of it. I have totally loved playing this game and if you liked the game Trials 2: Second Edition then you will love this one!
847	it passes the time.
848	From it's humble origin as a browser time-waster, this fantastic game comes to a steam client near you!  Excellent fun and fiendish puzzles to overcome!
849	I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this game. One of the first I ever bought on Steam, and I played it to death. If you like the demo, you'll love the full version. It's kind of like Trials HD with a better aesthetic, a better difficulty curve, and more fun.
850	A fully-upgraded Nissan GT-R is faster than a Buggati Veyron. So as you can guess this game is very realistic, a solid 10/10.  EDIT: Physics are still bad
851	About 5+ years ago, I got this on release, and played this on Xbox 360. I hated it. I absolutely thought it was the worst game that could have ever been produced.  Recently I bought this at a Steam sale, thinking that I might as well just put down my $5 into some random cheap racing game, hoping it would provide even an hours entertainment. I'm so happy with this purchase. I regret my constant stream of hate.  Granted, this is definately not the pinnicle of NFS (Underground 2/Most Wanted 2005 will always be), and that's clear through some poor design desicions regarding the lack of a main menu, the fact you can't change graphics quality until you actually get to play the game (about 5 minutes of cutscenes), and even the fact that there's too much bloom and there's some weird glitches with the lights floating a la Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.  But, with all the negatives said and done, this...this is the most fun I've had in a racing game in years. It seems like the devs tried to be as faithful as they could to Most Wanted, while still moving forward with the rest of the game. The cars control FANTASTICALLY on PC compared to console, and the selection of vehicles is awesome, especially considering the Bugatti Veyron (which, gladly thanks to the Master Events balancing the field, isn't game-breaking). The length of the game is awesome, with a huge amount of things to do. The police chases are fantastic, and polished much further than Most Wanted (admittadely though, I'll always prefer the down-right hilariously poor AI of Most Wanted's cops, and their over-the-top voice acting).  Overall, this really probably didn't recieve a lot of the backlash it got from fans. If you're a Most Wanted fan who has been disillusioned with the Need for Speed franchise as of late, you can do no harm in buying this game and reliving a time just before Criterion broke everything. And before The Run existed...
852	The game is fun to play even though the story is short. There is lots of fun things to do. I would tottaly recommend this to anyone.
853	Despite the obvious issues with the game, such as sun glaring into tunnels through the walls and into your eyes, the skyboxes randomly spinning around you, and heavy police SUVs easily outrunning a Veyron, it is a fun game.  It's fun, but a bit too easy at times. Almost depressingly easy. So easy, you'd want to keep a lower-leveled car around just to give yourself a challenge.    No, seriously. Except for one time some dude in a Dodge Viper challenged me to a 1-on-1 race, I still outran him in a 1969 Camaro. Sure, it took me 20+ tries, but I did it.    And finally, children: Don't be afraid to alt+F4 the game if you're about to get arrested and you know you wouldn't be able to afford the impound retrieval costs. It's easier to spend a minute loading the game back up than it is getting enough money to get another car.
854	I personally enjoyed all that Need for Speed hasto offer over the many years, but this one is one of my all time loves next to of course the Most Wanted-NfS. You are a cop undercover and must be bad to get trusted and so on, but you dont do no boring bad guy stalking stuff, all you really have to do is simply race and run from cops, the game's campain will indeed follow you on its own. Only single downside i didnt like was that there was no acheivments, other then that its near perfect.
855	This is a NFS game. It's still in the classic vein of games, like the 2005 MW and Carbon and such. The story, as always, is pretty garbage. The cars, as always, look nice. The cutscenes have sexy cars and bangable women, as always. The graphics are shiny, but ugly when you look at it close up, as always. The performance is decent to good in most cases, as always. The controls are responsive and driving feels good, as always. The customization is extensive for the visual aspects and utter linearly progressing dog â¥â¥â¥â¥, as always. The only real new feature is the gradual performance increase you get when completing events. Things like +2% to engines or +20% zone income. Slight things, but they make you feel like you're progressing.  It's the standard NFS experience, you know what you're getting into. It's worth it to everyone during a sale. Without one, I'd only suggest this to the most hardcore of NFS fans.  Overall, it's a solid 7/10.
856	this is still one of my all time favorite racing games and after turning everything up to High in the graphics it looks SO much better than i remember it from playing on XBox 360.
857	Not the best NFS game, still a good one
858	Other than the extremely irritating A.I. always ramping you into the walls and the citizen vehicles not knowing how to drive, this game is actually pretty fun. The graphics (for its time) are really nice looking, the selection of cars is very well done and the overall controls are fairly smooth. It is an overall good racing game. Need for speed fans should for sure pick this one up if they donât have it already. 7/10
859	Standard NFS game. If you like this series before, you will like this as well. The stroy is a bit predictable, but it's OK. The game area is pretty big and varied, with a lot of life. I loved the county highway pursuits. Perfect casual racing game.
860	Very good game, beautiful graphics and nice cars.
861	It has plot and this is what I like in NFS games. Also it has sensitive control if compare with latest NFS games. One thing you should know - you should follow story and complete story tasks first. If you will finish all available tasks and after that will follow the story you will have to repeat races and tasks you have finished again.
862	----DONT BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTI ONLY---- i will be using nfs most wanted 2005 and nfs carbon as reference to review undercover (a lot) and thanks to my friend i played it again and this time i finished it . -so first of all if you already played nfs mw 2005 or carbon you'll understand how this game work very fast , the plot is not the best in the world but kinda entertaining , you play as undercover cop trying to take down car thieves and smugglers ,plot twist here and there ( real actors just like in MW 2005 and carbon) you can get 15h if you play only the main compagne. -big well detailed city to play and explore but it feels so lifeless , you just drive with no purpose except the races . -graphicly is much better then MW and carbon cause they didnt port this one from the ps2 version like they did with carbon (8 years and still looking good ) and dont try the hd texture pack on the steam version it wont work -voice acting is really good just like in the previous nfs games , perfect sound effect , but shity soundtracks ( the worst soundtrack in a nfs game yet ) -gameplay is smouth and 2 new type race, Highway Battle (my fav) and stealing cars .but sadly no steam fetures like steam chat in game and screenshot . -the multiplayer was dead 5 years ago (EA shut down the servers since 2011) so if you want to buy this game just for the multi dont do it ) i recommend this game to gamers that want some nostalgia cause it feels just like MW2005 but with updates 7/10
863	NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your 'handler', Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your 'boss' may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!) to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city.   While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game.   All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and 'The Run' attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.
864	Is a good Racing game making chases through the open world is more fun :D 
865	Yet another wonderful Need for Speed title, only bad thing to say about the game is there is no online community to race against Dx
866	If you want a fun game to chill or to mess around with the police and have fun this game is for you. Also it is very cheap right now so if you are going to buy it, buy it now.
867	This game rocks. Never seen anytthing better than this.
868	If you are thinking about purchasing this game do not think again!  This game is similar to Need for Speed Most Wanted the old version, with the capability of customizing cars and everything...  So there you have it, what are you waiting for?
869	Man, this game is Awesome!  I like Map, Cars, Graphic,..  10/10   I have NO Lags!  And Add me for online playing.  
870	This is a good arcade game.  Unfortunately it's also very easy to beat.
871	This game is good but i just got in a pursut for apparently speeding at 20 - 30 mph on a 30mph limit?!
872	First time playing this on PC. I played this in the Wii version. But I wasn't expecting that it would be different in the PC version. I just finished the game but I still have more races to play.
873	Fun, definitely. You can follow the (admittedly somewhat cheesy) storyline or just drive for fun. The cars handle well, you have to adapt to each one's unique characteristics, and there's a real satisfaction in getting away from a large pack chasing you across the large region.
874	Very good graphics and gameplay, Also controller support works very nice!
875	It was actually pretty fun, despite how everyone says it isn't as good, it is still a great game to play, racing in it just feels pretty fun. My Carrera GT looks pretty awesome as well. The soundtrack was pretty good as well, just great racing game music, you know. I just wish there was more races because I dominated all of them, so the game is kinda short. The story is kinda boring, but I just ignored it and raced more. And the map is pretty big, takes you quite a while to explore all of it. The only thing that annoyed me is that the police can impound your car, I had to buy another Carrera GT because of that. So just don't get arrested and you should be good. lol. It is pretty easy to race once you've gotten a fully upgraded tier one car. Also the tier system is reversed compared to carbon, 1 is fastest and 4 is slowest, so don't get confused.   So basically, its fun to race in, easy after you get a tier 1 car fully upgraded, avoid getting arrested as you only have 3 strikes, and the map is pretty big. Cool, if you buy it, maybe you can message me, we can race sometime.
876	In this review I will give you detailed information about the version differences between the Steam and Origin versions of Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover  - First of all, Steam version of Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover isn't patched and doesn't have the so called 'Challenge Series' (Origin version does include those!);  - Secondly, the Steam version doesn't have lag spikes caused by additional DRM (SecuRom) because this DRM isn't present in the Steam version, but unfortunately it is present in the Origin version of Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover. To get rid of the annoying lag spikes, you have to apply a 'custom' game fix (v1.0.1.18).  - Additionally, the Steam version of Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover doesn't support the 'Steam Community Overlay'â¦ unless you add it as a 'Non-Steam game' (I know... funny). On the other hand, to be able to use the 'Steam Community Overlay' while playing the Origin version of Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover you also have to add it as a 'Non-Steam game' (note that 'Origin In-Game' must be disabled so that the 'Steam Community Overlay' would work when adding Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover Origin version as a 'Non-Steam game').  Additional Notes: When adding the Steam version of Need for Speedâ¢ Undercover as a 'Non-Steam game', you also have to use a 'custom' game fix (v1.0) to get pass the error upon launching the game after you have added it as a 'Non-Steam game'.  P.S.: Long story short, even though I own the game on both digital platforms (Steam and Origin) I still had to use 'custom' game fixes to be able to enjoy ~ The way it was meant to be playedâ¢ ~ this actually beautiful game! 
877	Very good game. Nice cars. Fast speeds. Everything you need for a good NFS game. Definately worth the purchase.
878	Fix physics But the game is very good
879	This game is like no other need for speed it changes the gameplay and style.  Pros: -Great Gameplay -Good Graphics that have aged well -A nice car selection -A fair storyline  Cons -AI doesnt realy try in most races or pursuits but some missions can be very challenging -The Story feels very short -there is a pretty fair customization but not as much as I hoped -alot of races feel recylced  This game has alot of personality to it however weather that be from the random (and comical) Police radio chatter or even just some cheesy cutscenes or music choices which add some real charecter to it.   Overall I think this game is about a 9/10 there is definitely ways this game could have been better but overall its a solid game and for the price you can't realy go wrong.
880	Pretty good game, pretty easy to play, try it!!! Love it, cuz it is one of N4S game serie :]
881	A wide spread racer game for players in an open world to do as they wish, provides it pisses someone off! 
882	I don't know why people give it so low rating,This is not the best nfs game in the series nothing can beat nfs MW2005,bt it's better than carbon,pro street even Shift,also MW2012 ,yeah the online is dead bt the single player means story mode is fun and awsome ,I'm giving it 8/10 , And you should buy it on the sell it's worth of your money and time So buy it on the sell if you lyk the story mode nfs
883	best cop chasing simulator out there 11/10 would want to get my car impounded again
884	Best swaying car similation, would crash into any AI car again, 10/10,
885	Very good game! Good storyline, good sound good game. Despite when it crashes (Windows 7 + dual screen) The graphics can be set kinda high, but the graphics mod is better. The mod includes Higher detail reflections, hd tires smoke, hd landcsaping and road. The cars alltogether are amazing! Wide selection of cars, colour wise not to sure about that the red looks like pink! but all the other colours are fine! Races are realy good the fact that the traffic is still there when you are racing is very realistic, cop simulation is kinda dodgy though they say the wrong things all the time, like 'suspect is driving a pink car' acually red!
886	Very good game,extra fast cars,incredible graphics so everything is pefect
887	Very good game,extra fast cars,incredible graphics so everything is pefect
888	it is a nice need for speed game even though it's a bit old
889	best cop chasing simulator out there 11/10 would want to get my car impounded again
890	Don't buy it at full price, I got it at the summer sales, but still its an awesome game
891	This is the first Need For Speed game i have ever played other then the first one that came out and i have beaten this one all the way through to the end. I really enjoyed it, there were some parts of the game were it got frustrating because sometimes you would be so far ahead that you know noone is going to pass you and then the AI might just put in there after burners or something and get really close to you as you about to finish a race. The story was interesting and got you thinking all the way to the end. The running from the cops was alot of fun and challenging because you have to think of different ways to drive to try and loose them. I found my self playing it for hours on end to level up my rank in game and to get more money so i can get better cars. Some times the gameplay felt repetitive, like you were going down the same roads as before over and over but alot of times they mixed the route up. If you love running from the cops in highway and rural areas then get this game.
892	in my foreign car with the trunk by the engine so when i back up im frontin on you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s
893	it has best grafic in all vido gaem, it run on crytek grafics 10/10 would buy over again and again
894	I find it very fun and enjoyable. My opinion is somewhat blinded by nostalgia though. Anywho, if its on sale you should certainly buy it.
895	I normly did not like need for speed games but this one had some tuches on it that made it a awsome racing game. FREE ROME, like need for speed carbon, if you dont feel like doing a mission you can just â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the cops. DETAILED CUSTOMISATION, agin, alot like NSF Carbon AMAZING CONTROLLER/ WHELE SUPPORT. works with evrything i throw at it and even lets me combine stuff like my flight stick with my wheele and my DS2 for in game commands. GRAPHICS, as always with nsf the graphics were amazing for there time and thay have adged well. LARGE MAP, there is a vary large area to explore especially for not being able to go off road, lots of jumps and destructible items as well.  IF you liked carbon or agin, like the custmisation and free rome aspects of sanadreas then this game is for you. i wish newer NSF would learn a thing or two from this one.

897	NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your 'handler', Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your 'boss' may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!) to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city.   While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game.   All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and 'The Run' attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.
898	An awesome delivery of the need for speed sand lot experience.
899	Good game, very arcadeish but cool racer, good story and the hottie Maggy Q stars in the story. Still my favorite NFS has been Most Wanted, too bad it didnt make its way to steam to have a digital copy.
900	super fun, too easy tho ... i though old games were harder ...
901	You should buy it if it is on sale. not full price. I liked the story line. I played this game on PS3. It was my first NFS Game on my PS3. and grafics arent bad. When i played it on my PS3, i was kist 8-10 so i didnt understand a thing. Lol. Alot of good and old cars like Dodge Charger R/T(1970) and SRT-8 and Dodge Challenger. Nissan skyline, BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini and much more. You can aslo customize your cars wich is my favorite! You can also customize your cars, which is my favorite! Good Sountracks too. It also was my first PS3 Game and i got the PS3 Early when it came out, still have the PS3 and the Stearing Wheel i used. Good times. 8/10 for being an old game and i played it at PS3 arround when it came out. had alot of fun in free roam :P
902	It fun to play, especially if you have a less powerful computer. It's practically the same as NFS: Most Wanted, and it's just fun.
903	Worst NFS game in history. PS2 Version OP
904	Meh.  Positives : It's on Steam Pretty cheap Lots of cars It's a NFS game.  CONs : -Stupid, dumb live acting cutscenes -Of course they are unskippable -Friggin crashes  -It's not Most Wanted (2005)  I'll recommend it anyway since it's on Steam and that worths a positive review. OLD MOST WANTED ON STEAM WHEN -1/10
905	this game is a little outdated graphics wise but its a good game
906	The last great NFS... 11/10
907	The best NFS for me! And awesome soundtrack
908	Can't believe its only been 60 hours! Felt like so much longer in a very satisfying way! (played through a couple of times) I love driving and listening to the sounds the sports cars make! I also like using Nitros in my turns rather than my breaks or e-breaks, so much better than other games!
909	A classic but very good game!
910	Best need for speed ever!!! Awsome car tuning and upraging I love it!!!!!! 
911	Such a great game I liked it more than most wanted 2005. xd But old times multiplayer was awesome.
912	This was AWESOME!!! Beat the game in under a day FTW.
913	i wish it could be faster !!
914	played through the campaign 8 times so far
915	EA's Need for Speed franchise has been in an odd position the last couple years. While the franchise often worked to mix up the formula from year to year a decent bit, the release of EA's own Burnout Paradise posed a bit of a conundrum for the publisher. With Burnout switching to an open world setting, it meant that it competed directly with Need for Speed in that space. Last year's Need for Speed ProStreet was a diversion for the series from recent years, going to track-based racing, plenty of tuning options and focusing entirely on the events than exploring the city or running from the cops. ProStreet didn't turn out too well, so Black Box went back to the drawing board and returned to an open world setting with this year's Need for Speed Undercover, but that wasn't the only design change. Undercover also seems to be directed right at the casual market, both in terms of presentation and its extremely relaxed learning curve.
916	Great Bad-â¥â¥â¥ racing game! smooth graphics! Great cars and chases! Definitly recomended!
917	played through the campaign 8 times so far
918	It has been a number of years since i played this game and going back to it was so much fun, the graphics are still really good, the storyline is a lot of fun playing again and the cars are so much fun, especially if you are a car fan, If you do not have the patience for racing game dont bother, this game has an arcade style and this game is so much fun, I would recommend if you want a chill out game this is the game for you, you have to have some interest in racing games though!
919	I love this game! I may not have many hours on here but backn in my peasent console days I gave the NFS cops hell for days on end. Storyline different &amp; a bit Corny but lets you drive like a maniac and be the Goodie. Very fun &amp; combatible (at least in auto) for Logitech G25 Steering Wheel. :)
920	just a basic NFS
921	I have to start with; this game is a lot of fun, like hella fun, totally worth $10.   This game has no story, there's no point even pretending that it has any substance, but that's not a bad thing. There isn't plot development outside of the UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENCES and the characters are laughable. It only serves as plot-points to give you free cars.   The car selection is broad and the cars feel unique for the most part. Upgrading in tiers is rewarding enough and you can feel how much potentials cars have when you first unlock/buy them.  The races are just regular races, be fast, hit the apex, win. The AI can be a little funny sometimes with it's speeds, but the game will sometimes straight up cheat speed to make you feel the pressure to win.  I remember the lack of pressure to win in NFS:UG1&amp;2 where you can easily lead the last races by over a 10 second margin. So that's nice.   The only real issue with this game is the police AI. Helicopters can see you in tunnels, and out of line of sight and the GTR cops have x-ray vision and always know where you are which creates a mini-game of finding the pursuit breakers and cooldown spots.  However this is 'gameplay feature' is really frustrating sometimes.    Multiplayer aspect of this game is nonexistent.  Conclusion:  This game is really fun as just a brain-dead racer with some free roam, nothing else to it. Going in with any expectations above that and you've played into EA's hand.
922	The game looked good in HD it was fun i didnt play it for long but its not what i was looking for in a Racing Game.
923	Pretty much the last GOOD NFS game (until NFS 2015?)
924	Singleplayer - 9/10
925	It's your typical racing game, nothing spectacular. The previous title was a lot better, however undercover isn't bad if you can pick it up on sale.
926	who needs brakes when u have speedbreaker. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you physics, suck my â¥â¥â¥â¥  10/10
927	its a good game, good story, good graphics but it needs steam cloud so i can backup my saves other than that its an amazing game.
928	After loading it up &amp; fixing all the graphics issues it starts with &amp; makes it look like a 1990's N4S the game starts to look good &amp; work good.  But PUNKBUSTER software ninja loads when you turn on your PC &amp; stays hidden running in the background with no option to turn off (unless you know how to work services, YES SErvices not start-up) which is unacceptable up to you guys if you want that or not.
929	I really like this game as I had played it when I had a PS2 console and fully completed that version. However I would really appreciate it if this game had full controller support. As there isn't an option to set keys or certain functions are still on a few keys on my computer's keyboard. I can accelerate, brake, change view, access events, and steer in the game. But as for handbrake, nitrous and speedbreaker. Those functions aren't seemed to be on my Xbox 360 controller.  Please fix the controller functions to full controller support. I recommended this game because as I said before. I had completed it on the PS2 console. And everything on that version really was playable and enjoyable. But as for this version, I'm neutral.
930	â¥â¥â¥â¥
931	i sux at this
932	need for speed for life man
933	one of the best police escape games 5/5 but graffigs suck
934	hi my name is bob
935	Ok, for car racing lovers.
936	I thought this pc version of NFS Undercover is the same as PS2 NFS Undercover. But it is not the same. I'm quite dissapointed though. Well, it is quite a good game for me. Thumbs Up (Y)
937	Very much race, such classic customization! Love the garage and brings back nfs Underground Memories&lt;3
938	The name of this game isn't funny, my brother died while working undercover 
939	Its downloading  
940	2nd best nfs game in my opinion, only beaten by nfs most wanted (2005).
941	we cud alzo fuhk undercuver, u kno. sheeeet
942	Great game, fun to play and it has Glorious graphics.
943	Its downloading  
944	A lot of cops and EA Nation. Even a GTR can faster than other Tier 1 cars. You can even drive when you crash your car. Very realistic 100/10 recommend.
945	Highly under-rated. Everyone desn't like any NFS afther underground 2, exept HP 12. I ENJOY IT ! Now you can all burn in hell, it has a good story, good graphics and a pretty hard control-system.
946	This is the last good need for speed game , has good customization ( not like in Underground that was the best custom ) , of large numbers of cars *48* , is using the EAGL engine ( oh men how much I have loved this engine i grew up with him from hot Pursuit 2 ) if you mod with Limited Edition graphic mod it look even more spectacular , the car sound are greate.  Now the Bad things : the game has a bug which consists in the sun follows you even through buildings , the soundtrack is bad in my opinion , sometimes the care physx are weird and the car flay like a rocket , really BAD STORYLINE ( even CARBON had a better story) , was rushed by EA and could not be finished properly.  If you compare the old series NFS is a average car race , but compatible with the latest parts who have lost the feeling of NFS is a greate game. If you get past the technical problems you can enjoy the game :)
947	&gt;bought bmw m3 E92 &gt;Customize the crap out of it &gt;Drive &gt;Car turns into chassis    10/10 would turn a bmw into a strip chassis again
948	game is fun but i dont get the story
949	  Awsome game! I love it!
950	Very glitchy, driving physics are terrible, graphics and graphics settings are blergh, racing is incredibly easy, cop chases require effort to stay in and over all is a fun game to play to relive stress and boredom.  10/10 for short term entertainment. 1/10 for everything else.
951	The EA really got right this time with real and plausible street/highway structure.
952	THIS IS A VERRY GOOD GAME THE LAST GOOD NFS
953	One of my old favorites, just like I remember it.  Someone who liked me bought it for me, now she hates me, bet she's regretfull!
954	Chase or Be Chased.  You never thought it would turn out like thisâan all-out chase where you're the hunted. And the hunter. Now you must get behind the wheel and risk everything to infiltrate a ruthless international crime syndicate and take them down. The man you're after is a maniac behind the wheel, and he's driving like his life depends on escape, which maybe it does. He's the one with all the answers you need, you will track him down. Needless to say, that fleet of police cruisers in your rearview mirror won't make things any easier. It will take all of your experienceâand every ounce of skillâto outrun the law, take down the enemy, and unlock the truth that puts an end to this chase once and for all.  - Go Deep Undercover - Race into an action-packed story of pursuit and betrayal. Take on jobs and compete in races to prove yourself as you infiltrate and take down an international crime syndicate.  - Highway Battle - Fight off the cops and others as you take down your prey in high-speed, high stake multi-car chases. New and vastly improved AI mechanics mean more aggressive and intelligent cops focused on taking you out fast and by any means necessary.  - Own the Open World - Tear across the massive highway system and discover the open world of the Gulf Coast Tri-Cities area, with three unique cities connected by an extensive highway system.  - Heroic Driving Engine - An all-new game engine lets you pull off amazing moves for the ultimate driving edge.
955	Need for speed undercover has one of the most detailed and fun story lines you will probably ever play. It has acting, drama, action, and a little bit (and just a little) of comedy. I got this game originally on playstation, but when I found it on steam, I just HAD to have it. I finally grew up to understand what to do in the game, how to get money, etc. When I played it for the first few times I was honestly pretty bored. Once i starded getting into it, I started to complete the game mission by mission, race by race. When I finally got near the end of the game I was deeply sucked into the game, wanting to know more, for the crave of knowledge. (And getting to say I beat the game). They have beautiful graphics if you have a computer like mine you can tune up the graphics, they have one of the biggest selections of cars that I have EVER seen in a car game, They have a great story line, and they have great actors. When I got to the credits, I was amazed about how much effort went in to this game. Over all this was a good 9.99 spent.
956	this sucks 
957	Not very realistic or challenging, but sure as hell very much fun! (+I love the story and the cutscenes)
958	I bought this game on impulse because it was $2.50. It will suck you in from the start. There is never a dull moment. You can explore the open areas or just continue to the next race with the click of a button. I'd pay at least $5.00 for this.
959	If you like your racing games to have even the slightest realism to it, skip this. This is a traditional acrade racer. The cars all handle the same, like they are on rails. The graphics have aged badly, the soundtrack sucks and the acting is terrible. BUT, if you can get over all that underneath is a pretty fun arcade racer. If you are a fan of Rage Racer, Over Rev, Daytona USA or any of those style games, be sure to give this a go. Especially for the price, you can't go wrong.
960	it`s like all need 4 speed but it`s one of the best ..
961	Awesome Game.I just love it.I play multi with my friends and we have fun.
962	Great game, good fun but bad graphics.
963	This is my own honest opinon, but this is the last proper need for speed game in the series. This one had all the action and drama we had grown to know and love while also having the ability to create completely unique custom cars and send them around corners at 100km/h. This game will forever hold a special place in my heart as the last stand of a great dynasty.
964	a true recomendation to everyone who likes the underground serie, most wanted and/or carbon, very good follow-up .
965	Great mechanics, awesome cars, awesome races, great storyline.
966	i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es
967	i love this game but whenever i play it, it quits on me after 20 mins... why???
968	Slightly old, but fun nevertheless.
969	Pretty good just dont understand why slr is tear 2
970	its ok. after this the NFS series went downhill.
971	Like the other people said itÂ´s not Underground 2 or Most Wanted, but I still like this game as well.   Gameplay any good and does it work well? Nice BMWÂ´s.. The gameplay is REALLY smoother on the pc than on the PS3, works on my win7 home premium 64 bit. The steering is really nice on my rumblepad reacts instantly, works well on widescreen, got all settings maxed out and still works smooth. Autosculpting is really nice with my rumblepad 2, works a whole lot better than the mouse.  What I do not like: Cops, so many cops.. it's almost like they are doing a parade in the game.  Gaming gear used: Logitech Rumblepad 2 corded.  Bugs: Had no startup issues playing the game. Few crashes like pc freezes were a common occurrence it seemed until I bought a different pc. Had one bug at the transporter mission, crashed to windows. If you get this just drive to the race and activate it.  Note: If your videocard is going nuts then try vsync in options, helps to calm it down alot. This happens even when you have a really good graphicscard.  Recommend it? Yes, the cars sound so good in this game.. I can almost smell the fumes playing it.
972	This game is absolutely truly addicting! Why? It is so fun! It is so cheap on the Summer Sale and it is so easy to play! Get it now!
973	Starts off slow , but it grows on you . World is huge which is a plus , story however is way too short . Gameplay is easy , most cars are easy to handle and you won't need to use the breaks that much . Most annoying thing is that you can not buy your car out of impound . Even if it is your first strike , if you do not have money to pay the fine , it will still get impounded and there is no getting it back so if your heat is high , make sure you have some cash reserves .
974	Not very realistic or challenging, but sure as hell very much fun! (+I love the story and the cutscenes)
975	i'm going to finish it with the 240sx
976	A great game with a wide customization selection. When you're not doing the jobs in the game or racing, its always fun to mess with the cops thanks to the open world gameplay.  9/10 Would play it again.
977	Always been a fan of the Need for Speed series. I'ts a shame the last few games are not that good as there previous ones, i really like this game i would recommend it definitely!! graphics are not that out dated if you set that at the highest as you can get. story is good aswell, like the cars and that they are subcatogorized in the shop by the country the are from.
978	One of my favourite racing games ever. I remember I got it back in the day, shortly after it was released. I had 800~ online wins and 200~ losses. Got the steam version just because it was a dollar. Online community is dead and gone, obviously, however it still kept me entertained for an hour~   Do not buy this for online experience, as stated above, nobody played this for years. However, if you just want to experience the last of NFS before franchise gone south, by all means get it, the game itself is dated, but it doesn't make it any less awesome.
979	One of the good NFS Games
980	game does not boot up. why? need for speed undercover
981	Holy speed
982	Need for speed undercover has one of the most detailed and fun story lines you will probably ever play. It has acting, drama, action, and a little bit (and just a little) of comedy.

983	Do you like speeding recklessly through highways and interstates while making sweet 360's to get away for the (sometimes utterly stupid) police?  4.5/5 stars.
984	Pretty good just dont understand why slr is tear 2
985	it's a really good pc game i like it but u met not or u do like but i really love this game i played since i was little and some people out their mit haved play it in life and trust me it's a good game 
986	I was unsure at first when I got this game because of all the reviews saying how poor the physics are but I didn't notice them too bad with a standard keyboard setup. I defenitely suggest, its worth the ten dollars for sure.
987	One of the better NFS games with quite good customization to each car, good selection of vehicles and quite large open world map. My only frustration was the last mission which was freakishly difficult to complete with all the nonsense of the enemy ai where i wasted hours just trying to finish it.
988	Very fun NFS for 10 dollars. Cops are super fun like they were in carbon and in most wanted. Story is meh, but the races are fun and there are tons of cars in the game. If one word could describe this game its DOMINATED!
989	The nostalgia is very real.
990	you could widebody a lamborghini gallardo and tune it to makeit fast.
991	It's a good game unless you judge it by the way it looks then well don't even bother to buy it but if you enjoy the journey you go in a game then well I certainly advise getting this game and this is a lot comeing from me because I hate almost all faceing game but Honestly I'm quite fond of this game I recomend it 4.5/5
992	Typical NFS.......
993	After all those races I won and all of those criminals I shut down... I'll still never be able to repay the damages I caused to the city.
994	This game is super, But I don't know how to friend someone on the frineds list in this game???? 
995	This game is the fogotten side â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you called 2 years ago when your girlfriend broke up with you. She was there for comfort and supplied you the needs and fun you lacked. But looking back on it now, you dont wanna think about it cause shes nothing compared to yo new â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW GRAPHICS!
996	It's a good game and all but honestly you need a controller of some sort to fully enjoy the game.
997	HELL YEA finally some were you can break the spidomiter and have a chance not to get caught
998	I'm pretty sure this is the only racing game on Steam that actually lets you free roam, street race and customize your body kit and so on, I literally looked through all the racing games and have found nothing similar to this. I really love this game, it stays true to the NFS Underground series. I'm still waiting for a good racing game to come out on Steam like this one.
999	The Need for Speed trillogy has been an all time favourite for me ever since most wanted to Undercover, This game has shown a great deal of what it would be like to move throught the streets with a great deal of speed.   I personally recommend this game but if you dont like racing games or have the patience for it this isnt the game for you.
1000	Great mechanics, awesome cars, awesome races, great storyline.
1001	This game is fun, although there are many bad things about it. Good news: Love the free roam. I love the selection of cars. Kinda like the story line. Bad news: Police chases get WAY out of hand. Ex: I was heat level 2 and there were like 20 cops chasing me and they were laying down spike strips and all that. But, when you ARENT in a police chase, the spawning of the cops is so bad. I had 5 police cars behind me. IN A ROW. Also, I stop at a stoplight, like a normal driver, and a police cruiser slams into the back of me and puts his sirens on. On the radio he is saying it is my fault! That â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off. Also, I found a spot in the map where NO COPS can go. I don't know how to explain it, but basically its an unfinished highway and you have to jump onto it with your car. And the police can't get up there! After that, you have evaded and all goes well. So the AI and the spawning of the 5-O in this game is kind of bad, but if the game is on sale for 3$, I'd say get the game :D
1002	Need For Speed Undercover is a very interesting need for speed game(there is no other need for speed game like it).The graphics still look nice and the gameplay is very fun!
1003	A Need for Speed game, what else can I say? Love this racing franchise. :)
1004	Great game, good for its age, bit shiny textures tho: but worth the price on sale all day long :)
1005	If you love racing and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cops this is a must buy game!  if not then this wont be anything for you  8/10
1006	Losing the cops once you've captured more than the tiniest bit of their attention is the most impossible thing. Ironically, you yourself play as a cop.
1007	Very good, short but good
1008	Fun game, the car customization is not so wide, but that did not bother me for this game, it was not really needed to be honest.
1009	'I must say ive always liked the nfs games and this one really brought movie action themed racing to you hands for a newb to racing games on the pc the controls were very simple to get used to' I give it a rating of 7.9
1010	this is the best of circuits and the free ride is niccccce! but there are not a lot amount of cars thats a con but its still nicccccceee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1011	Very good, short but good
1012	One of my favorite Racing Games, A must Buy!
1013	If you love racing and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cops this is a must buy game!  if not then this wont be anything for you  8/10
1014	I'm pretty sure this is the only racing game on Steam that actually lets you free roam, street race and customize your body kit and so on, I literally looked through all the racing games and have found nothing similar to this.

1015	View CD-KEY (Redeemable on Origin) RUN REGEDIT Conputer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\ea games\need for speed undercover\ergc
1016	makes my computer freeze and have to restart and start over i dont know if this happens for everyone but it is VERY annoying for me.
1017	The heroic driving engine is easy to use and handle - You can perform J-turns, 180 turns, 360 burnouts, and Drifting, all the elements of being a stunt driver which I find pretty useful when escaping the 5-0. Most of the missions were pretty easy except for the hot car events where you must deliver a car undamaged while escaping the 5-0 under time constraints. The Customisations were good too but very limited. The single player is only fun to play around this time now, if you're looking to play multiplayer then don't bother with it. You'll rarely find anyone. I would only recommend this game if you enjoy the single player alone.
1018	Not to many features but, really fun machanics!  8.5/10
1019	Played the PS2 Version of this game 10/10. Got it on PC Complety Differnet. They remade the WHOLE game 10/10
1020	One of the best ''need for speed'' game. I really like it.
1021	Combine this and Street Legal Racing Redlines customization and modding would have an amazing racer ....
1022	Definately one of the best NFS games that has been released. This game although the graphics are simple provides the perfect storyline and the perfect gameplay for anyone. Even if your computer is not very good for most games this game has low specs so that almost any computer would run it. NFS Undercover runs with no lag and offers accurate versions of cars and what is most to love by any car enthusiast is that it includes the almighty 1969 Shelby GT500 and also includes the other great cars like the classic Dodge Charger. This game is perfect from head to toe and is a no brainer to purchase. 10/10
1023	Not the best work fro EA games. But its an ok game.
1024	Need for Speed: Undercover is developed by EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts (EA) on November 18, 2008  Old Arcade Need for Speed game. As for me i really like it, it has good races and missions, the AI is not bad but sometimes do crazy things. I completed this game in 16 hours and i had a great time. If u liked the older U2 MW or C maybe u will like it too.  I dont like race track Need for Speeds cuz u can go to the racetracks in real life with a car... but in the real life u cant go with 160mph on the streets. The Graphics is not bad, but its old today.    Pros: -So many cars  -Tuning  -Street race  -Story  -Car damage  -You can have all of the cars  Cons: -Short Story  -AI sometimes makes you cry  -Too much bright sun, its always early morning or late afternoon.  -Driving is really arcade  I still like it, its a good game. Worth  LK's Score 6/10
1025	Not very realistic or challenging, but sure as hell very much fun! (+I love the story and the cutscenes)
1026	If you like your racing games to have even the slightest realism to it, skip this. This is a traditional acrade racer. The cars all handle the same, like they are on rails. The graphics have aged badly, the soundtrack sucks and the acting is terrible. BUT, if you can get over all that underneath is a pretty fun arcade racer. If you are a fan of Rage Racer, Over Rev, Daytona USA or any of those style games, be sure to give this a go. Especially for the price, you can't go wrong.
1027	One of my favourite racing games ever. I remember I got it back in the day, shortly after it was released. I had 800~ online wins and 200~ losses. Got the steam version just because it was a dollar. Online community is dead and gone, obviously, however it still kept me entertained for an hour~   Do not buy this for online experience, as stated above, nobody played this for years. However, if you just want to experience the last of NFS before franchise gone south, by all means get it, the game itself is dated, but it doesn't make it any less awesome.
1028	this sucks 
1029	amazing game, have a lot of fun with it, but ea is tricking you with those pictures
1030	I honestly enjoy this game a good bit, as this was my first time playing it in like 3 years.  Some people seem to dislike it, but I myself find NFS: Undercover to be quite fun. Great for passing the time when you are bored. I'm making great progress in the story mode, it's not too easy, but it's not too hard either.  I'd personally recommend it, it's a good racing game with a pretty interesting storyline.
1031	I cannot fully review this game as one small concern holds me back from playing this. I'm NOT saying I do not recommend this game.   The more I play this game, the worse the lighting gets. The sun's glare is unbearable and ruins the settings the game supplies. The lighting also blurs and blends the colors in such a way that I cannot stand.  The gameplay is how you'd expect like in previous titles NFS: Carbon and Most Wanted with a hint Burnout-like handling.  After buying this game, immediately fool with the graphical settings to your point of comfort. There is NO windowed mode unless you download the windowed mode patch.

1033	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!
1034	NFS seems to be popping out titles like crazy! Undercover: 7/10
1035	Fun game, on pc atleast. Its worth of buying if u like car games
1036	Definitely worth a play!  I sunk at least 40 hours into the PS3 version back when it first came out, and re purchasing it on steam was interesting, the first time I played it I simply thought 'well, this is s**t' and quit after 20 mins. However, having gone back to it in a more tolerant mood, I'm now in love with it all over again. The 2 most off putting aspects of the game are the car handling (only to begin with) and the graphics. But once you get used to both of these, its an enjoyable open world racer with a decent sized map, good car choice, better customization than most modern racing games, and really damn fun police chases.  When you first play it you may be very put off by the bizarre and immensely unrealistic handling of the 200sx that you start with, it basically feels like its got the worlds tightest suspension set up, and the worlds most grippy tyres. Therefore the car will understeer heavily round all corners before suddenly lurching violently out of control if pushed too hard. But a few tuning adjustments and suspension upgrades later this is greatly reduced, and once you get onto driving the skylines, evo's etc the handling model suddenly stops feeling ridiculous and starts feeling like a good old arcade racer.   The main downsides are....  -Short and poorly told story (But I like the premise none the less) -Empty and fairly lifeless city -Dated graphics -Car handling takes a lot of getting used to -Difficulty fluctuates (Starts way too easy, then gets pretty hard)  The good parts are.....  -Fairly large and well laid out free roam world -Decent car selection -Good customization -Police chases are a blast -Variety in race/activity types -Cars sound nice and soundtrack is good -AI actually make realistic mistakes which allow for varied and unpredictable races  So if you want a good old open world need for speed game for the purposes of picking out a nice tuner, pouring large amounts of time and money into making it a badass street racing machine, and then smoking some other racers or playing with the cops, then Undercover is perfect for you.  If you want modern graphics, realistic driving, atmospheric worlds and memorable plot/characters then this isnt the game for you.
1037	Eventho this game is old it's still fun to play. :)
1038	This game has really good graphics
1039	It's just as fun as it was on the xbox. Not necessarily one of my favorite NFS games, but it is still very enjoyable.
1040	nice graphic
1041	I've played all versions of the game (x360, ps3, ps2, etc), so i can say that this here is a great game. The visuals might be slightly oldish, but they aren't too bad.   If you like cars or any stuff of that kind, get this game, immediately.
1042	it's a really good pc game i like it but u met not or u do like but i really love this game i played since i was little and some people out their mit haved play it in life and trust me it's a good game 
1043	Good game. lacks in missions .
1044	A slow â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, that's that â¥â¥â¥â¥ I don't like, bang_bang.
1045	It's more fun than I had on the ps3 years and years back... but it's not that good actually. I seem to have really bad lag for no reason. I'll run Driver San Fransisco on High res, high quality without ANY lag and this is just wow horrible for no reason. It looks like crap and it runs like crap. But... it's still fun. That's why I'm still recommending it, buy it on sale, couple of bucks, why not? But what I don't get is why the worst NFS's are on Steam? Where's Most Wanted, Underground 2, etc. I mean this one is alright but it doesn't look or feel anything like the better ones. It's still fun though.
1046	Great game for its time, but...  Is it just me having a laptop or is it because of the game that: a) The game doesn't support native screen resolution, and b) Every time the game launches, it just reverts to the default audio/video settings (640x480 resolution, etc)  Actually, take that second thing back... I fixed it. But still no native screen resolution, although 720p does look good enough for a laptop screen (1366x768). Other than that, it's a great arcade-ish style game for its time. Now I just have to get Hot Pursuit and (maybe) Shift and Shift 2 Unleashed.
1047	Childhood Dreamz
1048	One of the better need for speed games! General Lee for the win :D
1049	If anybody wants to play with me in 'Online mode' make sure you have EA account and add me if you do! lets play together!
1050	Fun to play, ok cars, great concept, good customization and lot's of great ways to upgrade your car! Drifting could be better as the grip is a little off on all cars so when you turn from left to right while drifting you suddenly get good grip and drives straight forward. But overall very good and fun game!
1051	Overall, an enjoyable game. Not a true NFS game, though. But an enjoyable one.  Almost all races are unbelievably easy - I completed the game about 23 hours in. One race I was dragged sideways, giving the leader a 15 second lead and 40% left on the course, and I still caught up.   The storyline is probably acceptable, although those cutscenes did have an air of that slightly high-end porn that you occasionally find when you dig deep enough.   Fair amount of cars, with a decent range of classic American muscles, although the way to the Mazda MX7 and Lotus Elise. As a rule of thumb when buying cars, get ones with good handling. T4/3; Lotus Elise T2: Lamborghini Gallardo T1: Anything but the Veyron, which goes like the clappers and handles like a dead pig with no legs and a massive erection.  Would not recommend buying at full price, but if it's on sale, and you're looking for a little bit of casual racing, get it.
1052	One of the better need for speed games! General Lee for the win :D
1053	Good graphics, great story,perfect gaming style. 10/10.
1054	Great game for its time, but...

Now I just have to get Hot Pursuit and (maybe) Shift and Shift 2 Unleashed.
1055	My opinion: + Enough good story + Nice cars + Visual tuning isn't bad - Graphic isn't that would I like to see - Cars sounds
1056	it may not be the best need for speed, but its one of my favourites because is the first racing game ive ever played. for 2008, not bad graphics and gamplay, AI is pretty bad tho... 7/10
1057	This game is epic. Everyone got their millions and got the Veyron but I got an R8 and suped up the M3. Not much to do after every mission is completed. There still are side mission but the heat system is in effect, so your cars can be taken. Only so many spray jobs will protect your wheels. It's fun to drive a 230mph max car the speed limit.
1058	cars handle great + open world +story driven +car customize to no end and what is not to like? I beat this game so many times and enjoyed it the last time I played it as much as the first time I played it, I would love to see another game like this but as of now there is nothing ....sad
1059	A story behind it you play as an undercover cop and earn reputation (And free cars) by racing to take down a crew of car smugglers. This game has me hooked.
1060	This is a good game and would highly recomend to anyone the likes the need for speed franchise.
1061	Amazingly fun and timeless. One of my top 5 racing games of all time.
1062	I've always had a thing for need for speed!!! It's one of those games that never get tiring. Especially if your a driver of the street world.
1063	!!!SPOILER ALERT!!! !!!READ AT YOUR OWN RISK OF RUINING THE STORY!!!   In Need For Speed: Undercover, you pose as a Street Racer, (but you are really an undercover cop). Your objective is to get close to some major car thiefs and bring them to justice. The story is really engaging, I couldn't stop playing it for weeks, but the free driving is my personal favorite in this game. Just being able to drive around the city and get the cops on you is the most fun way to play. The cut scenes are live, and they put more of a reality spin to the game.   All the cars you can get are very nice, and fun to drive. But the thing I like best about this NFS game is the free driving; both during and after completing the story you can just drive your car around the city(s). Words can't tell how awesome the free driving feature is.   The best part of the cars is the customize feature. You can go to your garage, and change basically everything about your car. You can put on decals (as far as I know the number of decals on your car are unlimited), change the color to any hue, change the body, tires and frame, there is basically nothing you can't customize. For me, who loves racing and escaping from cops, this is my favorite NFS game, save Most Wanted.   So overall, I would say this is a SHOULD BUY, not a maybe, not just a good game, but a game that everyone who calls themselves racers should buy.  !!!GET NEED FOR SPEED: UNDERCOVER!!!
1064	Still Playing it in 2017 :) Lovely game!
1065	Great game, Graphics look pretty good but some aspects are dated. 
1066	I bought this game for around 5 bucks and after finishing it I'm not completely, but very disappointed so I give this game a thumb down. Main reason for this: This game has NO replayability and you probably won't even bother to finish it. Reasons see below.  First of all: The races and missions are always depending on luck, I guess. Some races / missions are ridiculously easy, some are nearly unbeatable. Sometimes you flee from the police and you're completing the mission in under a minute and the next day you're failing at a similar mission even after ten tries. Especially the high way battles (where you have to stay ahead for x seconds or lead at least for x meters) are unfair beyond belief. Sometimes I thought a race against light itself would be easier.  Mission vary from 'Sprint', 'Curcuits', 'Getaways', 'Cop takeouts', 'Causing costs to state' (boring as hell, since you only gain XP, and no money at all) and some missions, where you always have to get away or take out some other drivers.  The 'Speed braker' adds a great deal of fun to it. Which brings me to the fact that, when you hit the wall, you will ALWAYS end up being either stuck exactly when not more than 90Â° to the wall or completely reserved when you try to accelerate / manouver your way out. After so many hours and races it happened constantly, so I'm sure the makers thought: 'Well, the game is already unfair hard, what else can we do to frustrate a gamer? How about your car gets stuck or completely reserved after hitting a wall in a tiny bend?'  And of course, like in every single racing game: ALL other racers are in one place. Meaning when you're at 1st place and you make just a tiny mistake ALL other racers will overtake you and you're last. And believe me, the other racers in the later races are getting REALLY hard and unfair, like hitting your tail and stuff. And guess what? You always have to be 1st, or you won't get any reward. Why didn't they thought of a 2nd or 3rd place, with at least a part of the money to show some appreciation of the time I spent on that race?  I also missed an 'Test drive car' - option before purchasing a car. Wasting a fortune for the Bugatti Veyron (which accelerates like a rocket and steeres harder than a tank with a house on top of it) is kinda disappointing. Oh and don't expect ANY reward for finishing the game, like all cars, bling bling money, a special car, gimmick, anything else etc - you're not getting anything, except closing credits.  The tuning system is easy to use and minimalistic, except where you can buy a paint job. Worst. Interface. Ever, if you use a controller. I even had to use keyboard plus controller to do a paint job. Well done, makers, really. Are you satisfied with all the drugs you take?  The game gets harder and harder, but not in a challenging, but an ultra-unfair way which will drive you (no pun intended) effin insane. I played half of the game with the first Muscle Car I got via a Pink Slip, until I could afford an Audi Quattro TT. This went good for a while. After I bought the Zonda from Tier 1 I had absolutely NO chance in a race, because I hadn't enough money to buy also both Power and Handling - 'Ultimate' packs for my car, which all of the other cars obviously had. Frustrating, because I had to go back to my already maxed out Audi and finish a dozen races under my current league until I could afford the upgrades.  I also tried to cheat because I nearly smashed my controller through my LCD into the wall. Cheats are absolutely, f-word ridiculous. There is a cheat for 10.000 credits. Nice, eh, typing it in a thousand times and go shopping big time, eh? Nope. It's, like all cheats, a disposable cheat, meaning you only can use it ONCE. Like the game itself. Disposable. So in a game where cars cost about 300.000 credits and not to mention tuning and upgrade packages where you could buy a whole city, 10.000 credits as a disposable cheat ain't just quite cutting the deal. Where they drunk when they made those game plus cheats? No, they were obviously thinking about letting another good franchise going down the drain big time.  Oh, and by the way. How can you tell you're playing NFS? After you've reached your maximum speed of ~350km/h, you're gonna be overtaken. By a flying police jeep of two-and-a-half tons. And all other enemies. Speed's just a number, after all, eh?  So the longtime-fun is found somewhere else, this game has absolutely no value left after a few races or about maybe ten hours. I now own the Zonda with all upgrades and the races got too hard. Just a single minor mistake or getting hit by another driver (who drive like they're in effin Carmageddon) and you can restart all over. I mean, I'm not a pro gamer, either I'm bad at it, I just want a racing game to be fun, race now and then a few circuits, have fun. And not be frustrated more and more AFTER I have the best equipment in the game and finished it already.  Further you get stuck later in the game. I finished the game. Now I own the Paganini Zonda, a Lamborghini Gallardo, an Audi Quattro TT, a Porsche GT2 and a few pink slips from other cars (which can't be sold, just be removed. Sense, please?). The latter missions will earn you 25.000 to 35.000 credits and you will spend it all on cars, upgrades, paint jobs and aftermarket stuff (like spoilers etc). But then, after maybe four, five fully upgraded cars there's no races left (only old ones, which will earn you peanuts of 2.000 credits each or so), but there are still so many cars and upgrades left to try and buy.   So when all the missions and races are won, you're gonna be stuck with your five good, maxed out cars. And you will have to start a new game to drive all the other cars. Where are the good old times, when finishing a racing game unlocked the complete car list? I'm not willing to start five new games just to see, drive and have all cars in the game.   Here are also some other thoughts:  Menues: The menu is very well sorted, tidied up and everything is easy to use, even with a controller. Great! That's how you do it. Bravo.  Intros: Couldn't care less about these annoying things and they are not skipable. Cutscenes are skipable, after you've played the mission once.  Graphics: Graphics are not important in a game. NFS:U is acceptable, there are games with better and worse graphics. For me (I own an older pc) they were just fine and, like said, of no importance.  Story: I couldn't care less about a story in a racing game. I mean, what's the big deal? Car, this is player, player, this is your car. Take the controller, hit the buttons, wipe the floor with your enemies and have fun. Early in the game I muted the volume of 'Voice' in the menu to 0, because in one mission I had to chase someone and every two seconds a voice said 'Catch on' or 'Go faster!', like this wasn't the thing I was doing. Good thing after muting: All cut scenes were muted. So I didn't know what the story was all about but from what I saw the story was more boring, mediocre, filled with not B- but C- and D-movie actors.  Overall: For a small price like five to ten bucks it's a great, action packed game to play now and then which will serve a few hours of fun until you experience the things I mentioned in my review.
1067	It's good. The story isn't good and it isn't bad.  Bought me a Bugatti and never lost a race or got arrested.    Multiplayer isn't working so yeah. Still wished i refunded it. 
1068	Steam version is unpatched. Buy on origin instead.
1069	This game is... more enjoyable than NFS:MW 2012, which I spent like $60 when it came out because of the MW name, and I hate it so much. Undercover is a game that gives you a feeling that they rushed too hard during development, so it lacks testing, refinement, and thoughts. It carries quite a few promises, but is very disappointing.  Pros: 1. Fast-paced action easily makes one EXCITED! 2. A good collection of cars. 3. A nice world to roam about. 4. Cut-scenes are quite well made. 5. Chances are that you buy this game when it's on sale, very cheap.  Cons: 1. Physics is ridiculous, when crash happens, all cars seem to have infinite mass. Mario Kart has better physics and makes more sense. NFS is not famous for physics accuracy, but this game is way too off-scale. 2. If you drive manual, you will easily feel that the cars' torque-rev relationship is pretty ridiculous. 3. Brake is so ridiculously powerful, and the car has ridiculous amount of grip. 4. They hired Maggie Q and others to make nice movies, so it seems that they focused on SP. However AI is ridiculous. Anything controlled by AI just makes no sense. 5. AI racers seem to be 'given' speed and accleration. Sometimes I can have 200 feet in the lead and I am faster round the last corner, but the second car just acclerates ridiculously and robs my first place. It feels that those cars do not have actual drivers in them. 6. Roaming traffic cars are quite amazing, not only AI racers ram you like crazy, those roaming traffic cars also ram into you for no reason at all. 7. There's almost no balance between cars and missions. You can win by miles using Lotus Elise against some really slow Volkswagen, and at some other locatons you will face Audi R8, Gallardo, and many other cars that are way faster. BTW Lotus Elise is extremely overpowered. 8. I can't believe how bad the cops are. They seem to give up chasing you as long as you are 100 inches ahead of them. Sometimes it can be extremely hard to complete missions like cost-to-state challenge, because the cops do not chase you at all, even you are at heat level 5. 9. You can easily use the TAB key to fast travel to just jump right to the next race, so although there's a huge amazing open world, chances are that you don't even roam about at all. 10. Graphics are okay for a game this old, and it uses similar color scheme as the original NFS:MW. However it looks a lot less attractive than NFS:MW for some reason. 11. Road surface is modeled quite badly. Different road surface (asphalt, grass, dirt, etc) feels quite similar, and the only difference seems to be the smoothness. 12. Its compatibility with controllers has lots of problems. If I have my keyboard, XBOX360 controller, and my Logitech G27 all connected at the same time, the car will keep steering to the right, and the menu cursor keeps going down. 13. The cars' performace has little to do with their real-life version.  Conclusion: If this game is on sale, and if you want some excitment road racing, and if you are not good at braking in racing games, pick this up. It can make you blood boil (Rush-time High Way Battle is the best mode in this game IMO), and it does not require too much skill.
1070	Good single player game, multiplayer sucks â¥â¥â¥, origin is lame and finding and playing with friends in nigh on impossible, I give it a bad review just for this spent 3~ hours messing with firewall settings and router setting and still can't play with my mates,  i sign in ok to EA nations (origin) but i can't create or join any games.  If you want a single player driving game it's OK  but don't expect any help from EA or origin as i tried to contact origin for help via on-line help desk and gave up after 2~ hours wait.  Love NEED FOR SPEED but the support and on-line stuff is run by blind and stupid people.
1071	Do not get this game, you will be sorely disappointed! Graphics are really bad and the car handling is totally unrealistic (feels like a brick more than a car)! Even older NFS such as Most Wanted and Carbon are infinitely superior to this sad excuse of a game!
1072	3/10 would not recommend.  Alright, if you've played Need For Speed Carbon, it's a bit like that.  Except now envision the game looking 5 years older. And the police cars are tanks compared to Carbon. And the car controlls feel clunky as all hell. And the menu controlls are awkward.  Maybe it's because it's arcade style that I'm plain dissapointed with this game. I don't know. But Carbon beats this game all day, every day. While it's asleep.
1073	While it may not be one of the more memorable NFS games, Undercover has a strange charm of its own. Making use of it's free roam feature, Undercover allows players to race, evade cops and set lap times on various points on the map. The various amounts of events may seem entertaining at first but loses it's appeal quickly. The races are dull and it becomes very easy to have a significant lead over the other racers. The color palette is obsolutely atrocious. Everything is painted in a dull brown which makes every corner and straight seem the same.   There is a story component but it's easily forgettable unless you're a fan of Maggie Q. My advice would be to avoid this game and look elsewhere for a memorable NFS experience.
1074	In this game it looks like the computer is driving the car instead of me, i just have to stay on gas pedal from start to finish, and sometimes turn my wheel a bit when some corner is in front of me. In some races with less corners it's also possible to stay on the top speed limiter all the time. Accelerating in corvette z06 from 0-375 kph in less than 5 seconds is not impossible.
1075	This game has cars, roads, a mediocre scenary and nothing really customized well enough.  High Stakes was very good, Porsche was great! Most wanted and underground are better than this one.  My SCORE is 44 / 100. not worth my time...
1076	Undercover is too easy and monotonous. Oldeer games like Most Wanted or Carbon had better gaming experience and difficulty.
1077	A pretty fun game, especially for the price. However, it's just too buggy to recommend.
1078	This game looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥, plays like â¥â¥â¥â¥, and those â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unskippable cutscenes make me want to gouge my eyes out. It isn't worth a dollar, and I wouldn't play it even if they paid me to do so.
1079	Won't run on Windows 10 x64 unless you download a No-CD crack. Damn DRM.
1080	this is a horrible game whats the point of playing this DONT WASTE YOUR 10$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1081	Very stupid game, wasted money.
1082	This games is terrible. first of all it gets no steam overlay and it is launched with a command promt. Why? It also has no deadzones so good luck trying to play this games. i can't refund after spending more then 2 hours on it but dont get it. so lucky i got it on sale.
1083	I have beaten this game 10+ times over on PS3, and let me tell you, I will NOT be completing it againon PC. This port is atrocious. There is not complete controller support, the pc controls do not allow for fine control of your cars, and the game was locked into a disgusting looking 4x3 aspect ratio. NO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC. It's a perfectly good game on console; but I implore you, DO NOT try to play this game on pc.
1084	Aside from crashes they never bothered top fix, there's a lot of other things going wrong here. From unskippable cinematics of the most abbrassive to watch bad storyline in gaming to the jumpy physics. Although it was still better than most of the series.
1085	I currently don't know what's going on with the game. I get the command prompt that the game starts then it crashes...steam needs to fix this problem. I can play Hot pursuit with no problems.
1086	this game will not let you play mulitiplayer do not get it
1087	The quality of this game aint that good and it is not worth 10 pounds
1088	Dont get this â¥â¥â¥â¥. just downloaded it and it crashes right away
1089	Storyline was dumb and predictable. 'Missions' were stupid, obnoxious and tedious. Not the best from this franchise.
1090	I'm no where 'new' to the racing game scene. ive played for years on end and ive even beaten this game on playstation 2. if you're considering buying this is 2016 or later, please save your time and skip this buy.... i'd honestly enjoy one of those 50 cent arcade racing games more than Need for Speed Undercover.
1091	got this game and start up and everything was off, and my intial thought is if i go to the settings it will fix everyting because it setip for my computer. I was totally wrong, the in game cut sceen were fine but when it cam to hte gameplay all the cars squeezed and resemble a tiny clown cars you mighty see on tv. Tinkering with all setting didn't fix the problem and immediately requested a refund
1092	If you were a fan of the old Need For Speed games, give this one a miss. For a good NFS game, go back to either the old Underground 2 or even Most Wanted.  Driving mechanics are not too great, the cars 'snap' to the road when trying to drift, not to mention the difficulty spike where the AI gets way faster cars and gets tougher and you are stuck with the slow cars.  ProStreet was tough but eventually you could beat it, the same with Most Wanted.  Try another NFS game, don't worry about this one.
1093	The game play is stiff, seems to have no story line except seemingly randomly videos telling you about an abstract story that has nothing to do with the races you run.   the roaming feature seems to have no point as continously on the bottom of your screen is a shortcut to the the next race which immiedietly can go into the next with seemily no reasoing except that its the next on the developers playlist.   Overall severly disapointed
1094	I've played a lot of NFS games, but this one was by far my least favorite. The car controlled better when I used the keyboard than when I used my Afterglow Xbox controller and I felt like I had stepped back to the nintendo 64. I loved the N64 and would never say it was a bad system but this game was released in 2008 and honestly could have looked/worked a lot better. I personally think that we are better than simply pushing tab to go to the next race (the races are rediculously easy to win, there's no challenge at all). For now I can't recomend this game for what it should be. Maybe I missed something. I'm going to go back and play some more at a later time. but unless the game becomes more interesting I can't recomend it.
1095	I don't recommend buying this game through steam.  I bought it and spent hours trying tyo sort it out but of it crashing. If anyone is having problems crashing, nomatter what Windowd you're on, go to where it's saved C drive, (x86), steam, type Need for Speed in top right. Once found the correct file, right click until you see compatbility and mark the dpi thingiemajig.Also you need to mark the thing about it being windowed, that makes mine work some unknown reason. Once done that, load the game up and when racing press ESC and trun v-sync on. Doont touch resolution until after. Hope this helps.   It's a great game, thats why i bought it again as i had it on xbox 360 and ps2.
1096	Spend your money on a better racing game. I had to go into my registry and look for the key to unlock the game on Origin because the Steam version really suffers. I finished the game on Origin, that's why my time played isn't accurate.  I don't understand the positive reviews mentioning a good plot. All you get are heavily compressed videos of Maggie Q having to say some dumb things and muscular men looking all angry at the camera.  The driving is quite bad. If you're not able to take a corner you have to release the gas for one second so the car turns like a charm even while driving at 200+ km/h. It's just not fun and there is barely any challenge in the game.  It's a consoleport and it feels like one. The graphics look way better in the screenshots and there are lot's of framedrops, especially when taking sharp turns. There is way too much bloom and if you turn it off the game looks worse thatn NFS Hot pursuit 2 (the old one). There is a nice smoke effect however when driving through sand or braking.
1097	Need for Speed Undercover! Where should I start with this? Let's see:  First off the graphics are horrible. I set everything to the highest settings and yet the game looks like crap. Even Nfsu and nfsu2 has way better graphics than this game and they came out way before. Even Nfs carbon graphics are better than this game. Second the gameplay is nothing similar to other nfs games. You can have the fastest car in the game and the slowest car can catch up to you like its a piece of cake. I'd like to see that in real life. Have a Nissan Skyline GTR r34 fully tuned race against a 240sx fully tuned and see who wins. If you're the person who does't care about graphics and gameplays then this is for you. If you're the person who goes after well design graphics and a good gameplay then I don't recommend this for you, but try it as you may.
1098	Does not look like what it looks like in the pictures above.
1099	it was great while i can still use it with my xbox 360 controller, then now i cant seems to play with it
1100	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1101	GOD what a poor Game.
1102	If you came from Most Wanted (2005) and expected a similar experience, or that of Carbon, you'll be dissapointed. This is an extremely unrealistic arcade racing game, that has some noticible problems. 1. Resolution. 2. No Steam Overlay.   Game feels poorly done and rushed. Not recommended.
1103	I would've recommended this game if there wasn't something missing...Oh, yeah. The Challenge Series DLC. Can't get it anymore or, if you can, it's Origin-exclusive.  Other than that, the plot's decent, car roster's small but great, and you'll get a challenge out of some the races. The Master Events in particular. Still don't recommend it due to the missing Challenge Series, which gives more than what multiple playthroughs could ever hope to. Therefore, the 2-3 Bonus cars you get from it to use in Career Mode are (probably) forever out of grasp.
1104	This is one of the worst ports I've ever experienced; only bested by the Tomb Raider 1 port.   IN SHORT: its ugly and plays badly. I've clocked some serious time on and offline on the console counterpart and wow. It's bad.   The controls for a start: in the menu, I was forced to use mouse control which kept skewing out randomly. I managed to put on the controller which annoyingly has to be done inside the menus; a bad thing in any game imo. when I got the controller on just wtf. The keys had been mapped to some random nonsense. And by that I mean even the pause button was out of whack, and I was using a 360 controller. I did remap them but just wtf. To remap them I had to revert ot kb+m to navigate the menus because I had no idea how to with the controller. Worked after this though but I have no idea why you would play it.  The game first loaded in 640x480... yeah... I have 2 monitors so I caused a big shift in windows placement and sizes and to make matters worse, the game starts with an un-skip-able cinematic which blends you into the game. So I was stuck watching this hideous quality game thinking when it finally lets me start, I can sort that. Nope. I maxed the settings and its hideous, I would genuinely take teh PS3 game over this and indeed only bought this because I had played and completed the console version repeatedly way back when.  As a game this is unspectacular in its prime but theres certainly fun to be had. However, its a poor port and looks terrible as well as feels worse than the console counterpart. I'm not sure if this is just me or what but its definately made this a waste fo money. I have a 3570k and a overclocked gtx 680 so I didnt expect it to look that bad for its age. Maybe its just my unrealistic expectations due to hindsight making me remember a prettier game but thats rarely the case.
1105	Need for Speed Undercover! Where should I start with this? Let's see:  First off the graphics are horrible. I set everything to the highest settings and yet the game looks like crap. Even Nfsu and nfsu2 has way better graphics than this game and they came out way before. Even Nfs carbon graphics are better than this game. Second the gameplay is nothing similar to other nfs games.

1106	GOD what a poor Game.
1107	Still as bad as when it came out on xbox 360.
1108	Heyyo, a very broken entry in the Need for Speed series... EA Vancouver... I expected a lot more from you.
1109	Don't waste your money on a game that won't play. Steam should kick these old versions that won't play on windows 7/8. What a piece of junk.
1110	i tried to play it under win 7 / 64 in compatibility mode, the crash sig says out of driver address ... dx'es are ok and fine so i guess ea just messed it up again..  *Update: the codelivered PB is OLD...lets see if ...  *Renewed update: PB repatched, drivers rechecked - it messes up with the gtx770 i guess.  So concluded: Not even at that price worth getting it.
1111	This is a tough game to review. I wish there was an 'okay' button, something inbetween the good and bad. Unfortunately, I have to give this game a thumbs down.   ~~~PROS~~~ For $5, it wasn't the worst deal I've made... I spent $20 on Goat Sim and only played it for a couple hours.  The car customization is great, the police AI has VASTLY improved since Most Wanted, there are lots of races and events, and a decent selection of cars. The soundtrack isn't too bad, either.  In terms of visuals, this game looks pretty impressive. I have a GT 640 and can max it out in 1080p, which came as a surprise to me.  The audio FX are amazing, though I don't think the cars sound quite as 'mean' as they did in MW. ~~~CONS~~~ I came from Need For Speed: Most Wanted with high hopes, and what I got out of this game was... uh... troubling, at best. The career in this game doesn't even compare to Most Wanted, and I mean that in a bad way. In Most Wanted, I spent hours replaying the career several different times, with different cars, I grew up with that game. Undercover, however... I kind of had to drag myself through the story. It was mediocre, at best. On top of that, the career mode seems to only have two difficulties; impossible, and ridiculously easy. One second, you win a race with the next opponent trailing 20+ seconds behind. The next, you get ripped a new one and end up in 8th place. It's really odd...  The multiplayer is a joke. Good luck finding a server. Also, your graphic schemes don't show up in multiplayer.  Menu navigation is NOT optimized for a mouse. In fact, I would unplug your mouse before you even play the game. All it could really do is get in the way. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Overall, I'd give this game a 4/10. If you want multiplayer, buy a different NFS.
1112	This game was fun on my old computer and I recently got a new one with a GTX 760Ti and an i7 Intel Quadcore Processor, It should be no problem running this game but for some reason it is. I crashes randomly! But besides the crashes It's a good game.
1113	A number of issues with this game.  Firstly is having to run it in xp compatibility mode to avoid crashing, second is having to reset graphics settings ever time I launch the game due to said compatibility mode setup that is needed to complete some races without the game crashing.  And the deal breaker for me, the usual NFS rubberbanding in races. Screw your lazy difficulty balancing.
1114	A game in which immature 30year old 'gangsters' and boobs stare at you.  it was to expect that aesthetically undercover could not cope with NFS Most Wanted(original/2005) but the fact that beeing released 3 years later it feels technicaly worse too surprised me indeed. maximum resolution: 1920x1200 particles: nonexistent improvements on the cops: none (roadblocks are even worse now compared to MW[2005].) flair: palm bay feels like a random generic city. there are barely any tracks with a nice vista. Try to get NFS Most Wanted[2005], if you want a great street racing game.
1115	This game is not good OKAY JUST GET ANOTHER ONE GO PLEASE 
1116	Sometimes crash without reason
1117	I want a refund
1118	Keyboard/mouse and controller support for this game is hot garbage. Out of the box, steering response has a major delay. I researched a fix for it and the only one that actually works causes the steering to be super sensitive. Either way, the poor steering makes the game unplayable. Stay away! This game is a waste of money! Do not buy!
1119	This game does not follow the real world's physics law at all. I am driving at least 20 to 30 km/h faster than an opponent (judging by the speed and time I am passing the opponent's car, in a way that if you are driving 20 km/h faster than the opponent's car, you are driving 5.5m/second faster than an opponent. This means, if you are literally tailgating the opponent, it takes 1 second to be a little ahead of the opponent and in a 2 second, you pass the opponent completely, and there are at least 2 to 3 meters between your car and your oppoent. And, lets think about how fast a car can accelerate. from 0 to 60 miles, or 0 to 100 km, an average car in the game (excluding cars like Bugatti Veyron) it takes about 2 to 3 seconds at least to reach 0 to 60 miles, or 0 to 100 km. Now, if a car is around or above 160 km/h or 100mi/h, it takes significantly more time to accelerate.. And guess what, my car passes an oppoent, gains some distance which is not at all achievable to reduce in a short period of time (meaning several minutes), and the opponent reduces that distance in no time like 10 to 20 seconds, and at maximum within a minute. This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Even if I am giving a consideration to the fact that it is a mere game, this is not something to be messed around. The fact that this game is released several years ago will be the only reason I will be accepting the fact the way it is, but this game does not in any way gives the way the cars are raced, nor how a car can catch up another car. Only the fact that it is a 'game' will give an immunity to this product of failing such significant factor of actual racings.
1120	A.I flat out cheats in late game. Its a racing a game so if your to incompetent to make decent A.I opponent then your to incompetent to make a game. If the rubberband A.I dosent bother you the custmization to the game I felt was rather well done. But frankly there are to many good games to play to waste time repeating races over and over due to rubberband A.I. Just feels like a giant waste of time. Not worth it.
1121	The game itself is a fun arcade racer that is well put together, but stick with the console version. This is a shoddy PC port, supporting only a handful of resolutions up to 1080p (I have a native 1360x768 and have to step down to 720p to get a decent image). That I can live with, but then I reached a required mission (one that pushes the story forward), and it crashes on load 100% of the time for that one mission. So I have to walk away from the game on PC :(
1122	The old Wii/PS2 version was WAY better, felt more like the original NFS: Most Wanted, I'm guessing because they used many assets from it to make developing easier. The PC version isn't even close at all. Not really enjoying it either.
1123	There is a category in my game library reserved for only a few games I own.  This category is titled 'Regrets', and in this category are a few (about 3 of my 60) games that I just wish I hadn't spent money on. This game was the reason I created the 'Regrets' category in the first place.  Oh, and it's a terrible console port. That too.
1124	Ahem... Need for Speed, a reputable racing game genre that everyone should be familiar with, especially after Underground appeared on the roadmap. So why do I ask, is this abomination under the NFS banner? This is a pure stinker of a game that will have you screaming in rage at either three things:  1. Akward controls - Get ready to smash your controller that the game doesn't support natively.  2. Rubberbanding A.I - What is this? The god damn 90's? Please, I don't need to be reminded that one mistake costs me that 10 minute race I was close to WINNING.  3. Graphics - If someone pooped on your eyes, then smeared the tears of slaves into it, that's what you get, I'm sorry, Most Wanted had the best graphics and even that wasn't awesome for todays standard.  Avoid, get Most Wanted or Hot Persuit or something, avoid like the god damn plague.   CRAPPIEST GAME IN MY COLLECTION AWARD.  Rating: 1 / 5
1125	i buy this not long ago at 75% off (a few days before i wrote this review).  and the game is crap, the reason i bought this, is because i wanted to play some racing games, that are not simulation, because lately racing games are all about simulation only, and i wanted a fun game, instead i got a crappy game.  Pros : this game got nothing good in it. except maybe because this game doesn't need EA Origin can be called as a plus.  Cons : 1. very poor optimization 2. the AI is too easy 3. because the AI is too easy, the game is absolutely boring / garbage. 4. lame acting. 5. Maggie Q acting sucks 6. story is kinda non existent, because they just throw us in it, after showing the cutscene. 7. car handling sucks. 8. no vibration for 360 gamepad. 9. i tried plugging in my logitech rumblepad 2, and the vibration option is finally show up, but it feels lacking. 10. for a 2008 game, the graphics sucks, too much blur. 11. the city feels like a dead city.  Conclusion : even at 75% off, this game is a waste of money, unless you got money to burn.  Overall : 0 out of 10  @EA : i wont use origin, that's why i wont buy your newer games, that is origin only.
1126	Due to the lack of any good N4S games being on steam I thought I'd give this one a try and sadly hated it.  To start with the graphics are horrible, even at full settings it looks like an old PS2 game, the environment is bare and buildings pop up into view as you get close to them. Also, the weird warp tunnel effect it gives you when your at full speed is very jarring and looks a mess.  As its an older game the shoddy graphics can be forgiven to an extent but sadly the gameplay doesn't make up for them, the AI is just too easy to beat. You can literally just hold down the accelerate button and let the car bounce off the walls and still win with a 10 second plus gap. In fact on one race I gave the AI a 10 second head start and still managed to win by bouncing off the walls with a 4 second lead, its just no challenge or any fun at all.  At Â£10 there's better racing games you can get off of Steam, I'd avoid this one and find something thats a bit more of a challenge.
1127	Game Crashes on the first turn over the bridge, with no help from steam (which they sell however they do not provide technical support for third party products) customer consumer protection laws do not apply to them it seems.
1128	The game looks absolutely Cheap in comparison to Most Wanted and Carbon... The Colors look false, and the completely controling like steering is total crap ... I mean if turn my Steering wheel abrupt to the left, while I am driving with ~200 km/h then a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥ should happen. Not in this game. The car just says no, makes a little sneak in the direction you turned your steering wheel to, and then continues driving straightahead. This game Sucks and I can't recommend it for anyone. kkthxbye.
1129	I miss these circuit within a city type racing games, like the old Burnout titles.  The problem here is that the game keeps crashing on story missions because of the crappy 10 second cutscenes with Maggie Q.  Seriously, the acting is so bad it'd be better to remove the cutscenes all together.  The driving is great, but the way you earn and unlock cars though the storymode isn't. And some of the story missions force you to use a POS car to evade the police, when you can't even outrun them in it.
1130	To call Need for Speed: Undercover a racing game, is an insult to all those who play racing games. To put it simply, to call Need for Speed: Undercover anything but a pathetic cash grab is an insult to the entire gaming community.  - Physics are in no way realistic, you bounce off walls and cars rather than collisions - Upgrades? Nah - A decent story? Nah - Easy to use UI? Nope. Because who needs a visible mouse cursor anyways? - Compelling soundtrack? Nope.  Don't buy this game
1131	tl;dr: Don't buy this game unless it's on sale. If you do buy it here, try not to waste your CD key on the Steam version (if it's possible to activate on Origin). This game is a solid argument for why NFS Underground 2 and older NFS games would be great on Steam.  When this game came out, the reviews were mixed, but the forum members absolutely slammed this game for being of a lower caliber than EA's usual fare. It was on sale for $2 during the Winter Sale in 2014, and I purchased it to satisfy my curiosity (or possibly vindicate the game for myself), only to find that - while the game isn't awful - it's also not anything incredibly special compared to older NFS series titles.  The game, overall, is a distilled sample of the worst problems plaguing the NFS series in the Underground (2003) through Prostreet (2007) era. The AI has a severe 'rubber band' effect that makes some early races easy, but others, like the 'Outrun' races, virtually impossible (and dependent on luck and blocking rather than skill). The car customization, like Prostreet, uses 'Autosculpt' for everything, making it difficult to create a good-looking car unless one sticks to stock parts. The 'Action Driving Engine' makes the cars eagerly jump into caricatured silver-screen maneuvers and dramatic donuts every time you take a turn a little too hard.   Visually, the game is actually impressive, especially for the time. The city map looks incredibly well made. However, between the overwrought bloom and motion blur, and the fact that the game defaulted to the lowest graphical settings through the otherwise fairly nice introduction scene (and I couldn't go into the options until the scene was over), the overall effect of the graphics is largely underwhelming. I later disabled the motion blur and realized that it was a graphical prop to hide the fact that the cars handle in an absurd manner.  The inability to access the menu up front on game start is one of many things that points to the PC game being a hasty console port. In addition, every time I quit the game, the game lost my control settings and I had to set them up again. The menus are also incredibly clunky and unresponsive. Moreover, the online mode works WORSE on Steam - EA has purposely broken intercompatibility between the Steam version and other versions. If you buy it here, activate your key on Origin.  The only positive part of the game, one I wished was present to the same extent in other NFS games, was the fairly impressive story and cutscene sequences. These were present to some extent in Underground through Carbon, but this game and The Run (2011) apparently dissuaded EA from using the same cinematics in later games until NFS 2015.  My recommendation is that you get Most Wanted (2005) instead, if you can find a copy, or else Hot Pursuit (2010). This game's reputation among the NFS community is deserved. At least, for $2, my curiosity was satisfied, and I was pretty sure I made the right call the first time around by skipping it.
1132	So I ask myself when I play this game why? Why don't I have nitrous straight off the bat like in every other game Why is the outrun mode a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of garbage Why cant the car be edited Why cant I upgrade the car Why AM I WASTING MY TIME
1133	Game Crashes on the first turn over the bridge, with no help from steam (which they sell however they do not provide technical support for third party products) customer consumer protection laws do not apply to them it seems.
1134	people usually like this game but for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake developers LEARN TO CHOOSE TO SKIP CUTSCENES. Nissan GT-R is faster than the bugatti veyron - seems legit  i like the NFS series but this one just sucks ballz
1135	Cons: 30FPS lock Max resolution 4:3 1024x768, 16:9 1280x720 (720p) Low textures (like very bad and dull textures, even NFSU2 look better than this), those screenshot are lies. Over-glare effect to cover dull world in high setting, and no I cannot turn that shining light of sun without turn it off whole effect entirely. EA Nation login, which is non exist today causing No Multiplayer. it doesn't scale very well with new hardware.  Pros: Cut-scene is great, I like Maggie Q Sound/Music overall shine over the gameplay.  Other Thoughts: I just want to replay my old NFS games, but I'm not sure which titled, so I end up with this one. I don't feel so bad about it, because 78% discount.  I feel like this cut-scene cost more than developing budget. I'm still curious which NFS title that I want to replay, it's probably Hot Pursuit, I should get that one instead of this.  just forget this and move on.  EDIT: it's NFS CARBON, I should get that instead, but I can't find it anywhere.
1136	Even with the settings maxed, this game looks and feels lifeless. The story is complete fluff and the cutscenes add no real value and come across as the worst softcore porn film ever.  If you're looking for customization options on par with Underground, OG Most Wanted or even Hot Pursuit Reboot, you won't find it here. Skill points are devied randomly, with bonuses given during certain events that you cannot allocate points towards.  The A.I. is non-adjustable and some of the easiest I've encountered in a game yet. Police stop chasing you heavily after a minute or so. The other racers are a joke as well. 30 second split times? Gimme a break...  I might revisit this game later down the line, but so far, I'm not terribly impressed. At least it's playable, compared to The Shift series and The Run.
1137	I don't know how you could possibly manage to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up this game so badly. There's barely anything right about it.
1138	My game won't go past the first cutscene before crashing. It's a waste of ten dollars.
1139	this game will not let you play mulitiplayer do not get it
1140	The quality of this game aint that good and it is not worth 10 pounds
1141	Crashed at the end of the first segment every time, no matter what I did.  I ran the troubleshooter, tried running it in compatibility mode for vista and XP, tried running as admin, followed recommended settings on  pcgamingwiki.com . Same thing. Crashed every single time.  Win8.1, Intel i7-2600K, NVidia GTX-970, 16 GB RAM, 2xSSD in RAID-0
1142	i love this game on ps3 so bought it for pc but was very disapointed that its not controller compatable so now ive wasted Â£9.99 on a game i will never play on steam dont buy unless willing to use keyboard says partial controller support but has no support great game poor support
1143	I don't know how you could possibly manage to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up this game so badly. There's barely anything right about it.
1144	My game won't go past the first cutscene before crashing. It's a waste of ten dollars.
1145	This title is everything wrong with the EA cashgrab machine. The actual game is quite fun; on console. On PC, however, they clearly couldn't be bothered to fix something as simple as the graphics resetting to minimum every time the game starts.  That's right, every time you fire up Undercover, the graphics will be at their absolute minimum in all their blurry, chunky 600x400 glory. Which means you will spend the first 10 minutes of your playtime navigating through all the graphics menus with your keyboard (because mouse support is overrated), and re-selecting the maximum settings you had before.  The sad thing is, even on maximum settings, the game doesn't look good. I get that it is quite dated at this point, but somehow in my memories of playing this game on my friend's 360 console, the game looked way better.  At any rate, it is a discount arcade racer that EA slapped a PC release label on, and once again didn't bother to actually port settings correctly. Don't waste your money.
1146	steam really let me down they didnt refund me on the game it dosunt even run i havent been able to load the game past the loading screen really let me down steam that is awful customer care
1147	tbh, this game is not fun to play with by look on it's cover, and this is my biggest mistake ever made on my damned whole life to bought this trash. Well i can't refund this cz my play time is almost 4 hours.
1148	This Game doesnt work! DONT BUY THIS SHIIIIAT !!!! Waist of money .... -.-' (and nerves)
1149	I wonder why the game fines you for driving too fast? At the same time the game takes away XP for crashing?
1150	its stupid and i cant use my gaming wheel!!!!!!! 
1151	Nonsensical gameplay, laugable AI, doesn't matter how fast you go, the police can go 65 M/h faster. Absurd controls, stupid story with lame graphics, worst need for speed I've played
1152	A promising game, let down by the mediocre graphics of a console port, the glitches that come with and the badly designed AI. The only promising aspect of this game is the storyline and the wide selection of cars on offer. If you want a trip down memory lane, and enjoyed NFS: The Run, grab this on sale, otherwise steer clear.
1153	This game is a poor port to the PC and it feels like a gutted and cheaply thrown together version of the game. Even the Wii version of this game had more features than this.
1154	I enjoyed playing this game a couple of years back, but if you are looking for a good experience you will be disappointed. It's glitchy, buggy and barely works.
1155	SHAMEFUL DISPRAY!  The Wii version was like 10 times better, in my opinion.
1156	If you remember the old classic NFS and like them, then, it may be worth, although I would recommend to buy it when it's on sale. If you expect this game to be better than the old one, then you are wrong. The story is terrible and you don't even have to finish the game to know what will happen. Car upgrade is worthless, challenger will be as good as the car you drive. And on top of that, driving is the same with all the cars.
1157	Need for speed undercover:  Great example of the NFS franchise. Unfortunately is let down severely by basic port/platform issue.  No ability to access the steam interface â this includes not be able to take screenshots &amp; access the hub or message etc. (thanks Origin/EA/Steam). Also I am bugged by some issue where the car steers to the right constantly. I unplugged my controller &amp; keyboard, tried another and rebooted as much as any man could in half an hour to no success.   If anyone knows a remedy to the issues above, please share and I will update this review. If not this game gets a stinking 0/10 for me for being a good, yet unplayable game.
1158	I've been playing this a bit, and I have to admit, I'm very disapointed, the traillers for this game made it look really good, but really, the game isn't that good. This is not the Need For Speed I know. I'm not impressed at where the story line goes or the fact that it just dumps you into the middle of a map, with no real objective. The graphics arn't much of an improvment from Most Wanted, and to tell you the truth, I think Most Wanted has beter graphics than this game does. We are talking 3 years difference, and not much improvment, plus the camera movement is annoying. That's really all I have to say about this game. Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit looks a lot better than this game.
1159	Utterly broken.  Neither my Steam controller nor my Xbox One controller would work with this game. Strangely, they both work in NFS Carbon and NFS Most Wanted.... Older games in the series by the same dev??  Graphics are terrible and also buggy. Car effects on Off, they look fine but you don't get lights on police cars. Car effects on, regardless of setting (low/med/hi) everything has a reflection on it that is on 90% of the time but disappears, reappears and flickers with no rhyme or reason.  Bad UI, bad controls, Steam overlay doesn't work in normal mode nor Big Picture (meaning you can't adjust your steam controller to work as a keyboard, seemingly the only way around the broken gamepad support). Just avoid this and go get Underground 2 or Most Wanted and get a 1080p patch for them.
1160	One of the worst, if not the worst, NFS games I've ever played. It has no sense of speed, the cars looks like crap, the city is totally empty and the interface is just poor. I'm normally all for open world/cities, but in this game there is just no point. And just because of this game I have no expectations whatsoever for NFS The Run (but that's mainly because it will created by the same developer). Let Criterion Games handle the next action packed NFS games please, they know what to do. Back to hell with you, Undercover !  [Rating: 59/100]
1161	Don't even know how this ended up in my library, probably with a bundle? I generally like the NFS series and accept their disrespect of physics (my favorite was the first Most Wanted) but as of 2015, this game is a damn waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.  WORSE: it installs PunkBuster and does NOT remove it when you uninstall the game. The thing stays active and even attempts to connect to the internet, with no record in the Programs&amp;Features panel. Just awful.
1162	Before I start this review, I will say that I am actually very fond of the Need For Speed games, atleast most of them, with Most Wanted 2005 being my absolute favorite. This game, however, does not come close.  I have played this game on Xbox360, PS2, and Pc now. The Xbox360 version was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. That one gets a 7/10. The Ps2 version was decent, but lacked a lot of the story and had very few cars. 6/10. This one, however, was ported HORRIBLY. It feels like it ported straight from the XBOX360(With much worse graphics) with about 5 minutes of tweeking. AND THE CONTROLS ARE SOME OF THE WORSE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I tried to use this with the controller and keyboard and both were tedious. The controller only is able to function with half of the game and the keyboard is utterly the most confusing set-up i have ever seen. I mean seriously? Delete was my nitrous button! I couldnt even customize my cars and had to get away with whatever they happened to give me.  The game crashes ALL THE TIME. for the hour and a half I was playing it crashed 4 times, twice while I was racing, and twice during a cutscene. I have a top-knotch rig, so it is definitley the game's fault here.  That and some other problems like blinding sun blare, jerky movement of the car, limited multiplayer, the only problem I couldn't find was what most people shun this game for: Rubber-banding AI. The only redeeming thing about this game is play-time(7-8 hours, which is fine), the customization(If you can find it) and the car list which was actually fairly large for an arcade racer.  My final rating is a solid 3/10. its a bad game port and I certainly don't recommend it. C'mon EA, you know better than this...
1163	Utterly broken.  Neither my Steam controller nor my Xbox One controller would work with this game. Strangely, they both work in NFS Carbon and NFS Most Wanted....

1164	This will be my first review, ever on steam.. annnnd this game is a doozy..  Where to start... i brought this while it was on offer (don't buy it otherwise) it's a pale comparison to the likes of Most Wanted (2005) and Carbon.. so.. the pro's and con's   Pros:  Many cars to purchase Lots of rims to choose Massive world to freeroam in  Cons: A.I has 'Catch-Up' i'm sure of this Traffic WILL spawn in the right places at the right time to screw you over Cops/Feds are literally driving in tanks, SUV's can keep up with you no matter how fast your going Car handling is shocking to say the least Poor port to PC as it'll lag even if you have a decent system Story is.. well. i didn't pay much attention, it ends abruptly   It wasn't a baaad game, but it'll make you rage at most things that happen in game.. won't be playing this again anytime soon!
1165	It just keeps on crashing right at the start right when i go through the cop barricade
1166	No controller support, a ton of motion blur and really dated graphics, get carbon or a newer one instead.
1167	Just don't buy it... Too many problems for too little gaming. 
1168	graphics suck! not worth buying period..
1169	I brought this game for 2.49 â¬ and with hand on my heart I'm telling you this game is:  - Absolue piece of garbage! - Crash all the time - AI sucks - Sountrack sucks (why the hell is RAP music in soundtrack?)  --Soundtrack should boost you to make you feel good and thrilled which RAP can not do this.  ! ! ! WARNING ! ! ! Do not buy this game, this game is able to put you out of balance and cause you physical and mental disorders can get you into overspending after breaking several keyboards, mouses and monitors.  Next time before buyng EA games i'll consider it deeply.
1170	Game breaking crash to desktop when you try and start the 'Transporter' mission prevents you from playing the second and third part of the game.  No unlocked resolution support: If your monitor's native res isn't on the list, you're out of luck because you can't mod the game or any of it's files to fix it. At least it calculates the aspect ratio from your desktop resolution so if you don't mind stretching the pixels the ratio in-game will at least be correct. However, the cutscenes and HUD will be stretched.
1171	Horrible controls, boring races, boring open world, and cheap ai. Only buy it if its a couple dollars. I owned this game on 360 as well but thought I'd give it another go because maybe the higher framerate and resolution could make it better. It didn't. The best NFS game to me was NFS Hot Pursuit 2 on PS2. Just get PCSX2 and HP2 on PS2, I'm sure you'll have more fun.
1172	Boooooring, not fun compared to other NFS titles.  Also major graphical problems, even when you set the resolution properly, everything still shows up squashed.  The fix is to disable triple screen play, if you have a triple screen setup.
1173	This will be my first review, ever on steam.. annnnd this game is a doozy..  Where to start... i brought this while it was on offer (don't buy it otherwise) it's a pale comparison to the likes of Most Wanted (2005) and Carbon.. so.. the pro's and con's   Pros:  Many cars to purchase Lots of rims to choose Massive world to freeroam in  Cons: A.I has 'Catch-Up' i'm sure of this Traffic WILL spawn in the right places at the right time to screw you over Cops/Feds are literally driving in tanks, SUV's can keep up with you no matter how fast your going Car handling is shocking to say the least Poor port to PC as it'll lag even if you have a decent system Story is.. well. i didn't pay much attention, it ends abruptly   It wasn't a baaad game, but it'll make you rage at most things that happen in game.. won't be playing this again anytime soon!
1174	Worst NFS I've ever played / 10 Buy it if you want to spare some time, but get it on sale.  Elaborate:  First off I'll start by saying that even though I played this game for 20+ hours, they weren't that enjoyable. I don't know if it's due to the games I play that frustration doesn't hit me that easly now, but this game is not that good.   Graphics are amazing by the time of it's release,  The menu it's just so horrible I reallly got to hate pressing the ESC key. The visuals for this one are so limited and not really that cool looking. Music is a subjective matter but I gotta say I really didn't enjoy most of it. The AI is just so bad, not really that 'Intelligent'. Hitbox problems.  Know that when you lightly touch a wall you can get hit and crash as if you were facing it.  
1175	Tried to steal a car, and sneak it to a chop shop, only to have a cop car spawn in the middle of the road in front of me.
1176	Extremely dated
1177	It will not let me get passed the first part without messing up FIX THIS
1178	ITs an ok NFS game, not that good because it is very repetetive and it gets boring.
1179	Being a huge fan of Need For Speed and my favorite being Need For Speed Carbon. This is porobably the worst game I have ever played. All the driving mechanics are â¥â¥â¥â¥, and the game itself if just too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing easy. Really wish I did not purchase this game. But hey, it was on sale and was more of an impulse buy. But I paid to be dissapointed so horribly.
1180	In typical EA fashion, this game sucks. It's competent, yet boring  Pro: Easy driving experience No rubberband AI  Con: Lackluster graphics/options Very forgettable soundtrack Cop AI is abysmal and stupid Story is thin and predictable  If you have the top car in each tier, there's no excuse why you can't win a race. The AI doesn't rubberband during races. Police chases, yes...but not races.
1181	AI suck Gameplay suck Only the story is good but if it does why dont you go buy a movie to watch LOL The Roaming Traffic in outrun race make me sick.....Da AI car just crash to you ridiculously and you never beat the target car I think this game ruin my impression to Need for Speed series,my last NFS game is Most Wanted on psp
1182	Can they get all dlcs for this please
1183	Very bad graphic ....
1184	Do you like 5 min cut scenes you cannot skip? I dont , â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lame I got bored after 5 mins of playing, bad visuals and low res graphics
1185	I really thought i'd like this game, since it came after prostreet, but i was more than wrong. The police are WAY too over-powered, and i can't steer for sh*t. I would like a refund please.
1186	TERRIBLE GAME! it makes you watch the movies and the graphics are terrible
1187	Many people love Apostle, for many people need Apostle, but when Apostle has expired past his shelf life, no one remembered Apostle, and so through the cycle of rebirth, he is doomed to experience this sorrow for eternity. May the good king rest in peace, for his heart and mind knew none.
1188	This game in particular has given me mixed feelings. When I first bought the game and played the earlier mission, I had a blast. The game was pretty fun, but the fun never lasted. When I was progressing later in the game, the AI seems almost impossible to beat and I got fed up. The scenery soon became repetitive and boring and the races became harder than my erect ding dong. I quit, never bothered to finish the game. Besides, the cars handled like sh*t anyway. In a nutshell, this game is like the wh*re of all NFSs. The game was fun for awhile, then it became an utter pain in the a** to play. Just like that wh*re of a girlfriend that turns you on for a few weeks, then dumps you for a better weiner.  Don't buy this game, unless if you enjoy getting cheated on.
1189	Boring, races are all in the same key. The only good thing here is music. It's advisable to try Burnout Paradise. It's from 2008 as well but 10x better.
1190	Possibly the worst game in exsistance.....It absolutely ruins the franchise for me. Not even Trayvon Martin would play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't buy it. Not even once.
1191	the autosculpt on this game is broken and steam helps you with nothing
1192	Don't buy that stupid game. I love NFS games but not this one. Don't even think about it.  
1193	NFS:Undercover has really shown its age. Unless you have some nostalgic value attached to it, then don't waste your time. There are numerous other racing games on the market for a little more money. The game is much like any other Need for Speed title and the cutscenes become extremely tedious after the first playthrough. Support for more recent versions of OS is also failing as the game tends to crash often.
1194	Game has some glitches, not very efficiant , cpu bots will have instant catch up , traffic will auto aim for your car to crash in all races, you can use a tier four car in a tier one race and computer will detune itself to match your cars performance automatically, once you get your car impounded , you will not get it back even if you tuned it up with game cash ...you will have to go into shop click pink slips add car. the car will be stock and back to factory look.
1195	I recommend playing NFS Most Wanted or NFS Hot Persuit instead of this one if you are a 'Imma go back and finish my old games' type of gamer.   While the most important thing in a NFS game is the driving, which this game does well, the environment and stoy both fall flat. If you've played Most Wanted and Hot Persuit then you know what I mean.  1 hour into the game and I already lost interest in playing it. You can play through this game once but that's pretty much it.
1196	Terrible game mechanics, it runs jerky as crap with a system well beyond its recommended settings. It's slightly less jerky than the PS3 version.  If there is any version worth checking out of NFS: Undercover it is the Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP). Its by far the best iteration to play and still not saying much.  I'm a huge fan of the early series but rather dissapointed in these later releases starting with anything after the first Most Wanted Black version. Have yet to play the Shift series with is supposed to be more simulation like.
1197	Bought it as a bundle for cheap so i'm not complaining much, however this game is poorly coded to the point where you may aswell buy a different game. Being an old game, it may not be badly coded but it isnt well compatable. Also being an old game, at Â£9.99 it's worth it if you have Windows XP / Vista I guess. But here's what happened: - First time I launched it, it went to 640x480 and crashed my pc with a black screen. - Second time, changed resolution to 1920x1080 and it crashed. - Third time, it launched it 1920x1080 and played for an hour or so finishing alot of missions and obtaining different cars along the way for it to suddenly crash as I merely evade the police.  Pros: - Nice cars. - Good gameplay. - Is not half bad if you get it on a console. - Enjoyable to play when it did play.  Cons: - Ugly enviroment. - Poor brakes. - Easy AI. - Cars too slow. - Use of KM/H. - Annoying real life based cut scenes. - Stupid police chatter. - Unrealistic police chases. - Unrealistic police cars. - Use of blocking corners with arrows. - Glitches with autosculpt. (Make a custom bumper for it to erase itself.) - Unrealistic traffic. - Weird gravity. - Any form of air requires a slow-mo replay apparently. - Buildings out of proportion. - No ingame brightness/gamma options, makes you change your tv. - Screenshots need an origin account? (wtf) - Steam overlay doesn't work %90 of the time.
1198	Low game, you cannot set sensitivity of analog game controll and not very realistically game!
1199	Recycled gameplay. Recycled graphics. Recycled features. Poor story...  And even after all of this, I would have STILL recommended it because it has decent replay value, and I enjoy playing Need for Speed games, even ones as bad as this. But not only is this game sub-par, it barely even works properly. The graphics stutter, the traffic ocasionally wigs out, the pursuit breakers sometimes don't work at all  and on top of it all, autosculpt flat-out does not work... So the game's entire customization aspect is not even present...  So, bottom line, no. This is not worth it, even at a discount.
1200	Horrible car physics making the car uncontrollable. Like the Video cutscenes with actors and good story. Prefer ?Underground Series over any other nfs title.
1201	absolute horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
1202	It's a decent game, took me 10 hours to complete. I would say that it's one of the worst NFS games though. The driving is really neat, but the police chases are boring compared to Most Wanted. You start of with a good car, then it falls of after a while. Then you get a new car, which is very powerful, but then that falls of as well. You constantly have to upgrade your car, or the AI will crush you. The storyline is flat, no real surprises, and the ending was expected. I had a good time, but I would probably not reccomend it to anyone.
1203	The worst game I have ever bought on Steam, EA hates livestreamers or at least that is my opinion based on their games never being able to go windowed so streamers and adjust things without killing the game. YOU CAN'T SKIP THE CUT SCENES...AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE LIVE VIDEO CUT SCENES? Lastly, playing on a controller is a joke unless you map it out in a script, default control for acceleration is X button? Why not use R trigger like everyone else? I will never buy another EA game outside of consoles ever.
1204	Literally a waste of money. This is the WORST ever of Need for Speed game I have EVER played in my entire life. Truly, Absolutely Terrible. There are no words in any language to describe how terrible this game is. From the controls to the graphics, everything in this game is just BAD. This Game is IMPOSSIBLE.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you are really a die-hard-fan of Need for Speed serise. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
1205	I love this game on the Xbox 360 alot but i do not recomend it on pc i only paid 3 dollars for it and i still wish i had my money back, it has a lot of errors like it cant remember your graphics settings ever and it always resets the controls suck and you are better off with a controller and if you really want this game i recomend getting it on the Xbox or Ps3 its not a bad game it just sucks on the pc
1206	This is terrible for pc. The sliders don't even work when customizing your car. DO NOT BUY IT.
1207	Did not realize it was the older version of the game... serious bugs with Windows 10, wish I had my 10 dollars back lol.
1208	let down by the way the cars grip!
1209	DO NOT BUY. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
1210	Over dramatic motion blur, thin story line, and boring scenery. With all the other Need for Speed games out there, this one just seems like it was just put out to make money. There are many better racing games to enjoy.
1211	bought this game to race cars. it crashes in the intro sequence. â¥â¥â¥â¥ EA and â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
1212	Game is unoptimized
1213	Really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥?
1214	this game is completely broken. when u change the resolution it will not allow you to to change the settings. I have tried to set controls for a gamepad, mouse &amp; keyboard and even a PC racing wheel and all this game does is glitch on the control settings that you can not set them correctly. AVOID THE GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE because it is. Its really too bad I was looking forward to playing it. Guess I will have to get it for console and get a refund from steam.
1215	I bought this game by a mistake. I wanted to get Underground, but mixed up the titles (very confusing, there are like 20 different NFS games) ... I was not enjoying the first cutscene, i wanted to go into the options menu..   There is no way to skip the freakin cutscenes. damn EA, will you ever learn?  The police are way too annoying...  Graphics are ok, this is an old game.  Controls, well I am using a steering wheel, but the pedals won't work ...  The cars are nice, and they have a good physics feel...   I can't recommend. If i could skip the cutscenes, then maybe :)
1216	â¥â¥â¥â¥ ea â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ everything i paid 10$ for something that doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work because the game screen wont come on because of this shity port never buying a ea game again
1217	horrible you lose your car and your money and most cars that are common as hell are hard to get because one slight bad move and your â¥â¥â¥â¥ed
1218	â¥â¥â¥ this game. Worst game purchase ever. Bad physics and graphics. The gameplay is different from PS2 (I thought it is the same that's why I bought it). Don't buy this game.
1219	Graphics arent as good as they are shown
1220	Graphics suck
1221	Giving this a 5/10   The game feels short with no real challenge and Need for Speed most wanted was more challenging. I miss Need for speed underground where the real street racing is. The graphics is average and as well as game play with cars and upgrades/mods.  I do not recommend buying this game at normal price. Rather wait for the summer sale next time.   They need to bring out Need for Speed 2015 on PC for steam as well!
1222	POS! NO Menu! No mouse support! No keyboard control! Game starts out being chased by cops no control of car with ANY cxontroller!!!!!!! Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times same outcome. Other games work fine NFS of any kind will NOT RUN!!!!  Worst POS that EA has produced besides Shift which is another POS!!!!!!!!!!!!  EA is a POS!!
1223	+ is good - Is bad = Both?   This game is generally an okay racing game.  It is on the lower spectrum of the NFS series (But they are all really good games)  I'll go through some good and bad. I may be a little knit picky about some of these but they just really get to me and maybe a good amount of you.  But there is 1 major flaw that makes this game horrible and fills me with anger every time I see it. And it is quite common  +The racing is fun when you have compeition. You want to win.   +The cars have pretty good handeling. The are nice to drive.  =The story you will understand and will sometimes pick up, but most won't really care and will just get into the racing.  =The map is large and sometimes is okay to roam around in, but you don't get a feeling of exploration and wanting to travel the map like other NFS games made me feel. No sense of adventure  -You are fined WAY too much. You lose money for many things. It gets annoying.  -The soundtrack in my opinion is GOD AWFUL. It only fits to 2 music genres, Country and Hard Rock. If you don't like these genres sometimes it is hard to play hearing it in the background and the music is very unfitting at times. When I am in a tight position with a rival car racing close to the finish, the music plays a soft country tune. I don't like either genres so it feels bad to hear. Annoying.   -You LOSER MONEY for SPEEDING. This game is Need For Speed. You are ment to go fast. I know it is against the 'laws' in the game but you get fined for going fast and having fun. Speed is one of the soul points of the game. You get fined during races for speeding, too. I get so angry whenever I see that red light flash of SPEEDING -250. Other than thisd major flaw it is an overall decent racing game. Although I do not reccomend the game it is fun to try out and I suggest you buy it on sale. I got it for $2, so I won't be so harsh on it. But if you want a decent racer, play this if it is on sale.
1224	NFS Undercover is maybe the most casual, plain and simple game of all serial. To call it arcade... well, I remember arcades of 80's, so it is definitely not an arcade! It is very sub-arcade, in the terms of controls and the whole gameplay.  Yet I'm not so determined to absolutely NOT recommending that game. You see, that depends from where you are looking at the whole NFS bunch of games. If you are one with NFS Underground, you maybe found Undercover less colourful, but acceptable. Same goes with the fans preferring NFS Underground 2 the most. Now, the biggest group of fans, I know, love the Most Wanted. For them, Undercover will be quite bleak in terms of contest. The police there dumb and slooow, the contenders, for the most time, also not showing you any challenge.  Undercover has its own nice features, sure. First, the soundtrack. It's the best from the whole serial, I still have more than dozen tracks from there in my playlist. Second, the cars. There are quite a bunch of roaring road monsters for every taste, with the only downside that you should invest some time in the game to get to the sweetest ones. Third, Maggie Q. I'm not a fan of her, yet she certainly make the atmosphere a little less boring.  Still, it is not enough for me. You see, my favourite NFS is Porshe Unleashed, so I can certainly tell you from my biased point of view, that all driving in the Undercover is boring as Mr.Obama speeches. The physics of driving is under every level of comparison. Maybe it is similar to the driving in the Watch Dogs, but hardly better. I've played Undercover on the PSP platform, but even there I was not really engaged in the races. They were not attractive even on that tiny piece of hardware, and PSP is not rich with the racing games at all!  So, the only good thing I believe you can get from buying Undercover now is the little fraction of the same drive that gathered NFS so many fans with Underground and Most Wanted titles. So far you can't buy any of those great games on Steam, maybe you'll get desperate enough and go with the Undercover.  My mark is 5.8/10. If you try to look a little harder, you'll find so many better racing games on Steam, than that. Yeah, they won't be calling Need For Speed, so what?
1225	Very easy. Not for gamer into realizstic car games
1226	I Guess it's okay, but I sorta don't like this game's style. I would rather put the $9.99 spent on this game toward a better game.
1227	1st car, stock Nissan 240sx, can do a 90Â° tight corner at 140kmh...  That tells you a lot about the physics...  No comment...
1228	GAME IS GREAT BUT BUT STEAM VERSION SUCKSSSSSS YOU CAN PLAY MULTIPLAYER WITH YOUR FRIENDS BUT YOU CANT FIND OTHER PLAYERS TO PLAY NICE STEAM VERY NICE 5/10
1229	Just like every other NFS game, the AI cheats you non-stop. Get Burnout Paradise instead.
1230	I think it looks like gta san adreas but racing it's a ripoff
1231	No... Just.... No! ...save your money!
1232	I TOUGHT THIS WAS BETTER THAN NFS MW 2013. BUT â¥â¥â¥â¥ I'M WRONG. BYE BYE 2.49$   T_T
1233	It is not the same as the excellent PS2 version.
1234	only buy if you can deal with outdated graphics
1235	Shines more than Edward Cullen, has a LOT of glitches and bugs never patched by the developer, like many other EA products, If you like to throw your money in the trash, then you should buy THIS 'Edward Cullen simulator.'
1236	This is NOT game for WIN 7 or WIN 8 - this game is unplayable on this systems - do not buy
1237	If you want to get this because you loved it on ps2.. DONT.. you will be dissatisfied.. this port is bad.. everything changed.. races are different, cars are different, customization is horrible.. story's the same, mostly, they added a bit more dialog, but geez.. i loved it on ps2.
1238	this game is the worst pc port of all time. the graphics crash if you run on more than one processor and you can't change the controls for a usb controller. the nos was always on no matter what and there was nothing to change that. DONT BUY THIS GAME
1239	doesnt work. It crashes non stop =(
1240	No wonder why they closed down the studio... just the frame rate is horrible and it's a game issue... I miss Underground...
1241	This game is so suck . Noob graphic ! â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ ALSO â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING COMING TO â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ UP THE â¥â¥â¥â¥
1242	  Not the best
1243	So far this game sucks, cant even drive the car with just the controller or keyboard. The game is having issues and uses half keyboard and half gamepad. this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is awful, do not buy
1244	Very bad game. Stuck after 1 minute and always crash
1245	DOES NOT RUN ON WIDOWS 10!!! I bought the game because i played it on my old xbox 360 and it was my favorite game. So after it downloads it has me download some stuff (I've never heard of it before) then as i tried to play it, it crashes and i cant even get past the intro... dont waste your money if you have anything other than windows xp
1246	A game that attempted to be Most Wanted, but failed in nearly every regard.  It apes MW with an uncanny level of dedication, but somehow misses the fun-factor of MW.  Autosculpt is fun as always, the selection of cars is wonderful, graphics are decent, and music is fairly good.  The engine runs inexplicably heavy on hardware far above the recommended and always feels janky and imprecise.  Get it on a steep sale if you're itching for something that feels close to MW.
1247	I purchased NFS Undercover last week, and until there is a patch it is unplayable. When the opening screen starts, there are small words at the top for Menu and Options, but I am unable to click on them! I have a wonderful Logitech G27 Steering wheel, but the game refuses to recognize it since I am blocked from access to the Options screen for setting it up!   I am sure that once it is patched it will be very fun to play, but as of December 1, 2013 I find it to be dead in the water!  Groan!
1248	The creator of this game must be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1249	This game is trash, no online play at all.
1250	4/10 Utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. Worst game from the Series.
1251	This game doesn't work
1252	great example of all the ******* **** i hate with old games , cant skip cut scenes , some mirical cant use my controller, couldent be ****** to figure it out either
1253	This game gave me cancer. TL;DR: gives cancer

1255	Need for Speed: Undercover retains all bad qualities of previous NFS titles while abolishing everything that made NFS titles worth playing. The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awful cut-scenes are there, the hilariously ridiculous cars are all accounted for, and the god awful storyline is present as well. Whatâs missing is everything else, customization is severely lacking and unique/accurate car controls are missing. You can drive a Lamborghini and hit top speed with nitro, but a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Mercedes will still pass you. Thatâs how ridiculous the logic is in this game. This issue isnât much of a problem early game, but in the endgame you will most certainly lose every race because every A.I. has hacks that can beat your top speed with any car. This game is a âMost Wantedâ wannabe and is an insult to the NFS series.
1256	The absolute worst driving game I have ever played. Graphics aren't what makes the game, and that is the only improvment to the game versus previous ones in the NFS franchise. The story, the physics, the lighting, the races, the AI, EVERYTHING is terrible!  0.0013/1,000 (Bad)
1257	HORRIBLE. JUST HORRIBE. I downloaded the game and it said that it said ERROR, i figured out the problem and launched the game. when i did launch the game it wwas a complete glitch fest, NO WHEELS NO BUILDINGS NO ROAD just tje chassisi was driving around on an invisable platform, with a car that had no wheels. DO NOT buy this game
1258	the graphics so bad
1259	It's not the best game I've played but I don't think there anything good in this game. You just drive around look for some races and that's it! If your going to get this game you made a mistake!  3.5/10
1260	OMG, OMG... That twist at the end... Seriously, that Keyser Soze stuff from Usual Suspects, that`s kid`s play compared to this. Well... you know how it goes... Need for Speed - failing since 2006.
1261	What a stupid game

1265	Out of the 110+ games in my library, this is by far the worst. As a Need for Speed fan this game is a major dissapointment. The graphics consist of ludacrus amounts of bloom and motion blur. You cannot find an screen resolution that isn't 4:3. There is literally no physics engine. NFS Hot Pursuit 2, a game from 2002, is better in both of these departments. If you want an older NFS game like this one just buy Most Wanted 2005 or Carbon.
1266	Too much recommendations for this game. For 9 euro's not a very bad game, but not worthy of the NFS name. Not very great graphics, gameplay or AI. Bad acting and worse story.  
1267	Its the old version (1.0.0.1) without any supports, think about it.
1268	FULL RIP STEAM FUNDS - game does the intro and then after almost 15 seconds of driving you get to a police barricade and it has a cut scene and then the game crashes.
1269	terrible storyline, end is also abrupt. Graphics decent for its release period, but overall i would pick something more engaging and rewarding.

1271	Oh heck no this game isint good it looks like its just texures and stuff from FRAN FRAN FREAKING SICO. anyways i onlt plays for 3 minutes until it just got worse.
1272	Eh... It's pretty fun driving around and completing missions, upgrading cars, all that cool stuff! Buuuut then all the cop-chase nonsense is just plain frustrating and repetitive. Makes me wish I could enjoy the game without them, or even better, just get my $10 back... :/
1273	THIS GAME IS NOT HOW IT IS IN THE SCREENSHOTS. I initially bought it thinking that it was the same game as shown in the screenshots, but IT IS NOT. It is a very nice game overall, but it is not the shiny newer world or cars as the post leads you to believe.
1274	It hurts me to write a bad review about an NFS game, but this one (PC version only, PS2 version awesome) was obviously really crappy. Along with its bad graphics, and glitches , it won't even fix my monitor (while NFS:Most Wanted fits it fine). So, I opted for the refund. Sorry EA, should of got your ish together.
1275	Normally i would reccomend this game, since it really is one of the greater NFS, however it is near impossible to get it running on modern machines, i dont know if this is because of steam or something else, but it jut wont work. Which is a real shame, if you like fast and furious type games
1276	Will not load have reinstalled 3 times. What gives.... I used to like the NFS games and i dont remember playing this one i was going to get back into them again with the NFS 2015 but apparently i am unable to.
1277	Just don't buy this. Go buy Hot Pursuit or any other NFS game.
1278	in the start after i drived to the first blockade the game crashes
1279	It keeps crashing a lot
1280	The only problem that I experience is how every time the EULA page shows up and I read it (Sadly) Is how I try and get on to my save slots and it says 'Unable to load.'
1281	Its the old version (1.0.0.1) without any supports, think about it.
1282	I tried, believe me i TRIED to play this, but the story was so all over the place I had no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idea what was going on for hours. The customisation is slow due to the fact that the stickers move at a snails pace, and i had no idea where everything was.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS NEED FOR SPEED go and get NEED FOR SPEED CARBON instead, It is basically the same game, and it does it vastly better in terms of story, customization, and graphics. Even though the game isnt on steam I highly encourage to get it anyway.
1283	If you liked previous games in the series such as Most Wanted and Carbon, you probably won't like this one anywhere near as much. The free roam isn't all that enjoyable because the police are around every corner, making it very hard just to drive around having fun with it. The races are fairly easy. A 5 year old wouldn't have trouble with them. The game took me about 10 hours to complete my first run. Unless you're gonna be paying a very small amount for it, don't bother. You're probably better off with hot pursuit.
1284	Finishing the story was a giant pain in the â¥â¥â¥. The events were horribly unbalanced, you'd show up on the cops' radar for literally doing nothing, and the car selection is hilariously small compared to other NFS titles. If Need For Speed: World had a story mode, this is it, and we all know how unbalanced the events in that game were. But I will give EA props for one good thing: half the money for the same BS in other Need For Speed games. So as the master of disapproving, I disapprove of this game.
1285	Shity story that is 0 % intresting and way 2 short, LOVE the gameplay and the cars ... but to little cars .. and no customsion on the cars. Hope 4 a story like the NFS carbon or the first NFS Most Wanted. the perfect nfs games
1286	Does not work. Error here, error there.... 10/10 can't go past the 'creating new profile' screen.
1287	-Get WinDSPro and open Dolphin. -Download a NFS Undercover iso for Wii. -Open it with Dolphin. -Enjoy a Need For Speed Undercover that is 300 times better than this one, and runs on Most Wanted's engine. Oh, and Autosculpt.
1288	The only problem that I experience is how every time the EULA page shows up and I read it (Sadly) Is how I try and get on to my save slots and it says 'Unable to load.'
1289	Terrible handling, Too much bloom its effing ugly.
1290	Crashes to damn many times and it's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to adjust the setting to even make it playable.
1291	Too much recommendations for this game. For 9 euro's not a very bad game, but not worthy of the NFS name. Not very great graphics, gameplay or AI. Bad acting and worse story.  
1292	For the year that this game came out, I guess you could say that it was okay. The car customization is pretty cool, but that's about it. The map doesn't really change, and after about 5 hours you've seen all the game has to offer. Missions, Cutscenes, basically everything. The story isn't even very good, the cutscenes are like 9 seconds long and look like they was done in one take with like 2K available cash for the scenes. Wouldn't but this game unless it was on sale for like 2$.

1304	dont get me wrong i love need for speed really i do  but need for speed undercover is a different thing   i couldnt enjoy the game because of the bad controls it just didnt feel like need for speed wich caused me to instaquit this game to never touch again (well perhaps if i am bored and need a reminder that there are worse game's that what i just played)
1305	+ Car customization + Speedbreaker mechanic (needs buffs)  - No Steam Overlay support - No fullscreen resolutions (I hope you like letterboxes) - No windowed mode - Excessive post-processing (blur, bloom, filters..) - Traffic is very wonky and leads to much frustration - Difficulty spikes throughout the campaign - Side missions must be completed to continue the story - Police rubberbands, escaping them is frustrating, and their role in certain events is annoying - Driving feels awful
1306	Not the best Need For Speed I've played. Car customization sucks in comparison to the older Need for Speeds (Underground 1+2, Most Wanted, and Carbon are way better). Story mode is kinda lacking and the cutscenes are cheesy. If it's on sale, then its kinda fun for wasting time. If it's more than 3 bucks though, its not worth it. Biggest complaint is that the game, for me, doesn't always quit properly and will run as a back ground task (hence the stupidly high play time on record).
1307	I bought this game, having played the outstanding 2012 most wanted. I thought it would be just as impressive. it wasn't. the police pursuits are short and boring, the money system is broken and the graphics are awful considering this is labelled as a 2013 game( although it was made in 2008). the trailers are a lie: you do not have a big task, you just compete in boring races. the mechanics are awful. if you want to waste 10 pounds on this game then go ahead, but be warned: its not what you think it is!
1308	Think the alternate version of Mario Kart for PC. This is a fast paced, balanced game which has alot of different game modes (stunts, traditional racing, sports, arcade). You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers. Hours of pure and legit fun.
1309	Good game! Nice game! Bombastic game!  This game is for lovers of kart racing! I played this game for 32 hours and I enjoy it maximally!   +: +Graphic. Yes, is not difficult! (+2 points) +Size..

You dont need to wait for real gamers. (+2 points) +Nice power ups! (+2 points)  -: -The community is dead. (-1.5 points)  8.5 points for this game! BUY IT! If you agree with me rate!
1310	I first played this game back in 2010 free weekend offer.... I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c itâs worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....
1311	Classic kart game, with races, football, hockey, basketball, touchdown, sumo and more. A blast to play with friends.
1312	The physics are terrible and the multiplayer is dead but this is a fun game to mess around in if you have friends to play with. For a low budget game it has a bit of variety. Its offers racer customization, a stunt mode, and goal mode which is similiar but is done better in rocket league.
1313	The Extreme Paintbrawl of kart-racers. You're stuck with the AI since the community (rightfully) died and said AI can be gamed to always lose if you just hit escape and go into the menu. They begin running directly forward and never changing direction.  Custom servers also a crapshoot - it refused to let me play another mode/level than 'Punchbowl' and 'tag' no matter what I set it to.  I didn't really think people needed to be warned away but damnit, if I'm gonna play this for a bit, I'm gonna write about it too.
1314	Zero people play Zero Gear, taking a lot of the fun out of it...but it's still worth it if you find it on sale.
1315	Really fun to play with friends 8/10
1316	This game is really good. Yet no servers are ever open. Why.
1317	Reminds you of the good old mario kart. I suggest you get it while it's still 0.99â¬
1318	What a rubbish game. Level design is repetitive. Cutomisation is limited. Controls are horrible. Camera angle, horrible.   And yet, I love it.
1319	Very nice kart racing game on steam, a la mario kart. 9/10 game just needs more players, but still fun with friends....
1320	Fun game, I enjoyed playing it for awhile. Reminded me of Mario Kart 64's Battle Mode a bit.
1321	You can make a PANDA in a PINK TANK here. Nuff said. 20/10  And seriously. This is kind of game that can be really fun if you've got friends to play it with. Good time killer. Good for having silly fun.  It has some disatvantages of course. Some may complain about physics and some other stuff. No game is prefect. And this one really isn't expensive.  Remember; You can make any game fun with right attitude! .... And friends if possible,  ~ D.Punk
1322	Quite fun, too bad no one plays it.
1323	I recommend this game, but there are a few bad things to mention: 1.) There's rarely any servers. 2.) If you play with friends, and host your own server, there might be major server lag. 3.) I think it's been abandoned by the devs, so basically your going to get what you get, and you can't throw a fit.  Some upsides: 1.) There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag. 2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.  It's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with. I think this game is definitely worth the $5.
1324	Mario who? A TRUE MASTERPIECE, don't let my 3 hours on this game trick you into thinking I did not like this game, I literally had to stop because I couldn't handle the girth of content that this game has to offer.
1325	it's only fun with friends guys buy it best game 111/11 :D &lt;333
1326	Since i started to play the football mode in this game i've never touched Rocket League again.  4/20
1327	'â¥â¥â¥â¥ this Game' I give it 10/10
1328	Kinda fun. But noone plays mp lol.
1329	pretty awesome. wish all my friends played
1330	Most offroad racing games have you racing around a relatively smooth dirt track that maybe has a few jumps. This game has some tracks like that, but where it really shines is when the smooth track ends at a huge pile of rocks and the only way forward is up and over.  You have quite a bit of control over the vehicle with the ability to use lockers, adjust air pressure, switch between high and low gear ranges and a winch. Knowing how and when to use these systems is essential to finishing most of the tracks, thankfully a tutorial is provided. The graphics and climbing physics are impressive and there is a nice selection of vehicles, although a little more customization would be appreciated.  This game has some fairly significant issues however. The driving model works quite well at low speeds (including simulating how easy it is to get stuck in deep mud) but breaks down at higher speeds on the smooth sections of the track where the vehicle has no sense of weight and slides and bounces around unrealistically. When you do get stuck without a nearby tree to use as a winch anchor, the lack of a reset button means you have to restart the race which can be extremely frustrating with the length of some of the events. The game does at least reset you if you roll the vehicle or fall off the track.   In all the events you're racing a ghost ai which often feels cheaty when it effortlessly floats over a mud pit that you're stuck in up to your axles or hovers over broken rocks that hang you up at every turn. When it's not cheating it's not particularly smart and is relatively easy to beat.  Unlike most offroad games, there is no free roam mode. The tracks are very detailed with lots of interesting obstacles, but you're confined to a relatively narrow corridor that resets you back on the track if you stray outside the boundaries. Sometimes these boundaries aren't very clear so you'll miss a turn and end up off the track with a time penalty. At least you have the option to set up an empty multiplayer server and drive around the tracks by yourself to better learn them and to test out the vehicles. I haven't found anyone else who has this game to test out multiplayer with so I can't comment on how well that works.  For awhile this game appeared to have been abandoned with the devs being MIA but a recent update just a few days ago added additional language support so there is hope again that some of these issues will be fixed.  Despite all these issues, I still had a lot of fun simply because there aren't many games that actually simulate low speed rock crawling and scrambling (besides possibly spintires which I'm waiting for a good sale on). I can hesitantly recommend this game as long as you can live with the issues and you can find it on sale, with the number of unresolved issues I wouldn't be able to recommend it at the full asking price.  Pros: graphics track design rock crawling  Cons: cheaty ai poor vehicle handing at speed no way to get unstuck without restarting race no free roam  7/10
1331	This game is not for your average arcade racer fans. This is for people who know and understand what lockers are, what high and low 4wheel drive is for and what tire pressure effects when in the mudd or rock crawling.  Off-roading is a blast and this game did a decent job capturing it. The only complaint I can think of is that it does not have a freeroam to explore an area and just create your own path through the map.  For a off-road sim, this is a good one.
1332	This game is excellent if you are familiar with the concepts of 4x4. Realistic physics, good controls, and a lot of fun if you are into simulation games. It runs on the Unreal engine so the graphics are decent as well. The only complaint i have is there is no free roam, which is disapointing. still definitely recommend the game.
1333	Not the best and not the worst, it provides a fun off-road experiance for a low price, it is annoying to get stuck in one spot and you lose the whole race because of it, it is also hard to level up (get more ratings) Also the multiplayer does not work and there is no free roam mode. 6.5/10
1334	i Love this game, this is by far the best off road game i have every played. Graphics Are great but could do some fixing. i Love Being able to get in the mud and dig and sling mud adding more to that would be fantastic considering once you hit a certain point in the mud you don't go down any farther and stop slinging mud. The biggest improvement by far to this game would to add a free roam in Different countries and sceneries
1335	Very good game .very differnt style off racing,nice sim of off roading,multiplayer seems not to work but coulld just be me .TBH not worth the price on steam but a great game if you can get for Â£5 or in a bundle. IMO 7/10
1336	'kin 'ell. If only there were more games like this. It's more colouful than Spintires.
1337	Free roam would complete this game.
1338	  Finally a true 4x4 game. iam stuck oh no not again. diff on tires de flated low range still stuck. try the winch. ok getting there . use your power correctly dont rev too high too get though obstacles. make sure you have the rigfht tires. For the price highly recomended. this is 4x4 time trails. not some arcade 4x4 racing game. love it
1339	Pros: 1. Complete and realistic off-road vehicle simulation. 2. 4WD Hi/Lo Range, Triple diff locks, 2WD/4WD, adjustable tyre pressure 3. Terrain is realistic.  Cons: 1. Does not save keyboard key preferences (need to readjust it everytime I start playing.
1340	I normally love this genre of driving game and was excited to see it go on sale, so I bought it. Weeellll, the external views are bugged as in do not work...at all. I uninstalled/reinstalled and no luck, I even tried a wired controller and still no luck. I played it as long as I did only because I somehow thought that always using the internal view would be bearable. Sadly this isn't the case. Do not buy.
1341	This game is not fun. I have played other offroad simulators, my favorite being Screamer 4x4. That game is more than 10 years old, and it's still much more fun than this one.  Off-Road drive does have some merits: -nice graphics (but nothing jaw-dropping) -all the standard off-road tools (differentials, winch...) - terrain deformation  However, there are a lot of negative elements, which take away from the fun: - no free roam mode - limited gameplay modes - time penalty for ridiculously placed posts - so game feels like a 'keep on the track simulator' - no real cars  I still play it occasionally, but only because there aren't that many other off-road sims.
1342	the worst game ever
1343	As an avid 4x4 enthusiest and mechanic by trade, I can appreciate where they were going with this game. Unfortunately it lacks the things which would make this game great. Not near enough customization/upgrades, no open world co-op trail runs.   It's still the best attempt at an actual off-road game I've seen, yet it just seems it got forgotten when it could have been epic.
1344	dislikes:more than once the game has deleted my career on its own accord, controls keep resetting to keyboard instead of 360 controller as i set it. hints incorrect they tell you the wrong buttons.  Likes: its a good 4x4 sim if only they made it right!!!!!!!  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE 
1345	really enjoyed this game, top marks :)
1346	This is seriously the best offroad simulation game there is.
1347	Good truck reaction over mud etc. It's a good purchase if around 5$ because this game will soon outdated (even though it's unique!).
1348	1c is a shady company that publishes games then abandons them. Inquerys go unanswered and bugs go unpatched. I will be avoiding this publisher in the future.
1349	this is a good game
1350	I reccomend this game if you like mud, trucks, water, and off road racing. The controls on this game is probaly the only con for me..... I am so used to the classic, 'w s a d'. But once you get used to those arrow key controls, your good to go.  Good game, but be sure you have a good computer that will run it. My computer will run anything, if yours isn't good with running those stunning graphics, don't even try it.
1351	A fellows, really love the game. My son turned me on to this game and I have enoyed it ever since. It comes close to the real thing for me since I lost my abilty to drive in the real world. I was wondering if you all could make it larger were it could have multiple players roaming around the desert using GPS and then come back to camp. The racing is cool I have a YJ Jeep and like what you all have done to make this as realistic when climping up rocks bolders and going through water. lots of fun.  Thank You Very much. Flyin Hawaiian out 
1352	aweful, dont bother
1353	Tracks are pretty unique and the gameplay is pretty in depth compared to my few years of off-roading. Great detail with the terrain and the dirt and mud that gets on the trucks. Intersting challenges throughout all of the different locations from rocks and boulders to mud pits and swamps. The supsension can get a little over bouncy depending on the class of truck you use and the vehicles do drop power on some of the obstacles, but overall i think it's a fun game to just go mess around on
1354	This is the greatest game I've ever played. I got this awesome game for a $1.74, if I knew about this game before I would have been glad to pay full price! If you know anything about offroading then you will love it, if not you probably won't like it!
1355	I have nothing but good things to say about this game. I come from a long history of off roading games. The greatest offroad game I have come across was the Cabelas 4x4 Offroad series. That was for the older, windows 98-XP system. I have played several others such as Spin Tires (incomplete), and none have come close to the Cabelas series. Then I saw this on youtube. When I saw it come onto greenlight I was anxiouse for it to be green lit, and I was super happy when it went on sale. I regret nothing of my purchase. Ill give you a nice thorough pros/cons list of what I look for in offroading My list will definatly be disputable.  PROS AMAZING physics. Truck mechanics (4x4, diffrentials, different tires etc) are the best I have ever seen. Ground deformation is only put where it is needed, thus reducing any lag and making the game easier to run. The deformation that is there, is beautiful Great truck selection Levels are realistic to professional offroad raceing courses Special tracks (mud bogs, rock climbs) test your skills of the extremes Nice tutorial. Gives you a good experience of what you're in for. Ghost truck and place indicator really add suspence, and give you a sense of competition to race against. Some times the place indicator is innacurate, and when it says you're in 4th, you could win in 1st by a fraction of a second.  CONS (most are very minor) Multiplayer and mods do not look promising to me at this point.  Not much for soft body physics. But really, it isnt needed and would just make the game more taxing. You cant add accessories to the truck (light racks, bully bars, roll cages etc.) Its only raceing - theres no checkpoint driving or free rome, but I have not found this to be much of a let down. The racing ROCKS. Trucks do not have limited fuel. No 'super bogger' trucks, or hard core mud bog/mud run tracks to use them on. Engine sounds arent the greatest in all trucks.   In short, do I recomend this game? Hell yes. Solid 9/10. Good job to everybody who worked on it, and thank you for making this beast game.  EDIT Since I wrote this review I have noticed that the public opinion has gone down. If you ask me, people are picking on it to much and cant deal with a few problems from the big picture. For $10, what did you expect? Of course there are some problems. One thing I saw was that there are to many obstacles. Guess what? Thats what pro offroading is about. Obstacels, and lots of them.   If the game is on sale, it is definatly worth it. If you are trying to dicide between this and saving for a better game, I would save for a better game. But, I still love it and recomend it.
1356	fun if your r in to cars and like mud and offroading
1357	4/5 good game just a few issues with some bugs, wheels getting stuck in logs/rocks and some button mapping problems but apart from that this is a real good off road game. Challenging fast paced and fun, ranging from wading through rivers and swamps to rock climbing steep cliffs the game boasts pretty good physics, not a sim but a fun game non the less.
1358	great game, nice to see this part of the off road world represented in a true to life genuine way.
1359	Excellant direction with this game allowing user to focus on driving skill instead of how fast u can drive and still control the vehicle. If you like challenge rather then GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN then this is a great alternative game. Just began playing but decided to give review already since nice to see this change of gameplay. As of now I give it 8/10 and if I am able to connect a wheel for driving (nice you can already assign your own keyboard controls so dont have to use arrow keys) and variety of upgrades like better differntials, brakes, etc then I will increase rating. GREAT GAME!
1360	In the 15 Minutes I tried it out, I had more fun with Off-Road Drive than with Spintires.  
1361	Off-Road Drive is 5/10 stars.
1362	good game but needs free drive
1363	the best game!
1364	this game is one of the best off road games iv ever played :)
1365	The camera controls are bogus. The winch controls are frustrating. Many of the races require specific vehicle/setups to complete the course, much less win the race.  But when things line up just right, this game is an absolute blast. Well worth the entry fee.  If using a G27, I recommend using the auto-center option at 10% in the Logitech controller manager.
1366	one of the best games to my opinion on steam buy this it will do you good
1367	I feel totally ripped off. Waste of my time and cash.Controls suck.Learning curve silly.Worst pc gaming experience to date.
1368	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, buy spintires instead...
1369	I have played this game for an hour. I still have not been able to map all the controls properly. I am using an afterglow controller for 360 (same software as 360). I will get all of the controls mapped the way i want, go into the game, then one of the controls will become randomly unassigned. So i cant even win the first race. I guess ill try keyboard and mouse, but i'm kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the moment.
1370	Weird game Weird controlls  Weird all the way  I seriously cannot see anything good about this game.
1371	Definetly should not be called a simulation 1/10 cause their is a lot of different trucks. Very very weak would like refund.
1372	this game is unplayable because of lag ingame.
1373	I play 5 minutes and got so frustrated on how bad the controllers were when playing with mouse and KB. I got stuck every where. Very poor porting from console. I do not recommend this game at all. Im happy I didnt buy it and got it in a bundle because I would never drop 10$ for this
1374	more proof that pretty doesn't mean good. If someone could make screamer 4x4 look like this but play just how it does now, it would be awesome. not as good as spintires but still pretty good... not fun, well not if you're expecting an off road sim
1375	Got this for $0.75, it's not even worth that.
1376	most best off road game ever just needs free drive
1377	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game lives to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over
1378	Too many things to deal with for a controler, way to sensitive to drive with keyboard. If I want to play a 4x4 game in the mud &amp; rock I dont want to take an hour or so trying to get a system working in order to play... it needed an Arcade mode, or buildup of controls. not being able to get thru the tutorial in 20 min is too much Simulater for this mudlover.  Then again if you like to play with your axle a LOT...
1379	Looks nice, but I'm not playing it without my T500 wheel and I can't get it working. Tried everything I can think of/Google, but no luck to date.
1380	the graphics on this game are awful you lose to everyone because it it is such bad graphics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1381	can't get it to work.!!!
1382	This is the MOST realistic off road driving simulator ever, from changing tire pressure, to the differentials on axles. Being a driving game means you steer and are driving with some button, on top of that some options such as changing differentials or activating 4x4 drive, require holding a modifer button and an activation button. Thats steering, driving, two buttons to change something, all at the same time. This isnt off road driving, its Octopus driving. This game is rated O for octopuses, Ha, never thought I would see that!!!   Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00
1383	M'aiq thought Spintires was bad; it still is, but this is worse.
1384	YouÃ¨ll have abetter chance at winning the lottery that getting past the tutorial. But on the other hand, what do you expect from the same company that made rig n roll just a year before this?
1385	***
1386	Squandered..
1387	The crappiest game ever made
1388	Although the game appears to be dead from a development viewpoint, I'm still writing this.  There are a few things that need reworked in the game; Object boundaries are pretty shoddily done, the respawn system is pretty infuriating, vehicle handling, and the vehicles ability to turn their wheels.  First, object boundaries, its pretty obvious when you're in rocks that the boundaries of the vehicles and the rocks are pretty lax. By this, I mean the game will register that the object are colliding when on screen they aren't. This will make taking a particular line difficult, its pretty infuriating when you should be able to make it up a ledge but the game won't let you. I can tell that this was done to ease the work needed in programming and less processing to do client-side, it would be nice to see it refined, however. This also ties into #5, vehicles ability to turn their wheels, more when I get there, though.  Respawn system, the forced respawn is rather annoying, there have been countless times when I was forcibly respawned even though I wasn't in the situation it was telling me I was. I think forced respawn should be removed and a 'You appear to be stuck, would you like a penalty-free respawn?' should be in its place. There's just no excuses for the respawn, something like that should have been fixed long ago.  Vehicle handling is another spot that I can had corners cut to ease the work on the devs. When vehicle handling is lower, the vehicle isn't harder to handle, it simply won't respond to inputs as well. Yes, this is essentially the same thing, however its not. When handling is low, the vehicle simply refuses to do what you're telling it to do, IE. solid ground, full lock steering, and going 4 KPH the vehicle should turn very sharply, there is no reason for it not to, however it simply refuses to turn due to the handling mechanisms in the game.   Torque, this is kinda in with the traction mechanisms of the game, low gear isn't as powerful as it should be. In most 4-wheel drive vehicles 4-low is almost unstoppable, however in the game the vehicles get bogged down far too easily. The vehicle get far too much 'traction' this is tied in with the object boundaries being lax.  (Un)fortunately, this is the only game that I have found that fills this genre (Hardcore Offroad Racing), so I would have to say its the best one like it. I would recommend it because it isn't a horrible game, it just needs work to refine it.   
1389	Dont get it unless they make a free drive cause it not what it looks like if u dont come 1st or 2nd u have to start all over again....... looked good on YouTube but i got to say its not worth ur money unless they make a place where u can do your own thing.......
1390	yo recommended best 4x4 out there atm
1391	This game lived up to my expectations and then some!
1392	Better than I expected, as good as spintires
1393	A good game with great 4x4 mechanics and simulation. It is very race oriented, but will allow you to drive in trial races which reward you based on climbing over things rather than going as fast as possible. The camera views are decent. The view from inside the trucks seems extremely realistic. You have a limited amount of tuning options - suspension and ride height and tire selection. These values do make a difference in-game. While driving, you can select your gear, clutch is an option, you can use a winch, tire pressure is adjustable on the fly and you can enable 4 wheel drive as well as separately lock center diff and axle diffs. Overall - 6/10 for a racing game, but 10/10 for an offroad simulation game.
1394	Was Really Looking For A More Calm Exploration Base Game As Opposed To The Timed Races And Panic Enduncing Races This Game Consists Of. If Only There Was A Free Roam Mode...
1395	the do't work
1396	Seems like they forgot about this game since they never update it or add content
1397	the concept of this game is very cool. the vehicles look awesome but with the collision between the vehicle bodies and the ground, i can't recommend this game.
1398	looks good, and graphics are not to bad but overall this game sucks, would not recommend to anyone,
1399	Fantastic for people who like Sims. Terrible if your looking for an arcade game!
1400	yet another dissapointment from this developer the game wouldnt be half bad but there controlls are always jacked up no matter what game they make i dont think i will purchase anything they make ever again... couldnt even use controller every race it would forget the buttons and i would have to reprogram its like there games are always incomplete or broken or never had debugging done or something..trash..
1401	It is fun, but please be weary if you have a less than optimal pc for gaming. The minimum system requirements, in my opinion, do not reflect enjoyable or smooth gameplay or framerates. Yes, techincally you can run it with just about any laptop or old pc, but it is not a pleasant experience.
1402	cant get cd key to play onlne.
1403	vey fun and good game 
1404	*Launches game*  *falls asleep after 10mins*  48/100
1405	Not sure what to say. These guys got the right idea. Nobody to this day has still made a really good intense offroad game for pc that i know of. And im sure if there was it would sell many copies. Please make again but put some effort in this time. This off road drive is glitchy, has poor graphics and hard to see where your going because of the camers setup. But this game still has some kool features like diff lock, four by, winch, tire pressure adjustment ect.
1406	its bad i want a refund 
1407	your stupid preset mouse keyboard â¥â¥â¥â¥ when im trying to get my steering wheel to be preset askes me to set up controls i do so but then STILL LEAVES THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE AS PRESET I CANT CHANGE IT â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!!!!!! SORT YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥ CUNT
1408	Lets pretend to be rock bouncers in austrialian styled adventure rigs.
1409	Thumbs up!  -editable review- I mistakenly figured this game was mediocre at best but then simply viewed the trailer, y'know the one that mixes real video with game footage, and I thought to myself of how well made and of high quality that was made. Easily this game could be lost among the so many other off-road/racing/muthatruckers that have been released and fallen either into obscurity or electro-plated for every successive generation until it gets cancelled to let the latest driving/riding/racing/combat trend blaze it's own trail into the aforementioned obscurity.   Is it simulation? I believe so but a simulation that is easily digestible, with corners cut realistically to - play. The vehicle roster is fanatsy based in reality, meaning the trucks are patterned off of real life counterparts only lacking the liscences to use their names.   As far as tracks go, and they sometimes go far, and sometimes don't go anywhere fast due to rugged terrain, are based upon reality and there is no need to trademark dirt, mud and water. The mud will bog you down more than deep water. You will skid along twisting dirt roads deep in the jungle. Climb vertically over rock precipices. Scramble upon rocks jutting out from deeper waters. Each country has a plethora of tracks to race against the clock and other rider's time and are wating to be unlocked along with vehicles.  Offroad Drive's gameplay can cater to the casual driver - meaning you can get through most tracks not using the tools at your disposal such as onboard tire pressure control, locking and unlocking differentials, 4 wheel drive etc. , allowing the player to enjoy the scenery and bumpy ride at the cost of finishing near the rear of the pack. For the enthusiast it is recomended to fasten your seat belts, because there is much challenge and learning of the tracks and modification for integration of utilization of skills per individual track, that only the most harcore could fathom gaining 1st place in every track with every vehicle. Basically this equals to much practice.  +first person with head on a swivel +detailed graphics all around +simple as you would prefer +complex as you could imagine +overtly deep means it really is a genuinely well made experience  -NO FREE ROAM (stay on or near track or be penalized and teleported within 5 seconds) -Does multiplayer even work and what would be the purpose if it did, you only race against the clock and ghost truck  If you believe that this is a standard arcade racer - that is fine - it will give you a glimpse of reality with its flexible controls (use what you want, sometimes a hitch is necassary). The detail is abundant in the environment such as the dust can almost be tasted during the hotter regions and the plunges into the creekbeds feel almost refreshing. The mud actually washes off of your vehicle when plowing through water. The trucks will flip over but not often and there is no explosions or machines breaking down that I saw exception like my windshield smashed out once and parts may fall off of the truck, but it is pretty much a vehicular goreless game. The only thing that ever stopped me was meandering into too deep water and something about my exhaust getting flooded.  There is an incredible depth to the simulation aspects of this title. With many ways to overcome obstacles- such as simply finding another route around, power-winching over it, depressurizing tires to soften your friction, plus more. Therefore each track COULD be mastered by finding what works best with what accessory or truck in the turbulent and primal landscape. And if you don't do it correctly or turn at a point just a little early/late, then possibly it will warrant a restart.  I have not yet gained enough hours into this title, but felt that it deserved a solid thumps up, positive review to let other gamers in the know.
1410	try this game it is so fun
1411	The gameidea is great, but I'm disapointed that Logitech G27 is not suported
1412	Game Is good, not the best but it is good for gameplay and graphics.
1413	this is a good offroad game. the problem is its to easy once you have figured out the correct vehicle to use and the setup its easy. each track has a certain vehicle you use. do not worry about the ghost car. as long as you do good on the course you can still take first. the rockcrawl if done right does not take a winch. you do need the keyboard along with the xbox controller if you suck at this game do not blame the developers blame yourself this game is to easy but alot fun.
1414	With such great potential Off-Road Drive felt like it was going to be one of the best off-roading games ever, only one let down. No multiplayer at all. Contrary to the official website this game features a multiplayer section that fails to work. I even downloaded and used Hamachi &amp; Tunngle with a friend and still no online co-op play. With such potential it is extremely sad that the makers have failed with this game. I only hope that a patch is released to fix this massive issue!  [UPDATE]  Since I last posted this review back on the 28th of December 2012 I have since then found a fix to be able to play multiplayer/co-op with a friend in Off-Road Drive. If you are reading this and you would like to know the fix just message me.
1415	how the heck would i know how i like it tried everything under the sun i cant get passed the first race :( 
1416	decent racing game kinda wish you could upgrade the vehicles. Other than that great mud physics for getting stuck unless your driving one of the good offroading vehicles. Very challenging requires quickness and skill. I found the game to be very good, because of the graphics and the unreal engine.
1417	Off-Road Drive is a must have for the 4x4 rock crawling enthusiast. This is a hidden gem. The graphics and physics are very good, the immersion is superb, you really feel like you're bobbling around in a 4x4 on horrible terrain. It has a good cockpit driving view and excellent free camera as well as all the usual other views. The systems modeling is extensive and you get 20 vehicles and a lot of maps from around the world. The game seems to come with an editor in there somewhere, and can be further modded with the Unreal3 SDK tools which you can download for free. This is one of the real bargains on Steam. If you like off road driving, buy it! This is a great game and highly recommended!
1418	Pretty decent game. The controls on the tutorial section of the game are all messed up though. It says press one thing and it's the complete opposite. I've not played much due to poor control system. It looked like the game had real promise. So I can only rate what I have seen, which means it's not gonna come out very high.  3/10!
1419	Great game and the first game i got my dad to play on a computer so thumbs up all the way.
1420	You have to use the differential, the winch, have to change the tire pressure. Pretty well made. Some issue with the XBOX360 controller - it shows patterns likd DPAD right+shift....where I cannot figure out what that shift is. Graphics are nice, some minor glitches. Overall a fun game that is underrated (possibly because itÂ´s not an easy racing game).
1421	I got this game for a few dollars but I wouldn't pay 10 for it.
1422	i meet recomended system requirements and its so laggy i cant play it so i want a refund
1423	Great graphics for a 5 years old game. Gameplay is ok but this shouldnt be a standart racing game.
1424	I got this game hoping it was as easy to play as the trailers showed, but even if i took the same line as in the trailer, I got stuck and had to winch out, then got a penalty for no reason. The game also crashed when I had another tab open.
1425	Couldn't even make it past the tutorial because it stopped giving me proper instructions half way through. Also, what sort of Xbox 360 controller control scheme makes you push Shift on your keyboard plus another key on the controller to accomplish something?
1426	Whoever decided to design this game has clearly never been to a wheelin\' competition. The times set by the computer are a little ridiculous. The vehilcles power are not even close to how they perform in real life. This game feels like they got pretty close to being perfect and called it quits. And why no sandbox mode or a least a practice option to where you can just slowly crawl your way through a track for fun. Even in the start up video there is a vehicle slowly crawling it\'s way through a course, but not once in this game will you be able to have that pace if you want to win. Would I recomend this game? Maybe if it was free, but it needs some more work, and it appears the only thing the developers are worried about it how many languages it has.
1427	A good offroad game. Very detailed.
1428	this is best car adventure game   https://youtu.be/dvjUXbKhQ_0 
1429	started playing and it was fun but once I tried to play multiplayer it asks for a key and I cannot figure it out. All of the forms and support say it is not needed but everything I put in does not work and I can't even get into the settings. They should not advertise it as multiplayer if they are not going to update the game.
1430	Im not sure why there is negative feedback on this game. It is pretty much the only game that has the actual feel of 4wd. Its really nice having the option to lock differentials, switch to 4Hi and 4LO. Deflate Tire pressure even! Even using a winch. The only thing its missing to make it more desirable is the option for a free roam, if we could drive through the whole area, ponds, lakes, mud, snow maybe!? This would be 10/10 but I will say its 6/10 for gameplay and 10/10 for having the true 4WD experience. I wish there was more than just racing but I do love all of the true 4WD system options. That is amazing. Oh PS, Im using the Xbox One controller and after looking at the buttons, use RB for modifier. It works amazing!
1431	Make no mistake this game is bad. Very bad. But I'll tell you one thing - I've enjoyed it more than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.
1432	This one is not as bad as many people say. It has it's flaws like any of the PC Flatout games. I think it's still quite fun.
1433	it wasn't worth the weight.
1434	I highly recommend this game! 10/10
1435	A time honored classic that redefined the way we look on racing simulators; This serie is one, if not THE first that effectively used detailed damage to cars and their components.  Don't expect a lot from the 3rd installment though, as far as I can tell its FlatOut 2 with better graphics only; The track are the same, the vehicles are the same...even the other drivers are the same...  Also don't expect guns or other forms of weapons though; Its not Death Rally or any of the Interstate series.
1436	This game gets so much hate. Yea, it's not the best of the Flatout series, but so what? It's still a fun fast-paced arcade racer. The controls aren't perfect, the music isn't has good has 2, and the graphics are somewhat ugly, but that doesn't take away that it's fun to play once in a while. Using a keyboard for controls is an absolute nightmare, but then again (IMO) using a keyboard for any racer is a bad idea. Use an Xbox360 controller or you'll have zero chance. I only played a little bit of it, but the little bit I did was fun. At least to me. I don't play many racers and really only truly enjoyed Forza 3 on 360, but this was good to me. I find the entire series fun. It's like burnout or NCG. Stop your whining that it's different. Isn't that how developers learn what to do about games?
1437	I recommend this game because has great graphics, its sometimes very funny and and amazing crashes
1438	NEVER BUY this 'game', arcade conversion from console, nothing like FLATOUT or FLATOUT 2 :(
1439	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1440	It's not like Flatout, Flatout 2 or Flatout UC in any way, but it's great fun and a good challenge.
1441	This game is absolutely awful. It completely ruins the entire FlatOut series, and it sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1442	This game isn`t really a Flatout game i must admit. But it`s not bad! There came a few patches and its a really good arcade racer now. It has many cars and maps to drive and unlock and there are many modes like stuntman, races, party modes like monstertruck and a zombie mode.   Technically it works fine for me on very high settings (GTX 660). It has not as good graphics as Flatout Ultimate Carnage but its ok. It did crash sometimes for me but that stopped in the last time.  The AI seems to be stupid but that really hurts mostly in Destruction Derbys. In Destruction Derbys all AI drivers `hunt` the player. That`s annoying.   So the massive 24 player destruction derbys are good for multiplayer but there`s no one online.  In total Flatout 3 is a good arcade racer that doesn`t need good skills so it`s perfect for playing once or twice a week. 30 $ is too much for this game so get it on a sale.
1443	it did not live to its brothers flatout 1,2 and uc in graphics and storyline it was just terrible 
1444	I recommend this game to anyone who wishes to find out what an N64 game would be like with modern day graphics. Actually, they aren't even modern, they're pretty bad too. Also if you wish to torture yourself, you may enjoy this game.  Otherwise... this game is an atrocity and should never have been called 'Flatout'. Save your money and don't buy this - even at $1 it isn't worth it.
1445	Great game, highly recommended!
1446	Great to play with a bunch of friends.
1447	agreed serious guys yes its not bugbear flatout soo wat if u play the game and it runs witch it did on a 2.6 dual core w/ 730gt and 4gb ram on my crap computer then it should run for you if u are going to compare it to its predicessors u WILL be UPSET if ur just looking for a fun racing game to play then play it ur reading this its got tons of game modes half â¥â¥â¥ junk charecters and a good handfull of tracks and it can be chaotic good luck in derby they all want u haha but serious like i said above just lookin for a racing game to play pick up the flatout bundle its CAP CHEAP AS F%#* on sale or even the game is only 8 dollars cdn and i can assure u will get your 1$ a hr
1448	better than flatout 2 !
1449	The â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ive ever played
1450	flatout 3 is fun
1451	Do not buy this game, It's complete garbage, Team 6 killed the franchise of the game. FlatOut 1-Ulit. is only ones to buy.
1452	Game of the year! If you still don't have it - go kill yourself.
1453	If you forget about the fact it's called Flatout and get past its depressing technical problems, it is a decent fun arcade racer and definitely one of the better games from Team6... most of their other titles won't even run or crash every 15 minutes. But this at last appears to work (so far).
1454	Still better than Ride To Hell -IGN 2/10 definatly worth a buy
1455	DON'T BUY, This game is absolutely terrible.
1456	Do not get this game. Bugbear is working on a new Ridge Racer title and you should focus on that. This is developed by completely different people, rendering the 'FlatOut' name uselss.
1457	Been a fan of Flatout myself and very much enjoyed the second one, but this is just Horrible...Graphically it looks like shiit for what the games recommended specs are, even a very weak low end PC could run this. The controls feel really clunky and physics feel awful. Wish I could get a refund for this...Will not be touching this game again.
1458	Believe the reviews - this game is truly terrible. The graphics look 10 years old and the handling is depressing.
1459	poor game. Flatout 2 is better..
1460	This is probably the worst game I've bought in the last few years. I bought it because I really enjoyed playing FlatOut 2. From the day I first played this steaming pile I've regretted it. Both the graphics and the gameplay are atrocious and I know of several games from the early 2000s that look and play better. The cars are basically uncontrollable and the tracks are terrible too. I unfortunately bought this back when there wasn't a Steam review system yet. The devs should be ashamed of ruining an IP like this.  If there was one game I could get a refund on, it would be this.
1461	For shame!...I loved the first games but this is a disgrace. These developers used to make those old arcade games, I swear. This game has none to the aspects that made this series awesome. Stick with the first two Flatout games then stay with those Bugbear guys and grab Wreckfest instead
1462	Sorry but I've never seen such a bad game.  This is definitly not FlatOut.
1463	The worst game ever made.
1464	This game is so terrible it is unplayable. I don't need to write anything about the physics or the graphics because you shouldn't spend any more of your time thinking about this game. Save your money.
1465	Don't bother. Get Flatout: Ultimate Carnage instead, this is just waste of money, as it is a cash grab by the publisher on the name of Flatout only, Bugbear wasn't even involved with this pile of garbage.
1466	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I am a huge fan of all of the other FlatOut games and I really tried to give this a chance but it is just a terrible piece of garbage trying to cash in on a series developed by a company no longer involved with it. Show support for the original series and buy FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage, or support those guys directly and go check out Bugbear's Next Car Game, but pleast do not give these guys any more money. This is not deserving of the FlatOut name.
1467	Alright, I was the biggest fan of previous opuses. I waited for this game to come out, unsure of what it would, because that it was not made by bugbear.   when I first runed Flatout 3, I thought it was a joke. And I still think it is. I think they make better games than that for toasters. The 3 races I had killed a part of my soul.  Seriously, dont buy this thing. And if you liked the other flatouts, well.. lets just hope Bugbear puts its hands back on the Flatout Serie.
1468	This is probably one of the worst games I have EVER played. Please. Do not buy it, you cannot support awful games like this.
1469	No career, drive like on a ice surface, creating perfect race to get ahead. This is not a Flatout .... The Flatout series is dead thanks to the new developer Team 6 Game Studios :-(
1470	Such a disappointment in comparison to the earlier games. The controls make it almost unplayable and certainly not enjoyable.
1471	If you are searching for a good desctruction derby 'recreation' or for 'destructible mindless racing fun' do not buy this game! I have made this mistake! The Racing mode part is terrible and hopeless to win. There is allways just this 1 car you can't beat. The 'stunt mode'......i have spend 20 min to solve the mysteries bejind it, what you have to do in this part.....without result .:( And the Destruction Derby mode.....lol the 1st level is fun......it's a deathmatch. But the other levels....its a 1 vs 23 other fight, where every car has the mission to destroy you, and they are ignoring each other....This was the most worst 2 hrs of my life i spent in it!
1472	â¥â¥â¥â¥.. Would Really Like My Money Back From This, Cause I Bought Preorder, Without Realising The Original Dev Team had Moved On.. The Real Flatout 3 Is 'Ridge Racer: Unbounded' Buy That If You Want The Awsomness That Is Flatout.. Cause This Isnt It
1473	Shockingly bad, avoid!!
1474	Not very good compared to FO1&amp;2
1475	This game makes me physically ill. All the other Flatout games are great, but this is garbage.
1476	IF your remotely are a flatout fan at all then Just put your money back in your wallet and just walk away ..... Theres nothing to see here folks just keep on going
1477	Dont do it, its menus are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it lags like crap
1478	Don't EVER buy this piece of turd. It has nothing to do with Flatout. If a game gives you a hard time navigating through the menus you know something is up. The driving physics is messed up, it's something akin to Outrun instead of being arcade but a bit based in reality. It's like they haven't even tested it prior to release.
1479	BUYER BEWARE, this is not a real FlatOut game at all!!! The 'Gameplay' is like pushing a shoe box around in a very unsatisfying manner.  Seriously, don't consider to buy this 'game'. Highly unrecommended. I was lucky to be able to get my money back and, more importantly, to have the stain removed from My Games.
1480	Nowhere near as good as the previous Flatouts. There's no tutorial or explination of what i'm supposed to be doing. Very disappointing game.
1481	Not worth the money, better off with Flatout: Ultimate Carnage
1482	worst flatout ever difficult to get working bad graphics and much more 
1483	Game has nothing to do with it's predecessors, it is a horrid joke of a game. Driving physics are terribly arcadey but way worse, AI are incompetent turds. Graphics is a huge downgrade. it is just a waste of money, i am a huge FlatOut fan  and this was the biggest dissapointment i've ever had...
1484	they ruined the perfect racing game. you rub sides with another car, you go 5 miles an hour. you get touched, you spin out you go off a ramp, you flip over wanna listen to music while racing? what music? i hear no tunage graphics look like they went back to flatout 1 not really chaotic, just messy. and destruction? nope
1485	Not worth the $$, even if it was free. Horrible control.
1486	Not sure how much time I put into it. cause.. like the other reviews.. the First two and Ultimate Carnage were absoluteely joy to play. I had not noticed when I purchased this one that it was made by an alternate company and again as the others said.. just did not stand up at all to the other games. My personal big problem with it, is the handling SUCKS, the Handling of the other games and the soundtracks and the whole feel were excellent, again this one just didn't have that feel to it either.
1487	This is not a Flatout game. It may have the name, but it is made by a different studio, and feels absolutely terrible. With absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, I'd heartily suggest you skip this one and go straight for Flatout: Ultimate Carnage instead. Now THAT's a great racing game!
1488	If you loved FO2 than you will hate this game. Upon first launching I can predict the following emotions... First will come confusion, then denial, more confusion, acceptance, anger will set in. Epic disaster. May God have mercy on the developers souls.
1489	Team 6 Studios You made a terrible game!  Flatout 3 has nothing in common with the high-quality, 'Bugbear' Flatout games   Do you recommend this game? NO
1490	IF your remotely are a flatout fan at all then Just put your money back in your wallet and just walk away ..... Theres nothing to see here folks just keep on going
1491	The only thing that is chaotic and destructive about this game are the ugly glitchy graphics, the balloon physics and the underwhelming damage model. For one, the game, as it is painfully obvious, is not even made by bugbear interactive, but by a studio named Team 6 who seem to be way off with their games quality.  It is unfortunate that this game has so much content to offer, but does it in such a disastrous and wasteful way. There are plenty of modes, with both old and new added to the mix with a variety of vehicles types, but nope! This just wont save this game from the shovelware/bargain bin   For what is worth its kind of hilarious to play the game and then read its description.  
1492	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!! It's utter rubbish.
1493	There was a Flatout bundle on steam that gave me all the Flatouts at a total of $7.99. Or, I could have bought Flatout, Flatout 2, and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage separately for $9.35. Quite honestly I wish I had payed the extra $1.36 just so I didn't have this god awful game.
1494	this game is about as fun as the dish network tutorial channel. 0/10 - bad bad bad
1495	I wouldn't call it broken, but the FPS goes down the toilet when you PLAY WITH MORE THAN 3 NPCS... *sigh* Buy #2, not this one
1496	Complete and utter garbage. Don't waste a cent on this game. Wonky Physics, terrible sound track, complete and utter insult to race fans and what was otherwise a decent franchise until now.
1497	Don't know what's more annoying.. Wasting Â£22 on this, wasting 11GB of bandwidth downloading this... or wasting 15 minutes of my life playing this.... seriously... wtf..
1498	I played like 12 minutes of this, and will never play another second. Excuse me while I erase this from my memory. *smashes head against brick wall until dead*
1499	It's not boring, it's disgusting.
1500	This game is absolute joke. Dont waste any penny on it
1501	There was a Flatout bundle on steam that gave me all the Flatouts at a total of $7.99. Or, I could have bought Flatout, Flatout 2, and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage separately for $9.35. Quite honestly I wish I had payed the extra $1.36 just so I didn't have this god awful game.
1502	try puting a toothpick under your toenail and then kick a wall  congrats you are now having a better time than you would have when playing this piece of trash
1503	I played like 12 minutes of this, and will never play another second. Excuse me while I erase this from my memory. *smashes head against brick wall until dead*
1504	This game is not worth the title Flatout, BugBear probably regret letting a different developor create such a god forsaken game. Best advice I can give is to not buy this game
1505	Do not buy this crap. If you want to play a good FlatOut game, just buy the FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.
1506	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1507	Complete and utter garbage. Don't waste a cent on this game. Wonky Physics, terrible sound track, complete and utter insult to race fans and what was otherwise a decent franchise until now.
1508	I do believe this holds the record for the lowest Metacritic score on Steam. Needless to say I could not even finish the first race.
1509	FLATOUT 1 - 7/10 FLATOUT 2 - 8.5/10 FLATOUT 3 - 0.75/10  
1510	Sorry, but I don't know what is this. FlatOut 2 and 1 was better.
1511	WORST GAME EVER you bonece off evry thing and evry thing blows up and thay must of spent 5 dolers on it and it glickchis it is crap thay need to take it off of stem i hate it makes me sick the first event i tride
1512	Feel the adrenaline rush as you aimlessly ice skate around the track wondering who the hell would pay full price for this half arsed crock of â¥â¥â¥â¥. cars feel bland, tracks are boring, and yes, just wrote this after installing and uninstalling within the hour.
1513	5.2 out of 10 It seem like the developers think as many game mode and feature as possible and qucikly did all these without check if there any bugs or problems!   They rushed the whole game the reason why I buy it because it was in a bundle for Â£7.99.
1514	This is a pile of crap, do not buy! The other 3 flatout games are good though...
1515	Guys dont buy this game,you may think its awesome but youre wrong.The graphics,the gameplay is simply awfull. Even FlatOut 2 is 100000 times better than this one. This game really ruined the Franchise.
1516	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage. Seriously, I can't say I've experienced a worse racing game in my life. What happened to this franchise? There's just no focus to this title, they just kind of throw all the modes and everything at you without any sort of explanation or objective to unlocking new tracks. Everything seems so random, oh and the rubber band AI is unbelievable. What happened to the physics engine too? This is a huge step back for the franchise and I hope future titles don't go this route. If this didn't come with the FlatOut franchise pack, I wouldn't have it. Don't waste your money on this, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you developers, give me 30 minutes of my life back.
1517	I would rather drink bleach than play this again.
1518	I bought the complete Flatout pack during a Steam sale and didn't install this one [FO3] due to reading so many negative reviews. I finally installed it today just to try, and am immediately uninstalling. It was made like an arcade game that was trying to be super cool. The stunt physics are terrible, monster trucks were pointless, and after just one race my eyes and brain are still jostling around it was so bumpy! Don't even waste your hard drive space. Despite my profile picture; definitely Do NOT Want!
1519	This game was very fun! Clicking this uninstall button was way funner tho
1520	Don't know what's more annoying.. Wasting Â£22 on this, wasting 11GB of bandwidth downloading this... or wasting 15 minutes of my life playing this.... seriously... wtf..
1521	DON'T BUY, This game is absolutely terrible.
1522	Do not get this game. Bugbear is working on a new Ridge Racer title and you should focus on that. This is developed by completely different people, rendering the 'FlatOut' name uselss.
1523	Dont buy this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥!  I played it for a couple of minutes but couldnt stomach how aweful the driving experience was, its a cheap cash-in on an otherwise good franchise.  The 1st and 2nd are games brilliant, ultimate carnage is just flatout 2.5 with more web integration mostly.
1524	This is probably the worst game I've bought in the last few years. I bought it because I really enjoyed playing FlatOut 2. From the day I first played this steaming pile I've regretted it. Both the graphics and the gameplay are atrocious and I know of several games from the early 2000s that look and play better. The cars are basically uncontrollable and the tracks are terrible too.

1526	poor game. Flatout 2 is better..
1527	I should have read the reviews before purchasing this game. This is an abomination. This is blasphemy. I can only assume Hell awaits for the person or persons responsible for this...THING to be unleashed upon the world.  I lasted two races.
1528	If you're coming from Flatout 1 and 2, this game may dissapoint. The cars do not drift at all. The driving machanics is just understeer (going too fast or under breaks) and oversteer (on the power). It really does seem like a step backwards even from version 1.  The graphics seem to be a bland mix on a low color pallet.  The tracks are not too bad, but some are rediculous (they are more like off road tracks).  Does this game present any kind of challenge? I would have to say Yes it does, but not in the same way as 1 &amp; 2. I think the fun factor has gone down with this version. Pick it up if its on sale.
1529	It's pretty buggy and runs like dirt.
1530	Do not buy.  Do. Not. Buy.    Do. Not. Buy.        Do. Not. Buy          DO. NOT. BUY        Originally posted by  Me :
1531	disapointment :( this game really went left away from FO2 this. the mechanics.. just feel wrong.. no real customizations.. sad. so sadly i have to say. DO NOT GET THIS GAME ;(
1532	Buy Ultimate Carnage instead. This came out later but is actually worse imo. Much worse...
1533	'It's one thing to release a new game from a small team, it's a whole other thing to hijack a well known name and destroy it. In case you haven't figured out where this is going, Flatout 3 is not worth paying for. I wouldn't play it for free. It's a mediocre generic racing game at best. Flatout 3 doesn't seem like the same series at all.' (copied)
1534	Beyond terrible. I bought this game to complete my Fallout Collection, despite reading the reviews. It is as bad as they all say. Avoid like the plague!
1535	Oh god, what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this? Is this Flatout? For real?
1536	When you have played the FlatOut series for years... YEARS on end, I remember playing it on the Playstation 2 when I didn't have the game on PC yet at my friends house, it was sooo fun. Then I had a new PC and I could play UC and I played it for DAAAAYS on end.  And then something like this, in your favorite franchise, comes along. Team 6, you should be ashamed of yourself. It looks like they took the previous titles in the franchise, threw it out the window, went outside and stepped a few times on the box cases, all smuddered in the dirt, spit on it and said 'let's squeeze the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the FlatOut fans'.  That's exactly what happened. An absolute travesty. It should be eradicated, considered non-canon and remade and rereleased by a competent team that knows something about racing games, and especially about the FlatOut charm.
1537	This 'game' is a fu**ing desecration...
1538	Another name for disappointment could be Flatout3. 
1539	Hahaha are you kidding me? What happened with the damage model of the cars?  One of the worst games i have ever played!    Flatout 2 was such a greate game...
1540	The handling is poor, the physics are rubbish, and the destruction is that by name only. If you want a good FlatOut, any of the previous ones is better.
1541	Probably the worst game that i own. Don't ever buy this. Get the 2:nd game or ultimate carnage
1542	DO NOT BUY! Terrible TERRIBLE GAME! Flatout 2 FTW!!!  Only place for this would be a trashcan!
1543	Before: Great expectations. After:  Total disappointment . I can't even put in into words...  The first two games are great but this is a total mess.  I absolutely don't recommend it to anyone...  DO NOT BUY IT!  As other mentioned before me. The only flatout in this game is the name.  I'm glad it was on a discount - it really doesn't worth the 29,99 EUR price.
1544	I got this on sale in a bundle, thinking 'Can it really be that bad?'   Yes, yes it can. After attempting to play it, I wish I'd saved the 20 cents and just bought the games I actually wanted seperately.  This game is simply unplayable. Even on the lowest settings the framerate refuses to go above 13 FPS on my i7-6700k/GTX 1070 rig.   There are myriad of better games in this genre that actually work, Gas Guzzlers Extreme, Wreckfest, Flatout Ultimate Carnage, Carmageddon Max Damage, hell even Clutch is better than this game because Clutch ACTUALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORKS.   Don't get it, even if its on sale, even if its free, this game isn't worth the hard drive space.  UPDATE: After finally getting this game working, I've discovered even more problems with it. Such as changing the graphics to ultra removing all texture from the folliage.
1545	The handling is poor, the physics are rubbish, and the destruction is that by name only. If you want a good FlatOut, any of the previous ones is better.
1546	So expensive for such a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. 3/10 just because it has monster trucks
1547	UPDATE: The Game Seems To Work Now - Steam Was Having Some Issues As Sonic Racing Wouldnt Boot Either. A Quick Restart Fixed Both Games Though, However, This Game Is Not As Good At FlatOut 2, And Is Rather Glitchy! Me: Oh Look, Flatout 3 Is 90% Off! (Opens Game) (Boots Game From Steam) 'Steam Not Running' (Finds Out Its By Team 6 Games) Me: Oh Boy, The Creators Of That Cheap Wii Game 'Speed'. Maybe It Just Didnt Load Right. 'Steam Not Running' Me: It Was Only 3 Bucks Anyways. I'll Just Bootup Flatout 2, Flatout Ultimate Carnage, And Burnout Paradise Again, I Guess. Someone Get A Better Developer For This Game!! Its Broken! It Even Passes My Computer Specs! Specs: OS: Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q8400 @ 2.66 GHz 2.67 GHZ RAM: 8GB Graphics: NVIDIA GEForce GTX 750 Ti Reccomended Specs Operating system:WindowsÂ® 7 (Windows 7 Pro, Check) Processor: IntelÂ® Quadcore (Core 2 Quad, Check) Memory: 4 GB (8GB, Check) Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 590 / AMD Radeon HD 6970 (GeForce GTX 750 Ti, Check) Internet:Broadband Internet Connection (Internet Connection, Check) DirectXÂ®: DirectXÂ® 9.0c (DirectX 9.0 Installed, Check) Hard disk space: 20 GB (Installed On A 150 GB Hard Drive, With About 100 GB Left On That Drive, Check) Sound: DirectXÂ® compatible Soundcard (DirectX Compatible Soundcard, Check) Supported Input Devices: Keyboard, Joystick, XBox Controller, Gamepad, Microsoft Controller for Windows (Optional) Additional Notes: Also supports Razer Hydra.

1548	Wow, just... Wow. I think every other negative review here is spot on acurate. Absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sadly I paid money for this.   TL;DR  Avoid...
1549	Completely misplaces the fun and physics of earlier flatout titles. Game has no structure at all (unlike earlier titles) and track design is uninspired.  Not even worth a buck.
1550	When I purchased this game, I expected a Ridge Racer experience: alien vehicles drifting at impossible angles and blinding speed in every curve with a very passionate commentator. Ridge Racerâ¢ Unbounded is none of those things.  This game differs from the rest of the series. A lot. You can actually drift off into wall and crash your car, or bump into your opponents in an attempt to take them out. There's a handful of game types you can play, from your typical race to the finish where drifting fills up your boost meter (Shindo racing), to causing as much damage to the city as you pass through it, including your opponents (Domination race).  Each car has a unique feel to it, although most of them just slide all over the place, or can barely turn at all. The lower the 'Drift', and the higher the 'Handling', the easier to drive!  The graphics are simply beautiful. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the different shops in the city to the spot-on reflections on the cars. The weather changes the look and feel of the track in an immersive way, although there is no precipitation. My only complaint is that lighting effects are sometimes blindingly intense, especially at night, to the point where wearing sunglasses would almost make sense.  The music is upbeat and powerful, unfortunately we do not get a set of original tracks this time around. Ridge Racerâ¢ Unbounded borrows a few tracks from previous games in the series, as well as songs from other artists.  The game features a fairly simple track editor, which reminds me of Accolade's Grand Prix Unlimited (DOS). Published tracks are uploaded online, where everyone has access to them. That's an infinity of maps to play on! I must admit, however, that most people are very uncreative when it comes to making custom tracks, but there's always a few gems in there. You just gotta find them!  Unfortunately, I can't say much about the multiplayer experience. You can invite people from your Steam friends to play with you, but don't expect anyone else to join your game.  I've encountered a few bugs here and there (glitching graphics, flipping cameras when boosting during a collision, and one area where you can drive off the map), but nothing major or game breaking.  What I'd love to see in this game would be a better controller support (for non-Xbox 360 controllers), rural-themed tracks, and maybe a multiplayer lobby where all players can actually see who's online and play together!  Overall, Ridge Racerâ¢ Unbounded's title can be misleading, but it's still tons of fun, and has a high replayability value for a modest price. I recommend it to anyone who'd love a neat little pick-up-and-play urban-racing game.
1551	Its not a ridge racer game. Its burnout meets trackmania without a clear focus. The game is based around beautiful destruction physics but in order to destroy other cars, you need to drift, chase, or destroy items. Destroying items is worthless since you get a fraction of the boost needed, so you tend to be drifting a lot.  However the ai just gains boost at a steady pace, meaning they will just boost whenever their meter is full. The boost itself is odd, its designed around strategic use to either power through a corner, destroy a city target to get more speed/shortcuts, or take out a racer but instead the game requires you to be constantly boosting in order to keep up. As well, there are no mechanics to allow players to catch up. None of the short cuts drastically change the map and the leader can use his boost to open it up anyways so there is no way for someone behind him to catch up unless he messes up.  Given the nature boost is gained, the late game is also to the favor of the leader as there are less targets available and players are more spread out.   Combat is also weird. There are no rewards for damaging cars, and you don't get boost if you frag someone in a special way ala burnout. Also unlike later burnout entries, there is only one type of car per race. As a result, cars with good acceleration and speed trump all else since they can drift fine and use boost to make up for any lose of speed.  The game does have one very interesting part and thats the special events. These include some trackmania esque maps where you have to get to the finish line while hitting targets.   But what sells the game to me is the sense of destruction. The objects you destroy remain on the track making the track feel more and more wartorn and whenever you destroy a car you see an amazing slow motion view of it bouncing. It never got old for me.  As for the default levels, they are pretty generic and some end up being confusing since they reuse prefabs in an unusual way. The events aren't always balanced, either, some will prove to be a pain since you just don't have the right car for it or others are so easy because you can use a car that the level wasn't balanced for.  The star is the player-made levels, of which there are tons, which use the ingame editor and allow for a nice variety of fun and bizarre levels. The game to me seems like a case where there was a pre-existing game that was adapted with the ridge racer brand and then rushed into development.  I say get the game if you like arcade destruction racing , the 10 dollar price tag is appropiate but with games like carmageddon and NCG, there are more focused alternatives.
1552	I have never played Burnout, a lot of others seem to say this is similar....  Honestly I do enjoy this game, the music is pacey, the gameplay is easy to grasp. It is slightly repetitive but worth a few pounds. It is a bit like Paradise City in a way due to its destruction stages, but without an open world (boo...).  I have stopped playing because the drifting stages are god-awful or I am just very bad at them.  I did buy the dlc at them time as it was mega a cheap, cars arnt great, but the RR Type 4 pack brings back some great times with the RT Solvalu. But, it no doubt comes as no surprise to hear that it sucks in game.
1553	The title of this game is probably badly chosen because this has nothing to do with any previous Ridge Racer games. This is an arcade style racer with an accent on destruction and explosions. Im not a big fan of racers and not a fan of destruction racers at all, but for some reason i liked this game. The graphics have a style that only Namco could achieve, really classy as you can expect from any Namco game. The gameplay is actually fun and after the initial frustration and 'wtf' moments, the game grew on me. Id say its my fave racing game in my library...but keep in mind im not a racing fan...at all.  The game is unfair and has some not so well designed parts but despite all this, its fun to play over and over.  I bought this a while ago when it was heavily discounted at $10 and never regretted. Now its full price is $10 and its discounted at roughly $3-4, more than worth it even if for the style alone.
1554	A really stupid but amusing game. It can be summed up in the following statement:  'VROOM VROOM BOOM'  Yep. Multiplayer is dead. Not an essential purchase by any means, but i can't say i haven't enjoyed it. Warning; contains Skrillex.
1555	It's criminal that this game has so many negative reviews so I guess I'll throw my opinion in the mix. This is a unique, skillful, strategic racing game with quite a bit of challenging single player content.  Just about all of the negative reviews don't seem to get it. The game is hard. It's not instant satisfaction win-first-try run of the mill garbage. You have to play races multiple times, build a route and create a plan on how to win: manipulating the AI so you stay out of their way when you need to, and exploit them when you can. On some tracks I would even start over multiple times just to get a solid start on the first corner of a lap.  If I had to knock it for anything, it's that the car balance isn't the best. It's not bad, but sometimes you will unlock a car later that makes previous tracks easier. So, it can be frustrating (but also fun) to try to beat a track over and over only to have it get retroactively easier due to an unlock.
1556	Crazy bad â¥â¥â¥ racing,i think i said wtf ten times in a single race,i later realized i was racing a custom track but hey it was still crazy,great graphics,even better music,ultra fast and ultra smooth on 1080p,online functions are there but no one seems to play this game,you can create your own tracks and track sets,you can then post them online for others to play.  I find it strange,infact Namco must have found it strange that there is little to no server activity for this game,they also must be scratching their heads and wondering why no one bought this game,i also wonder why Unbounded has not sold anywhere near it's worth,to look at this game and realize how much fun it is and how good the game looks and runs as well as the fact that Namco were bold enough to include a full track editor instead of trying to sell out on track and car dlc.  I just do not get why no one owns or plays it,reviews may say it's not a true ridge racer but i would say it does have the same feel and racing machanics of ridge racer,also the same scenic design of ridge racer,but hell yeh it is different and better in my opinion.  This game is pretty dam cheap by any standards and it can be picked up on deal often and right now it costs only Â£3.45 here ..   http://www.nuuvem.com.br/produto/627-ridge-racer-unbounded   This game is like burnout meets ridgeracer,cross breeded with flatout and trackmania on coke,i recommend this game to everyone who likes a good arcade racer,very casual but also deep enough to keep you racing and the amount of tracks will keep online racing fresh.  IGN review link - sums up the game pretty well but the game looks crappy in the ign video (console port) maybe,framerate was bad as well as looking washed out but the pc game looks dark,lush and full 60fps.          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Ridge Racer Unbounded - Video Review&nbsp;
1557	Things that I like: Super fun, speed effect, arcade style racing. Now with better multiplayer, and customizable tracks!!! The cars are pretty, and crashing through stuff is fun, I actually like the unrealistic physics, and cars. When I first got this game, I was all like: 'Oh finally, here's where flatout3 went.' I was quite happy, and really got into it. Great fun, fast racing, and all the fanciness that you would expect from Bugbear. I congratulate you for showing up the losers that ruined the title you should have done. Things that I didn't like: The learning curve is fun, you pick up on the game and gain skill as you play. BUT there's a point where it turns into a learning abyss, and there you are at the end of the game, with no chance of finishing it. I'm really salty about this, but there's a solution (not to discourage you from buying it) ONLINE. If you want to race h2h, arcade style; this game is perfect and what you're looking for.
1558	For reference, I probably played at least 30-35 hours of this game on the PS3. I bought it on PC because it is simply more convenient, and I'll get to play it more frequently. But I've also done some fairly extensive testing of the PC version before posting this review. It could do with more graphics options, but it's an alright port and runs pretty well.  Now, getting to the point: I simply could not believe how good this game was, given the harsh backlash. This game sold very poorly, and as such, went under the radar for most. It was hated by Ridge Racer fans, because in truth, it strays VERY far from the formula in other Ridge Racer games. It also takes a decent amount of skill and practice. As such, the reviews for this game were completely off. Even in reviews that praised the game (e.g. Eurogamer) it is obvious that the reviewers really struggled, especially with the concept of a drift button, which is pretty ridiculous.  It draws far more inspiration from games like the PS2 Burnout games and the Flatout games. In fact, it was made by the developers of Flatout (Bugbear Entertainment). It's extremely fun, and quite challenging. Iinitially thought that the AI were pretty merciless, but they don't actually cheat. You just have to make sure not to lose momentum bouncing off walls during drifts. This game is all about destroying the environment (like Split Second) and your opponents (like Burnout) in glorious slow motion action, drifting, and chaining this all together to win. There's also other types of events such as drifting and a 'Frag' event, where you eliminate as many police cars as possible. I couldn't recommend this game more. Buy it. Damn you Ridge Racer fanboys. We get it. It's not Ridge Racer. Boo hoo.
1559	Ridge Racer has a baby with Burnout ?  The 2012 released racing game Ridge Racer Unbounded is about the opposite of the previous releases. It features a more arcade-like feeling other than realism and introduces new features such as: -Different modes (races, drifting, obstacle courses, juggernaut) -Destructible environment -Destructible vehicles -Dominance system -New cars, tracks, music and so on  Some of these features are quite fun and fit well to the game while the destructible environment for example feels pretty wierd as in the beginning you don't really know if the wall you are about to crash into is destructible or not. Now I want to highlight the pros and cons of the game.  Pros: -Good graphics ( released in 2012 ) -Stable framerate -Fun gameplay -A lot of different cars and tracks to explore -Accessible shortcuts that need to be 'destroyed' -Takedown system   Cons: -No more multiplayer ( servers got shut down ) -Randomly occuring errors when leaving a race or tabbing out -Cars taking you over meters before the finish though you are on maximum speed -Extremely sensible drifting that sometimes sends you flying somewhere -No tutorial  All in all this is a very enjoable game, especially for the price of 10â¬. I would recommend this game to all lovers of arcade racing games such as Burnout, Flatout, Split Second Velocity, Blur and Need for Speed. The others should probably look for a more realistic game. 7/10
1560	Ridge Racer Unbounded completely surprised me. It is by no means a realistic racing game but therein lies its charm. It is very much an over the top, fast cars, sexy lights, thumping music, and just energy blasted into your face kinda game. And I love it! It switches the action around quite a bit which is nice but some of the things work better than others. The obstacle courses, frag attacks, and drifting challenges start to get tiresome but they really help when youâre driving the races. After a while the challenges get so challenging that restarting the tracks becomes your second nature in this game and you take it as part of it. The important thing is that the game rarely feels unfair. If you lost, itâs because you messed up. Wrecking the town is fun and blasting through your opponents with the turbo on feels really satisfying. I really enjoyed the ridiculous nature of this game and the way it just gets your adrenaline levels up.
1561	They transformed this serie into a standard arcade racer and now games like NFS: Hot Pursuit beat them in almost every way.   But still worth playing for the $8 when it's on sale.
1562	Itâs not really Ridge Racer, but whether you consider it a reboot or a spin-off this is the best arcade racer since Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.  Pros:Brilliantly destruction racing, with a heavy but enjoyable driving model and some great destruction effects. Excellent track editor.  Cons:More game modes wouldâve been nice and the multiplayer in particular can seem a bit bare bones at time. Supposedly edgy presentation is trying too hard.
1563	Ridge Racer Unbounded is an arcade racing game.  The games physics are completely unrealistic but it is fun to play. There is no real strategy when playing this game. You just need a bit of luck and experience. There are 4 different game modes which are all equally fun. The track editor works well. However there are limitation to what you can do. At the end of the day all tracks look the same.  The graphics are good and runs smoothly than most racing games on a PC. There is no issues with frame rate even on low end PCs. It almost feels you are playing the game on an emulator.  The sound effects are average. The destruction effects are good, but the cars are not. They repetitively go up in gears even at top speed. This can get annoying after a while. The soundtrack is brilliant and is worth having on during play at all times.  This is a game not to take too seriously. It is good fun and made well. Therefore I do recommend it, but only just and only on a deal.
1564	Hard as ever, this slightly obscure game is not something a novice gamer should play.
1565	Got this on sale, Fun arcade racer. Looks great on a 120hz monitor
1566	Not the best game out there but was fun playing it.
1567	Great game. It reminds me of all the crazy racing games I played when growing up. I would just drive in the wrong direction and crash into everyone rather than try to win anything! It's focused more on action than simulation which is perfect for me. If you just want some fast paced action then give it a try. But be warned it takes some time to master. The racing relies more on your ability to create shortcuts by plowing through certain obstables and blowing up your opponents rathern than pure racing skill. The best way to get power points for a boost is to learn how to drift properly and destroying objects. It's the only ridge racer game I've ever played so I cant comment on whether not it lives up to its predecessors.
1568	Now, I haven't played a racer since the old Gran Tourismo, on PS1 and this game takes me back to those days, but in more of a fun way to wreck â¥â¥â¥â¥, and have a ball doing so. Has nice cars, and such, a very fun game to kick the crap out of AI people, and to wreck havoc on the city! 10/10
1569	It's surpriseling fun, reminds me of Burnout meets Ridge Racer. It's not necessary a bad thing. 7.5/10
1570	Good racing game with destruction encouraged.
1571	Ridge Racer Unbound takes leaps and bounds in this release of Ridge Racer. Since Ridge Racer Type 4, I've been looking for another fun Ridge Racer to play. If you're looking for sheer driving fun with a mix of environmental destruction thrown in then look no further! The handling of the cars feel just right, not too arcade-like and not too realistic. It finds a balance in it's driving. Also, the AI is pretty good, often times I find myself redoing a race 3 to 20 times to get 1st place! I look forward to continue unlocking new cars and tracks as each vehicle has a different feel to it.   Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Controls 9/10 Gameplay 8/10 Music: 7/10 Fun Factor: 8/10 FINAL SCORE: 8/10
1572	This is a very fun, faced past racer that allows huge destruction of environments and other drivers. Although my Computer has the minimum requirements it still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ for some reason?
1573	This game is really good. Even better than NFS. At least for me.
1574	Burnout-style arcade racing game. and now this takes me BACK!
1575	This game is really good. Even better than NFS. At least for me.
1576	I had a great time with Ridge Racer Unbounded. Don't expect a racing sim, but just a fun arcade racer with lots of explosions and drifting. That's actually one of the features Ridge Racer is known for; drifting. But, in this game it works a bit differently. Normally, in previous RR games, you could easily drift around the map. However, Unbounded has a lot of maps with tight corners so there's a lot less drifting.  It has a length of about 8 hours, and even more if you want to finish every race with 3 stars. Graphically it's nothing special. There are a limited number of video options. It does look good, just not great. And the entire game (except the final map) has an orange glow. Also, the maps aren't all that different from each other. Different layouts but always the same buildings and corners. A bit disappointing. Anyway, I really hated the dubstep music and the engine sounds all sounded the same to me. And I normally can't tell the difference, so you can imagine what it's like.  [Rating: 82/100]
1577	IT'S RIDGE RACER. RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDGE RAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEEEER
1578	SRSLY i CANT understand why this game has this amount of bad reviews. It has extremely competitive AI, F...ing awsome RACE EDITOR (really really easy to use and lots of stuff taht u can add), and really good graphics. Srsly, u can spend hours and hours just creating 'Cities' (as they call it) with 7 events on each (diferent races) and PLAY THEM. As far as good!!!!  Give it a try, it is worth!!!
1579	this game is fun just action explosion and thats all and its good!
1580	Since Criterion has moved onto Need For Speed, someone needs to take the throne for crazy arcade smash-em-up racers. And this game is an excellent contender for that purpose. Burnout-style gameplay with the ability to make your own maps. Just wish there were more cars.
1581	Like old school Burnout.   I'm enjoying this, and yeah it's not Ridge Racer. Since it's less than 4 bucks for the game and all the DLC, I say go for it. It's fun. It seems like the same game no matter what car or level you are on though. I wish someone would just go the extra mile and include all the features in Burnout Dominator and nail the whole Burnout experience, but it's a throwback to the Burnout type racing games worthy a checking out. I don't think it will hold anyone's attention for too long, and servers are down so I wouldn't know if the online experience imporves things, but as a budget title, it's well done enough. I've seen enough in one hour to thumbs up it during the developer's sale. There's always room for more racers on my hard drive. I just wish they would call it what it is or make a new name, but NFS does this also. What else can you do to compete but follow suit?
1582	For starters, this game contains electronic music. If you're a pretentious â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ (Phil Fish-like) that can't think about it without being an insufferable â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, please kill yourself.  Now, the game itself. 5/10 at best. It's fun at moments, but there are so many broken mechanics that at the end it's only pain and frustration. Which raises the question of why is Ridge Racer Drftopia based on this game? Graphically, it's alright. A bit orange, and the bloom is sometimes overdone, but it's still a nice game to look at. Sounds are good.  But the gameplay, first you have to use the 'drift button', which is basically a glorified handbrake that magically sets the angle of the car around a corner. Counter-intuitive but not hard to get it right. Then you learn about 'frags', mainly done using the Boost and hitting an opponent. But a light tap with the boost will do more damage than a huge crash with no boost. Also, if you hit a car that has its boost activated, you are fragged. A collision between the front of the car and a wall, no matter what, will be a crash. The difficulty is horrible, some of the latest 'frag attack' (a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car, unlimited boost, and opponents to destroy) are a nightmare, the drift events are extraordinary hard and not helped by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ drift gameplay, where the cars that are already quite slippery in normal races become even worse. A central part of the game is destruction. Many parts of the world can be destroyed, but god knows what and how. Some walls can be destroyed, but some tiny columns can't. A same prop can be either breakable or unbreakable depending on the context. Some of the 'targets' (big destructions worth more points and sometimes freeing shortcuts) make no sense, and only the first hit needs to made using boost. The next lap you can go through the same wall without boost and be fine. Every car feels heavy and understeers at all times, but if you press the handbrake then it starts spinning around. The physics engine is missing, jumps and collisions usually end up in bouncing around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Multiplayer is dead, but there are still cities being created and the hourly challenges are still working.  If could've been much more, but at the end it's not a Ridge Racer game and it's not really that fun.
1583	Badass game, I recommend it to everyone that looks after a cool racing game experience. A lot more better if you also have a controller.
1584	Honestly im not a fan of car game and racing game in general but i got it on sale at very low price and i think is a good game for a casual race gamer like me 7/10!
1585	Fun gameplay. Lots of destructable landscape. And an awesome pickup with a humble bundle.
1586	If you played the old ridge racer from the ds or 3ds, you will enjoy this game. This game provides no open world but you can make your very own race track. This game is hard for it only gives the control basics and no strategy on how to win. You have to find your own technique to win that is suited for you.
1587	Best racing game EVER theirs actual reckage and then their is custom map building and its butiful graphics
1588	Great, fast paced racing. I don't like the drifting mechanics too much, as it's hard to execute well with a keyboard. Sometimes I play with a controller and then it's ok.   However, the racing itself is top-notch, so I recommend it.  Worth playing 7/10.
1589	It's a good game. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I wanted to. It plays well but it just seems to miss something. I'm not sure what though. I play a lot of Burnout and comparisons have have not been kind to it.  The sense of speed doesn't seem to be there unless you're playing a time trial mode and the drifting is...weird. It can feel very good at times and awful at others. I do enjoy the destruction though. A lot. If another Burnout is ever made they should definitely add that in. The breakable objects not the cutscenes. I always found it weird that a sign would flip your car in Burnout. If you're looking for poetry, I recommend Hot Pursuit by Criterion. As a standard arcade racer, you could do much worse. 
1590	If you are a fan of Criterion games like Burnout, Need for Speed: Most Wanted/Hot Pursuit or Bugbear's last Criterion-like game in the Flatout series, this is an absolute must-have.  Bugbear might have actually out Criterioned Criterion with this. Be sure that this is very much a Burnout/Flatout destruction racer and nothing like the old Ridge Racer games, something I am thankful for.  If The Incredible Hulk didn't have the success he has been enjoying as a giant green topless super hero/menace and found his way into illegal street racing, I'm sure it would be something like this.
1591	Flat out meets ridge racer
1592	The only reason I own this game is so that I can play it with the volume really loud, and shout into a skype call 'ITS RIIIIIDGE RACCERRR!'
1593	Absolutely love it, graphics are cool, the gameplay is awesome imo. Very cool game.
1594	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
1595	MUST PLAY! If you love RACING GAMES!!  10/10!
1596	If you want to have one more game in steam library you must definitely buy it !  Best fast alt+f4 simulator and delete local content simulator  IGN: 11/10
1597	A very good Burnout alternative, tho it's less arcade than Burnout, the drifting is a bit more challenging. Overall the graphics are nice and gameplay awesome.
1598	That's one awesome game! Currently on sale, I'd get it if I were you and had interesting a fun and unique racing game. It has a demo, so make sure to check that out at least and don't take my word for it. :)
1599	Cool game not perfect but there loads of replay available with loads of user made races

1601	Hello, I recommend this game cause I like graphic of it, damage system and making tracks. One think that I dislike its the difficulty of it and the control sensitivity but I still very like this game.
1602	superb game .. dosent look like from outside .. simply looks like crazy crash or be srushed type of racing .. but it has good diffculty level .. a slight mistake at end and u loose a full race !! ... happy to get it !!
1603	Cool!
1604	A great arcade racer which is a mix of Burnout, Flatout and Ridge Racer. The closest comparison would be Burnout Revenge, which propably was my favourite before this one. Made by Bugbear, this could also be seen as the 'unofficiall Flatout 3' especially as that game bummed out completely! This is also the only arcade racer I've played that is punishingly hard from the get go and every victory is a cause for celebration. Challenging and fun in all respects... oh, and friggin beautiful!
1605	Surprise, surprise. Any dreams you thought about of going multiplayer with this you can forget it. But other than that, it's what you'd expect from Ridge Racer games. Sorta a cross of Burnout and NFS underground.
1606	its awsome its interactof the way the creaters set up this game made it come together like a well placed puzle and this game has tons of potential i hope more peapol buy this game its awsome
1607	Very cool game but multyplayer is currently not working :(
1608	Awesome game, too bad it's not online now
1609	what can i say .. this is a good game great mechanics and very nice cars  graphics wise its really pretty and immersive   BUT   BUT .... they shut down mulitplayer   why could they not have made it peer too peer instead of on a main server so keeping it alive as long as there was players too play ..   apart from that the game is reccomended   just a shame the online has gone  
1610	If you like racing games and destroying things and building then this is the game for you
1611	It's got Burnout's Road Rage mode in it. Is that not enough recommendation?
1612	So i bought it despites all the bad review about the controls and such. Im only 2 hours in ,but i alerdy won 2 race and almost had 1st on some others. Im not an expert drivers at videogames,i mostly only played GT5 and sure,the controls is kinda weird,but once you get over it (and the orangy/yellowish colors) you will probably find some really good casual driving game with a nice twist ala burnout. I bought it 5$ with all DLC and im satisfied with the game. defintly recommended at the price if you want some casual/demolition racing game.  P.S. I never played any other Ridge racer nor Flatout,so i cant relate to those titles. Its a good game,try it !!! (go with a controler)
1613	The feel of speed is definitly in this game. however they messed up a great racing game with a bizarre power up ability that allows u to wreck things.  That said its fun. BUt if you liked the old ridge racer games none of that is in here.  It's an arcade game. no shifting just on and off and brake on and off.  Soundtrack is great though.
1614	Think of it as Flatout 3 and its great 
1615	It is a good game, but is very repetitive.
1616	Very cool game but multyplayer is currently not working :(
1617	Nice racing game with good graphics, reminds me of Need For Speed.
1618	Great fun racer, loads of tracks and cars, and the track editor has been done superb, very easy to make tracks. Graphics are good. Some people i see dont like fact you cant change controller layout, but buttons chosen are same as nearly all racing games, so shouldnt be a problem to most people. Got it on sale, absolute bargain!. :)
1619	Good game, love it. Although I'm using the low end PC its still running good, not smooth xD  Btw, the best game I've bought for the low price!
1620	Well, its almost all there. It is a pretty hard game which makes me like it  Its worthy of buying I guess
1621	So i bought it despites all the bad review about the controls and such. Im only 2 hours in ,but i alerdy won 2 race and almost had 1st on some others.

1623	Honestly, I was expecting another street racer when I bought this, but wow, I was wrong. This game is ridiculous, high speed, destructive fun. It's gameplay is instantly engaging and incredibly satisfying. Every race and event is enjoyable, and going back to get better scores is actually something I enjoyed, and I usually don't like replaying the same level over and over. It's stylish too, with a distinctive colour scheme and very pretty visuals all round. I was lucky enough to get this when it was on sale, and honestly I feel like I paid too little for it. It's worth it's full price easily.
1624	Cool!
1625	Recieved this game in the Bandia Humble Bundle. Now this is no Grand Turismo or Forza yet it is a wonderful time killer and Classic Ridge Racer.
1626	yo man this gaem has no online!! That aside the game is pretty solid. Just dont think that its like the arcade game ridge racer. its a bit more realistic with the way you turn and stuff liek that.   notable things about the game: has old ridge racer music, has original car brands from ridge racer, and uhh it has skrillex dubstep?? get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of here.
1627	Not a bad game but could be a lot better. + nice (or even amazing) graphics + no bugs or other errors + nice arcade driving - no original soundtrack (only few commercial tracks) - very repetitive gameplay - no tuning/upgrade options (choose one of few available cars before every event and change colour) - stupid point requirements to unlock next events - the s**t about dominating the city was unnecessary 10 euro/$ is quite good price though   review edit I forgot about one important thing. The game tries to connect to ridge racer servers which are SHUT DOWN!! every time you launch the game and it cannot be skipped so after half minute waiting you can continue to main menu offline.
1628	Awesome arcade racer with surprisingly, a lot of depth and replayability. Take downs are fun. Drifting is fun. All..... Just so much fan. Good job Bugbear, another awesome game ;-D
1629	Great game, highly recommended!
1630	Thoroughly enjoyable, on console or on pc!!

1633	not the best ridge racer by any means but still worth a purchase if you find it on sale.

1636	Despite graphic issues if there ever will be a patch that fixes it. I still love this game and play it. Its fun tough and won most of the game this game is so under rated. reminds me of Burnout and Full Auto like built in one. Sorry low rating users despite graphic issues. I would say 8/10.
1637	First things first, I would most recommend this to people who loved stuff like Burnout and Split/Second; if you haven't played those, I'd say to go to those first. This game fits the niche of over-the-top aggressive combat racing that sadly seemed to taper off just around the time it hit the track, and if you're craving something new of that ilk, this is a pretty neat combo of that sort of thing!  I will bluntly say that while I consider myself a die-hard fan of racing games, I've yet to play any other Ridge Racer titles. From what I've seen and heard, this doesn't resemble the series it's supposedly part of, like, at all. It's got the insane, incoherent drifting (the number one issue with the game, in my book, is how finicky this is; be prepared to spin out a LOT as you get used to tapping the handbrake and coasting along), the boost meter, and... is published by Namco. Otherwise, it's by Bugbear, who made the original Flatout and, more recently, Wreckfest, and as such, it ends up being a very floaty, hyperexaggerated, sort of arcade racing. It's very Hot Wheels-y. This is the kind of physics you get when playing with toy cars on the floor; reason goes to the curb for cinematic appeal.  The strange thing about the game in motion is the inconsistency of this game's 'Frags', which you will likely know better as Takedowns or slamming-your-opponents-real-hard-until-their-vehicle-goes-boom. For the most part, it can only be done by boosting straight into them, unless they are also boosting. Drifting into an opponent at an angle also wrecks their machine, unless they are going faster than you or also boosting. Boosting makes one invincible to frags. It's... it makes sense eventually, but it's not really explained. In short, you can't wreck anyone unless you're boosting, and anyone boosting can't be wrecked.  There is a nice sprinkling of Split/Second here in the form of Targets, which are basically glamorized shortcuts you boost into. It's a lot cooler than it sounds; where Split/Second had you pushing buttons to detonate areas of track, forcing you to memorize them, Unbounded just has you boost into walls, malls, banks, train stations, and trucks full of explosives so hard that you just smash straight through them. It's  extremely  satisfactory. I mean, let's be honest, most of why I still play this game is just to ignore the races and try to smash absolutely everything. With the right machines (the one other holdover from other Ridge Racer titles is that they are machines. Not cars.), each of the categories of Domination racing becomes a cakewalk, and if you get as much of a smile on your face from being dubbed a 'City Destroyer' and tearing down entire (unpopulated) districts, you'll love this for Rule of Cool alone.  Multiplayer is gone now. The online servers are entirely unaccessible and no substitutes exist, to my knowledge, so if you want to play on any tracks not in the main single-player campaign, you'll have to make them yourself with the Track Editor, which is kinda standard early 2000's PC racer fare. If you just want to drive around solo, the main career is a decent challenge, with Domination Races that let you tear your own shortcuts through the city, Shindo races which are cleaner, more serious affairs in line with past RR titles, Frag Attacks which are Burnout's Road Rage events but kinda sucky due to Boost, Drift events which just suck, and Time Attack events which tend to be bonkers in the best way. There's a good variety of locations, from city outskirts to tunnels to the heart of the city itself. Bonus points for the final area basically being the bombed-out wasteland you've left the whole rest of the game. Bizarrely, the way the game totals points can lead to some grinding; you may have to smash into a bunch of lamp-posts to be able to unlock more actual races, instead of better driving ability.  In short, this feels like a game displaced in time; very 90's in gameplay design, very early 2000's in terms of being hilariously not-really edgy, and very 2010's in visual and audio design. Drifting around corners to build up boost before Skrillex's 'Kill Everybody' comes blaring on and then flooring the gas to plow through a high-rise is very much a unique experience, and if you love and miss this kind of game, I'd say it's worth a go.
1638	Sure, it's worth the 2,49â¬ that it costs on sale, but not any more.
1639	This is one of those games that the Yes/No binary just doesn't work for. It's a fun game so despite it's flaws, I can't say don't buy it, but at the same time it has a ton of problems that make it hard to recommend.   To start, it's a really fun super arcade-ish experience. A budget Burnout clone that is more Burnout than what we got with Paradise. But that is also a negative, since Ridge Racer was noting like Burnout, making this a very poorly executed Ridge Racer game. For better or worse, it's just not faithful to the license.   The game also suffers from some poor design decisions. The MP servers were shutdown, but each time you launch the game, you have to wait for 2 full mins while the game attempts to connect to those now non-existent servers. This gets really annoying over time as the game also crashes more often than I'd consider reasonable.  But on the flip side, the game has some amazingly well designed tracks and set-pieces that make for some tense and compelling action that really suck you into the chaotic fray.  All in all the game is a mixed bag. Almost a perfect 50 / 50 split between âthis is amazing, I want to play this foreverâ and âthis game is so broken it boarders on unplayable and should be pulled from Steamâ, it's a bi-polar hodgepodge of awesome and awful.  I guess I'll give it the thumbs up, and say grab it on a deep discount, but just know, it's definitely a roll of the dice and extremely flawed. For every minute of fun, you'll suffer a minute of mysery.
1640	First car game that I really liked and would continue to play after first try. It's not too serious playing unless you want so. Recommended this to so many of my friends.
1641	Its not a good Ridge Racer - it actually feels much closer to Disney's super underrated destruction racer, Split/Second - but it IS a fun arcade racer that circles *around* the things that define Namco's famous series.   The soundtrack is loaded with classic RR tunes, for instance (even though they added in plenty of Euro Electronic music as well). There's a version of RR covergirl Reiko here too, albeit way edgier and looking more like she belongs in a Mirror's Edge/Fast &amp; Furious hybrid project of some sort. And there's a focus on drifting... although the drifting model here feels COMPLETELY different than any other Ridge Racer; nowhere near as fantastic, crazy or fun. Nor is it as good as Burnout. It just feels like Split/Second or any post-PS2 Need for Speed. You swing the back out of your car out, it slows you down, you bang into stuff or drive outwards to try and correct it or oversteer and fishtail, yadda yadda yadda. This kind of drifting is kind of the worst thing to happen to arcadey racers imho, but its still much better than sim driving games.   Unbounded also brings its own version of gleaming cityscapes, sports some brightly-colored speedsters, and brings the trademark red streaks from brake lights. There's definitely purposeful nods to the main series here, but mostly, its doing its own thing. And that thing is 'Bugbear's take on Split/Second, with traffic checking and takedowns from Burnout'.   And like with Burnout, the crashing is satisfying. Its not as good as Revenge or Takedown proper, but its still super awesome to smash into your opponents and trigger those slow-mo cutscenes and enjoy watching the flaming wreckage of your opponent go flipping through the air. How can that not be fun? Meanwhile, the boost system feels like that game's and Split/Second's; charging you up for driving close to, and bumping into other cars and crashing through some props in the environments. Once you're fully charged, you can boost and wreck other cars or blow through buildings to find shortcuts. Visually, Unbounded sports various special FX and color grading tricks that make everything look like a Michael Bay version of Fast &amp; Furious - very reminiscent of, say it with me, Split/Second's visuals. Everything here is pretty well done; even if other games do everything better, nothing here is executed poorly.  I mean, this isn't a failure as a game - its just a failure as a Ridge Racer. In an attempt to modernize and make it more competitive with other arcade racers of the day, they ended up borrowing a bunch of other ideas and smashing them together while not quite executing them as well, and also unfortunately scrapping the core feeling of Ridge Racer. Whats here is fun if you ever enjoyed any OTHER arcade racer from that era - Full Auto 2, Burnouts, Need for Speed, Split/Second, maybe Blur (never played it). But it does completely fail to play like a Ridge Racer game should, which is by far the worst part about it.   If they tweaked the driving/racing model to play like the real McCoy, this would be a fantastic - and much more unique - title. As it stands, it still offers up plenty of fun. It just feels different and can't quite stand next up to other products on the market. But for a low price, it certainly provides a lot of fun. Especially now, in 2016, when the well has pretty much run dry on arcade racers, its time to rediscover games like this if you're a fan of the genre.
1642	Being a big fan of Sonic and All stars transformed racing decided to try out the Codemaster's version of kart racng. There are definitely big pros and cons to this game and I hope they decide to fix these areas in their future sequel if there ever will be one. Which I doubt since Grid series, their signature line up is doing extremly well. Which by the way am a BIG BIG fan of. Unlike other kart racing games there are almost little to no drifting! Which could be good and bad. Basically focrces you to pay more attention to lines you take in corner entry and exit. Some may find this annoying and others might appreciate the challenge.  Let's talk about the PROS of this game first  + Clean eye pleasing graphics + Car damage and pit system + Team play mode + Price if you can grab it at 75% (4.99) + Slip stream!!! (shake and bake)  Ok the downside....  - TOO MUCH DLC (seems to be becoming codemasters trend) - Online multiplayer is dead. You'll need to get your buddies to play - Weapons were not very creative  Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend buying this game to any silly kart racing fans out there then immediately adding ME!!! 
1643	What make classic Mario Kart great? Seeing your skill and knowledge of tracks increase and slowly you start to win cups that seemed impossible. When is it at it worst? when too much luck is involved. Blue shell anyone?   This game is all-in on the luck part. Tracks dont require much knowledge outside some basic shortcuts + key/gate locations and certain rare spots where you actually need to use brakes.   What decides the positions is actualy what you get for powerups. Torpedo or Teleport once or twice in a game and you are golden. You better also know how to defensively use power ups also right at the first 1000cc cup so dont expect 1000cc to be the 'training wheels' cup. it is just the least broken one.   Career mode is a mess. You will be pressing restart quite many times during multi-track racing cups. Luckily the final order of drivers seem to be much more random than on Mario Kart where your main rival is faster than anyone else.   Multiplayer is dead. DLC structure is a mess. Tracks as DLC i can understand but the rest is some of the most useless crap i have seen in a DLC. And the prices. oh my.   Time trial works. Thank goodness.   F1 license in the game - has any reviews even mentioned it? must have been a good investment. ^_^ No difference to anyone.   Does it work as a couch game? Yes. If played casually it is wonderfully goofy. The shortcoming start as soon as you try to seriously play the game. I rather study Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed more complex mechanics or just go back to Mario Kart rather than try to seriously play this game. I will be putting some more hours into this but it's clear already i can just forget about a proper career game and just play this casually. That way it's obviously been designed too.   4.5/10
1644	+ interesting game/race modes + great looking tracks + good steering aside from - bad cornering mechanics - no slide mechanics which takes a lot of the fun and speed out of the game - not enough tracks to make them entertaining (only 15 + mirrored version) - demotivating and unfair power up system - long loading times (on SSD, probably due to some online features) - unskippable multiplayer setup cutscenes - no custom set up (no damage, no powerups etc.) available in multiplayer (only single track possible and that's frustrating due to loading times) - races can only be unlocked in carreer (single player) but are required to be unlocked if to be hosted in a multiplayer session - useless DLC (aside from the four tracks)  To make it short, the races don't feel like a fun kart racer. Due to very frustrating power up and repair mechanics it is often luck and not skill. Boosting is only possible with power ups, boost jumps or specific boost sections in corners (not every corner though). You'll find yourself being frustrated instead of having fun a lot of times. It's a last resort buy for me - I recommend getting 'Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed' instead. Alternatively you could just wait for a better game to be released on the PC - or just play the original: Mario Kart is still the way to go in this genre.
1645	As Mario Kart 8 is coming out, many console gamers are poking fun at the PC crowd for not having a Mario kart... but in fact we kinda do, it is this game.  It definitely has a few issues, but overall it is very enjoyable. the tracks are fun and well designed, and the fact that there are no crazy drift mechanics can actually be considered a plus by players.  Sadly, F1 race stars does have issue with its online multiplayer, but if you invite your friends over at home, it is a great PC alternative to the kart-racing italian plumber.
1646	F1 Race Stars is one of my favorite racing games ever and it is in my opinion the 2nd best kart racing game ever made behind Mario Kart and I've played most games in the genre if not all of them. I own F1 Race Stars for Xbox 360 with all the DLC and love it so much and missed playing it I decided to buy it on Steam. The game its self is worth the full price but it goes on sale often enough that you can buy it cheap. It's a very overlooked game that is very polished with great gameplay. Please try this game if you like fun kart racing games or are a F1 fan, trust me you will enjoy it.
1647	Rubberbanding at its best with frequent disconnects and crashes to desktop while playing with your friends. Thank God I only paid Â£3.99 for it as part of a bundle...
1648	This game was quite the surprise for me... I was expecting it to be so moronically cutesy that i would find it unbearable, and yet it's actually quite an enjoyable game. Despite clearly being aimed at younger players, the game is actually quite tough, with the AI drivers being quite ruthless in their use of power-ups and short cuts, often resulting in you leading the race into the final corner and yet finishing 9th or 10th out of 12 racers. This can be rather frustrating but if you can deal with that, it's a fun game. I should point out that i only got this game as a result of it being free when pre-ordering F1 2013... I'm not so sure i would rate it so highly if i had paid the rather high asking price for it. The DLC (and there is plenty of that) is also rather over-priced in my opinion...
1649	Hi everyone...Its a very easy to play, and very fun. Recomended to those, who got a sense of humor :)!!
1650	____ Pros ____  Runs and looks Great on a real 4k display Cool looking maps overall, with some decent designs It Is a arcade style kart racer.  ____ Cons ____ No Direct Input support - Most gamepads\input devices\wheels won't work out of the box with this game. There really is no excuse for this.  Hates Joy 2 Key 3.7.4 (the free version), making the above problem harder to solve, delays with the inputs so large you can't accelerate with it. You end up using xbox360ce and accepting its input delay, or sucking it up and using a crappy Xbox pad or f310.  You can't drift, like in most kart racers in existance, makes the races less fun.  Lots of Hidden Advertising in the backgrounds by big companies in a kart racer, that just does not belong.  ----------- Final Score  6/10  -----------  Just barely a Pass for postive, in the end it is a kart racer in a market that has few, get it when its on Sale 75% off, and don't mess with the overpriced DLC.
1651	A great fun-racer a little bit unbalanced with the special abilities, but very funny with friends on steam or in a group. i like it, buy the dlcs when its on a steam special sale...  Join the F1 Race Stars Group  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/F1_Race_Stars_Online_League  Best Group ever for the Game!  - Nice Members - Pro Drivers - Special Events - Reward Cups  and many more....
1652	F1 Race stars is really a kool and entertaining game for a person of any age to play! I would say the game play is easy to use and the game has plenty of levels to move along in the game! Enjoy
1653	If you are into games similar to Mario Kart, this game may be for you. But you can't drift like in Mario Kart, Instead in the corners, where you have to slow down significantly, it have a thing called 'Kers Boost', and as the name tells you, gives you a boost, just charge it up by holding the W button (drop the W key and hold it again to get a bigger boost when you're out of the corner).  MULTIPLAYER: If you want to play Multiplayer, just look at the community hub, you will see that there is a thread about F1 Race stars, and there you will see a link to a group with members that is playing F1 Race stars with each other, so if you want to play online, just request to join the group, and when you want to play, you can just ask someone in the group. (If you are 3 racing, the rest of the spots get filled with AI racers).  You won't get anyone to play with if you just create a multiplayer game on your own.  PROS:  + 14 different power ups, also some unique ones:  Safety Car - Slows down the 1st Racer.  Wet Weather - Making it rain and making the ground slippery for everyone except for the one that used the power up, which get special wheels for the rain.  Static - Everyone loses their current power up.  Rain Cloud - Slows down the racer in 1st place.  + 8 Different game modes  + If you get hit by a power up, your car get damaged and makes you go slower, if you get hit again, even more damaged, to repair your car you need to drive through a pit stop.  Bad: - The teleport power up can be annoying, someone can teleport in front of you right before the finish line.  - The DLC tracks are expensive, it's better to wait until they're on sale.  If you are into Kart racing games I recommend this game.
1654	kind of like mario kart just with formula 1 cars and drivers
1655	I'd like to give this a proper review, but as the resolution refuses to budge to 1080P I cannot. This is a widely reported, and never fixed problem. Shame on the publishers. An absolute disgrace.
1656	Don't give CodeMasters any money for this s***!  It's a buggy wasteland with absolutely no support and multiplayer just simply does not work!  Move along to Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed for a truely decent karting experience.
1657	The negative reviews didn't shake me on buying this game as i thought it might have been a cute mix between micro machines and mario kart, and i was right  But oh god does it â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off It is a struggle enough fighting against the controls (which you can't customise, oddly defaulted to left handed play) and the turning offers no powerslide unless i assume you are using a controller, which puts you often at the pack of the pack. The catch up is decent the slipstream is effective and some of the powerups make it easy to recover from mistakes but if you are in front it is one of the most frustrating experiences. I keep racking my brain trying to figure out why these corners are physically unable to be made unless you 'powerslide' (i.e braking until stopped and moving) or turning well before you would be normally instinctive to do so, The catchup powerups make it so the first place suffers the most while everyone else affected very little. The Safety Car powerup makes the first place and anyone catching up slowed to barely anything while the behind catch up and the Rain Cloud powerup is god awful, causing me to come second on the final strip in more than a few races. The damage system is innovative but in the end flawed as you are permanently slowed until you divert to a repair station, often longer than the actual track in it's own sense, just constantly punishing you  The graphics kept me entertained for the time i played and the little animations were pretty cutesy and enchanting but unless you are withering it out with a friend, pick up Toybox Turbos, another game made by the same developer which has the same arcadey charm but not as punishing and when it funnels down to it, it is actually fun to play
1658	This game is terrible and amazing at the same time. Think Mario Kart, but with mostly real people, on tracks inspired by real race tracks and you've got an inkling of what this game is like. There are, of course, some of the same basic power ups that will help you or hurt your opponents. Characters do all sorts of silly things, especially when you win a series. You can customize a little bit of your car. Really, it's a wonderful game, but for some reason it makes you think it's terrible while you're having so much fun. I just can't explain it.
1659	FYI! For some reason this game is much cheaper on Origin, and if you buy it through Origin it still gets added to your steam account.  It's a very fun and light hearted game. If you are looking for a mario kart type game for PC, this is one of the better options. Unfortunately online multiplayer is desolate. I haven't seen a single player online since I got the game. However the 4 player split screen is very fun (you need xbox 360 controllers for that). One negative for me is that the graphics and control settings are pretty much non existan. It's pretty clear that they want you to be using an xbox 360 controller for this game.
1660	This game is great, I was looking for a fun Mario Kart clone and there was nothing, until i found this! It is colourful, stylishly presented with slick cartoon visuals and great audio and has a great attitude to the source material making the whole atmosphere fun and lively.  Multiplayer online is a little sparse, apparently it was priced a bit too high on release, but its work every penny in a steam sale and has teriffic 2 player split screen!  Gameplay is challenging but fun and the powerups are as frustrating to get caught with as they are when you use them to win races, there are 3 engine sizes allowing for greater speeds and the maps are teriffic caricatures of the host track/country.  I love this game and i defy you not to.
1661	Worst game ever made from Codemaster!!!  Similar and better game, Buy Sonic &amp; All Stars Racing Transformed!!
1662	nice co-op/multyplayer-couch casual game
1663	Alright, so I'm pretty torn on this. I'd been waiting a long while, debating a long while on whether I wanted to get my hands on it, because it looked quite fun and silly and right up my alley, and it's from Codemasters, but the reviewers I normally trust noted frustrating difficulty with it. Having finally picked it up for a little under $4 USD, I think I can sum up all the problems with this game in one word: 'Arbitrary.'  There's an arbitrary elimination mode that's horribly unbalanced and basically just means the person in first at the beginning wins. There's an arbitrary shortcut system that requires you to find a key on the track and drive through a specific gate to basically win right off the bat. There's an arbitrary random interval of time between the '3, 2, 1' and the 'Go' to make boosting at the start that much harder (though honestly I found that kinda funny). There's an arbitrary damage system that slows your car down after each item that hits you, which serves only to force you to pit and to let those in the lead keep their lead. The whole freaking point of item racing is to keep it competitive, make it so that it's a constant fight for position based on skill. The gameplay mechanics routinely defeat their own purpose here. Hell, there's an item that   instantly teleports the user to lead position . How â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lazy is that, destroying the entire purpose? In a great deal of the career mode's races, I didn't feel any satisfaction whether I won or lost, feeling instead like I just ended up wherever the game decided.  Now, if you've read all of that and still want to give this game a try due to curiosity, sale price, a love of F1, or being charmed by the trailers,  then  I can recommend this to you. If you want a better racing game, you're spoiled for choice here, but Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is name-dropped so often for a reason. If you just want to check this in particular out on sale, then go ahead; you'll definitely get your $4 worth.  The course design is a major, major plus here. I'm not too familiar with F1, but I know a lot of the real tracks from other racing series, and especially racing games (and especially games by Codemasters, at that!). The KERS system encourages taking your time in sharp corners, meaning that places like Monaco and the mountain roads of Japan (because come on, it's a Japan course in a racing game) get to be twisty and winding without ruining momentum. Each course is a loving, cartoonish, theme park version of its setting, be it the country entirely or just the city, and national stereotypes are played for humor, creativity, and really exciting scenes. Racing on bullet trains in Japan, leaping through the castles of Germany, and battling in the factories of the UK are grand fun. As an American, I personally found the USA course to be absolutely adorable, and love the effort they put into these. The original courses are part of the design, of course, and it's quite impressive to see familiar sweeping curves recreated in the country's landscape. I will also have to give some points for sheer awesome value of Abu Dhabi starting with a back-to-back combo of Yas Marina and Ferrari World.  The character design is your usual exaggerated cartoony look, but the animation sells it. Seeing your driver put on their helmet a random way every single time you start the race livens up the usual countdown, much like the Battlefield games having those one-in-ten-thousand reload animations. I don't know the drivers all too well, but was able to find pretty much all of the ones I've heard of. The voice acting is serviceable, and playing mostly as Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, it took a while before I realized that every driver speaks their own home language with a peppering of English. It does add a good deal to the experience to hear an international field, even if a bit exaggerated in performance.  There is a massive amount of bloat in this game, from extraneous unfun game modes to a wealth of gameplay mechanics that are never, ever explained. The key and shortcut system is never once mentioned. Boosting at the start by pressing the pedal right at 'Go' is never mentioned. Boosting after a jump by hitting the gas the second you land is never mentioned. And so on, and so forth. You're gonna probably need a guide for this one.  The sense of speed honestly isn't too impressive outside of boosts. It doesn't really feel particularly like F1. It's the courses and the KERS system that really hammer home what it's based off of. All in all, it's absolutely goofy in a great way, but I mostly only recommend it to those out there that, say, would go into a game store and pick out a racing game from the bargain bin just to see what the experience is like, not for completionist's sake or out of serious hope it'll be a major timesink and investment. For the most part, I really was tempted to hit that 'Not Recommended' button. But I haven't stopped playing, so I think that answers that.
1664	Personally I think the game is fun,has a good system and can be really entertaining but if you are looking for something to play online I do not recommend this game. I played non stop for 3 hours on single player and local multiplayer and I adored. If you want a good racing party game that's a nice one unless you are going to try to play online
1665	a good game  i satisfied that i buy him like the DLC tracks
1666	I know it's a karting game and luck does play a little into them, still, decent karting games still reward skill. This game, THIS GAME is nothing more than a test of patience. It's pure luck, nothing else, doesn't matter how well you drive. You will be on the last lap on the last straight and someone will get a warp into the front.... This happens all the time, it's not just an odd 'oh well, you lucky B.............' It's almost every race.  It's a great shame tbh becuase the game plays really well, it's very playable, it's smooth, the variations of the real tracks are done well but for me that element of luck is far far far to high to make this game enjoyable in any sense.
1667	So disappointed, hoped for something more....even hoped for online playablity and nobody id ever online (if online works)
1668	Honestly, its just not a good game. The controls don't feel tight and the items are uninspired. Its essentially a really crappy Mario Kart for people who like Formula 1. The reality is that anyone who is an F1 fan will also cringe at the gameplay found in F1 Race Stars. Children may find a little to enjoy here thanks to its playful aesthetic, but even they will put down the controller in short time.
1669	Probably the single most under rated racing game on PC. Great for racing with your kid. If your kid loves F1 and Indycar racing like mine, it's even better. We enjoy this as much as mario Kart 8 and that is no lie. Really good value.
1670	Getting difficult too much. Your driving skill is nothing for AI drivers. Whatever you do, you cannot win them at all later.
1671	Very funny game. but i very hate the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing power up transfer. delete this power ups and i will recommended this game. and all people want to this game fully supported cause multiplayer doesn't work now
1672	what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, 10/10
1673	It's a really good game, but is expensive, buy the DLC's when they are on sale.
1674	This is another one of those great party games. Snacks and drinks on the table, getting worse at the game with every shot of vodka. It's great fun and really competitive!
1675	Driving physics are too weird for this to be enjoyable.  Multiplayer is empty, always.  
1676	If you are looking for SP arcade game, choose NFS. If you are looking for MP arcade game, try looking somewhere else, because the MP in this game is so broken I can't even find words to describe it. It's just unplayable and guys at Codemasters should be really ashamed of themselves and return the money they got for this unworking piece of ****. It's been over a year since the game came out, Codemasters know about the problems people have and still they have done nothing to fix this issue except giving bad advice that didn't solve anything. Last game I bought from them for sure. Not worth single dollar.
1677	great game
1678	I recommend this game :D It's awesome!
1679	Not even worth the Â£2.74 when it was on sale. Shovelware Codemasters shouldn't be proud of.
1680	Great game, highly recommended!
1681	I would only reccomend to buy this game on sale. That is somewhat pushing it as well.  Let me say the game does have it's fun moments when you're playing with some friends, but it also has a lot of bad.  One of those being the damage system, your car physically gets crippled (slowed down and hard cornering) when you're attacked with power ups. This means you have to run through a pit lane to repair your car almost every 30 seconds or so.   The power ups in the game are also quite dull, not really much exciting going on with them to me!  The game has a lot of issues, AI is extemely buggy, sometimes they're like having a speed hack - no idea what that is about, and with the damage issues it can be a stuggle getting into the top 3 a lot of the time vs AI - not to say it's not a challange but it's due to you being damaged most of the time.  There is an option to disable the damage but I haven't found one yet for championship mode when you have more than one local player.   I don't mind it, it's sort of one of those things you love to hate.   Just buy it cheap, I don't think it's worth a big number either way.
1682	The closest to Mario Kart for the PC you can find. Great for LAN parties.  A couple issues: - Inability to edit controls. You get what you get. Using Xbox 360 controller works well, though. - When alt-tabbing back from the desktop, it will go from fullscreen to windowed and not return until you reconfigure your video to windowed and then back to full screen.
1683	  The game is great!!!! Especially, if you like to beat your friends!
1684	:)
1685	Only played for 20 minutes and sure enough I had a fierce battle with Sebastian Vettel for the lead. Game is increadibly accurate to real F1 racing even though its a kart racer. 10/10
1686	Only played for 20 minutes and sure enough I had a fierce battle with Sebastian Vettel for the lead. Game is increadibly accurate to real F1 racing even though its a kart racer. 10/10
1687	A very enjoyable game. Slighly repetitive but still fun.
1688	  Flawed but still Fun
1689	Nice game if you want to have fun with F1 drivers and stuff.
1690	boring
1691	I enjoy playing this game, it's lots of fun and its pretty well made, its a Sonic All Stars racing type game thats definatly inspired by the former mentioned, get this game if you see it on sale. 7/10
1692	Online multiplayer is dead :/
1693	In the world of 'WACKY-RACIN'-GAMES!!!' F1 Race Stars stands alone in being...exactly like all of the others.   That's not a bad thing - this is quite enjoyable, and I like Codemasters. The game is fun, it's wacky, there's tons of DLC's that add new things, and two years after the release I buy it in a bundle. For the price? It's excellent! It's well balanced, not buggy, doesn't crash on me, and it's playable with a keyboard or a controller.   There's a ton of content to unlock, lots of achievements, etc. You know, all those fake psychological bonuses you get for playing a game. So, if you think that Sonic All Stars Racing is getting boring, or you're tired of any of the other SUPER WACKY RACIN' GAMES, you might want to give this a try.   Definitely not bad, especially if you can get it on a huge discount with all the DLC, but it isn't worth dropping double digit bills on.   Fun factor is huge, music is lame, characters are bobbleheads - all the gimmicks are there! Fun, polished, and I think that's the whole point. I do think they went a little bit crazy with the DLC, though.   6.5/10 - You'll get your money's worth if it's on sale, but it's not the greatest game of all time.
1694	A decent kart racer. Those chibi drivers are so... cute?  http://lonergamer.blogspot.com/2012/11/f1-race-stars-transform-now-than-later.html 
1695	HOW TO GET THIS GAME ON CONTROLER 
1696	Way more than expected.  This is a great game for fans of the kart racing genre. Smooth as butter **beautiful** game art, fun tracks. Beats the crap out of any Mario Kart. I stand by that.  Easy enough for non-racing game fans to pick up quick, nuanced enough for racing fans to get a kick out of.  It's just fun. I recommend it!
1697	This is so bad you will want to kill everyone in the entire world
1698	Loading took too long, never got to play
1699	Mario Kart meets F1 how can you not love this game?
1700	There is not much to say about this game, its an average cart racer and thats all, the only thing that sets this game apart from other carters are the good graphics and fluid gameplay. There are alot of flaws in this game, first off there is NO drift, every cart racer needs a drift no matter what, i found myself crahing into a wall and getting stuck constantly. The second thing are the powerups, when i wasnt getting stuck i was getting hit with bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Third is the lack of fun things to do, it was very repetive and made me sleepy after an hour or two. This should DEFINETLY NOT be $39.99, the most it should be is 5.00 - 10.00 dollars at MOST, luckily i got it free by pre-ordering F1 2013, which i HIGHLY recommend! If you are anywhere from the ages of 8-13 and enjoy carting games i suggest this game but only if you want one off steam. Mario Kart For Life!
1701	Mario Kart Clone?  Alright, i bought it and wanted a Mario Kart for PC... This is what I got: 21/25 Gameplay 14/15 Replayability 5/10 Fairness 6/10 Controls 9/10 Graphics 8/10 Sound 8/20 Multiplayer ----------------------------- 71/100  And here we go: In F1 Race Stars you get a game similar to Mario Kart. Same Power-Ups, same Gameplay. There is not much to say about these two points. But why does it just have 5 points in Fairness? The Damage System! If you get hit, you get damaged, if you get damaged twice you are half as fast as the others. And that until you reach the next Repair Boxes. And to drive into these you loose even MORE time! Unfortunately you can only turn off the Damage playing with friends.  This leads to the next point: Multiplayer. There is no working multiplayer in this game! Noone plays it, becuase the Match Making is bugged...But if your friends play it, you get a nice experience: you can choose everything- Damage, Power Ups, Special Things, Length... And then the game makes very very much fun! Unfortunately this game had no racing wheel support. Just controller support. But a good thing to say about it is that the Controls are pretty easy (WASD+Shift+Space+Alt) and that you can play this game in Co-Op mode with a splitscreen and on 1 computer. But you have to have a controller for each person you wanna play together with, just one person can use the keyboard. Because of the easy Controls, the Replayability is very good. Also this game has very many game modes, a campain with several cups on several roads and a quick race mode. I took away 1 point because of the eventual Rage Quits because of the (Un)Fairness. The Graphic is pretty good, the maps look cool and the special effects are well detailed. Everything is in a pretty comic style and there is no violent. You can play it with your whole family (if you turn off the damage...I am already hearing your kids cry...) and your friends.  The only thing I have to fault is the sometimes angular graphics. The sound is nice, too, but it had a bit potential upwards.  TL; DR This game is a Mario Kart for PC with an unfair Single Player Damage and no Online Community. Play with your friends or Offline and have fun! (See my Sonic all Star Racing Transformed Review which has 87/100 points before you buy!!)
1702	you can't change controls from WASD to arrows so for this i dont't recommend this game . sorry for the good graphics
1703	If you like silly cart racing games (think MarioKart), this is a fun game. Quite silly, and rather pretty. Even more amusing if you also follow Formula 1.
1704	please dont buy this game this game is full of hacks
1705	Whether you play at 1000c or 3000c, the difficulty doesn't change much. As a result, it is an incredibly frustrating game which doesn't reward you in any way regardless of how well you play. The entire game depends on luck and only luck for you to win a race and the eventual championship. It's well made, but that's about it.
1706	I enjoy this game. I do wish the controls were customizeable and I wish that a wheel could be used, but for the price I paid for it, it's well worth it. Wonderful little time waster and you can't beat getting an opportunity to race with 'Cartoon Schumacher'. That's worth the price alone
1707	I think the whole grab a key to open a shourt cut thing is very gamebreaking making it almost impossible to catch back up with who grabbed the key and took the short cut. Otherwise, pretty good arcade style racing game.
1708	Yeah it's not as much fun as Sonic Allstar-Racing, but the handling of the cars feel good, the items are cool, and if you're also a F1 fan, this game is even better.  Overall, a good buy :)
1709	Well worth the 5$
1710	Good stuff, especially if you are for some fun with friends since this game supports 4 players in split screen.
1711	amaaaaaaazing,i mean this game is the best mario cart simulator that i can play on pc.other racing games r still great but this one is special for its simple and beautiful graphics and awsome mechanics.Just one con,multiplayer takes soooooo long so have a friend with u
1712	
1713	one of the best!!! muy buenoooo para jugar con amigos!!!
1714	This one is only a moderate recommendation from me. It has a really interesting art style, with some spectacular tracks, that feature some nice hidden passageways and branching routes. But the fun turns into boredom pretty quickly when you realize winning and losing is all luck and no skill because the power-ups are too frequent and too overpowered. (specifically the teleportation and soda-rocket power-ups.) It's still a ton of fun with friends, where winning and losing doesn't really matter, but the career mode gets pretty tedious and frustrating when you need to win to unlock the next cup and each race is essentially a flip of the coin where you can go from 1st to last in the final 100 feet of any given race due a string of indefensible attack power-ups. If you don't own Sonic All-Stars / Transformed, get that instead, it is the superior game, but if you've already beaten that game, you might as well give this a try if it's on discount.
1715	Just very nice!
1716	This game just isn't fun and that's really such a shame, because it's like it's almost there, and then it just fell short for no reason.  There's just no give in the cars, no drifting, and when you realise it's not possible it's just not fun. Corners are bland and witohut the Mario Kart style handling but with the MK styled tracks it just feels like a weird mashup that makes no sense. It's like they wanted to make a fun party racer, but decided the F1 cars should handle like F1 cars.  The majority of the power ups are so uninspired, most of them being carbon copies of MK powerups which is mostly the norm since, it's not too otherworldly, but everything is just, bubble. Red bubble, blue bubble, purple bubble. The only other power-up is a safety car which slows down the lead racer, but just slows them down.  I would appriciate this game more if the safety car was introduced as rubber banding, making sure that the lead racer can still stay first, but can't get to a point where they're unreachable especially playing a solid defense. Also if you could just drift, I swear if you could just drift this game would be fun.  Just don't buy this, Sonic and Sega Allstars is a much better game.
1717	F1 Race Stars is, essentially, an F1 version of Mario Kart. The worlds are just as cutesy, the hazards just as interesting. I think about the only difference is that your cars can take actual damage and require 'pit stops'. You can play it online with friends or in a career mode. I purchased it on sale for $3, and have yet to regret my decision.  8/10. Purchase if on sale, I'm not sure I would recommend it so strongly at the full price.
1718	  simple awesome fun comedy ON THE PODIUM!
1719	The closest thing you will get in terms of atmosphere and fun to mario kart for the pc.
1720	I think the concept of this game is great. The idea is that it's an open world crime game like GTA, but it's set in video game land filled with parodies of almost any video game character you can imagine. It's a brilliant idea, and fortunately the game mostly lives up to this great concept even if it falls short in some areas.  The game plays as you'd expect out of an open world crime game. However, the game tries to have a much better variety of mission styles. It doesn't try to be only standard A to B shooting. The game tries to mix it up by including missions that are arcade-like or based on old NES games. Thanks to this the variety is incredible and every other mission mixes up the gameplay in some way, so you'll rarely get bored. The quality of the missions do vary however. A good amount of the missions are fun and challenging, but others tend to be a little shallow and funnled, not leaving a lot of room for experimentation. On the whole though, the biggest problem with the missions in this game is that they're all a bit short.  The pacing of the whole game is crazy fast, so it's a very quick experience and missions end quite fast sometimes. Unfortunately this leads to my biggest problem with the game; the main campaign is not very long. You can try to take it slow and try not to rush through, but the game is so fun you won't want to stop. It isn't criminally short though, it can last to about 6-7 hours. Just don't expect a 15-20 hour long campaign. The game offers a challenge and it gets really brutal at times. Don't get me wrong the game is not unbeatable, it's just some of the levels do not hold back on challenge, so there is a good amount of authentic NES-style difficulty. Expect to get a bit frustrated at times if you're not used to that kind of thing.  The game has a pacing problem narrative-wise as well. It seems like the game was supposed to have a somewhat deep storyline and characters but that aspect seems to have been scrapped before the game's release. So as a result, if you were looking for an engaging story, you'll be disappointed. It's extremely fast paced, and has a lot of unrelated events and characters you see once or twice then never again, there's just no focus. That doesn't mean it's horrible though, since it manages to be entertain and the humor is mostly well done. The characters are also interesting and there's always something new and amusing around the corner.   The parody aspect is extremely well done. Basically, the whole world of RCR is one big parody. The characters in it are cleverly de-branded counterparts of famous characters, and basically everything else is a reference to something from the 80's, the 90's, or sometimes the 2000's. The whole city you explore is chock full of parodies and pop-culture references, it's pretty fun to explore. However it's a little 'look but don't touch'. The city is just kind of....there. It's fun to look at, but it's not very interactive and you can't go into most of the buildings. The city is also a bit small as well which is a little disappointing, but understandable if there was not much dev time to spare or it couldn't be bigger due to the NES limitations, possibly both (yes, the game's engine has limitations very similar to the NES). The sprites are small as well which is kind of jarring in contrast with all the amazing pixel art in the game. They're not very detailed, but there is a zoom mode if you want them to be bigger. Just keep in mind that it doesn't make the sprites more detailed, it just makes them larger.  The music in this game is composed by 3 different guys including the legendary 'virt' (Jake Kaufman), and they each have their own style. The soundtrack in this game is very, very good. It sounds extremely authentic, so it's almost as if they were ripped out of an actual old NES game. The only problem I have with the music is that during cutscenes, it switches between songs in a weird way. Like one shot shows something and there's a song in the background, then when it changes to a different shot showing something else, it switches to a entirely different song that's completely unrelated to the previous song that was playing, so the cutscenes sound a bit weird at times. Also I know an in-game radio like in GTA is probably hard to code, but in this game you don't get a feeling that it's playing songs on other stations without you. So sometimes, it sounds like it starts playing the same song every time you switch to a certain station.  Overall though, RCR is a very fun and unique game combining all the pop culture from the 80's and 90's into one game, so the nostalgia due to the sheer amount of references gets pretty intense. Also, the game has a lot of variety and and some genuinely good humor, so you'll rarely get bored during the short but sweet campaign. The game may have not truly lived up to it's great concept, but it was pretty damn close. I think there is a lot of potential for this concept, with just a few tweaks, a sequel to this game could possibly be one of the best indie games ever.  EDIT: After some rethinking, I've decided to recommend this game. You have to keep in mind that I waited quite a while for this game, and it didn't live up to the extreme expectations I had, so I set myself up for disappointment. So at first it was more of a personal review instead of an objective one. So I changed it to be more objective and recommended the game. The game still has some hefty flaws, but it's still a fun romp no doubt.
1721	Itâs like Grand Theft Auto in an 8-bit simulator. Retro City Rampage is the incarnation of the 80s and 90s. Also the sound effects and music make you totally feel the 80s. This game is a MUST-HAVE for all those who grew up with such games and want to relive the old times. Through, if youâre one of the new age-kids where graphics are everything, you might want to pass.  Once you made it through the handful of training missions, the game opens up substantially, and you can keep both: the comedy and the action rolling at your own pace. Some of the comic moments are so thick that it can at first feel oppressive. Nobody will laugh at everything, BUT everybody will laugh at SOMETHING in this game!  Of course you can keep attention to all missions but the most of your fun will consist of freeroaming the city and just raising hell! Itâs easy to spend hours with it because the game always offers enough to keep you busy. For example whenever you start to kill people (with driving, shooting, punching or otherwise) the police will follow you and you get the feeling of a gangster on escape.  I highly recommend this game. â¥
1722	Decent gameplay, the main reason to bother with it is for all the crazy 80's and early 90's references. There are a few internet meme's strewn throughout and it's all very welcome in my books.  The retro game references are just superb though, with an entire section dedicated to the original TMNT NES cartridge among others, it's a blast to just experience the game as a whole.  The game had a lot of love put in to it, the music is incredible and I had to download the soundtrack afterwards and I still listen to it every once in a while.  Definitely worth a sale price purchase in the 10 to 15 dollar range.  I can't say much about the controls as it basically plays like a slightly better version of the original top view GTA games (1 &amp; 2) mixed with an 8-bit NES style. The map can get a bit convoluted and collectables are a bit annoying to find even with a guide because of the shoddy graphics but it's still do-able with some focus.  The thing is you'll either love it or hate it... and if the references can't save you because you're too young to understand it, then you should probably stay away because it's all about the references, not so much about the gameplay.

1724	If GTA was made for NES, that's how it would be.
1725	8-bit GTA, Music 10/10 Dialogues 11/10 Story 10/10 +There are cards to collect +You can play with your pad I really recommend this game for lovers of GTA, action and retro style. 
1726	This game is great. You can really tell it was a labor of love for the people who wrote it. Not just for the (actually amusing, which is rare these days) references but the art and completely pointless but still great settings like arcade screen borders and color style. I wish more games like this would happen. Too often we get 8 bit â¥â¥â¥â¥ with bad art and content that hides behind the excuse of 'but teh retro'. This doesn't. It's actually better than the original GTAs.  Also the music is awesome.
1727	Retro City Rampage mixes a lot of old school ideas together for a nostalgic experience that is easy to enjoy, but best captured in small doses. I tried the campaign story for several hours, but I found being an errand boy started to get repetitiously boring. That's not to say I wasn't having fun, rather having fun in moderation.  The stuff I enjoyed the most were the side missions where I got to go off on wild rampages with various weapons, although after about 5-10 minutes, I found myself looking for something else to do.  It's definitely a fun way to escape from reality. Plus there's something about scoring points for running people over that never gets old.
1728	The developer really cares about his game!
1729	If you like retro games, parodys, and GTA, then this is the game for you. This is the first time in a while, where i would just run around, instead of doing the missons. This is a plain and simple fun, and funny game. I have only spent a few hours in it so far, and im just having so much fun. The retro 8 bit look is nice, the controls are simple, and it has full controller support. This is the type of game that you can play for 5 mins or and hour. While i bought it on sale, this game is worth the cost, if you like open world sandbox type games. If your thinking about picking it up, stop thinking and just get it.
1730	This game is a NES nostalgic dream. It isn't however, an NES game (just to make that clear)! It is a spoof of every game possible and it does a good job of synthesizing it together. Just get ready for both good and bad (lame) jokes.  The  storyline  follows a person named 'The Player' in which he is essentially a thug for hire. A bank heist goes wrong and The Player ends up stealing a time machine which flings him years forward. Doc Choc (another spinoff of a well known persona) comes in to help The Player recover pieces of the machine to get him back to where he belongs.The  gameplay  is like the first version of GTA. You are able to move in 9 directions and shoot relatively to your position. Weapons are in abundance and in variety from golf clubs to shotguns to the bionic commando arm. Why is there? Why not... why not. There will be situations where you will need specific weapons to accomplish certain tasks. I prefer to use the shotgun over automatics when it comes to being overwhelmed by a lot of characters. The player can choose to free-roam the city or do main missions or side-quests. The game is really over-the-top with everything it does and isn't scared to loosely knock off and ridicule other games.   Any car (or bicycle or motorcycle) can be stolen. Some cars can be modified to be given a jet engine at the back or some kind of armaments. The more you progress in the game, more modifiers become available. If you do happen to break the law, cops will chase you if you break but it isn't as tedious as the GTA series. To get the police off your back, the player needs to find a special police token that will rid them of their wanted level. This token appears randomly in areas or can be dropped by eliminating a certain amount of police forces. In addition to modding cars, the player may mod themselves as they please. Again, progressing through the story will unlock more styles. There isn't much the player can change but hair is definitely one of them as cut-scenes will show 'The Players' face. Throughout the game, there are power-ups that can be picked up to give the Player some neat abilities. These abilities can come in the form of speed or in some obscene form such as a Super Mario cape allowing your character to fly.  The  graphics  are quite basic and provide basic 8-bit fun. If graphics are imperative to you, this might bug you. Although the graphics are simplistic, it seems that the smallest of details were paid attention to. Sure, it is a simple color with a simple outline but the thought of including as much as one can is appreciated. The  sounds  follow a NES scheme. The music station can be changed (there are about 10 stations to choose from) and the sounds are appropriate for the setting. Don't expect to hear triple A explosions but you'll definitely hear everything going on in the game.  I like this game. I personally bought it on it's lowest sale price and do find the price slightly steep. If you do like this though it might be worth the purchase for you. It's good, it entertains, but doesn't try to attempt to break away from traditional gaming. I would have loved to see the game take a bit more risks with it's gameplay.    RATING : 7.25/10.

1731	All the stereotypes of gaming are here! George Romero, Delinquent hair-style, Shaddy time machines, etc. If you have played Jackal on Family Computer you will really see the similarities in this game. It's an open-world game that plays a lot like Jackal. The achievements are tough but a fun to play no doubt!
1732	Humorus, story rich, witty references, retroish, customizations, amazing gameplay and plot. What more could you ask for?
1733	Retro City Rampage.   What can I say? I love this game. I canât even write from an objective standpoint here to make an honest and fair review with this one. Iâve spent over 20 hours with this game here on steam, gotten every achievement- and even then- I didnât quit. I took the time to Gold Medal all the optional missions too. I seriously canât get enough. I tried for hours to put my name up on the leaderboards. Iâm in the top 20 for lots of the missions and Iâm quite proud of that. But enough about me.  Since I canât really come at this from an unbiased angle Iâll just try to explain whatâs it like. It's a retro-inspired Grand Theft Auto-esque homage to everything that was popular before I was born- and I can definitely respect that. I grew up watching movies and playing the games of the 80s- even though I was born in '95- just because of the way my parents were. Itâs a top down shooter in some ways- a bit like Smash T.V. (a game which is actually referenced in a rather obvious level) The game is indeed open world- and has the very same mission based structure youâd come to expect from an open world experience. The cars in it drive in a couple different ways. One is akin to an RC car (a bit like R.C. Pro-A.M) and the other is one of those âDrive in the direction you pressâ things. Oddly- I usually prefer the latter- but mostly because I find it more precise. The story is goofy and out there- but fitting for the game. And thereâs even a few cameos of a few other popular indie games.  This is the kind of game that you might be skeptical of when you see it in action- but when you actually play it youâll see what makes it appealing- surely. Whether or not youâll like it is entirely subjective in this case- but if you have an interest in retro games or games that resemble the kind of gameplay you find in Grand Theft Auto- youâll at the very least get a kick out of it. If you grew up in the 80âs with the games and movies of that decade- Iâd almost universally recommend it.  I canât imagine a situation where someone will buy this game and feel entirely disappointed. Iâd imagine youâd want to pick it up during a sale- as with most things on steam- but I feel the game is entirely worth the full price. Especially if you want to support the developer- whoâs a pretty awesome guy by the way.   I canât wait to see what Brian Provinciano has up his sleeves for the future.
1734	Like 8-bit games? Like Grand theft auto?  like VIDEO GAMES?!?!?!   If your answer to these questions is yes, then buy Retro City Rampage.
1735	'My biggest issue is that I didn't pick this up earlier.' Think that said it all.
1736	I haven't played this game. I only played for the minimum of 5 minutes so Steam would allow me to write a review.   I've bought it because I saw two videos from its creator explaining how he managed to port this game to NES and 486DX and also compress all its assets to fit to a 1.44 floppy disk.   I wanted to find a way to donate my money to him, so ladies would find him more attractive, thus raising his chances of having offsprings.   Our world would benefit greatly from his genius offsprings. Please buy this game so we can have more of them in the future.
1737	so many homages, so many awesome mini games. such a beautiful and detailed style. The controls and gameplay are spot on. This game captures a huge amount of retro feel and charm while adding fresh ideas. It plays and feels a bit like a newer GTA game but with the gaming style of the first one and the visuals of an NES home console.  All I can say is it's a great game
1738	Amazing game, recommend to anyone who wants to have fun and relive the retro days!
1739	Pixel GTA!  It offers much more than just the few hours to beat the story. You have civilians, cops, side characters, unlocks, and just fun 'rampage'. You may beat the game in 3-4 hours but if you explore and visit other things beside main quest you will get much more.
1740	Every moment is thoroughly calculated to make you laugh between the moments you laugh. Not only because of the parodies scattered all over in the game: they just have a sense of humor and know the right way to use it.
1741	This game, This game is one of those games where you derp around and is full of references  10/10, Would derp around again
1742	Take GTA and make it 8-bit and silly as hell!  Graphics: Retro fans will drool over the 8-bit look of the game, which is nice to look at. Lots of vibrant colors and detailed areas to enjoy. And the cutscenes are well drawn and fit the feel of the game. Nothing much to complain about here.  Sound: 8-bit sounds all the way! From the sirens and gunsfire to the music, it's all 8-bit bliss. Much of the music is also nice to listen to, but you have the option to shut it off it it's not your thing. The game also has options for different filters and boarders to make it feel like you're playing it on an old tv back in the day, scanlines and all. Some of the colors filters, while nice options, can hurt the eyes after a bit.  Control: You can use keyboard/mouse or controller, but controller is HIGHLY reccomended. Controls are a bit of an issue, as the default keybinds feel weird and rebinding them is dificult. Once you get past that though, the game plays fine and control is responsive.  Gameplay: This games, despite the cartoony look, retro graphics, and hilarious story, is still a GTA clone at heart. You can mug people on the strees, collect weapons and carjack people. There are paint shops and pickups to lose the heat, and shops to buy skins and weapons. But you also get a few tricks that GTA doesn't, like speed boots, the ability to jump on enemies, add weapons to your cars, and even a time machine! The wackiness really sets this game apart from GTA! The story is also a full on omage to old retro games! The game's missions doubly so! You even have to go visit an imfamous dam from a certain turtles game! The only issue I have is that some of the missions are QUITE long and due to random difficulty spikes, will often take more than an hour to complete, and repsawns during the mission are unforgiving. I have ragequitted a few times because of this. Still, this fact does not limit the overall fun factor of the game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has or had enjoyed a GTA game, but want something more light-hearted and crazy!
1743	This may be one of my favorite games of all time. It's chock full of references and easter eggs from 80's-90's video games and pop culture, as well as hilarious and absurd dialogue. 10/10
1744	I wish i could say i like this game. I really, really do. But it just has massive glaring flaws, that keep it from actually being fun to play.   When the game starts, it's funny. The intro manages to both parody AND lampshade the Megaman 2 intro, and pretty much 90% of the intro level is a parody of the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises, and a well done one at that. Then you step into the gameplay, and it's actually fun. Yeah, it can be tedious at times, but it IS fun. Then, after about the third mission, the problems start.  The first one is honestly one of the bigger problems: The game doesn't understand when there's been ENOUGH refrences. You can't go two seconds without a reference, and while it's fine at first, by the end of it, it's gotten EXTREMELY annoying.   The second one is more of a deterrent to the experience: The random gameplay changes are not implemented well. Why is the final battle a chase with crappy hit detection? Why do you have to run over people in a car that might as well be made of paper? Why do you have to stealth with stealth mechanics that DON'T WORK?!?!?  And finally, the game seems to expect you to be perfect in the later stages. Narrow hallways with enemies with rocket launchers that can kill you in one hit if you don't have a full lifebar? Check. Throwing 15+ of said enemies at you in one room? Check. Massive Zerg Rushes of Enemies with guns when all you've been given is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ melee weapon?  MASSIVE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CHECK.  All in all, this is one of those games that, while i'm glad i bought it, if only to learn about it, i honestly would've been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if i had bought it at full price. It's not nearly as good as the trailers make it out to be. I'd reccomend leaving it be.
1745	Retro City Rampage is pretty much what I'd hold up as the ideal that all indie games should aspire to be like. Some parts are much better than others, but most of it is really awesome.  The one major drawback I see with it is it's free roam mode. This mode feels limited in what you can do. You can do things to get money but there's ultimately nothing to buy. Structuring this mode a little differently could have made it more engaging.
1746	Retro City Rampage is fantastic. The gameplay is simple and addictive, with high replay value. The game is nearly 100% a reference/parody of the 80's (including Back to the Future, Ghostbusters and TMNT) or popular NES games at any time (including Mario, Mega Man, and Rad Racer). It's very charming and doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the coolest features is the graphical options. You can change your 'television' to several different sets, including an arcade cabinet or a Gameboy. You can also change the color settings to look like an NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis, Atari 2600, Gameboy, and many more. You can even turn on scan-lines for an authentic 80's CRT TV experience. My only gripes with this game are particular levels. The underwater levels are overly difficult and frustrating. Another level pits you against several rocket launcher-wielding goons with little to fight back with; defeating them is pure dumb luck. The final boss fight is initially interesting and stylish, but quickly becomes overly difficult and unfair.  Other than these few issues, the game is incredibly fun and I would reccomend it to anyone. 8/10
1747	Retro City Rampage is what you get when you combine a modern open world game with retro 8 bit gameplay and style. Oh, and with loads of pop culture and video game references. This combination of different gameplay and style works well, playing out like an 8 bit version of GTA and similar games with plenty of humor and parodies going on.  The story revolves around Player, the main character of the game, who is a henchman. After stealing a time traveling phone booth that takes him into the year 20XX, Player must work with Doc Choc to fix the time machine and also interact with other characters in Theftopolis to get the needed parts. In the game, the story is driven through missions and cutscenes. Along with the main missions for the story are optional side missions that provide extra narrative based on the main plot. The game uses a lot of parodies and references throughout as seen with the characters and scenery, to name a few. With the sheer amount of references going left and right, itâs easy to be overwhelmed, but the parodies are a good laugh with a focus on video games and 80s and 90s pop culture. The references range from mainstream to obscure and subtle to blunt, and itâs a great experience keeping with the gameâs theme and setting. The majority of the references lie in Story Mode, which really drives not just the parodies but also the overall style of the game.  Retro City Rampage plays much like a cross between open world games like Grand Theft Auto with some gameplay style from NES games. Like in most open world games, there is a big city to explore and missions pointing you to certain locations. The majority of missions focus on getting to a certain spot on the map and doing a certain task. Thereâs a great variety of different tasks to do, making the Story Mode missions interesting with different gameplay goals to complete. In addition to the structured missions that show each objective to be done, there are also arcade style missions with the goal being to get a high score. These arcade missions are quite fun in their own right, focusing instead on pure mayhem and causing as much destruction in the city. As the gameplay borrows from GTA, there are some common elements in Retro City Rampage. Cars can be stolen, pedestrians can be attacked, police will attack upon seeing a crime, and there are a variety of weapons to use. The game does deviate from typical open world games by bringing its own twist based on games from the 8 bit era. Jumping is performed like in platforming games with the intent to jump over obstacles and to jump on peopleâs heads. This jump attack can kill people and is a powerful unarmed attack. Objects and people can be picked up and thrown in a manner similar to beat em up games, where any object is carried over the head and thrown forward. Powerups can bestow different effects. These powerups must be bought unless a mission gives one that must be used, and they give a huge amount of power in a limited time. In addition, the game is quite fair when it comes to trying to complete missions. After dying in a mission a few times, the game will offer some useful tips pertaining to that mission. If the game feels that the mission is quite tough for the person playing based on the many deaths that occurred, the game may change things around by giving a handicap to help complete the mission. This function of making the missions a tad bit easier is not in every mission, so some particularly tough missions must be completed at the default difficulty. Anyhow, itâs clear to see the inspiration from open world games, but thereâs also a great combination with gameplay from NES games that works well as a game that is fun to play.  This game employs an 8 bit pixel style, with a very sincere approach in imitating the style of actual games from that era. The graphics are quite blocky and low resolution in the overworld, as if the game were on the NES. Character portraits are also similar in style, along with capturing the original character or personâs features from the parody. Only a few modern graphical liberties are used, one of which is the wavy screen distortion effect. In addition to its 8 bit style, there are various screen borders that slightly affect the presentation of the game, either by placing high resolution graphical borders that fit the gameâs theme to even changing the colors of the game. With the 8 bit NES art style, the game treats the graphics quite well. Itâs the same way that the parodies are treated with respect toward the original material, and the game goes great lengths into accurately portraying visuals as if it were an actual NES game with great results.  The music in the soundtrack is chiptune like the style of the game. There are some nice tunes played throughout, with the soundtrack being done by various video game musicians. Each of the songs work very well with the tone and style of the game, with a few parodies too based on some popular NES tunes. Overall, the soundtrack is quite catchy and stays true to the general theme quite well. Of note is the sound design, which is done like the sounds of the NES. All the sounds are not realistic and instead go for the beepy electronic noises that were a mainstay of games in the 80s. This design choice perfectly matches what the game was going for, with almost every aspect of the game being lifted from an NES game from its original time. There are only a few unique things seen in modern games that this game uses, but Retro City Rampage does so well in staying true to the original retro video game style.  Retro City Rampage is in essence, an 8 bit version of open world games like GTA with lots of parodies here and there. The story is quite straightforward with the majority of parodies going there for a good laugh. The gameplay draws from GTA the most but throws in some gameplay style from NES games too. To top it off, both the art and music stay close to the style of the NES and holds its origins in high regard. Retro City Rampage is a fun game to play and oozes with respect for retro video games.
1748	great little game to pick up and play. lots of pop culture refferences and gamer/movie in jokes.
1749	Feels like  Saints Row  converted to 8-bit. 
1750	(Of course, this review will be downvoted because it doesn't agree with the general consensus. Good.) Retro City Rampage is a pretty straight forward title. It's retro, takes place in a city, and you rampage. This is the game, a majority of the game. Visually, the game hits the mark spot on, colors and and sound design truly do evoke the right feeling. The missions aren't particularly fun, mainly consisting of 'A to B while C, then return to A', or 'Fill Quota of X' missions. It's an open world, and you can drive. The primary issue with this game is it relies almost entirely on trying to tickle the nostalgia part of your brain and reference things from the 80's. Do you like that? If you do, you might like this game. And in fact, some of the jokes and pokes are humorous, but it feels oversaturated. There's nothing wrong with being an 8-bit style game. But in Retro City Rampage, when you strip away the cheesy reference humor and the old school aesthetic, I feel that you'll find that there's not much worthwhile beyond that.
1751	Super fun. That's all that needs to be said.
1752	The perfect GTA game for 8-bit NES that never was!
1753	This game I already had purchased when it was originally released for XBLA. I had so much fun with it, that I thought I would buy it again when it went on sale for Steam(and all of the udpates that are included)  This game is a throwback to the 'good ol days' of NES. From the creator of the NES rom homebrew 'Rom City Rampage'   He took the idea for the Rom Homebrew 'Rom City Rampage' and built on it ten fold...The result is a HUGE sandbox retro styled 8 bit GTA type game. The gameplay is solid and the ENTIRE game is filled with all sorts of great 80's and 90's pop culture references/parodies. Movies, TV, Video games. You name it. Heck, in the opening gameplay/tutorial there are at least 10 great video game references that most gamers will recognize right away. They come fast, so keep your eyes peeled!  This game has COUNTLESS HOURS of great gameplay. There are plenty of side missions, minigames, and badge/high score runs that you will never get bored. That doesn't even include the storyline missions that are required to 'beat' the game. Tons of vehicles, enemies and 'outfits' for you to mess around with.   I am impressed with how perfectly the developer made the game play and feel like an 8 bit game, yet made sure that the game plays flawlessly.   If you are a fan of GTA, retro games or just fun 80's and 90's pop culture I HIGHLY recommend you purchasing this game. There's NO excuse no to. It's worth every penny.
1754	great game as a younger gamer i loved it lots of funny 80s refrences its a pretty far out game i got chased by ninja turtles, met doc choc and assisted him in wierd tasks,mow down pedestrians in the back to the future car however its a bit  hardenoughtokillyou  hard but i managed with help of brother  if you are looking for a open city game full of funny refrences and wierd tasks (and mullets) then this is the game for you  10/10 would die 400 times again
1755	This game techinically takes only a few hours to beat. However, the proper way to play is not simply to beat the game here. Nay, the true goal is to take as much tiime between missions as possible, thus increasing the playtime by at least twofold. That being said, other than the actual arcade-style games-within-a-game, the only game I've been able to come up with for this is 'See How Long You Can Survive the Police'. The story missions are quite enjoyable and provide the variety I cannot, although there really should have been more of them (especially the non-story missions). The endgame somehow manages to take away both the titular city and rampage, instead opting to throw in a tonne of combat. And then you reach the final boss. While I personally found it a pain to beat, I can only imagine the difficulty one would have with it if they hadn't played one of the aformentioned games-within-a-game. Have fun if you miss one of your incredibly specifically-timed attack opportunities!  In short Retro City Rampage is a fun game, as long as you don't put too much effort into beating it. It's fun, but doesn't have too much depth.  7/10
1756	This is a fantastic game, although I don't usually like indie games going back to the 8-bit era, just cause it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥. This game is very good though and I highly recommend if you can get it for a buck, even your old Windows 3.0 can run it through DOS, I;ve had fun trialing it in DOSBOX and it works flawlessly, very good port.
1757	I was running down the street to get from Point A to Point B, in this epic Grand Theft Auto like game where you can play random arcade mini games during sleep, and was suddenly attacked by Teenage mutant ninja turtles who popped up from from the sewer and I stomped them to death.  11/10.
1758	If GTA was originally a top down 8-bit series on the NES this would be it. It is a very fun game and I highly recromend it.
1759	  This game is GOLD  -LOTS and LOTS of movie and game references -Good and simple controlls (and recognizes my Logitech Rumblepad2 right away) -Nes era graphics style even on cutscenes -Big map, lots of content -Great soundtrack -Nice story -Even a potato can run the game
1760	This video game is a love letter to video games. I'm having so much fun with it. BUY IT YOU DUMMY
1761	This is a top / down grand theft auto clone in 8-bit style.  I think it's one of the best top / down video game of this time. If you love the old GTA video game you really need to try this. It's haves a open world to explore and really a lot of freedom. This games have a lot of missions that will keep you bussy for some time.  + Great Music + Great 8-bit Style  - No Multiplayer  I give it a 8/10. 
1762	One word: Radical.
1763	GTA+8bit+Makes no sence+fun+80s=This
1764	Welcome back to the days of 8-Bit. The game pays homage to many of the old classsics you love and enjoy. Honestly it isn't my favorite game or even close to my top 20 but, it is a game worth checking out if its cheap or if you want that nostalgic feel in a modern game.
1765	I killed over 256 innocent civilians with dreams, jobs, and families for no justifiable reason. 69/10
1766	Very nice retro game, a mix of GTA and nostalgic game of 80's and 90's.
1767	If this game would have released in 1998 it would be called Saints Row and by now we would have Saints Row XIV: Conquer Atlantis Or Saints Row XIV: Get Gat from Heaven or Saints Row XIV: Slaughter of Gods.  Raiting : A crazy ride to 90s town
1768	Prositives:  * More 80's refrences than any peice of media constructed in the past 20 years, brillliantly weaved together. * Good NES music, thats available digitally and on limited vinyll. * Comes with a in-game instruction manual that's just a joke. * Free roam, with an emphasis on killing sprees. Basically, what GTA is built for. * Chris Hoffman himself is a cosmetic in this game. * A emphasis on retro graphics and style-you can even change the TV border (or turn it off) * DX mode makes it easier than what you've heard (and is toggleable)...  Connatatives:  *...but it's still hard. Expect a lot of deaths and some frustrating levels. * Once you finish the story, you're really only left with Leaderboarded-Challanges and Collectibles * The story is about 16 hours. A little lackluster. * If you're not familiar or from the 80s, the game's humor won't make any sense.  SUMMARY:  A radical jet-fueled love-letter to all things from modern gaming's birth, It's a satisfying yet challenging game for those who's hearts and minds are still with their NES. Anyone else, though, may simply be too young to get it.
1769	Really cool game. Great pace, from slow ramping up to insane. Love all the salutes to pop culture. Absolutely worth the current Holiday sale price of $3.   If you love pixel graphics, games like Hotline Miami, you can't go wrong here.   
1770	8-bit GTA pretty much.
1771	Awesome 8 bit pixel game, reminiscent of original GTA with a whole bunch of pop culture references thrown in. 
1772	Retro City Rampage (DX) is essentially a reference-packed trimmed down version of the original GTA games that manages to keep a lot of the original gameplay along with a few other bells and whistles. In it, you take on the role of âPLAYERâ, a greaser caricature from the 1950s who has a lust for wanton destruction. Inevitably you are wrapped up in a plot to save the world from evil via completing random fetch quests and other minutia, even though youâre really just doing it to wreak havoc.  RCR is more of a linear game pretending to be an open world game to the point where I almost wished it was just a linear game. The world map serves almost entirely as a vector to get you from one plot point to the next and typically you will end up with an option list of âdo optional questâ or âdo main questâ. To be fair, this is mostly done for parodyâs sake and the game doesnât really take the whole open world concept very seriously (at one point randomly teleporting the character to save time). There are a few minigames and challenges to keep things interesting in case you decide to wander off the main plot-line and some of them can be pretty tough.   The game eventually does force you into a few very demanding action sequences as part of the main questline but with a little perseverance, and a bit of hatred for water levels, you should be able to make it through just fine. Pick this one up when youâre feeling the need to scratch that retro-gaming itch.
1773	 Heavily resembling an earlier 8-bit game-hence the name-,  Retro City Rampage DX  is an open-world top-down self-aware adventure filled with popular culture references from the 1980s. The player takes the roll of a character name Player who resembles a greaser âcool kidâ from its said zone of reference. With heavy influence from the  Destructoid  crew (back when Jim Sterling was involved), this game features an abundance of weapon types, game and player modifications, and humorous themes. Apart from the content I would like to feature in the exposition of this review, a very noteworthy act by the creators of  Retro City Rampage  was the free update involving the Directorâs Cut (DX) edition, which was supplemented to each other platform as well as Steam.
1774	Retro City Rampage's gameplay, setting and style are summarised by the title. You're in a city, it's based on various old games and the objective is mainly to murder anyone onscreen. It is a parody of the 80's in general, with references to old games, films and pop stars in abundance. The game may get repetitive after a while, but with the astounding amount of content and fantastic references, it will take a while. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.
1775	Great game and lots of easter eggs
1776	This is the pinnacle of indi game done well to me: Not only the game is good (lot of references to other games, good story, lot of stuff to do, good OST), but the game is constantly updated, even 2 years after it's release, which really show how much the devs care about it. I highly recommend it to you love old GTA (1, London and 2) and if you love retro games.
1777	This game is too fun. Its a great tribute to games of the 80's and 90's and gta of corse. I was shocked at how smooth the controls and the gameplay is. This is a must have if your a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series and just a 90's or 80's kid looking for nostalgia.
1778	WARNING! This Is My First Review so sorry if i make a terrible review. The game is a fun open world game where you play as ,,Player'' a guy who went to the future by accident. It has a big city to explore,epic weapons and a ok story. The only problem is the that when you complete the story there isnt alot of things to do. 8/10
1779	a SNES style retro game, using gameplay mechanics that would not have been possible on the SNES. it's a little bit GTA, a little bit RCR, and a little bit modern budget game for XBLA. I wish I had a game like this to play back in 1992, I would have â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.
1780	I think this is even better than GTA, cos it's well... more fun! :D 10/10
1781	whats that timmy? you want GTA made up entirely of pixels and pop culture references? well here you go
1782	This game is one of the few modern oldschool-style games that really captures the look feel and sound of 80s. Its absolutely a must if you grew up back in the day like me and want to relive what made games back then so great. Its so convincing i often find myself forgetting it was made recently instead of back in 1987. Though, if youre one of the new-age kids where graphics are everything, you might want to pass. For the rest of us, I highly recommend it.
1783	Absolutely a must-have, I see no reason why you shouldn't buy this, it is awesome! Unless you're a 4 year old baby who only likes to play Sesame St., you'll like this! Highly Recommended!
1784	RetroCity Rampage  if nostalgia == gameplay (Buy.ThisGame);  else (Buy.ThisGameAt.ADiscount);
1785	Do you like using the sidewalks as roads? Did you grow up in the 90's? If you answered yes to these questions, this game is for you.
1786	Take the first Grand Theft Auto. Set it into an 80s setting. Develop it with fantastic and stylish 8-bit graphics. Fill the game with a billion quotations from the pop culture of the time. Allow the player to use a lot of weapons. Fill the city with awesome challenges. Make everything a bit surreal with super-hero powerups. Blend everything with a kickass soundtrack. Et Voilat! You Have 'Retro City Rampage'. This game is absolute fun! Like a GTA 1 on steroids, but, unlike the rockstar masterpiece, the missions are more varied and there's actually a lot of stuff to do!  I very highly recomend this game to everyone! Except those who can't stand 8bit graphics  (funny thing: you can customise the way the game is rendered. you have a selection of different palettes, which replicate the look of old monitors/gaming systems)
1787	Fun gameplay, great story, it's funny laugh out loud style not just lol, so much gameplay to replay, mini games within a game, mods, constantly being updated showing that the developers cared enough to make this game better and better. when I first bought it there was a few things that just stopped this game from being the best of it's kind. the amount of polish that was applied makes it a superb game. I'm gonna play this and san andreas until I can afford GTA 5.
1788	Retro City Rampage is a unique sort of indie game. It was originally an attempt to remake GTA3 for the NES console, and became it`s own project that was ported to the PC. The influences from that game are very clear, as are the other games the author sought to parody.  The game from intro screen to gameplay is pure NES. It replicates many of the problems that programmers had creating for that system, and in a lot of ways moves past them. The gameplay is modern, it runs at a very nice framerate and in general reminds me a lot of GTA2 in some odd way.   It is also riddled with references, it shoots them out almost as much as a bodily function. So if you like loaded action packed indie games that don`t take themselves seriously, I can`t recommend this game any more.
1789	If you enjoy the classic 8 bit games of the mid 80s to mid 90s, chances are good that you'll enjoy this game. It really plays well, and the attention to detail is incredible. Within the first 5 minutes, there are tons of references, which might turn off some, but I really enjoyed that, and the gameplay itself is very well polished. Highly recommended.
1790	Top-down Grand Theft Auto fan, and possibly retro game fan? Then get this, now! This is basically what the first two GTA games from PSX/PS1 would be like on NES. And it's really fun, with a dash of humor too. 8 bit wanton destruction and car jacking!
1791	Great game, especially if you're into retro games and like 80s pop culture.
1792	This is pretty much GTA pixelated.
1793	This game is pretty over-the-top. Mullets and spread guns run rampant in Theftropolis. There's even a car that runs on running over pedestrians. Pretty neat. It all comes in an appealing 8-bit art style. After the original insanity subsides, you will find plenty of fun missions, almost all of which are based on classic NES games. A great buy for anyone who played Zelda, Contra, Bionic Commando or Mario and wanted it to be overhead and open-world. For those new to gaming or that have only played recent releases, there are recognizable unlockable characters like Meat Boy, CommanderVideo, and even Steve from Minecraft. This is a game made for anyone to enjoy.
1794	Cool game! If you enjoyed the first GTA games, you're gonna love this! It truly is a Retro City Rampage!
1795	Still better than NMS
1796	The best retro game i have ever played. It kind of looks like GTA1 graphics if anyone has ever played that. Retro City Rampage is awesome and fun, what makes it even more cooler is how the screen looks like an arcade machine screen when playing with the added retro sounds. Worth getting if you're interested in Retro games.
1797	For those of you who love Retro Nintendo and Sega games, you should play this. All the fun of GTAbut with a top down 8bit look. Retro City Rampage is filled with tons of references and jokes that would sure to please the classic gamer in you. I give this game a perfect 10/10
1798	well there is a few things i want to clear up about this one, I played this on my vita for about 254 hours 44 min according to my little play log adding up each things 3-5 hours to 30 min a play session. Playing this one it is the same thing with same features just not portable to the vita version (makes me wish i didnt give it to my sister who's daughter lost the charging cord) The only thing the steam has for it are the following  more updates (updates * more stuff / awesome sauce = a cookie) more renames (retro city rampage, retro city rampage DX, you know renameing is good for anyone hehe) less cost ($9.99 steam store vs $14.99 on playstation store at the time of preorder on play station store) better control (root of 3 reason never good with joy stick) mod ablility (square of 3 reasons i got this after the fact) better screen view (power of 3 reason i dont have good eye sight)  i still recommend it for those that havent played the game but for those that have played the game on another console still get this for a little more bang for your buck and some cheating galore (if you want XD)
1799	This is basically like a 8-bit gta game and i whould definately recommend this game but i dont know about if it is worth buying for full-price because it is a singleplayer game and maybe not completely worth the 9 euros in my opinion. This game is actually very fun and i got it for 80 cents and that was soo worth it for this game, when i play league of legends there was long queue times and this was an awesome way to kill time and have loads of fun.
1800	My biggest issue with this game is that I didn't pick it up sooner.  Takes stabs at gaming classics (including Mario Bros, Smash TV, Mega Man, Metal Gear, Road Rash, and Contra just to name a few) with in an 8-bit open world thats real fun to mess around in.  Highly recommended. Especially since its on sale.
1801	Best retro game that I had never seen this before...
1802	If the first GTA was given the elements from the other GTA games and then filled with lots of references, this would be the outcome
1803	It's not exactly my kind of game, but I used to play GTA style games before and the sheer joy of running around murdering people in a game was enough to make me like this game a lot. It's a great game to play when you want to burn time or just lift your spirits. The amount of references in this game is pretty ridiculous and I do wanna find as many as I can. Like I said, not my kind of game but I love it anyway, so go ahead and give it a go!!!
1804	Its like Grand Theft Auto, but with a million times more pop-culture references. Its interesting, well made, and long, despite the fairly low cost of the game.
1805	it is AWSOME
1806	Fun game. Suffers considerably from abysmal controls and abrupt difficulty spikes occasionally. However, I got used to it and managed to get through the game. Most will beat the game at 12 hours max. Not much replay value offered here unless you deem having to complete the game again with the 'TURBO' setting on any remote sense of fun, which honestly isn't. Overall solid game but try to snatch it on sale.
1807	THE GRAPHICS ARE TOO MUCH FOR MY PC
1808	Retro City Rampage is one of my top 10 indie games. It's like an 8-bit GTA with great OST, gameplay, and the story is full of humor and references of movies or games from the 80's. I would def recommend getting the game for sale or even for a full price. 9/10
1809	I felt nostalgic before reaching the main menu...  10/10 nostalgy simulator
1810	Ive had this game for a while now, it is really cool, and lots of fun. Very funny as well, totally worth the money. I think its on sale for $0.99 right now!
1811	this is kinda fun but the grahics are not good
1812	amazing game but i wish i would be able to change the key bindings.
1813	This game was awesome!~ Full of so many early Nintendo game references and newer indie-game references. It is kind of like the first Grand Theft Auto Game in gameplay, but with a ton of mini-games and silly ways to play.  Took me about 4-5 hours to complete, but I did not do all the side-quests. Many of the story missions feel like side-quests but you don't care because you Beat up the 'Saved by the Bell' cast, Play Bit-Trip runner at an arcade, and smash peoples heads like your Mario.  Several guns, a bit of auto-aim helps, and silly melee combat. Just the right amount of original gameplay and lots of throw back gameplay like SMASH TV arena level.  If you loved Nintendo Games and want to play a juiced up, silly, reference to them. I would buy it!
1814	This game is a glorious throwback to the 8-Bit games of old whilst still giving a breath of fresh air in what is essentially an 8-Bit GTA adventure with many cameos and easter eggs.  While the game is glorious on nostalgia however, the gameplay gets pretty dull, pretty fast. The story isn't really captivating enough to demand all of your attention, the most of your fun will consist of freeroaming the city and just raising hell. It's good for a fun time or 2, and considering it's often on sale, it's experience is worth the price you pay for it.
1815	Great Game it tries to parody various classics while maintaing a good gameplay fun storyline and the fun of rampaging on a city the gameplay was built around the older GTA's (top-down view 2D) theme where you can rampage in a big city drive cars, EXPLOSIONS. you can also have various powers one of those is super speed as you trow pedestrians into other pedestrians and cause complete chaos.   There are also tons and tons and tons of referenÃ§es to videogames and comic books movies etÃ§  for 0,89cents Hell Yeah Pick it now as it is cheap belive me you wont find a game better than this one for this price
1816	I drank some 'Milk' and I got high. 10/10
1817	Nice game :D please create multiplayer mode :D its very2 amazing :v
1818	Before i start my review , lett me point out this game plays way better with a gamepad or controller. It works fine with a keyboard but the game is more difficult and less enjoyable to me.  This game is a game full of suprises and yet so much clichÃ©, where you go wtf and say 'ahaha now i get the reference'. The game is kind of a parody of the old gta games, talking about gta 1-3, where you run around in an open world and do quests and sidequests (or â¥â¥â¥â¥ around and do what you want). When you start the game however you instantly notice this is a throwback to the past with references for movies, news and games from the 90's and early 2000's. The basic gameplay is you running, stomping and killing enemies and getting from point a to b. Unlike the old gta games you can get a highscore for killing and stealing stuff which makes free roaming more enjoyable, but the main part of the game are the quests. So far being 5 hours into the campaign i found it extremely enjoyable to find the references in these missions. The missions often contain new power-ups, minigames, new characters and items to keep the game interesting for longer playthoughs. Retro city rampage also has a good sence of humor and made me laugh several times. The animations are quite good as well altough they are pretty simple sprites. Something i have to mention, i like to play the game for around 30 min.-1 hour everytime i play. I think that the game might start to bore you after playing it for more than 2 hours in one playthrough.  Overall i love the stylized graphics and great music a lott, altough if the references can't interest you or if you are to young to get them the game loses some of it's potential. If you like getting highscores, have a good laugh and do quests where you get struk by references at every corner this game is something for you! If you would would like a game with some good mechanics, lotts of minigames and some hours of gameplay you might also like retro city rampage. This game does not have multiplayer for people looking to play with friends!   Overall i would give the game a 83/100  Retro city rampage is surely worth the 9â¬ or regional equivalent. If you think this is to expensive or are doubting that you would like it, then i advise to wait for a sale
1819	Well, if  this  isn't GTA-meets-NES, then I have  no idea  what those two acronyms  are . Serious, this is about the  only  format in which I would even bother with a crime-game like GTA; it's fun, it's goofy, it literally has  all the references ... it's basically just gaming nostalgia force-fed into your face, complete with intentionally poor NES graphics, just to make the experience  complete . Do I recommend this title? Does the Earth orbit the Sun?
1820	It's so fun to play! well that is my opinion!
1821	Awesome indy retro GTA-Style game.  SGB-005 = Supported.
1822	Cool aesthetics, much fan service, recommended! _b
1823	a big phat recommendation for RCR :_)  if the screenshots and promovid dont make you wanna buy it  let the advice of the Cabbit pull you over, as this game kicks â¥â¥â¥, period :p
1824	This is probably as close to an 8-bit GTA as I think we're ever going to get. I love the open world environment in this with this particular art style, and it's nice they included a sandbox open-world mode for those who just want to mess around with everything. Another thing I like about it is the vast array of parody included in it. Everything from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to Batman. If they can make fun of it, I guarentee this game already has. Great to play
1825	I would wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone, it's mix of awesomeness and more awesome makes an epic result of awesome! Seriously though, this game is full of content, be it references, things to do, missions and exploding cops, this game is for anyone (over twelve of course, be legal now) who likes anything I mentioned before. Even for someone who would prefer shiny graphics over the retro style of this game, it would still be a worthwhile buy. I'm pretty sure anyone playing this will at least understand one reference, be it to another game, tv series or anything else. In short, this game is basically a retro style, 2D GTAish game with a ton of references and definitely a good idea to buy for the Â£6.99 pricetag, if you think that is a bit steep, then wait for a sale, or maybe (if you are into trading) buy it from someone else via the steam trade system. 10/10 :D
1826	ITS FUN BUT AKWARD WITHOUT A XBOX OR PLAYSTATION CONTROLLER\ 
1827	This is a great game. If you were born in the 80's and grew up on Nintendo I recommend this one highly. If you didn't it is fun but you probably won't get all the references and jokes. I like it.
1828	This game. Where to begin. This game is like pixelated GTA minus the multiplayer, but to compensate it adds some of the best and most 80's/90's references I've seen in a game to date. You are instantly greeted with references from things like Back to the Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and so many more. Gameplay's a bit iffy, but overall pretty good. In total, 9/10.
1829	Pretty fun classic game i would reccomend it to friends that just like to free roam goof off and have a good time  :D
1830	I played almost every retro styled game and I got to say that this may be the BEST retro game of all time.  The game itself is a GTA 1/2 clone, built in a 8-bit style with many oldschool references, including Back to the Future, Frogger, They See me Rollin' etc. There are three modes: Storyline, Arcade and Freeroam. Freeroam is basically Story Mode without the Story. Arcade mode is awesome, includes so many awesome different mini games. The Story itself is amazing and filled with so many references and stuff that just blows my mind.  Play this game. You will not regret it.
1831	If Bill and Ted would go to 2013 in their time machine phone booth and play this game, they would not be able to describe how RADICAL it is.
1832	I think this game is a love or hate deal. Personally I really like it but that may be due to all of the NES nostalgia this crams into it. If stealing the Turtle Van and beating the crap out of the Saved By the Bell cast sounds fun to you, then pick it up and leave your 'Games Are Art' badge at the door.
1833	Retro City Rampage is basically built on nostalgia, if you grew up with the NES, buy it... If you didnt grow up with the NES, STILL BUY IT!  Both ways, its amazing... :D
1834	This game is a loving tribute to the NES / SNES era of video games (&amp; culture) in an excellent GTA-style spoof.  If you've enjoyed the games of the past with a new twist (complete with some old-school difficulty), you'll want to BUY THIS GAME NOW! If that was before your time, still BUY THIS GAME &amp; enjoy the open-world mechanics.  You WON'T be disappoint with this game (no guarentees on periodic frustration).
1835	Get this game THATS AN ORDER!!!!!!!!!
1836	If you look close.There Might be a pokemon Refrence. O_O LOOK ITS RIGHT THERE
1837	reccomend to people who like GTA and clasic arcade
1838	Retro City Rampage is a must-buy for gamers who love GTA or SR with a classic, 8-bit vibe to it. This game is a HUGE parody that references A LOT of social media and games from the late 80's-90's. RCR is an endless, free-roam game with lots of missions, laughs, and secrets to explore. You can customize your 'Player' and use a variety of weapons or skills to score major points. This is a great game to own in your library at a low $10 and is available here on Steam, Xbox LIVE Arcade, PSN, PS, PC, Ninendo 3DS eShop, and WiiWare.
1839	10/10, would recommend using a gamepad, keyboard felt weird to me.
1840	Very funny game and you will see enjoyable references from other videogames, movies, series, products. Very enjoyable game for a little price. Sometimes i got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of by the missions because they are very often hard because the health runs out pretty  fastly. I like most the free roam where you have millions of money to spend on ridicilous things and use them. Recommend the game for people who like references in game and funny missions :D Totally worth the money! And you will get 8 card drops what is very cool!
1841	It's the GTA everybody wants. Also, it kicks the 80's gaming world in the balls and then makes sweet love to it as an apology. Get it.
1842	This in a nutshell is the incarnation of the 80's and 90's pop culture references and GTA, And i'm glad this exists
1843	ENG:  Addictive and classic style of the GTA game on Steam, a testimonial!  FIN:  Koukuttava ja klassisen tyyliin tehty GTA peli Steamissa, suositteluni!
1844	Absolutely amazing! This game is filled with so many references to pop culture that it blows my mind! 
1845	This game is a love letter to fans of arcade games and open world games!
1846	Awesome. GTA 2 Is back ^^
1847	A masterpiece, fun, nostalgia and a lot of references to games and movies that players will love !
1848	This game is nuts. Completely. I love it.  If it was released back in the days on Commodore64, people would still keep that ancient 8-bit machine for playing this crazy one. The other way, it is a really dense tribute to the whole history of gaming, including so many elements that I'd rather skip listing.  If you have anything coded in your DNA that makes you feel itchy (in a good mean) about raw retro and wicked stuff, just go for it. You won't be disappointed.
1849	If you like games with references to the past then??? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. It's art is freaking amazing, it's not like the wannabe pixel-stuff we see all around, it's actually a limited palett with a nice use of the colours. The humor is great, and the game is like, action action action all the time. And you don't go around and do the same stuff all the time, the game throws you around to lots of crazy â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's worth playing.
1850	If you are an older gamer like myself, you want two things: To relive old games you loved with ruby-coloured glasses, and to chuckle at parody games and reliving 'those were the days' moments in your head, either recalling difficulty, or when you first started up an NES console. This game, is for people like myself who have been desiring something to scratch the itches I had mentioned earlier. A nifty, retro-reference laced game, I have found references from the early 80s through 2000s, I've enjoyed gameplay I have longed for since the first Grand Theft Auto, while indulging in gameplay that is remarkably easier to control. Between the subtle and blatant nods to influences of the past, with gameplay to tickle your nostalgia bone (GUNGAMUNGA! Or whatever that phrase was for the satire of the followers of Sun Yun Moon used by DMA Designs,) or to entice the player who loved the original GTAs and Death Rally who wanted their funny bone tweaked, but no desire to grind the skills once more on game systems who's control is nearly as much an enemy as the opponents programmed in.
1851	This game Is GTA and Saints Row ON STEROIDS, with the most High Definition graphics of the 8 bit era.
1852	A masterpiece, fun, nostalgia and a lot of references to games and movies that players will love !
1853	1-word-review: AWESOMETASTIC!  Buy this Indiepearl, free roam, story, minigames, cameos and lots of humour. This game was in development for years, I pre-ordered it from their homepage because it sounded like alot of fun, and now I can just approve this! Runs on all machines XD!
1854	This game is nuts. Completely. I love it.  If it was released back in the days on Commodore64, people would still keep that ancient 8-bit machine for playing this crazy one. The other way, it is a really dense tribute to the whole history of gaming, including so many elements that I'd rather skip listing.  If you have anything coded in your DNA that makes you feel itchy (in a good mean) about raw retro and wicked stuff, just go for it. You won't be disappointed.
1855	It's fun. You should get it.
1856	It's like a casual Grand Theft Auto parody, its tons of fun though!
1857	Pros: Game is a great parody of many NES games, Back to the Future, and GTA. Music is earcandy in chiptune form. Missions are fun and also have additional options in case you die a lot of times. Cons: Controls are a bit wonky at times (at least for me). While firing weapons or walking, other random buttons were being inputted (holding down would move down and then occasionally move left and fire/move right/move left). The arcade games have no checkpoints or way of saving.
1858	like gta but without the g
1859	its like 2d GTA with a ton of game crossovers. if you hadd multiplayer it would be out of stock XD
1860	Oh boy, I only played a bit of this and, Its a really fun GTA styled retro type action packed game! I really like it!
1861	Flashback to the 80s-90s in this old school kinda GTA game. Very recommended.
1862	AAAAAA!!!!111  THAT GAME IS AWESOME!!!! It feels like I'm 10 years old again! :D
1863	This game is EPIC! A Rewind into 80s culture, everything NES and old school wrapped into one bad â¥â¥â¥ game. If Grand Theft Auto Got Drunk and Made love to a nintendo and shoved some VHS's in the backdoor, then you'd have this game. 10/10 I Want more Games like this!
1864	Feels like a well made SNES homebrew game, and that's totally awesome.
1865	I will be honest when I first got this game I enjoyed it but thought it was way to hard. The missions all seemed very hard to complete and I gave up on it. However this new version seems to be a lot easier to play and to enjoy. Also the resolution on the sprites look a lot better. Before they were very hard to see. Its also got a lot of 80's references inside the game that I really enjoy. A fun and so far easy game to enjoy.  Ok so I got to the very end boss... The few levels before meeting the head boss were not up to the level of play I had expected thru the entire game sadly. Most are one hit kill=deaths. Their is an underwater where if you touch a gear you insta killed. Not to be out done on this insta kill. Also just a side note. I am tired of indie developers including insta kills in their games. TIRED OF THIS TREND.   Their is a mini boss fight inside of a building with gears and some chicks who have rockets that will push you into being insta killed. Then you have the mini boss who can also insta kill you. Sigh.  I did manage to beat the mini boss. So then we come to the last boss. Ugh. Sigh. Head pounding on desk at this point. Your a car with machine guns. This is fine. Why do I have to get carpal tunnel syndrome hitting the fire button for every single shot??????? Thats right no continous fire button you have to press it for each and every shot. Ugh again and of course its not just and the boss on a road. Oh no its you and the boss and other cars and exploding canisters just for more fun. You get 5 chances however pressing the button each and every time to fire( the boss has a life bar that is almost as long as my arm) will cause your to develop carpal syndrome.  I will say I enjoyed the game till the very end levels that still have me scratching my head over these insta kill levels. So their you have it. Is it worth your time? I would say it depends on how much it costs. I would say for the $10 dollars asking price. NO. Its way to expensive for the game price. On sale for under $5 dollars then yes.
1866	I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!  http://youtu.be/CK-k0Fv5hX8  I hope you enjoy! Martyr
1867	Retro City Rampage is a trip down memory lane with awesome game refrences and funny writing but will the game be worth playing ? In Retro City Rampage you play as the Player. He is a criminal that is trying to make it big in the city of Theftopolis, But when an accident happens player is sent back in time and must get back to the present. So hows the game ? Its pretty much an 8 bit GTA and its great. The game has many awesome things that will make you chuckle or will make you want to break youre Pc into Bits. The game is presented in a top down persective and is played in a sandbox style of gameplay. The game will let you explore the colourfull city of Theftopolis and its a big city with lots of stuff to do. Many missions are parodies of classic games like Metal Gear Solid, Paperboy and many more. Many missions have you to pick up some itmes for people and in the other missions you just shoot youre way through dozens of enemies. Now overall there are some problems that haunt thsi game. One of those problems the game is incredibly difficult and some missions are unforgiveble. Sometimes youre charecter can get stuck in the buildings and this game has a cover system that barely works. This game also has an amazing soundtrack to match the style of the game. Overall a really fun game and has many great moments and for the price its going for its one of the games you must own right now i give Retro City Rampage a 9/10
1868	This is a really cool retro-game. The game is a retro sandbox game (GTA 1 &amp; 2 style) with a huge array of weapons (clubs, pistols, rocket launchers, grenades), different vehicles (cars, sport cars, skateboards) and tons of shops to customize your character. Overall, the game is full of retro references for the older players, and fun gameplay for everyone else.  SCORE: 84/100  VIDEO REVIEW  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ61tDShaAs 
1869	I jumped on a cop's pixelated face, then continued to beat him to death with a lovely spanish guitar.
1870	 NOTE: Though my time on this game says 0.1. hours, I played this game on the 3DS to completion. This may affect some of the comments on controls, but everything else is accurate to pretty much any version   Retro City Rampage  ostensibly  is an 80s homage/NES recreation of Grand Theft Auto. However, getting into the game, one will quickly realize that it's a dumping ground for pop culture references, with a game that cannot decide what the hell it wants to be.     Graphics/Art  Usually, faux-retro graphics is a kiss of death for indie games. Far too many developers use 8-bit homage as an excuse to make lazy pixel art. I am willing to excuse it in this instance considering that RCR was originally supposed to be an actual NES conversion of Grand Theft Auto. The character portraits are about what you'd expect from a higher-budget NES game, with the in-game art being fairly small   Sound Design  The music is good, but that's to be expected from Jake Kaufman. That said, he's done far better work for far better games (Check Shovel Knight, one of the few truly great retro throwbacks.) Not that you'd be able to hear the music unless you muted the sound effects, which is a very smart move because Retro City Rampage has some of the most ear-grating sound effects I've ever heard in a game. Every few seconds, there's digitized screeching, what's supposed to be sirens and constant white noise that is supposed to be gunshots.   Story/Character-World Building/Dialogue  Once upon a time in the 2000s, there were two directors named Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. After being part of the staff for the popular Scary Movie series, they set out to make their own comedies, such as Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie. Everyone  hated  these movies, and deservedly so, because in lieu of making jokes about pop-culture, they would just reference the fact that it exists. Seltzer and Friedberg are now pariahs in Hollywood, because everyone hates them.   What does this have to do with Retro City Rampage, you ask? Because I'm convinced that this game's writers' only comedic reference were Selzter and Friedberg movies. The game does not tell jokes. The game tells references. Technically, the whole plot of the game is an *ahem* 'parody' of Back to the Future. The tone of the game is set right at the beginning, where within the span of about six minutes, the game references Mega Man 2, Duck Hunt, The Dark Knight, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The A-Team, Contra, Mario Bros, Frogger, and Bill and Ted (or maybe it's Doctor Who.) See, the joke is that you probably recognize these things and they are there. The villain is literally Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog, except his name is Buttnick. There's a level where you go to a factory. The joke is that the robot is the Destructoid robot.  H I L A R I O U S.     Gameplay  The story mode will showcase several problems with the game 1. There are several missions where you are faced with a ton of enemies, which showcases how bad the lock-on aiming is. It's inconsistent with when it wants to actually lock on.  2. The game has knockback when you are damaged, which  will  frequently kill you in later stages 3. The game will force you into random diversions, usually to show off another 'parody.' Want to ride a slow bike that can barely turn? No? Too bad! The developer remembered that Paperboy existed. Want to throw barrels at a wall and have to constantly douse yourself when you catch fire? It's a good thing that Tapper was a thing the developer knew about. How about having an automatic runner stage featuring a guy who can propel himself with his sweat? Don't know what the homage it, but you get it anyways! Then comes the last two stages. Now, in most video games, you would need to use all the skills you've learned in the game so far to the test but- hold the phone. The developer decided that for the final stages, the player should throw all their skills away and play freaking Outrun. I could excuse the arcade minigames because those were optional, but here, you are forced to play Outrun, while Dr. Robotnik fires missiles at you that are timed to hit you right when it's impossible to avoid them.     Grade: D 
1871	I got biten by Mario in the sewers, and then the Mutant Ninja Turtles pursued me in the street.  10/10, but 2spooky4me.
1872	Basically, it is GTA for the NES. AND IT'S AWESOME!!!
1873	I've always wondered what it would be like to rampage in a retro city!
1874	This game is truly amazing. I wish had multiplayer.  
1875	One of the most fun 8 bit games I have played. It's kind of similar to GTA only on a more funny and less serious tone. Open World and with plenty of references and paradies to 80s and 90s games. Get it for the cheap price during the Spring Indie Sale.
1876	This game deserves my recommendation.  It's fun and well-made.
1877	Brings me back to my NES days lol Pokes fun at alot of 80s games and movies ! So if you are a 80s nut GET THIS GAME!!!
1878	I've been playing this on my Vita a bit. Great game. The amount of game, movie, music, and pop culture references they can fit into the first 5 minutes will blow your mind. Very entertaining game and a must buy for EVERY old school gamer.
1879	This game is hectic. Could tone some down a little to tell the story better though.
1880	Now this game is a fun bit of random 80s and some 90s nostalgia. A lot of fun if you want to blow off some steam...however the whole nostalgia jokes they use in it get old REALLY fast. I mean, at first it was really funny and entertaining. I felt like I could love this game, but then it went on and on and on...it got pretty old, pretty fast. Not to say it's a bad game, it's certainly a lot of fun for going around a open world and doing a GTA which is what the game was designed for along with the sillyness of jumping on people like mario and the many hundreds of game references too. However the funnyness levels do sag pretty fast.
1881	Still better than Cod  Really nice arcady game  gta indie style  My sponsor:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ArchReviews/ 
1882	An 8bit version of GTA with a chockful of '80s popculture references and 8bit thrash metal songs? Where has this been in my life?
1883	Retro City Rampageâ¢ DX is a game that I recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - it has an acceptable price - it is a retro game - it is indie - it is funny - it has a good soundtrack - it has action - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
1884	Decent enough game, though some may not like the constant relience on 80s and 90s references. This is a game you play in smaller doses. This isn't like GTA in the sense of being able to go on citizen killing rampages. You can, but it's not as fun. Lots of content though.
1885	Too much milk can lead to seeing 3D which can lead to random iced tea which can change your life forever. Be safe out there kids of the 80's and 90's, just sit back and breathe in the nostalgia.  Highly recommend this game for any GTA fans or people that can enjoy clever references (lots of 'em).
1886	A pretty fun well made retro NES style game. Every mission you do is some reference to old school NES games or culture back then. It is basically a GTA game on Nintendo which is awesome. If they could've made a game like this for Nintendo it would still be known today as the greatest NES game of all time, but unfortunately 90% of NES games were garbage with the the other 10% being the classics we know. If you are an oldschool gamer or can at least appreciate old school games and aren't some little punk kid who thinks video games started with Call of Duty, give this a shot.
1887	Awesome sandbox made in retro-style. Interesting missions, nice humor and easter eggs.
1888	On the one hand, a tremendous amount of work went into creating tons of mini-games in service of making a reference a minute, and that merits respect. On the other hand, that mostly ends up serving as a reminder of games you liked a lot more than Retro City Rampage.  If you want open-world mayhem, go with something like a Saints Row game, where the city is easier to enjoy. If you want referential humor, grab something like Shut Up And Jam Gaiden, which puts more effort into its punchlines than 'Hey remember that thing.'
1889	Grand Theftendo was a homebrew Grand Theft Auto game that was being developed by Brian Provinciano for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was developed in 2002, and was due to be released in Fall of 2005.   It was never released, and instead it was replaced with a brand new game, Retro City Rampage.  Grand Theftendo was originally going to be a toned-down version of Grand Theft Auto III.  Extremely fun. Definitely recommended.
1890	Retro City Rampage was already a decent game, but the DX version made it even better! Retro City Rampage DX is a GTA-styled game (but with the old school topdown-view), plus all kinds of references from the eighties thrown in to it that you can renember. I'm just 13 years old, but there are quite a lot of refernces that even I know.   For example, Bundy's Wedding Chapel is clearly a reference to Al Bundy from Married with Children. Doc Choc and that time traveling-phonebooth are just references to Doc Brown from Back to the Future and Bill &amp; Ted's Phonebooth.    I like the retro graphics, and the fact that you can change the graphics to old monitor settings, like CGA, Monochrome, and EGA. It's not the best game ever, but the game is pretty cool. And, it's just fricking GTA without the violent blood splatters. And I love blood splatters and unnecessary violence! *sarcasm* I would recommend buying the game, though not through Steam itself. If you go to the  official website   [retrocityrampage.com]  you can get the game for 10 bucks, the same price on Steam, but included with (of course!) the Steam-key for Retro City Rampage DX, an DRM-free version of Retro City Rampage DX, plus all of the soundtracks! But, if the game is 75% off, then why bother and just buy it from Steam. 8/10
1891	GTA could learn some stuff from RCR DX.
1892	Better than GTA VI.
1893	a great title with throwbacks to many classic games, though the only issue i experienced with the game is that is simulates not only the nostalgic feelings of the nes area but sadley also the 'what do i do/go?' feeling that comes with old games
1894	This is a lot of fun for anyone who played games in the 80s and 90s.
1895	Good game, Good Programmer. Compatible with MS DOS, WOW !!!!  Awesome : 10/10
1896	I could not believe how much fun, nostalgic and hallarious this game is!! Everything they made a parody on had to be created by some of the most comedic video game players ever to play games. There were times I was laughing so hard I had to stop and relieve the pain in my abdomin. Where do you find games that do that??? This is the perfect game for anyone that has ever played an 8bit game in their life to the newer generations that get to see how graphics do not mean sh*t when it comes to great content. I scroll through my games list on steam and everytime I see Retro City Rampage It always makes me grin and laugh. I think above all I want to say thank you to the creators for bringing me back to my youth and twisting it with amazing humor. Aces!
1897	looking for MS-DOS games in steam? you are lucky this game is for you, yeah you can play it in ms-dos with floppy disks or in dosbox just look into your files  but if you looking for a 8bit game in steam? yes this game is also for you  BUY IT
1898	Someone tried to make GTA for SNES... and I am SOO glad they did. this game is amazing. Although it is primarily a GTA parody, they also make fun of a TON of other things, such as the video game industry, Back to the future, teenage mutant ninja turtles, Apple, and about a ZILLION other things!
1899	Retro Old school, new school, it has it all. If you love the NES you will love this game! My Video Review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJpuR1bSAA&amp;list=PL324F8735ECCE6C63&amp;index=13 
1900	Old school, LOVE IT!
1901	This game is Awesome! I'm not really into 8-bit game before, but when i play this game i felt i want more game like this.  The main story is simple, yet entertaining. Well actually i don't really get some of the side story, maybe because my english is not really good but still this game is fun to play. And another things that made me like this game is that this game has a lot of easter egg of some famous movie like   TMNT, Rambo, Back to the Future, Robocob, and many more   The things that i don't like in this game is i feel some stages are too hard to finish, even though in the end i finished them. But overall this game is great I would rate this game 8/10
1902	This game is a large parody of movies and other games that takes on a life of its own and is reminiscent of the style of the original GTA games...how they would have looked on an 8 bit system of course...this game is well done.
1903	A retro-styled take on the open world genre. Highly recommended!^_^
1904	If I had to describe this game, the first thing that comes to mind would be, Holy Sh*t.  Must have.
1905	a great title with throwbacks to many classic games, though the only issue i experienced with the game is that is simulates not only the nostalgic feelings of the nes area but sadley also the 'what do i do/go?' feeling that comes with old games
1906	I have only barely tried this game, a couple of times. This is not an in-depth review at all, but simply the thoughts I have about it at this point.  I just can't seem to get into this game. The introduction to the game is hard to follow. It's like everything's on speed, and they tried to add as many retro references they could into as short a time as possible. The graphics are reminiscent of games of old, but the picture is so incredibly busy, it's hard to register what you're actually seeing. It doesn't help with all the achievement and unlock popup messages that seemingly constantly pop up on the already busy screen. Controls feel really awkward, and what you're supposed to do exactly isn't always clear.  The biggest issue for me though, is that it's not really any fun. There's nothing pulling on me here, unexpectedly. I'd rather go back and play the old Grand Theft Auto games (which was the primary inspiration for this game, apparently) or pretty much any other retro game than this.
1907	The game's too short and easy and the whole game after the 1st mission is just a bunch of random events revolving around copycat characters you couldn't care less about. 99% of the plot just rides the Back to the Future train and occasionally mocks soccermoms, the NES/80's references are all either used as a (weak) basis for story missions or appear in passing mention, like the devs were just ticking down a checklist of things to reference whilst they made this.  The BTTF â¥â¥â¥â¥ in of itself is wasted anyway because nothing in the game world (if you bother exploring it before the 1st mission) actually changes even though you've supposedly time-travelled a number of years into the future/past(the game never makes it clear on which one it is which goes to show how little thought they put into it). Yup, they made the whole game a time-travel plot just to wax nostalgia over one freaking film that not everyone is going to have that sort of attachment to.  Most of the side-content such as the challenges and mini-games are a joke and take almost no effort to get gold on. Most of the weapons are identical other than how much damage they do and apart from the speed shoes, the power-ups all feel like an after-thought the developers force you to use in certain missions in an attempt to get you to care about their existence.  The graphics, whilst I get are supposed to match the look of a NES game, are lazy- most of the game world looks the exact same despite being so small, the actual character sprites are â¥â¥â¥â¥in microscopic and have almost no detail so everyone's basically a pallete-swap of each-other with the only distinguishing features being hair/hat. I understand this was originally supposed to be a homebrew NES game (EDIT: proto of said NES game is playable in the DX version, it's cute to look at... for about 5 seconds), but they really shot themselves in the foot in the graphics department by trying to make it 'authentic', especially when I can think of God-knows how many actual NES games with better graphics than this.  The soundtrack is HUGE and there's a decent amount of variety but you barely get to hear any of the good tracks in the actual game unless you fiddle about with the radio stations cos they all play in the story missions which only last around 4-5 minutes at most cos, as I said, this game is too easy. Otherwise get used to listening to the same 3-4 songs throughout the game that get annoying really fast.  For a game that took 7 years to make and kept me waiting for almost 2 years after I first heard about this game before it came out, I was pretty damn disappointed. Buy it when it's on sale and you have about 6 hours to kill, otherwise if you want a good NES/80's parody game, play Abobo's Big Adventure for free on Newgrounds and stay the hell way from this.
1908	I've been following this since it was supposed to be a homebrew NES remake of GTA3. It was obviously made with tons of love, and the 'LOL '80s,' stuff isn't as groan-inducing as it could be. However this thing is littered with outright horrible design decisions like the trailing mission that the game repeatedly apologizes for (and which got overhauled, and made worse since the first patch), or the Tapper sequence where the arc on the barrels depends on finding the exact pixel to stand on. Oh, and all around horrible person, Jim Sterling is in it. I really really wanted to like it, but beyond the first ten minutes, and the maze toward the very end, there's not much to celebrate here.
1909	I don't know why I forced myself through this torturous 15 hours of mediocrity. Controls are extremely awkward even playing on a PS2 controller, gameplay is dull. One thing it has though is varied gameplay - there are many missions that reference other games. Unfortunately that's where it also fails, the game is a massive parody, everything is a parody of a parody. After the first few 'heh's it becomes over used. Then it tries to have some original content and you get explosive sweat man. Suffice to say, I didn't 'get it'. I grew up in the 80s on Paper Boy, TMNT, Skate or Die, Battletoads, Sonic, Mario.. I get the references, but I don't get why anyone would think this is fun.   Retro City Rampage is like someone on a diet who remembers how awesome fast food was, then rolled out some dough, topped it with chocolate sauce, covered it with fried chicken, ice-cream, hotdog buns, skittles and Big Mac sauce and expect you to eat it - but don't worry guys, if it tastes bad it's just a parody of a pizza.   Can think of many better things to spend $1 on.
1910	Let me start off by saying that this game surprised me. I mean, I for one never thought I could actually be bored with a GTA knockoff. You learn something new every day.  Retro City Rampage commits the cardinal creator's sin of giving you content without context. It is essentially the Family Guy of video games, making references to various films and games that only make people laugh in that 'oh, I get that reference' kind of way. I can say nothing negative about the graphics or the controls, as they are watertight, but the story and characters left much (MUCH) to be desired.
1911	Its like skyrim with guns, without skyrim, with gta, with lots of great pop culture references. gr8 m8 r8 8/8
1912	All the elements for a great game are there, but are entirely wasted. As good as 8-bit open world sounds, it all begins to feel pretty pointless very quickly. There's no real motivation to do the side missions and minigames other than high scores. Roaming around town quickly becomes a chore unless you have one of the better vehicles. I can't help but wonder why this wasn't just a linear, old-school beat-em-up, but as it stands now, the open-world element of the game is entirely superfluous. I'd give this one a pass unless the premise really interests you.
1913	This game has a lot going for it. The positives:  80âs and 90âs references are amusing.  Free roam gameplay is really fun.  Challenges and sprees are also great (although, getting gold in some of these is too hard). I absolutely love the retro style.   However, there are many issues that really drag this game down:  The final boss, I gave up. Iâm not going back. The last few levels were horribly designed, and were simply not fun.  TMNT sewer levels were bad then, and RCRâs reiteration is also bad.  With regard to the story, donât ask why, itâs not supposed to make sense. Why should I care about whatâs going on, if the game is constantly telling me not to care.   Performance: no issues playing on PC or through the steam link. Throughout my gameplay I used an XB1 controller, and I did not encounter any issues.   Overall, this game is a 2 out 5. I purchased this game on sale, and I got enjoyment out of it, but I wonât be coming back for more.
1914	I LOVE THIS
1915	This game is great....for 15 minutes. In reality, it's a parody that, like many other parodies, is only funny for a little bit. It's a romp through nerd culture from the 1960's to present, primarily in the realm of video games and television. This leaves a vast source of material to cover, and unfortunately, it makes the novice mistake of trying to hit on way too much at once.   Gameplay-wise, the game is so-so. It plays like GTA 1 (the old one) but the best vehicle, from what I've seen, is the super-speed boots that let you run over people with the force of a speeding train. There are early and wonderful nods to Doctor Who, Back To The Future, old-school Metal Gear, and many other games, movies and shows. Unfortunately, they are wrapped in a plot that seems like Beavis and Butthead wrote it from a cartoon rehab center somewhere. The parodies either drag on or are barely touched and then abandoned. Eventually, you will lose interest in the plot and just tool around trying to make money (which is far too easy), and try to find new things to do.   One of my biggest gripes about this game really had to be the implementation of player-earned penalities. It makes sense if you become a raging alcoholic, you turn into a fatass and nobody likes you (see the Fable series). That's not how this works. Instead, you wander into a 'noodle shop' and buy mushrooms....and half of them hurt you. One, especially at low levels, can kill you dead. You can't tell by the names; it all seems like a good time. Nintendo-hard choices of how to get digitally stoned make no sense, especially when you can die. Even in the 80's, 'Winners dont' use drugs' was about as far as any game took it before handing you a hero that pops painkillers and drinks liquor to heal themselves.   I do like one little easter egg; your 'home base' allows you to play an old console video game. That game is an alpha build of Retro City Rampage. I'd love it if more games did this (how badass would GTA V be if you coudl play GTA 1 in the arcades?). Try it, though. When you feel how unpolished the alpha build was....and how the game feels pretty much exactly like that version....you'll want your money back.   Not recommended unless it's free or 99c and you want some pixel games to go with your booze.
1916	Retro City Rampage might be one of the poorest attempts at cloning GTA in a long while. Developed by one man, which is cool admittedly, it's basically a Parody of both GTA and other games released throughout the years, which is its only saving grace. The parodies are funny! Everything from Duke Nukem to TMNT to Back To The Future to even Jean-Claude Van Damne are parodied and each one managed to get either a chuckle or a nice laugh from me at times. But that's the games only saving grace  The rest of the game is clunky, monotonous, and down right boring. It's main issue is that it plays its trap card too early with it's tutorial mission. After that, the game just copies itself to the point where even the jokes are boring. What hampers the game even more are the controls. Now I hate saying that the controls can ruin any game (I'm able to look past bad controls if the game is fun), but WOW! These controls are both bad and clunky! Not only is it a pain to move and aim, but the driving is what REALLY kills the game. I get the point that it's supposed to be emulating the NES in terms of gameplay, but come on! Even the driving games on NES had better controls then this clunker! When it comes to the shooting, it's even worse. There is supposed to be a lock on mechanic, but it's one of the worst ones I dealt with. Whenever you are shooting, you lock on to any near by targets and all your shots go there. The issue is that you STAY locked on when you are shooting and you can't freely aim at other targets without ceasing your fire and then firing again. This is a major hindrance when you are in gun fights when are you want to do is aim at another target but you keep targeting other stuff that AREN'T YOUR TARGETS!  Sadly, I can not recommend this game what so ever. Not only does it fail in trying to be a good GTA clone, but it sadly fails in being a parody at times. It does make me mad though...when I first got this game, I loved it. But now, the more I play it, the less I love it and the more I get frustrated with it. Save your cash and skip this game.  FINAL RATING: SKIP
1917	Pros: - Sometimes funny. - Lots of other game references, so it's fun to see what you can remember. - Very satisfying to run over lots of pedestrians with a combo chain. - Variating missions.  Cons: - God awful controls especially when you try to aim. If you want to use a mouse like a normal person, then you still shoot fews seconds after releasing the buttons also if you are moving, you will be still moving in the same direction you started to move while shooting. Dunno how they screwed up like this. - Cops who always try to run over you are going to get on your nerves really quickly. It's possible to evade them, but still very annoying, - Challenges... Oh god... Some are really fun and interesting but there is this stupid thing when devs without thinking or trying themselves give a challenge with idiotic goals. For example sweat bomber challenge. It is a very fun challenge where you are just an exploding person who can propel himself with exploding and travel quickly. Goal for a golden medal - destroy 50 cars in 60s. You have to destroy 1 car every 1.2s. Sounds logical? Especially when cars appear based on rng? Really? 47 cars is my cap. Always at the last 5s cars disappear. It is not hard to destroy those cars, there are not enough cars even when you are flying non-stop. - Last mission... I was going to give this game a 6-7 out of 10 score but after that mission I am sticking with 4/10. Not going to spoil what stupidity went on there but Jesus... Now every time I remember this game, I want to puke. Yay.  Conclusion: Don't buy this game. Watch a let's play or walkthrough but don't waste any money on it. After finishing it, you will feel that you wasted ~10h of life for nothing. You will appreciate this game more if you won't be the one playing it.
1918	  Cool game.  [zippy.gfycat.com] 
1919	60 references per second.
1920	The closest I'll ever be to owning GTA V.  But I'm sure I'd have more fun playing this instead.
1921	Retro City Rampage is quite the interesting game, not because it's fun, but rather it manage to reach the point of boredom and cheap thrills. I have mix feelings about this game. While I did enjoy some of the references it's somewhat distracting. Don't get me wrong, I like the reference to 'Smash TV' as much as the next gamer, but if I want to play 'Smash TV' I'll play 'Smash TV'. In fact there are a lot of moments like that. Everytime they bring up those games it just made me wish I were playing the real thing instead. Without the attetion to detail or the at times humorous dialogue the game would be nothing more than your standard GTA clone (except not nearly as fun). I don't know, maybe you'll like the content in here, but it's not for me.
1922	brilliant a real must have
1923	Retro City Rampage is a mash-up of a lot of retro games from the 80's and 90's, with a few movie references in the mix, all set in a GTA (1) style world. Lovely premise, absolutely balls execution. This dyed heap of diarrhea is barely playable. In a failed attempt to recreate the difficulty of the so-called retro games, it's unbearably painful to play, especially the second half of the game.   A few things are done right. It's occasionally funny, but tries a little too hard at times. The soundtrack is pretty sweet and hits the retro spot perfectly. However, once you actually start to play, all the good things get buried under a massive pile of failure. Bugs, unexplainable mechanics, pathetic controls and uninspired gameplay, only to name a few.  Unless you're looking for a night filled with frustration, simply don't buy this game. If you need your fix for old skool games, actually play the real deal, not this half-arsed attempt at blending 50 games into one.    + Soundtrack + Pretty funny  - Everything else  3/10
1924	very recommended !!
1925	Police are smarter than the Grand Theft Auto police.
1926	This is a very Fun game Becuase You get to go around in the streets of town and BLOW THINGS UP!   I totaly recomend this game becuase its Fun and Not to violent. And it has minecraft Content in it!
1927	This is a very Fun game Becuase You get to go around in the streets of town and BLOW THINGS UP!   I totaly recomend this game becuase its Fun and Not to violent. And it has minecraft Content in it!
1928	This game is just.... Bad on PC. I get that you should play the game with a usb controller but, I dont have a controller soooo, its impossible to play this game. Its esentially Final Doom's Controls but just a biiit harder to control.  Overall, its a good game but the PC version is the one that REALLY requires you to have a controller.
1929	You can shoot police with rockets and run over innocent people with a tank within the first ten minutes of this game for no clear reason. 11/10
1930	8.5/10  This game brings out the inner child in me. I love the retro jokes and the feel of playing a 8bit all over again. With added features that change the texture of the world is just FANTABULOUS!  If you miss the old 8bit days of gaming check out this game when it goes on sale!
1931	It's really awesome, tens of years of popculture in 1 title. There's something missing- Anaglyph 3d support for whole game. It'd be AWESOME even more.
1932	This GTA parody includes a ton of classic game references, particularly from the NES days. Anyone who is not aware of that era may want to look elsewhere though.
1933	Grand Theft Retro!
1934	If GTA was made in the 80's this is basically what it would be. I played it on the 3DS first, so I have to learn the new controls, but overall a fun game filled with tons of references! Soundtrack is rockin, the retro graphics make it more enjoyable than other GTA type games, and it's ovel a decently sized map. 9/10
1935	This game is fantastic! I love its older look, The game itself is hillarious and it plays so smoothly. The only thing missing is multiplayer functionality.
1936	It's hard for me to recommend this game. Is it fun? Yeah. Is it worth the price? Sure it is. Is it engaging? Well... no. The game isn't meant to be serious, that much is certain, but I think it takes it's self too unseriously. Everything happens without rhyme or reason and a bunch of references to older video games, movies, comics, you name it, are just tossed into things randomly. Much of the time too much stuff goes on at once and it's hard to wrap your head around everything. And a lot of the mechanics in the game such as cover shooting and driving are just plain bad. It's an average game so its fun to play in short bursts... but other than that I don't know.
1937	Best game for the price it worth it
1938	Awesome game! Its like old school GTA. It has hints of all other console classics in it too. Mostly like old school GTA though. Want a review? TOo bad. Play gta 1 and 2 then youll know what this game is. Or just watch the videpo. Everything in the video it does, and it does right. You want to read an hour long review? You arent even a gamer then; dont buy this; its a game.
1939	The 80s called: they want their culture back.
1940	Classic mischief simulator.
1941	Awesome game, good chiptune soundtrack and great gameplay. A lot of references and things almost every geek love. I really recommend this game!
1942	Very fun if you grew up in the era all of the references come from. It's nostalgia crammed into a game.
1943	Parodies EVERYWHERE This Game...... This Game is Amazing I've purchased this on the Nintendo 3DS E-Shop Last Year and I love it Hours of Fun and all that 8bit Graphics so yummy LOL   Graphics 10/10 Music 10/10 Entertainment 10/10  BUY IT!!!!
1944	GTA 5 can go â¥â¥â¥â¥ itself
1945	loads of fun for 69p or 99 cents in the us. full of hints to retro gaming and child hood memoeys from the eighties would fully recomend.
1946	Well, This game is a combination of many famous titles! Do you want to drive the Delorean? ( Back to the future) If you like the 80's, and pixel games like Super mario, Frogger and even GTA &amp; more... You definitely want to buy this game. Great 8Bit music, Great pixel art design and enjoyable gameplay.
1947	Silly 8-bit Grand Theft Auto parody. The main story is short, and not as expansive as GTA it self. But, the game play an humor is really fun. Really great for people who grew up in the 80s and early 90s.
1948	Welcome to the jungle we got fun and Retro City Rampage Its got everything you want honey, if you loved the 80's Its got the parodies and mindless killing and all the violence need If you got the money honey Retro City Rampage has your disease...  In Retro City, welcome to Retro city Watch it bring the Turtles and the A-Team to their knees  Its got what you need  Retro City Rampage pays homage while parodying so many things from the 80's, and some things from the 90's and now, that its easy to lose track at just how many films, comics, cartoons, etc, that are poked fun at. To add to the whole 80's retro theme the game is an 8 bit throw back to the NES days which may make it unlikable to those who are extremely obsessed with the latest and greatest graphics but for those who prioritize gameplay over graphics and are total children of the 80's and gratitious but very cartoon violence, they'll love this game. Gameplay wise, it isn't unlike â¥â¥â¥ 2, you go around doing missions and side quests, stealing cars, gunning down people, etc, and so on but what gives it an edge over GTA 2 is the games sense of humor. I also recommed this title to those who are into the humor in Duke Nukem and Postal games, the Player (that's the lc's name) isn't as rauncy but it has a fair share of non pc humor.   For the record, the the last review was written with my old account (Devianza97) which I no longer have access to and need to get Steam to delete.
1949	8-Bit Grand Theft Auto!
1950	Its like gta 2 but with hipster
1951	i have probably played this more than i should, love it.
1952	'Good gosh!'  Take the gameplay style of GTA 1 and 2 and add a story involving time travel that throws in pretty much every piece of '80s and '90s nostalgia you could possibly think of. Then add an insanely awesome 8bit soundtrack and sound effects and you have this game.  I've pretty much had a smile on my face the entire time I've played this game. Even repetitive failure is entertaining.   Plus you can jump and stomp on people.
1953	This game is a light, fun 8-bit GTA alternative if you want a change of pace. The gameplay is tons of fun, with you being able to hijack cars and use all sorts of weapons. The story mode has creative missions and has a decent story. However, I wish there could be more content.  Nothing amazing, but pretty good.     7.5/10
1954	Very good.  The spiritual successor of GTA 2.
1955	i am very sure evry gamer in our tiny world want to move around in a pixelited world and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the police with a golf one punch bat(it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing one punch them to hell!!!) yuo can get power up and stuff/there is a free roaming mode.. hell i got this game on sale. 3.60 bucks only,but u know what? it's so good i would buy it for the original price: 10 bucks.
1956	Very fun open world game. Wish it had a longer campaign though, I guess I can try the challenge missions .
1957	what are you waiting for get it already
1958	  Amazing programming, solid and fun gameplay with lots of 80's and 90's nostalgia.
1959	I'm very happy when i play this game, but i think it's a bit difficult for me. If you're fans of GTA or Saints Row, at least you should try this game.
1960	Very good.  The spiritual successor of GTA 2.
1961	i am very sure evry gamer in our tiny world want to move around in a pixelited world and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the police with a golf one punch bat(it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing one punch them to hell!!!) yuo can get power up and stuff/there is a free roaming mode.. hell i got this game on sale. 3.60 bucks only,but u know what? it's so good i would buy it for the original price: 10 bucks.
1962	BEST GAME EVER FOR RETRO GENRE Used to have on my 3DS XL NOW I JUST FOUND OUT ITS ON STEAM YAY
1963	It's probably one of the coolest parody games I've ever played. I just wish there was multiplayer. MP in Shake Down Hawaii?
1964	Its cool. has references and stuff
1965	I grew up playing GTA 2 on a windows 98 computer, this game reminded me of those times years and years ago and Im really happy with it. The game has constant a flow of action and references about movies and videogames. Great gameplay, great story, great atmosphere, great open world and an excellent game overall. Highly recommended even if sometimes the game crashes randomly.   PD: In the files of the game, they give you a ms-dos, ms-dos installation floppy and windows 3.1 versions of the game and that is really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cool.
1966	Retro City Rampage does a good job of hinting at old games from the era it targets at, and even does a good job on some of the gameplay mechanics in game. However, if RCR is a must play for you i would HIGHLY recommend playing on console.   RCR feels out of place on PC as it is constantly reminding you of its tedious and confusing key mapping; and even when you map the keys yourself, it still feels wrong. Different game mechanics, like the mario jump attack, do not work on keyboard, and as a PC gamer it pains me to see they did not put much time into thinking it through properly.   It is hard to give this game a 'no' recommendation. RCR is a game filled with lots of things to do, from playing retro arcade games, to playing a brutal version of Paperboy, and it constantly tells funny jokes hinting at other retro titles. But it just does not work on PC as it feels like too much of a console port.  Although this game does have full controller support, i would recommend players play it on its true platform; that being the PlayStation 3. If a PS3 is not available then buy yourself a controller for PC and save yourself the tedious controls and clunky gameplay with a keyboard.
1967	It's not bad, but it's worst offense is it's mundanity. I got bored, nothing more to it. It's not stupid bad, it just couldn't hold my attention. And those are the worst kind of games. The ones that are merely 'okay' but not good enough to keep playing.  Don't believe people's lies, this game doesn't have any pop culture references. This game  is  pop culture references. There isn't a single individual slice of this game which you can take out of context, show it to someone, and not have them say 'Hey, I recognize that'. The game is self aware if nothing else.  Two out of five Lennys ( Í¡Í¡ Â° ÍÊ Í¡ Â°) ( Í¡Í¡ Â° ÍÊ Í¡ Â°) ( ) ( ) ( )
1968	Quite frankly, it's not at all worth it unless you were DEEPLY entrenched in the era this game constantly references.  The controls lie on the awkward side, and it's nearly impossible to aim in combat, including the lock-on feature... which is annoyingly difficult to lock. Jumping is also difficult to aim correctly. It's probably better with a controller; haven't tried that myself.  The graphics are meh, although I understand that's the point. The arcade-like borders around the game come off as pointless to me, thankfully they can be disabled in the options menu easily.  The story is an excuse plot; acceptable for this sort of sandbox game, and of course allows you to run around a variety of enviroments parodying games of the era. However, again, if you weren't part of the era, most of the references will sail over your head.  The gameplay: run, jump, shoot, evade police, etc. The story missions may screw with that a bit, but only temporarily.  For the third time, don't bother unless you really, really know the era well. There isn't much more to this game past that, in my opinion.
1969	Reference City Reference XD is like Troy McClure from the Simpsons.  You may remember him but that in itself is not amusing.  What you end up with is a classic GTA clone in pixel form, which is fine if you buy it on a platform that does not have access to GTA, such as the 3DS.  Saints Row series does this type of thing far better because it has its own story that sets up the pop culture gags.
1970	After four hours of Retro City Rampage there are two things to say:  1. Technically superb, well playable.  2. This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing obnoxious as â¥â¥â¥â¥. References, references, references and humor from preschool.  The WAY it is designed, the sounds, the 'story' the lack of concentration on one theme, gamemode, level, whatever is so hyperactive that it just bursts my nerves and in the end ends up beeing nothing but busywork.   Result: Competently made, grossly obnoxious busywork that you have to be REALLY into to stand for very long.
1971	Dull combat, cheap wanna clever dialouges and really awful characters marred with mind blowing tedious grind combat. The only redeeming factor for this game is that the retro visuals look good, i havent played too much of it and i have no intention of either it just too dull for my taste if you want you can try it out maybe the retro theme is enough for you to play it at length.
1972	Retro City Rampage would have been the best game ever in '92. The title pretty much sums it up what to expect. Game is filled with pop culture references of the 80's and 90's. Some of them are funny but not enough to make you wanna play this game.  Gameplay it self works fine and cars act exactly like they did on Super nintendo. Everything feels retro as intended: sounds, graphics, menus, effects.   There is nothing new this game offers and nowadays there are much better games like this available. I recomend getting GTA 2 (free game) if you like to play a game like this one. If you want to re-live the glorious pixel world of the past with all its greatness and flaws, this just might be the game for you. Rest of use who has left the past behind: feel free to skip this title.  10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre 8 - Good game, worth your time  7 - Average game, nothing really special
1973	I want to like this game, because it's right in the wheelhouse of a bunch of thngs that should be fun, but it's totally insufferable and that's sad. Literally all the writing in this game is REMEMBER THAT VIDEO GAME YOU LOVED IN THE OLDEN DAYS HEY HEY GUYS REMEMBER HEY GUYS REMEMBER THAT TIME THE THING HAPPENED HEY WE ARE REMAKING THAT SEQUENCE HERE HEY HEY GUYS HEY THIS IS SO FUNNY HEY GUYS LOL.  It's too bad. There's actually the basis of a real interesting game here, but this is the video game equivilant of that guy you know that is about one one-hundredth as funny as he think he is, and it kills the whole thing dead.  Also, no remapable controls is an inexcusable PC programming sin at the best of times 15 years ago, never mind now.
1974	Retro City rampage is lacking in both depth and originality and tries to mask it with a retro theme and 80s pop culture references.  At its heart it's a GTA clone that is quick to pull you in and then quick to fall flat. The pixel graphics and simplistic gameplay are charming at first but grow tiring in a hurry. The missions and challenges are frustratingly frantic and unbalanced. The jokes are mildly amusing at first but just boil down to a series of references. It's like 'the big bang theory: the game'  Just look at the hours played by those who recommended it. Countless positive reviews from those who played 2 hours and then forgot the game existed.  Had this come out in the early 90s it would have been amazing. As is, it's a forgettable and mediocre game that leaves you wanting to put it down to play the classics it constantly references.
1975	It's basically a pixel version of Grand Theft Auto. It's certainly playable, but I often feel like games like this are just trying to tug at gamer heartstrings out of some sense of nostalgia. I'm glad I got in in a bundle, because I'm not sure I would have gotten it otherwise. I have no idea what it retails for, but if it's any more than any Grand Theft Auto title, you may as well just get one of those instead.   
1976	I didn't play the game much (half an hour? A bit more perhaps?) but I hardly think I will play it again for long, if ever: the graphic is very nice, the music does it's job (until now it has been ok, not superb) but the game has some *very* serious issues with rithm and humor.  Humor-wise, it looks like it has been written by a 9 years old, or a bunch of drunken nerds: citations, memes and other stuff *everywhere*, and without style. The authors tried the hardest to stack tons and tons of innuendo, winking at this brand, that superhero, etc, but they did it so just throwing stuff around wihout thought or respite.  There is no single line of text that's not a reference to something (a videogames trope, TV, other titles: you name it) and in the end, the result is just a confusing, boring mess. It's like hearing Jon Stewart in fast forward, without pauses between the jokes to enjoy them. And if you think it's cool, think again.  Same problem goes with sory and rithm: the missions are rushed and everything seems to go way to fast. After the first 10 minutes you already start skiping dialogues (it's the usual bunch of so-so puns, random objectives, etc, so why care?) and after half an hour you find yourself in a grand theft auto city, but wihout much interest in exploring or doing much.  The story jumps from one place to the other without a logic, and the settings are good looking, but logically inconsistent: city -&gt; military base (so far so good) -&gt; underground hi-tech complex (ehm...) -&gt; obstacles run in the same base (wtf?) ).   Might be funny for nostalgic of for the kind of people that get all excited at *counting* references (loook! The ninja turtles!!! Look! It's robocop! Look! That's the car of the A-Team...). Everyone else: stay clear...
1977	This is the crown jewel of all retro games on Steam.
1978	a fun top down 8bit gta with a campaign full of refrences and a really fun free roam mode 10/10 ign would play again
1979	Prepare for a totally unfunny oversaturation of pop culture refrences for no reason! Also, incase you couldn't tell, RCR is a GTA clone, and has a criminal protagonist.
1980	a fun top down 8bit gta with a campaign full of refrences and a really fun free roam mode 10/10 ign would play again
1981	Not a review, but some of my impressions can be seen at  https://youtu.be/A1oJJrGaxmM 
1982	really fun but gets kinda boring/short after a while  Reminiscent of the battletoads tunnel sequence because last boss is impossible  pros: +graphics +soundtrack +references  neutral: +/- gunplay, using wasd to aim/move then using a button to tap fire which already feels clunky OR using a huge honking ugly as crud cursor  cons:  -last boss basically impossible -some missions frustratingly irritating at times
1983	God this game is so shucking AWESOPME
1984	Boring
1985	This is an amazing game that you could run on a potato. Nuff said.
1986	If you watch AVGN or/and if you like old NES Games or/and if you like 80's Action Movies then GET THIS GAME! xD
1987	I AM REAL PINK SHEEP
1988	its looks life a great game.. BUT it is so lagged out that i cant even control my chareter and has made the game useless
1989	Never even played this, i bought it for like 50c or somthing on sale like 3 years ago and never touched it xD
1990	its really cool. Its like gta but pixel and retro and old school. All in all its a cool game  
1991	This game is what duke nukem forever shoulda been
1992	My ex wife still misses me...                                                      BUT HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER!                                                              JOAJE
1993	Awsome 10/10.
1994	So much Violence So many quests So many weapons So many cars So many people...to KILL I honetly don't even remember the plot of this game i've just spent too much time having fun. 5/7 perfect game with an addicitng kickass soundtrack.
1995	After the first ten minutes I was done with this game. The game is only kind of fun, but it would be passable if the game was better written, or at least had a general idea of what comedic timing and pacing are. It is CONSTANTLY referencing something. There is no way I will finish this game, because it beats me over the head with references that I pick up on instantly, then continues to pursue the reference just in case I have haven't played the original metal gear games or if I have never seen Back to the Future.
1996	i was wriitng review when suddenly 400 references to vvideogames appeared in my room and then left just as quickly then jay sherman appeared and sayd IT STINKS and i had to agree with him
1997	8bit Grand Theft Auto + 90's Gaming Parody. Absolutely recommended.
1998	Avoid this, sure it's GTA style but the missions are dull and they focused too much on the references (I don't wanna keep being told IT EXISTED) and barely a thing original.   I do like that the sprites look close to real retro NES the pathetic retro look indie games mostly go for. I can praise the music, as a listener of chiptune I give the music (That they probally choose the cheepest'/free authors who got theirs in a youtube chiptune compilation ) a thumbs up... if the massive amount of overeferencing like Disaster Movie (Which is a DISASTER itself) didn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off and they just fixed the gameplay, dull missions and original content.
1999	While mocking the modern games and referencing the old ones, Retro City Rampage doesn't provide much in terms of production values. It has cheesy story and dialogues, eye hurting pixel art, chip tune music, sketchy sfx, top down view and everything else you'd expect from a game made in the early 90s.  But guess what, I played a similar game 20 years ago and I don't really want to repeat the experience. You probably know that game, it's called GTA. And it basically did the same as what Retro City Rampage is trying to do, but in a more elegant way.
2000	I want to love this game, I really do. This game is pretty fun, most of the controls are pretty awkward though.  Having to use shift to lock on &amp; shoot targets? You can set it to aim with mouse. Pressing ENTER to enter cars and other things? I would prefer E but I got used to it pretty fast. Having to press TAB for switching weapons? NO.  The problem (With me at least) with this game is that the weapon switching is way too slow. To give an example, Part 5. The Contraband base.  I had INSANE amounts of trouble trying to switch to grenades because enemies kept attacking me, so I would waste 1, ONE GRENADE and I would have to start over because the game only gives you JUST ENOUGH grenades.  Now before you say 'Oh but the game is tough!' well, bad controls do not make a game tougher.  Now, outside of this, the game is pretty fun. Hitting people with the cars is silly fun, and the game has tons of references to retro games. But this ONE problem I have with the game makes me want to put it down. Weaponswitching is awful.  Please, add an option to let us switch through weapons via 1-0 keys and this game will be playable for me.
2001	Its fun you can steal cars shoot stuff and play bit.trip super meat boy and a weird eating game so its fun
2002	Really just a bad game. Reminded me of Half Minute Hero in that you play for a few seconds then watch a cut scene. Not for me. Got old fast.
2003	Give me my freaking cards!
2004	Review Haiku.    Nostalgia abound. Heavy handed, bad controls. This game isn't good.
2005	Fun,Awesome,Pixel,2D,,Like GTA game from Niko Bellic what is better then get this game from Niko Bellic ?!
2006	Retro homage with nods to countless classics. Great pixel art style and oldschool music. Sadly, the controls are lacking and the gameplay is so-so. 2/5
2007	Retro homage with nods to countless classics. Great pixel art style and oldschool music. Sadly, the controls are lacking and the gameplay is so-so. 2/5
2008	It isn't worth the 15 dollars but if you can get it for sale it is worth every penny This game features many parodies of old 90s SNES games the sound track is amazing the control gets a little bit buggy overall if your a an 8 bit fan or just want a casual game this is the game for you but totally notttt worth the 15 dollars just wait for it to go on sale
2009	The game may be fun unfortuantly for a lot of people including myself it's imposible to get it to recognise a controller (in my case a wired Xbox 360 controller). The Keyboard controls are horrible. Making the game near un-playable.
2010	This game is the very definition of overkill. Can there be such a thing as too many references? YES. Every second of this game is filled with costant references to movies and other games and it becomes mind numbing really really fast. Most of them are just simply references that really are not funny moments in the first place. The game never lets up and just lets you play. It was the most painful 16 minutes of my life. I will never play this game again. If you want to try it, do not pay 10 bucks for it. I paid a buck and still somewhat feel that it should have been cheaper.
2011	what's not to like about 8-bit.
2012	This is a basically an indie version of Grand Theft Auto. Retro-graphics with chip-tunes, all pixeled out. Its a fun idea and the references are all great. It is chalk full of homages to all the greats (and not so greats ;)). There is obviously alot of love put into this game with constant updates, since I have owned it anyways. If you are into it, there is also several game modes that will get you plenty of hours.  One problem for me, and why I ultimately do not recommend it, is the controls. I mainly play with an X360 Wireless. Driving is obnoxious - its the style where 'up' on the controller = 'straight' regardless of your current orientation. It also forces you to map your own controller instead of recommending a default config. I mean the devs should find a tried-and-true setup and just recommend that (they surely can recommend something from all the time they spend playing it).  Second problem is the core gameplay. After you strip away all the clever references, you are left with some really bare-bones game mechanics that requires little skill or learning, and is mostly short little epidsodes that you plow through with little grace. They certainly try to have a strategy angle, but I don't think it matters too much. Maybe it does if you are trying to get top scores or something, I cannot speak for that.  When it comes to indie love, this game has it all, but falls short with core gameplay and controls.
2013	The concept is good; the nostalgia is great; but that's the only redeeming value this game has. It's clunky controls combined with attempt to simulate the old consoles will have you firing in the wrong direction and facing 4 or 5 enemies shooting in succession before you can even get one shot off in the opposite direction.   It's fun, it has it's moments; but it strives too hard to be as hard as the old-school arcade games...and scucceds in being more difficult and clunky than even ET for the 2600.
2014	Synopsis: A 8 bit NES era take on Grand Theft Auto.  Yea!The shooting is good, a varied amount of game play types from the NES era and the story and starting references will make you smirk and remember the old days of NES games  Meh! But the reference parodys quickly lose their novelty as your constantly bombarded with them. Controls are extremely akward and most of the time it is difficult to perform what you want to( from stomping on guys to driving).  Bleh! The difficulty ramps up towards the end making it vastly more frustrating then challenging. Being crammed into small coriders where you get pummeled by 1 hit kill rockets or thrown into rooms with out a weapon and guys having guns could result in many many level restarts. The final boss is also a frustrating expierience with the need for pixel perfect percision(which the akward controls makes difficult) and timing.   The Lowdown: I really wanted to like this game but just couldn't, the controls are akward in almost all aspects and this is with trying a controller and keyboard. The game starts off great but quickly loses its flavor of fun. The references come out like they are being forced(should of cutdown on them and fleshed out some more of the more popular ones). The difficulty changes midway to a point where it becomes frustrating when you after to do the same level forty times due to you missing a set of triple jumps by a few pixels to you being stuck in a 2 block hallway where 6 guys shoot bazookas at you killing you in 1 shot before you can get your own shot off. Its a joke and a waste of time that you could be playing other games that actually make difficulty fair.Beating a gmae should feel like an acomplishment, but this one i was just glad that I was able to remove it from the backlog and off the HDD. Only redeeming factor is a quick end at 5 hours.  Haters are gonna hate but i rate it 2/5. Only worth it through a very cheap sale
2015	A car hit me, now every cop in the usa wants to kill me
2016	Seemed enjoyable at first, but it is unplayable to me on a normal PC. I ride around town for a while. Get lots of guns. Get upgraded car. Unlock plenty of new outfits. Then I SAVE my game and start STORY MISSION 1.  Game hangs during the bank cutscene. Unfixable. I load my saved game, and all my unlocked stuff is gone. My guns are gone. My score is gone. My car is gone.  Searching online reveals the game has a history of bugs and driver issues : ( All hope lost.
2017	Avoid at all costs. Frustrating controls, lackluster humor, and obnoxious missions. I can't warn against this game enough. If a parody of 90's gaming and TV is what you're after, there are better places to get it.
2018	DO NOT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥! I thought it would be the game like GTA. NO! it's NOT! This game is anti-human. i spent a bunch of time for doing the missions, and i still couldn't pass it. If you have passed a difficult task that took you much time, and you thought you are such a patient and skillful player,started looking forward to a easy task, you are completely trapped by this game! This game's tasks are INCREDIBLE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hard like the game's poster said. i used to think it's much worth than 1 dollar, haha, how naive am i!
2019	It's cute, it's funny, it's retro as hell. But i'm not gonna waste my time on it. Support the devs, try it out if your looking for something special on a rainy day.
2020	not what i expected at all. misions are jumbled and seem to just be a chaotic mess as you float through them trying to find your favorite 90s cartoon characters  Note: i did enjoy seeing all of my favorite 90s charatoon characters
2021	dont buythis game, worst controls ive ever used in my life, stupidly annoyingly hard, if your driving any type of vehicle you will hit every car on the road and have forty cops on you at all times. DO NOT BUY this game is equal to paying to suck a horse's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2022	higccuhj
2023	This game is full of reference of older games. Some will get the jokes, others not.  The game is fun but meh in my opinion. I have to admit i didn't a lot of 8-bit or some these in the past so yeah.
2024	A game capable of bringing tears even to the hardest of men. Tears of boredom that is.
2025	Excerpt from PRO GAMEZ 64, Jul/Aug '88:  DEZ: I like my games to have a high ChallengeFactor, but basing it on â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls won't do. MISS!  BAZ: This game got loads a bits from them films I seen down the cinny. HIT!  MOZ: Honestly, there are far better softs to get for your micro. MISS!  JIZ: Don't bother solving this tape, write over it with Adam Ant songs off the radio. MISS!  BOTTOM LINE: Give Retro City Rampage a MISS!  PRO TIP: To make things happen, press buttons on the controller.
2026	Retro City Rampage is to video games what a Wayans movie is to film. A constant barrage of references does not equal clever or funny writing, and the feelings of nostalgia they may invoke will only distract you from the fact that you will inevitably grow old and die for so long.
2027	FUOK IS GAME TO HALL THE GAMES BAD  
2028	A game which tries far too hard to be funny and just comes off as jumbled. If you can get it for a dollar or two it might be worth your time.
2029	This game is just a frustrating pile of crap. If this game were released in the 80s or 90s, it would have received horrible reviews for control scheme alone. Not worth the money.
2030	The very definiton of tries-to-hard. So packed with cultural references they forgot to include a solid game as well. About five minutes in and you've tapped its pale GTA imitation dry.
2031	Extremely lackluster gameplay, not nearly as funny as it tries to be. Total slog of trivially easy free-world components mixed with unfairly difficult platforming segments.
2032	Mocking bad gameplay elements from the eighties WHILE USING those *exact* bad gameplay elements from the eighties is not how you make a fun game. It is how you tell the player to go eff themself.
2033	It's.....meh, the story mission became insanely difficult and infuriating, it counts you;re deaths and there is no good enough reward FOR TWO UNDERWATER LEVELS! if this game is on sale for a dollar, than you can get it but otherwise noooo, there isn;'t enough or good enough rewards for the stuff you have to do
2034	This is more of disclaimer than a recommendation. The game is trash in short.   There simply isn't any focus on gameplay, and it constantly hides behind the image of 'parody'. This would all work well of course, if it was even the slightest bit clever or well written. It plays more like a shallow game version of Internet Nerd humor, filling the screen with a jumble of obscure 80s references with no context simply for the sake of it. Rather boring to play and quite exhausting if you're looking for a good gameplay experience. Hotline Miami (released at nearly the same time) is a much better choice in every single regard, and in fact cheaper.  Can't recommend this at all and wish I didn't even pay $7.49
2035	It's retro and I rampage around the city.  8/8 gr8 tr8r m8
2036	Buy it if you're really into memes because this game has them in spades mixed in with 30-second gauntlets of borrowed mechanics. The shooting is okay but the game as a whole is boring and devoid of originality or any surprises. Didn't think you'd be playing Dig Dug for 30 seconds at some point? Well you should have just assumed so. This game is obnoxiously referential. Buy it if you think something is cool just because it's retro but you don't have the skills to make it through an NES cart, or if you have a really hard time picking up subtlety.
2037	Turned on a cheat because I saw it on the wall. Gave me speed boost that lasted 2 minutes. Played ten hours and wanted to save before last boss. Apparently using any cheats disables all saves. Deleted game.
2038	This is a game that seemed it could be fun on a small handheld device, but an odd fit for a PC. I tried to get into this one, but the plot was simply uninteresting, though there was a small amount of nostalgia that made a few parts of the game fun/funny. Overall, considering price, fun, and replay value, I'd have to say to avoid this one.
2039	This game Is a story game mostly It gets boring then fun then boring. I do not at all recommend this game at all. At the end this game is SO BORING!
2040	A game that celebrates the frustration of old NES games, hooray! I guess it can be fun if you've got heavy nostalgiagoggles for the NES and also like GTA/sandbox games? If not then I would probably recommend passing on this game, whoops!
2041	Average game , thought it would be better extremely disapointed
2042	this game was just annoying from the beghinning
2043	kinda feels like they just crammed a million billion things into one thing and none of the things are really very good.
2044	love the game but after the story theres literally nothing to do, DLC plz?
2045	Me, 7.18 PM. Oh cool, retro city update, WAIT WAAAAAA, DELUXE?!?! I play it, feel nauseus, i feel ill, zoomed it perspective Go in options, change zoom to 1x which is like the original, play the game again look at the the map Nice New inventory system, alright... looses the difficulty a bit but it still works the same never the less Go on a rampage Realise its retro Go on a retro city rampage Classic
2046	Quite possibly the worst game I have ever played.
2047	Don't even hesitate, GET IT! Very good game! Full of nostalgia moments/feelings.
2048	Have intercourse with my ear-hole.
2049	If you like riding a giant gorilla while blowing up cars and murdering pedestrians and policemen then I highly suggest this game.  Or how about taking shrooms then highjacking a van?  A mission where you must murder civilans using the Tanooki Suit?  Or just making fun of every game from the SNES era?  This is for you
2050	At first I was like: 'meh...'. But I gave it a shot, and in return I played a cool retro game, that maybe does not have the most original gameplay, but is packed with popcultural references to the max. So you keep playing to see, what else have they parodied, and in the meantime you find that the game kept you for good.
2051	This game is really good. The DX version surely makes everything far better. I highly recommend this game especially with a gamepad. The weapons select system is just great and much better than pressing the left or right bumpers cycling through 20 or so weapons. The challenges make this game highly replayable and the main missions are so much fun! This is a game to always come back to!
2052	TL;DR: Good comedy multi-genre game with horrible controls.  Rest of review:  Retro City Rampage is hilarious. It has so many pop references around every corner that I can't help but laugh at the cameos from Paperboy, Sonic, Mario, Ninja Turtles, Bill And Ted, Back To The Future and so on. It also makes light of the game development process by giving the player a 'ROM City Rampage' prototype version of itself inside the player character's room. The game relies on its humor and does a good job of keeping me entertained.  The controls are a different matter all together. For starters, you're not given controller support, even though the game's store page and the game itself both say you should be able to use a controller. I was tempted to map the controls with XPadder, but I didn't feel like going through the trouble of that. Regardless, the default keyboard control scheme is not very comfortable, and I found the mouse useless. Aiming at enemies without stepping into bullets was difficult because I could not control where I was looking while I was moving. The auto-aim system doesn't work well, and I can't auto-aim at everything. Overall, the game is frustrating to play because of the control scheme.  If you don't mind a little frustration and are looking for a funny 2D RPG shooter, Retro City Rampage should be your first choice.
2053	This game is AWESOME hahaha. I have all these new games, yet this is what i'm playing... on my new liquid cooled X99 system with i7-5820K, R9-290, and a bunch of unecessary hardware lol
2054	Fun, worth getting for sale if you are into action games
2055	This game is awesome. Like many have said, its pretty much GTA. The humor alone makes this game very enjoyable. It's quick to pick up and play at anytime and has a pretty decent re-play value. A lot of dedication went into this game and it totally paid off. I'd highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys nostalgic, fast paced GTA styled games. 8 out of 10
2056	Gta if there was no bug in the system to form the gta's we know today  1 : Super easy to run i get over 317 fps on this game all the time (11 year old laptop) 2 : If board play this! 3 : Just a fun game!  Downsides are the badge takes too long to make and thats all to be true  3.7/5 Good Game but make the badge easyier to get ;-;
2057	A very funny parody of old GTA style video games that still retains a level of enjoyment.
2058	Retro City Rampage is a very fun game with gta style gameplay, 8=bit graphics, and funny parodies. I think anyone who likes gta would love this game.
2059	While it feels like several indie games these days attempt to play upon our nostalgic love for the 80s and 90s era of video games, Retro City Rampage takes the trope to levels that I donât believe have yet been reached. Pixelated and chiptuned, youâll know that exact feeling from the minute you start the game and hit the start screen.   Retro City Rampage plays more like an NES game than any other recent title I can remember, and not just from the style. The controls are tight and limited, but jumps are very hard to land. This becomes frustrating later in the game, as Mario-esque head stomps are required to dispatch certain foes. This does not translate well into 8-direction movement, as you tend to slide all over the place trying to land on a character the size of a dinner plate. Vehicle controls are fine, however, which is a benefit since youâll spend an extended time zooming around the town in the various cars you snatch, GTA-style.   While I felt that Evoland took a good idea and didnât take it far enough, Retro City Rampage doesnât have that problem. The creators of the game seem to have first-hand knowledge of the golden era of videogames, and pop culture references come flying by â Iâm very sure that there were several that I missed completely. Saved By the Bell, Back to the Future, Terminator, G.I. Joe, Sonic the Hedgehog â the list goes on and on, right up to recent memes that still managed to find a way in. With this amount of references, it would be an easy thing to feel inundated by all of the content being thrown at you, but I never felt like it was too much, or going too far.   There are a few difficulty spikes that are frustrating, particularly with the combat, as some enemies are simply bullet sponges that will require you to strafe and jump and shoot like a madman. There is a simple lock-on feature, but I felt it was somewhat unreliable as I tried to clear rooms of enemies. Wide-spread weapons, such as the rocket launcher, gained primary use for me, as I just had to aim in the general direction of some foes. When it came time for me to face those same weapons, however, I felt almost helpless. Plus, the end boss of the game doesnât fit into the rest of the gameâs dynamic at all â the end stages are completely based upon Rad Racer, which really serves as a knuckleball to the gameâs pacing and would have served better as a side-mission somewhere else in the game.   The game has a healthy amount of content, with a few side-missions and some achievements to chase as well. You can play through the game once again in Turbo Mode once youâve completed the adventure at least once, though personally I felt like I had my fill after the first play-through. I may return to the game down the line, for achievements, although I am satisfied with the time I spent with it.   Recommended for those who havenât yet tired of the ânew indie game in a retro style,â as long as itâs on sale. It makes for a good weekend play.
2060	TOTALLY RADICAL DUDE
2061	Retro City Rampage DX is great fun to play and beautifully presented, though I can't see it lasting for too long. This is fast and furious, short and sweet indie gaming at its best.
2062	It's Gta in 8-bit with tones of references about the nes era Gameplay is simple but good (nothing horrible) 
2063	Pop culture references everywhere! Great game I intend on finishing (if thats ever possible)
2064	Amazing game. Lots of catchy references. All around very difficult and very challenging, but worth the money 100%.  ~javi
2065	Alright.
2066	Rockin this with my PS4 Duel Shock controller. This is one hell of a bang for your buck tons of fun to be had here.
2067	Shopping carts have radios 11/10
2068	So, you read the negative reviews and decided not to buy this game? think again, sure its kinda unplayable with a keyboard, and its hard to connect an xbox 360 and just because of that people call this 'garbage' I call it 8-bit heaven, it takes the mechanics of gta advance and gives it 8-bit graphics, good controls (well, it requires a logitech gamepad, and if you have that then its good controls, if not then dont be lazy and buy one) and all of the retro jokes you can get, there is even a secret lightgun that jokes around, when you fire the screen flickers black and the enemies turn into white squares for a split second, just to joke with, the only problem is that the smash tv refrence level is just way to hard, the ninjas when you get to the night part cant be beat, but besides that the game is good, heck, the game has the doc from back to the future, in which he tries to help you rebuild your porta potty tardis, again, its kinda unplayable with a keyboard but with a logitech controller, its fine. there isnt any blood, untill you activate a cheat (no it doesnt activate cheat mode, theres another one that unlocks turbo mode, again, doesnt activate cheat mode) which is a refrence to mortal kombat SNES where instead of blood it was sweat, and people thought there was a cheat that added blood, all in all its a good game for retro guys, 9.5/10 stickmen     O O O O O O O O O  \|/ \|/ \|/ \|/ \|/ \|/ \|/ \|/ \|/  | | | | | | | |  /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ - .5 because of bad keyboard controls
2069	This is the Beast NES Style Retro Game ever made. Every time I play this game, it reminds me of the good old days when I use to play my Nintendo NES Game System as a Kid back in the 80s.
2070	This game is absolutely Nintendo Hard, by design. Floaty controls, unfair enemies, the whole schtick. If you're looking for a punishing game that's at least hard but fair, try Dark Souls instead.
2071	This game is lots of fun! Combine the game's over-the-top, goofy events and characters with the original top-down Grand Theft Auto style gameplay and countless references from classic films and games from the 80s and early 90s, and you've got a good time. This game is worth every penny dropped.
2072	A Great funny game that anyone who likes GTA ot the 80's will enjoy but i wouldnt reccomend if you are tuned off by games with 'Bad Graphics'. its also very cool just to go to the arcade or mess around with the graphics settings. i love retro so i love this.
2073	This game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing NOSTALGIA BOMB!  There are so many references, anyone that lived during the NES age will smile when playing it. Until you meet the rocket launcher goons. The â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ rocket lancher goons.
2074	There's no wonder why it took Brian years to make this game. The tutorial alone is a love letter to all the games we played as kids. There is such a surprising amount of content to see, and the game is filled with easter eggs. It's silly and awful and wonderful.  Try to find some blue/red 3-D glasses, then buy this game.
2075	What a ride! I would readily pay 10 times the money for a sequel.
2076	The 80s and GTA had a baby and it's AWESOME!
2077	A great overhead destructive shooter with a great deal of old school game and movie references. The game also delivers and comical and fun style of gameplay to accompany the silly and action packed story. The game also features greatly done pixel art and music to really engage the player into the 'retro' style. 8/10
2078	All the 8-bit glory of the NES days, with all the parodies and references you could cram into any given situation. Retro City Rampage is, essentially, Grand Theft Auto merged with all of your favorite NES games. Yes. All of them.
2079	Have you ever played those old school NES games and wanted to relive some of that again? Well retro gamers rejoice! This collaboration of gaming references and 90's movie humor is just for you! This game feels like GTA on an NES cartridge but there is much more beneath its appearance. Like the ingame arcade with minigames such as a pixelated Epic Meal Time, Bit Trip and Virtual Meat Boy! ( I rated that high cuz' that was my favourite part :) )  + You can change in the main menu whenever the graphics should be a retro remix or original 8-BIT colors.  + The already mentioned arcade.  + GOOMBA STOMPING!!  + Your acquaintance, Doc Browns less successful cousin, Doc Choc!  + You can unlock secrets and reveal different playable characters and skins!   + An completely perfect experience on a 360 controller!  + A soundtrack that would make AVGN swoon :3  + Challange during heated fights with the cops!  + STEEM TRAJDING CYARDZ!!   All in all, I would rate the game an entire 10 outta 10. I might speak of it lightly but my opinion is stated. 
2080	Commited crimes, have the A-team, Ninja Turtles, and popo chasing me. killed them all.  9001/10 would play again   i would write a full review,but i was felt slept, leave massage
2081	This game is all sorts of crazy. Any fan of 80s pop-culture will get a kick out of this game. The gameplay in itself isn't anything amazing, but you come for the aesthetic and the humor which it has plenty of. A pretty large world all things considered with many challenges for you to complete.
2082	After what has been thus far 8 hours of gameplay (and many more to come), I've reached a conclusion. I'll make it quick: If the name 'Retro City Rampage DX' isn't appealing enough for you, you can try 'GTA '85: Back to the Future Edition. It's basically the same sh*t...........just buy the f*cking game already.
2083	Great game.
2084	Stop questioning whether to buy the game or not. Just buy the thing. No regrets/10
2085	Grand Theft Auto, NES style! A must play!
2086	Loved The Game
2087	- Stole a bus - Painted it yellow - Named it banana bus - Got dual-grill gun - Shot everyone I encountered - Killed police - Got away with it  10/10
2088	A Great GTA Like Game With So Much To Do.
2089	The best retro looking/feeling game I have ever played
2090	This game is one of the best indie titles I've had the pleasure of playing. Its reminiscent of the classic GTA games in play style and is loaded with 80's pop culture parodies. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a well programmed game to play casually or who is looking for a game they can sit down and play for hours.
2091	Back to the Future meets NES/80s references galore.
2092	I can not recommend this game enough. This is a free-roam game thats kind of like the original GTA, but on steroids. There are 80's references everywhere, too. With a bunch of weapons, and a lot of fun, you can put hours into it. If i had to say something bad, theres no multiplayer. But other than that, its amazing, and its only $10. BUY IT
2093	A love letter to the 80's, with lots of references per second.  If you're fond of retrogaming and the first two Grand Theft Auto games, it's a buy.
2094	i got dis game for a doller i think it was its 9 dollers now ._.
2095	If you grew up in the 80s, prepare to have most of the pop culture of your generation satirized. Well worth the price of admission as it's done well for those that remember the early console days, and if you came of age in the 80s it really should be in your library. Younger players may find less to draw them in with intentionally and well done retro gaming mechanics, graphics, and audio though.   For what it's worth this gamer gives it 8 out of 10.
2096	Great retro version of that sanbox game of rampages! Many referances to pop cultures and easy to pick up gameplay, Retro City Rampage is for everyone!
2097	You love GTA? You love NES? You love pixel graphics and retro music? You love LOTS of references? You love rampaging through the entire city? You love playing with a controller?  If you answered yes to all those questions, WHY THE HELL ARE YOU NOT BUYING THIS?! GET THIS ASAP!
2098	Like Grand Theft Auto compressed into a tiny .BIN file and produced. I dunno.
2099	I barely know what to say about this nostalgia fest. It's amazing. If you are an 80's or 90's baby, BUY THIS GAME.
2100	This open-world game combines the gameplay of the original '97 Grand Theft Auto with a plethora of retro cultural references. The arcade feel is complete with various graphic options to help you relive the adventure through the simulated view of a number of classic consoles and themes, itâs touches like these which complete the feel of this game. If you enjoy endless streams of pop-culture references and the thrill of a pixilated shootout I'm sure you'll enjoy Retro City Rampage.
2101	A dirty love child of everything you've ever loved from gaming pre-2000AD. Glorious, cheeky, childish, immature, incredible, OUTRAGEOUS, RADD!, fantastic, disgusting, perfection.  BUY. THIS. NOW.
2102	Do not buy this game. seriously, IT SUCKS AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!
2103	First 10 minutes of game there is a Tardis and Doc in a Delorean from Back to the Future, 10/10
2104	'LETS HAVE COFFEE' procedes to have sex on the kitchen table.
2105	A lot of old school gaming and movie parodies. 8-Bit GTA and Arcade fun. Surprisingly polished and well thought out game.  8 out of 10
2106	Its like GTA but you can drive properly
2107	So !  If GrandTheftAuto would have came out in 1986, that's probably what it would looked like.  The fact is, this game is full of geeky and pop-culture references, with an arcade gameplay and jokes all around.  You like BTTF, GTA, Old School and rollin' over people's face ? Then buy it quick.
2108	gta 3 meets mario and river city randson
2109	An 8-bit Open world with lodes to do, stuff to see and many refrences to see and play.Retro City Rampage is many hours of fun. (Final score 8/10)
2110	Excellent soundtrack, tons of excellent graphic modes to tailor the gameplay to suit you perfectly, tons of weapons, great characters, witty, cheesy references, awesome cars, the list goes on!  Worth buying for the soundtrack and references alone tbh. Imagine GTA: Vice City and Commando for the NES had a baby together? that baby would be Retro City Rampage &lt;3  I got this game on sale for 69P, the same price as a bottle of soda, Excellent game!
2111	Good game, I give it an 80's reference/10
2112	10/10 Would Mindlessly Run Over Pedestrians Again
2113	pixel graphic of GTA 1 and Back to the Future with chiptune. I really like it!
2114	Did I enjoyed this game? Well, I certainly did, in the sense that I think it's good fun, and there is plenty of stuff to do, and overall I think it's a good game. Although missions are varied, but it comes back to 'drive from A to B', only to find out that you have to return to A too often, and I didn't particularly enjoyed driving through the city as much as I thought I would. Also, the controls didn't clicked for me.
2115	Recently purchased this as part of the latest Humble Bundle, seriously fun, takes me back to original grand theft auto!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ATkDpUKJc 
2116	Extremely fun game. Picked it up in the humble-bundle. Definitely worth the money! I recommend you buy this game!
2117	PROS: This game is awesome. It's like a 16 bit version of GTA. You can drive cars, shoot people, hit wit' a bat and it has hours of exploration that will have you playing for a long time. I beat the game and still think about playing. Also, in my opinion the mini games are quite interesting. The story is entertaining and the missions are fun to go on so that you can increase your skill or just have fun.  CONS: After you beat the game the rush of blowing stuff up and regular activities may fade. (Like mini games and missions). Some stages may provide little to no challenge for some, but don't misunderstand me, if you are human, you are bound to make mistakes that will cost you your life.  INCONCLUSION: Retro City Rampage DX is a great game weather on sale or not. This game is for sadists that like breaking the rules and having fun. This game isn't for you if you want a long story.   9.1/10.
2118	Great 8-bit GTA style gameplay and refrences to other games that will make you chuckle or burst out laughing. Retro City Rampage is a game that all gamers should play.
2119	This game has a lot of great stuff going for it.  First off, the gameplay is really fun and can get challenging in spots. However, it all stays fair and I never once felt like any of my deaths were cheap or unavoidable. It was always something I could've gotten myself out of if I had simply played better. The feel of the controls helps in this regard, as they're very tight &amp; responsive, just as you would expect from a game of this style. One negative of the gameplay is... driving is a bit of a hassle, as you would expect from a top-down game like this, since you can't really see what's going to be in front of you and unless you have the city layout entirely memorized, you might end up crashing into a wall or two.  The graphics achieve the nice retro NES look that they were going for, and even when the novelty of it wears off, they let you choose from a lot of different graphics filters, many of which emulate the look of different retro game hardware. It's a really nice touch and allows you to keep the game looking new &amp; interesting throughout the duration of the story mode.  The music is also very good. It's a bunch of catchy &amp; memorable chiptunes made very much in the style of NES sound hardware, while not strictly adhering to it's limitations. It fits the game very well, and will likely get stuck in your head later on.  There are some challenge modes with online leaderboard support as well, which you can either find in the world (much like the 'killing sprees' in GTA) or access from the main menu. These manage to be pretty fun if you're looking to compete with your friends. They even include replays for these challenges that you can watch for players on the leaderboards, or which you can save &amp; share with your friends.  The story is probably the weakest part of the game, essentially being a string of retro game &amp; movie parodies, which are cute at first but end up getting a bit tiring about halfway through the game's 8-or-so hour length. Still, the gameplay is fun enough that it's easy to overlook the annoyance of the parodies after a while and just enjoy the game for what it is: A fun throwback to the classic 2D top-down GTA games which has a really cool, retro style, good controls, and a nice slate of features which will keep you coming back to it.
2120	I love this game so much! I have made several Yt-Vids on it too :-)
2121	Cool, really cool GTA clone. This game have tons of references to popular games of 80's like zelda, contra, road rash, etc. It's fun, it has cool missions(not stuff like go there and kill this guy, really cool diverse quests). In some way there are hardcore moments that frustrated me a bit(VHS show on the end), but in fact i enjoyed it.
2122	Unique and so 90'ish !
2123	This is without a doubt my favourite 2D game on Steam. Great easter eggs, references, and more! You'll always discover new stuff. And the most fun part is rushing through the city with a rocket launcher causing lots of destruction!!!
2124	fun, great for completionists, tons of extras
2125	Another one of those times where I don't know if I should click 'yes' or 'no' on the 'Do you recommend this game?' thing. If you're into late 80s arcade games, this will probably entertain you very much. But if you're not into that, do not let the 'positive' reviews deceive you.   Gamers nowadays like to shame people for expecting modern graphics in a game, not enjoying 'retro' themed games and etc. (Undertale was the prime example for this. There were witch-hunts for people like me that didn't enjoy that game.) If you weren't old enough in the late 80s, you'll miss most of the jokes. If you're not into fast-paced, non-sensical action that is most arcade games, the gameplay has nothing to offer you. And then the price tag I thought was a bit too high for the emount of content this game has to offer. (The store page has different prices for different countries though.)  To sum it up, this is a very specific game. If you're not into old-school arcade games, I see nothing to like in this game. I'll give it a negative review because of the reasons I listed above, though I do see what's good about it if you're into the genre.
2126	Cool game. A mix of NES with GTA. Will tell friends about it.
2127	It's basically the first two GTA games in 8-bit, and loaded with references to many things from the '80s and '90s. Great for nostalgia, still a good game overall.
2128	80s and 90s Nostalgia Wrapped in a GTA Tortilla Burrito.  Fun yummy goodness.
2129	This game is so...                             CCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY... and cool
2130	This game is very similar to the first couple Grand Theft Autos. Lots of retro game humor and throwbacks and fun game play. (if you enjoyed GTA)
2131	AWSOME I like playing as steve c: Its awsome! busting action! althrough levels get realy hard sometimes which is awsome!
2132	Take every retro themed game you know (or are supposed to know) and put them in a theme of Grand Theft Auto. Boom. RRCR goes on and on.
2133	Pixel GTA...what more do you want?!? personally im a very indie gamer and this game is one of the better ones. the way you can stea cars and run over little a bit people is just... INVIGORATING! buy in technical terms gameplay is solid, story is interesting, art style is perfect, and the refrences are funny. its all around a fun game to play so GIT IT!!!
2134	When I switched to using an xbox controller instead of keyboard, I enjoyed the game much more.
2135	Loads of 80's humor. Nothing like running over the ninja turtles and then stealing bill and ted's phone booth time machine so you can rob a bank.
2136	There is no reason for you not to own this game... Plus there is a really nostalgia enducing sonic location. So buy it. You.... Beautiful little internet person... xD I swear this game is 95% good. The flaws are s slight they are not even worth the mention. This is paying respect to retro, the right way (take notes avgn adventures) Buy it. Enjoy it.
2137	You will do such things as robbing banks, running across streets with fast moving traffic, go down warp pipes, get accosted by the ninja turtles and A-team, steal the TARDIS, and team up with Doc Brown.    That's just the first mission.
2138	What started as a Demake of GTA games, became the definition of sandbox refrence joke gameplay, witty humour, retro feel, and indie awesome, there's nothing you couldn't like! unless you find keyboard manuevering via arrow keys hard...
2139	An insane love letter to GTA, 90's gaming, and various other things. A fun game to toy around with
2140	Hours of mindless reffrencing fun
2141	the controls were a little hard. i should've used a controller.  6/10
2142	Awesome game on many levels. Alot of customization. Stealing cars. Free roaming. An arcade with three hilarious games to play. Parody's of everything 80's. There's alot to do and see, and I have been having a blast. It's definately worth the price. Especially if your a child of the 80's like me.
2143	I LJN made a sweeping epic, well... this is it, though it is backhanded it is a complement. I liked it, and recommend it. The soundtrack is some of the best chip music EVER! I mean EVER! Some tracks move me to tears.
2144	No other game has made me laugh this much in a long time.  The story is ridiculous and amazing. It's essentially a random assortment of old school video game jokes and internet memes that are somehow woven into a narrative that is better than most storylines coming from games these days. You'll be laughing the whole way through this game.  The gameplay is very simple, top down old school GTA style with more of an 8 bit feel and a combination of driving, shooting and platforming. It's very easy at first but the difficulty ramps up later in the game and definitely when trying to 100% the game. Very reminiscent of a challenging NES game.  What can I say about the art design? It's 8 bit, it's awesome, exactly what it should be.  The sound is incredible. Most of the music sounds very familiar to old favourite NES classics. Certain tracks made me feel pumped as I raced to the next mission.  Achievements are mixed bag of story progression, jokes and completion. To get all achievements will be a challenge but to those true completionists getting all the achievements and 100%ing the game will be a rewarding pain in your â¥â¥â¥.  If you are all about modern games and can't look back then this game isn't for you. But if you grew up or even played and enjoyed your share of 8 bit era games then this is a must play!!
2145	Why review this one when everyone knows it and have their opinions on it? Simply because since you either like it or you don't, Well... I like it so yeah, thumbs up.
2146	amazing pure comedy brilliance
2147	Not bad, pretty gud actually. Also funny.
2148	A part of me feels bad for Retro City Rampage: critics were a little too harsh on this budget game, and the rabid fervor surrounding Hotline Miami overshadowed RCR rather quickly. On the other hand, the project may have been more than the devs could chew. The game blatantly markets itself as a parody of retro gaming, for better and for worse. The music is charming, and the graphics suck in an oddly endearing way. The checkpoints suck and the difficulty spikes at totally random intervals. You get the good with the bad. The open world is rather robust, surprisingly, with dozens of different characters and styles to customize your character along with collectable sex hotline numbers and drug bags. Oh right, this game is rated M and it wants you to know that. The writing is witty, albeit one demensional and chock full of lazy and uninspired refrences and supposed in-jokes. It was fun while it lasted, but I don't think I'll be returning to RCR in the near future.
2149	Badass GTA style game with retro graphics!
2150	this game is one of the most fun games i've played. When i started the campaign i got board really fast, but in the free roaming mode, thats when it got me. now i love this game. everyone who is wondering what to buy, buy this.
2151	Arcade gta. Simple as that.
2152	Back to the.. greatest theft auto?!  Open world.. a lot of weapons.. cars theft.. and tons of humor. This game brings us back to good old 8-bit classic graphics with modern vision of the great shooter. Non-ordinary story wrapped in excellent implementation. BTW.. game size is only about 30 Mb and yes - originally this game was a tribute to GTA3 for NES. But now it's a product with own storyline.  So.. Should it be played?: Sure! Should it be buyed?: Totally sure!!
2153	This game is a love letter to anyone who grew up on Nintendo and the internet.
2154	This game for only 0,89â¬ (easter price)? I paid full price and the game was damn sweet even then. Do not dillydally. Buy this game now!
2155	Fun game to waste some time with. Loaded with parodys! In the first 15 mins I saw things from Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Ninja Turtles, Mag PA, and much more!
2156	I like it!The game have a lot of old school details.The graphics are great and remindes to old day games.
2157	Dear god YES! It's like this awesome combination of the original GTA, Warioware and so much retro popculture awesomeness.It's like the naked gun movies but in retro NES gaming goodness! The minigames are worth the cost alone!
2158	Imagine GTA as a NES game, but add an absurd amount of customizability and pop culture references, and make the story mode every single game from the entire 8-bit era smashed together.  Now imagine that being kickass. Buy Retro City Rampage, and you won't have to imagine anything.
2159	Omg it is a super fun yet hard GTA-ish game that is on sale for $00.99 as of may 20
2160	Its a cool little game and its fun for a while
2161	What kind of nerd would play this? Not me, certainly.
2162	The humour in this game is amazing, the references are great and i got it for 99 cents so its AMAZING!!!
2163	Absolutely love it so far! Of course I was born in 1988, so i get a lot of the references I've seen so far. I've noticed nods to everything from Metal Gear to Duck Hunt. Ultimately, it plays like the original Grand Theft Auto, but it has a much more arcade feel to it. It needs to be played to really understand what that means. Everything from the sound effects to the graphics scream late 80's/early 90's, and I have loved every minute so far. Nostalgia meets modern conveniences and advanced controls. I couldn't be happier with it, especially for the $.99 I paid for it. It's worth the $9.99 standard price, but on safe for $.99 it would be insanity to pass it up. FRUN.
2164	This game is AMAZING !
2165	Ok this game caught me off guard. Though my game time is small, I can already tell that I am going to love this game. If this is on sale, pick this game up for sure. My rating is a 8/10.
2166	This has to be one of my favorite games, at this point. This is literally old-school Grand Theft Auto if it were on the NES and as full of pop culture references as it could get, and it just works. Honestly, this game has been incredible amounts of fun so far, and I recommend it to anyone who just loves a game full of comedy and fun.
2167	I just sat and played this game for 2 hours straight. It's comideic value alone makes it worth buying, not to mention its mechanics and retro feel. In the two hours that I played, there were at leeast 10-15 references to geek culture. All around great game.
2168	Nowadays, modern video games always include classic video game references, such as Mario, Sonic and Zelda, in order to make them more old school and nostalgia to it. But RCR isn't only that but it's also a game that WAS meant for old school fans of video games. It was originally meant to be a remake of GTA III under the title Grand Theftendo but was later changed into a original game in 2007 with the title being changed to Retro City Rampage.  Story focuses on a guy simply named player who was working on a bank heist with the Jester until he time travels to the year 20XX where a young scientist names Doc Choc finds him and helps him get back to his year, 1985, by finding pieces of the time machine which breaks down when you travel  Gameplay does have a GTA feel to it in 8-Bit but also throws in many video game references within the first 4-5 minutes of the game. Theirs also references to classic shows and movies from the 80's. You can also do side jobs in order to make lots of money. And you can even play as famous characters from indie games such as, Super Meat Boy, Steve from Minecraft and Commander Video from the Bit.Trip series.  I say get this game if your a hugh fan of classic games or if you love the GTA series as well. You will be hooked in.
2169	This game is awesome. If you have only a mild appreciation for the 80's + early 90's you probably will still enjoy this as a game on it's own.. but if you fit the target audience of someone who loves the 80's and early 90's? Just buy it. Retro City Rampage will make you nostalgia all over yourself. 
2170	YES! RCR is an excellent throwback to 80's and 90's video games, music, movies, etc. but with a top-down open world perspective. This game is great, aside from a few minor control issues and random difficulty spikes. Definitely recommended!
2171	It's not worth the $9.99 dollars it usually is, but for the 99 cents I paid for it on sale, totally worth it.
2172	Controll is a little bit hard to master. But the gameplay is not that bad.
2173	This game is the ULTIMATE nod to NES gamers!!!
2174	nice retro game,, reminds me my childhood.. :D
2175	great fun... I just wish that there was multiplayer :(
2176	This game is an om-age to retro games while being fun, i found myself actually feeling like I was back in time enjoying some core 8 bit game play, it plays like a top down GTA 1.  If you were born in the 80's and like top down GTA type games, buy this.
2177	I think I honestly had more fun with this than GTA IV and V combined...
2178	This game is like GT* 2 Games, but with awesome bunch of 8-bit music. The gameplay crazy like S*int Row series with futuristic mission and story. Love it so much :)
2179	It's everything I had hoped for! Story mode exceeded my expectations and makes for a much longer experience that will be fun all the way through.  You can get into any car you see and go complete the mission assigned to you. The city is full of hidden jokes and pickups, and nothing rushes you from just going around and exploring before your next assignment.  And they designed it so no level would be too insanely hard, so if you struggle it helps you out.
2180	Don't know what people are saying that this game has weird controls, pretty sure the dev was just left handed because for once controls on a game are awesome for me, bought it on daily sale at $0.99, best $0.99 I ever spent. for sure totally worth it, have not even touched campaign yet
2181	I paid Â£0.69 for this game and the whole things takes up 35mb on my hard disk and with this in mind, it's actually ok. I really dig all the nostalgia
2182	it a fun free roming game that has a lt of awesome stuff
2183	Great game it has the old retro feel with a modern twist :) Got it on sale but way worth more than i payed for it :) this game is very enjoyable if you like killing everything:D
2184	Great game with many references to older games.
2185	A fun top-down sandbox game, very similar to GTA 1 &amp; 2. There's many references to the 80's and 70's, along with many video game, both old and new, references. The music is great, and it's fun to just run around and blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up.  The dev still supports the game, occasionally adding new content, such as better graphics, more features, and even mod support for altering fonts, color palettes, character models, and so on.  This is a great game to run around doing random crap and missions, many of which emulate old games like Contra and Metal Gear Solid 1. If you haven't guessed, this is a parody game, and it's great fun.
2186	This game is super rad! :D You should totz go buy it ESPICIALY with the sale going on!!!! OMG Wallnuts!
2187	On sale for '99c' with trading cards &amp; a download size of under 30mb,full controller support,retro customisation and fun nostalgia included...need I say any more?
2188	ah.............. where can i get some of this cereal.
2189	If Gta was made on the NES :D full of references it's a must buy for any free roaming loving gamer :D
2190	This game is amazing. It's like GTA 2 for the Play station 1, but i personally think it's abit better than that. I don't know the playtime yet, because i haven't finished the game, but if you're done with the game, i think there's alot of site quests to be done. It's a really cool game open world and i've heard it's commin' to the 3DS. I think it's a great idea to have the inventory and minimap on the bottom screen of the handheld, but i dunno about the 3D for this game... But it's a great game for a 2D game.
2191	I don't even know what to say.... 99 cent 2d Grand Theft Auto. ENJOY!
2192	Get this now. It's only 99 Cents
2193	I first bought and completed this game on the PS Vita, so when it came on offer (for the TUBULAR price of Â£0.69) I couldn't help but get it again. With solid gameplay mechanics, more references than you can shake a Flax Combobulator at, secrets, collectables, story, and a playtime that'll keep you intrigued, this is an investment you'll be glad you made. Oh, and the Nintendo style difficulty is frustrating at times but well placed.
2194	UPDATE: Has some crash problems! They need to fix this. I have a Windows 7 Dell Inspiron Laptop w/ 16GB of RAM and Aprox. 500GB on the Hard drive left. NVIDIA Graphics  This is a great game! I really like the old video games such as SNES or NES. This is one of those games, kind of like GTA 1. But I really would recomend this, but buy a controller, it will work much better! I am going to buy a controller my self.
2195	Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
2196	Wow. This was a blast to play. This game is simultaneously a blast to play and a love letter to gaming culture from the NES forward. I'm truly shocked at how many references were coherently packed into by Brian Provinciano. This is a masterpiece of gaming and parody. YES. BUY IT! (Brian, you win all the things.)
2197	Brings old memories that i didnt have. its fun. and worth its price.  9/10
2198	I may as well call this game what it is - it's GTA in 8-bit style. But with that comes endearing sprite art, an awesome chiptune soundtrack, over-the-top shenanigans and more retro references than you can shake a stick at. If you want to spend hours goofing off and reliving the glory days of the video game industry, this is the game for you.
2199	awesome game remidns me of GTA1 &amp; 2 with nes era art :D
2200	This sums it all up.  Do you enjoy 8/16 bit video games (sonic,mario,earthworm jim? ect)  Do you enjoy GTA (Grand theft auto?)  
2201	Retro City Rampage - Play this game while heavily caffeinated and try to keep up with the over the top action, over the top retro, and over the top puns and pop culture references.
2202	This game is amazing! Gameplay is flawless, tons of humor, and it's just sooooo good! Buy this game! It's worth every cent! 9.5/10
2203	it is a good game and this game would be cool online like with friends
2204	RCR feels like someone took all my childhood Nintendo memories and compressed them into one game, slathered it with Rockstar-style scatological 'parody', and sprinkled on a bunch of references to modern-day games/game developers and my former stomping grounds of greater Vancouver, BC. The developer even jokes about having included everything and the kitchen sink (if you examine the correct sink).  I'm pretty much in the bullseye of this game's target demographic; a child of the late 80s/early 90s who spent some time in the Vancouver game development industry. In fact, I feel like at least half the pleasure I experienced was spotting references and recalling pleasant memories. Remove that, and you're left with a game that's probably a mixture of enjoyable and completely baffling.  It's pretty short and linear (despite being 'open-world'), so keep that in mind. Unless you're the sort who enjoys finding hidden collectibles and replaying mini-challenges to get the high score.
2205	Awesome crossover of nes and gta.
2206	It's GTA meets back to the future meets TMNT meets all other 90s cartoons and video games. It's just great.
2207	REFERENCES GALORE!   GTA2 style game filled with powerups and whatnot.  Not a whole ton of content but worth it on sale.  
2208	A must for any fans of 80s pop culture, and lovers of mindless mayhem!
2209	This game takes the retro GTA to a whole new level. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It's not one of those games that you can play all day, every day, but it does something that not many indie games do; it plays like a video game. A must have for your library.
2210	It's like grand theft auto, with the exception that is an arcade based game with mod support :D
2211	80s gaming homage in an old school GTA package. Try it out.
2212	Streamlined to eliminate anything that isn't 'fun'. Good times, much parady. Worth price of admission :D
2213	GTA meets 8bit with a super dose of video game and 80's parodies. This game does a hilarious job of spoofing Back to the Future, Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters, Mario, Sonic, Batman, Contra ... and so on and so on, nearly every mission has your nostalgia senses tingling. Somehow they managed to make the combat pretty damn fun despite your character only being 10 pixels high. Tons of unlockables and collectibles to keep you playing. You can equip a Jason mask, mario hat, rock a MR.T haircut, some stunna shades. It's an awesome, fun game IF you get the references, otherwise it'll just be an 8bit GTA ... which is still awesome :P
2214	3 bucks on sale. That's 12 quarters/tokens. Usually spent that in an hour at the arcade back in the days.. Now why would you not pick this game up?
2215	wow.. just wow. a sort of Gta demake full of humour, references, good gameplay and great pixelated art! I've already fallen in love!
2216	Better than GTA.
2217	Imagine if Rockstar made GTA while they were still DMA Design and you might have a good idea of what this game is. Who needs fancy graphics anyway?
2218	Retro City Rampage is a very nice game: it isn't just an 8-bit version of GTA, but it is also a game that combines all the good things about gaming from the 80s.  The missions are very interesting, the arcade challenges are addictive and the storyline is impressive.  Overall it is worth all 9 euros (I got it on a 90% sale, but it might appear again)!  10/10 would play again
2219	If you're at all into classic gaming, particularly the 80's stuff, you can't go wrong with this. With just my first 30 minutes of gameplay, I came across no less than 16 different 80's gaming (and movie) references in the most ridiculous circumstances. This 8-bit GTA-alike-gone-berserk is really a must-play, but I would go so far as to call it a moral obligation to buy it for any retro gamer.
2220	Even its a 8 bits style game but its give a lot of fun.
2221	While some folks might be turned off by the top-down classic GTA style gameplay, I found it somewhat enjoyable. What really made this game for me was the presentation. Tons of nods to old school games and even to some movies/tv shows, and all done so hilariously. The soundtrack is also amazingly well done with good variety. The fact that all of this was done by one man (sans the soundtrack, to my knowledge) is certainly a feat in and of itself.
2222	One of those good retro gaming throwbacks in a GTA 2 inspired open-world structure.
2223	1.21 GIGAWATTS, MARTY, LET'S GO BACK TO THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FUTURE.
2224	Recommend this to the end of freaking time holy moley the refrences the style the gameplay is the bomb i am pooping all over JUST.THIS.FOREVER :DDDDDDDDDDDD
2225	Admittedly, I love the Retro Gaming Trend. But I also love free roam sandbox shooters. This game delivers on both. The game actually plays better than GTA 1 and 2, effectively improving on the original. Plus it also pays homage to other classic 8-bit games of the NES era along with other current games in the Retro Genre. All in all, good game. Check it out.
2226	A classic take on the retro-games of our past, this comedic top down GTA2 style game is thoroughly enjoyable. With quips to boot and every second of the game a poke at something else, I found this game entertaining the entire way through. The plot is not strong (I really don't even know what happened), but it was funny and it all fit together quite well. I only wish the game was longer with a little more to play with. Worthwhile indie game all the same.
2227	This game is so damn awesome. Great old skool music, tons of variation in gameplay, nice visuals, non-stop jokes...and a lot of challenges to beat too! Had a total blast getting 100% completion on this one. The only criticism of mine would be that it draws a bit too much from other games, hence undermining the originality a little. Still, for a parody game this is exceptionally well done.  Overall: pure retro dynamite, 5/5.
2228	Fun. Funny. Hard. Those are the three words that best describe this game. If you lived through the NES era, you'll recognize a lot of this game. It's cleaned up to be playable, whereas a lot of old NES was broken to a certain extent, but that doesn't make it any easier. Glad I played it, but even more glad I'm done.
2229	THIS... GAME... IS... AWESOME!!!!111! If you like 8 bit style graphics in games at all, this is a MUST. It seems like a GTA ripoff from the onset but there's so much in this game its insane!
2230	This game is a throwback to the old games we played back then on the nes. its a big parody of a game and its really funny and fun. If you see this on sale for a decent price. Pick this game up you wont be disapointed
2231	Take all that crazy 80s-90s nostalgia, the original grand theft auto, and you have something pretty close to this game. It's quirk comes from all the references it has to retro pop culture, and is pretty fun to play. You do missions as you like, and can go off on your own and rack up your score if you like. Pretty fun pass time when you are really bored. I wouldn't say it's for everyone, because only someone who knows the references would be able to fully enjoy the quirk.
2232	You remember that part in back to the future where marty helped the joker rob a bank and killed the turtles and the a-team then hid in a box and met bill and ted? This game is just like that.
2233	Like an 8-bit Saint's Row and if that's not enough, just buy it anyway because we all die in the end.
2234	but hey ... 30 mb ... What else u need. xD
2235	Imagine every classic 8-bit game ever made then throw them all in a blender with GTA. This is what you get.   This game works pretty great as long as you understand all the nostalgic 90's references.
2236	Anyone that like 8-bit games and GTA...this is a must get!
2237	This is the ULTIMATE 8-bit game. Merely calling it an 8-bit GTA clone doesn't begin to describe this, it is EVERYTHING you love about video games.
2238	Flashback to the '80s! Decent writing and tons of classic gaming references make this game a laugh around every corner. If you're a gamer who's been around since the third-generation (NES, Master System, etc.) gaming era, you'll likely enjoy this one as much as I have. There are a few drawbacks, though. Some of the achievements and unlocks are incredibly frustrating ('Death Cam, No Death' being particularly infuriating for me), the main storyline isn't very long and the price tag is about $5 too high. Still, I don't regret my purchase but if you're on the fence about a game like this, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale.
2239	Should you think about buying this, remember two key things. One, you really need a controller. Second you need a good sense of humor, don't take this game that serious, for it is only as good as its joke and murder.
2240	Enjoying this game about a hundred times more than I thought I would. Pure good times if you like this sort of thing at all. In terms of fun, much more toward the playground of a Saints Row 3 than the grit of a GTAIV.   The only things I don't like are the 'retro' screen framing (is there any way to turn that off?) and the 80's-reference humor, which has seemed forced, and worse, not funny.  TL;DR: IT'S GRAND THEFT AUTO BUT YOU CAN ALSO STOMP ON PEOPLE LIKE IN MARIO AND COINS COME OUT.
2241	This is a great game. It's a more colorful version of GTA 1 &amp; 2. There are a lot of Easter eggs in this game and it also has mod support. The story is short, but makes up for it by adding so many levels from different games. I even think the boss battle is taken from a Zelda game. This is a nice game to play if your bored and wanna have a good time for a while. 7.5/10
2242	I'm in love with this game.
2243	Seriously, this is easily the best and biggest indie game out there. It's an open world sandbox with lots of stuff to do in it. A love letter to the long gone 8-bit era full of references and parody. And while those references are pervasive they don't feel forced at all. The difficulty can be a bit high at times and some levels get repetitive but nevertheless RCR was worth the 5 year wait and the price. Think of it as an 8-bit Saints Row 3. Also. Get it when you can.
2244	It feels like the 80s blended into a smoothie and forced into your eyes and ears.  Pure retro bliss.  A compulsory purchase for generations X and Y alike.
2245	OK trying to explain the awesomeness would have me to say spoilers JUST BUY IT for the amazingness
2246	It's like a well-designed (e.g. modern conveniences like just-in-time help/tutorial reminders) GTA2 chock full (this is an understatement) of video game related references. And I don't mean just your run-of-the-mill 'remember old graphics and cheesy writing?' references, or even a few specific things like 'princess is in another castle'. I mean they poured their heart and soul into this thing. Less common references include the 'history of IBM', 'Commodore 64 load flags', 'Game Genie noises', and tons of musical parodies that will be nostalgic of particular games/tunes without actually stealing the audio. This game screams 'polish polish polish' and everyone who has been gaming for a while or likes/is intrigued by 2D open-world games should give it a try.
2247	This game is carzy! good retro feel with lots of options to make it look the way you like. plus it fully supports sony's Dualshock 4 controller which is awesome. its like GTA for the NES.
2248	This game is just a barrel of laughs. With its retro style graphics as well as music and parodies of old classic NES games like Bionic Commando as well as other video games and even TV and movies of the 80's and 90's. You won't stop laughing once you start playing this game, you can be sure of that.
2249	Toasty.
2250	This is one of the best indie games I have ever played, period.  The control is tight, the graphics are serviceable (and changeable to your tastes!), the challenge is actually challenging and the chiptune music is brilliant. RCR doesn't take itself seriously in the story department but the gameplay is no joke. A lot of effort was put into this project. The main campaign is short, but it's fun to go back and raise 8-bit hell every now and then.
2251	Get it if it's on a good sale. It offers a good bit of fun and comedy, but personally, it struggled to keep my attention. Maybe I'll go back to it someday. If it looks fun to you, it probably will be! It's just not my style. Still, recommending it because I know many would love it!
2252	Retro City Rampage is a nice flash back to the olden days of GTA (and gaming in general). You start as The Player, running around committing crimes just like you always do in your standard GTA. The over the top view is great, and more exciting than that (to me at least) is that for all this game you have an install of less than 40MB! Movie references will abound. The combat system is fun and the game is simple enough. I would definetly recommend this game if you are looking for a cheap time waster that's actually decently made. My advice, buy it, play it and go on a rampage. A retro rampage.
2253	If you ever wanted GTA with retro graphics, then this is for you
2254	What started as Grandtheftendo, has been turned into one of my favourite indie titles for this generation. Retro City Rampage is a swansong to the older days by using early 90's and mid 80's references such as Megaman 2 (For one of the songs and parody), Back to the Future and of course it's big influence being the older GTAs (Pre-GTA III). I've got tons of fun out of this game and I hope you will too. Also there are some neato bonuses of cool characters you can unlock.  With a soundtrack consisting of music by virt (Popular chiptune artist was has worked on Ducktales Remastered and lately Shovel Knight), Freaky DNA and Norrin Radd. Retro City Rampage has that definitive early era sound to go with it's old-school inspired graphical style. Since I wrote this review, there has been updates which allows sprite and palette modding as well as the prototype rom of Rom City Rampage followed by 30fps mode (Perfect for some older PCs)  Pick up this game now
2255	My mommy always got so angry with me, see said 'You're far to girly to be a boy' - 'But mommy I love my Madonna tapes, and I drew Freddie Mercury naked for science class!'. I would always cry on my totally awesome cool friends shoulder about it, until my totally awesome cool friend bought me RETRO CITY RAMPAGE! Now my mommy doesn't care about my tapes, or holy cardboard cut outs of Elton John. Just as long as she knows I'm playing Retro City Rampage, she knows I'm all the man I need to be.
2256	GTA meets 8-bit action. It's a yes.
2257	i beat the epic meal time arcade and didn't really do much today besides run over cops
2258	Exceptionally fun 8-bit styled open world game. Lots of fun missions, NES difficulty curve, funny story. It's a fun game, and good for any classic gamer.
2259	Fun game, lots of 80's movies refferences, reminds me of clasic gta
2260	I am ashamed that more of you do not own this game. Not even on your wishlist? SHAME ON YOU!  Insane game in a tiny package.
2261	A game filled with video game references and funny jokes. Definitely worth the money.
2262	Honestly, one of the best retro-styled games I've played. This game gives you a lot of content if you compare it to most games nowadays that cost 10 bucks. You'll be hooked with this game and the amount of variety in it is impressive. More importantly, if you're here because you think it's just like GTA, this game most likely isn't for you. This game is for people who are fans of arcade and NES games, and people who are soft enough to wanna have a good laugh. Every mission is different in it's own way, and there's always a reference or parody that gets you to laugh. As you progress through the game, it obviously gets harder. This game isn't impossible, but it gets difficult, that's for sure. At first you just kill dudes with pistols, but then you're gonna run into dudes with bazookas.   The story is obviously not supposed to make sense, I mean this game is a parody, just look at the title. Despite how senseless it may be, it surely is entertaining. It was fun for me to walk down the street and randomly run into some batman parody, and then having to impersonate him. At least the game actually had a story, and it's been a while since I've enjoyed one this hilarious.  I do recommend this game, and trust me, it is worth the 10 bucks.
2263	This game is very much worth the .99 cents it currently cost on sale!
2264	After playing a while longer and playing around with a few things, I've decided my original review was unfair, and have decided to revise it.    -First of all, collectively throughout the other platforms, I have invested hundreds of hours in this game, probably nearing a thousand. That speaks volumes. -Second of all, while I still stand by my opinion that the controls are awkward, it they can be bypassed using a control. -Third, after playing around for a while, I did eventually get the mods to work. While the community still appears split on whether it works or not, I'm going to review it for what I have.  Now, instead of writing a long, frivilous review, I'm just going to post the scores.  Replay Value: 9.5/10 Sexy Retro Soundtrack: 8/10 Sexy Retro Graphics: 8/10 Story: 8/10  Final Score- 8.375/10 Recommended Buy Price: Full  Final Thoughts: Though this port does have its flaws, can the same not be said about most, if not every other port? I'm content with this game being on Steam, and I will play it again.
2265	Retro GTA + Pokemon - Pokemon - Logic  We have to go back!
2266	Best retro 8-bit openworld action adventure funny comedy game ever, u deserve this game , buy it to ride gorillas ,skate, travel with timemachine, kill cops with micropenis, jump on theyr head and lots of stuff 9.49\10
2267	This game has really fun gameplay, and is packed with all kinds of references and jokes to the 80's and early 90's. If you are a fan of retro-style games, I would highly reccomend.
2268	I love this game like Gta but 8 bit so fun!
2269	If you're old enough to have played the games this one parodies on a nearly constant basis, then you'll find a lot to enjoy in Retro City Rampage.
2270	A fun game for purely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around in. Best when bought on sale. $9.99 Seems a little high, but even at that price, the gameplay is surprisingly entertaining. Grand Theft Auto in 8-bit form minus the sex and drugs.
2271	Would be more fun on mobile, when GTA series didn't exsist
2272	I first saw this game on the nintendo eShop and asumed that this game would be for kids. I thought it would just be gta but with no fun killing. No robbing stores and no real goal.  If only my gut feelings were this good for my exams.  still okay 6.5/10
2273	It is what is says it is. A city chock full of obvious and obscure references from the 80's to modern times (sunnyvale park supervisor). And it's designed for you to go on a rampage through it. But, after the rollercoaster opening, I am burnt out. It was fast, confusing, and I was assaulted at every turn by another reference. Worst of all, it was pretty much on rails. Once it opened up to the GTA style gameplay, it was great...but I'm tired of it after a total hour.   The open game seems well made, and the controls feel good. Graphics are good and I have no issues playing it on a minimum spec machine. My only problem is some of the 'achievements' on screen which are too aware of themselves. 'Mediocre jump' If it's satire on achievements, the joke went on too long; if it wasn't, it feels like insecure fan-fic writing.  I think I just need to set this aside for a week and come back to the open world with fresh eyes. I will like this game, just not at this moment.
2274	Seriously one of the best games i've ever played. It plays like grand theft auto for the gameboy color, but its much more than that. Filled with pop culture references from the golden age of videogames, you'll crap your pants over and over and over and over and over and over!
2275	My shopping cart blew up  10/10
2276	I always wanted it, I tried to buy it on 3DS but I was too late for the sale, and a few days ago I bought it on steam. Kind of sucked. Missions and campaign were terrible, and open world roam was too OP. Buy GTAV it's better.
2277	I play with the MS-DOS version. I boot freeDOS from a 4GB SD card on an MSI Wind U100 netbook. The netbook is total cold during DOS gameplay. When I do the same under windows it's hot.  The developer have perfect programming skills! :)  10/10
2278	retro GTA, yep all you need to now
2279	80's video game gameplay that feels fun as hell to play with a hilarious story mode that refrences every thing in 80s popculture  10/10 8/8 
2280	Amazing game in general. Love the modding and open world exploration! I could play for hours...
2281	I fell in love at the time i saw the   Refference to doctor who. A TARDIS!!!! it apeared right in front of me and i was like OMG.   The other thing that i noticed that i didnt see on the trailer was, This is alot like GTA actualy.   How can i say this is alot like GTA?
2282	If you really enjoy 8-bit games and exploration this is such a great game. It's based off of grand theft auto but it also incorporates a lot of things from other games and theres more refferances then I can count. Theres numerous secrets and things to occupy your time outside of the main storyline and the acheivments are great. Extremely funny and so much fun I highly recomend it. It's more then worth the money espcially if it's onsale, I'd get it for everyone I know.
2283	If GTA were re-created on the 8bit NES...  Pros: + Huge open world. + Tons of side-quests. + Good mission variety. + Boatloads of minigames and unlockables. + Good sense of humor, filled with 1980s Pop culture references. + LOW hardware requirements; netbook friendly. + Both Direct Input (Logitech/PS3/PS4/generic) and Xinput (360) controller support. + Available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and even MS-DOS.  Cons: - 8bit graphics...given you take issue with it. - No multiplayer as of this review.
2284	All I expected was a fun pixel GTA game.  First 20 minutes I work for the Joker, I kill the TMNT, I steal, wreck and destroy the TARDIS.... And well, I won't spoil anything more   What the heck is this? My dream game.
2285	Dear Howie Mandel, I am your biggest fan.  I wish I could love this game as much as I love you. I love you Howie!! your bestest buddy, Christopher Walken
2286	Bought at special. It's an amazing 8 bit game. Open world allow me to do whatever I want to(which is possibly killing other people). I recommend this one,
2287	This game is lots of fun. I like it so much, I have it on nearly every system.
2288	totally rad
2289	It's like Saint's Row had an illegitimate child with an NES that was then abandoned and forced to live in a series of foster homes, and every foster parent turned out to be a nostalgic video game, movie, or internet celebrity.  10/10, would help the Joker pull off a hesit while POWing turtles off of pipes and delivering magazines on a paper route again.
2290	This is by far my favourite game in the world as i love greasers, retro and Originality (is that even a word?) i highly recommend this game and it copes great with a computer as old and crappy as mine
2291	its a great game and completely makes my think of gta 1 or 2 and really fun to play in free mode plus you run kill people and drive and get heaps of guns and have lots of fun   HERES MY FIRST LOOK AT THE GAME  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFf-MeWu78A   Rating 10/10
2292	Very funny game with many gags.
2293	I have maybe 15 minutsee into this game, and I'm already â¥â¥â¥ of tea kettle in love with it. So many paradoies of games, movies, and anything popular. If you are a GTA fan, a movie fan, an 8bit fan, or a human being at all, really, you'll love this game. Great isometric driving and shooting, without the worry of being too real or serious. Get RCR today. You won't regret it.
2294	it are good
2295	Just wish it had multiplayer too
2296	When I first read about Retro City Rampage in Nintendo Power so long ago (when it was pitched for the 3DS) I was immediately interested, and I'm glad I finally got my hands on it. Retro City Rampage is a retro-fabulous GTA clone that pokes fun at every aspect of 8-bit video game culture. It's probably best to play this game with a Controller, though the game CAN be played with Keyboard (albeit the second mission immediately becomes more difficult) I love the throwbacks to everything from Ghostbusters to Robocop to Contra to Metal Gear, Sh*t even MEAT Boy gets a cameo (he's in an arcade game and you can play as him if you beat it) I think I like Retro City Rampage.
2297	Pretty much one of the only games you'll need on Steam.  10/10 would have my pc break down, and be left to play this game on my laptop again.  (using a controller is a must!) gg. 
2298	Fun. GTA + references + coffee at 2am.
2299	Classic top down Nintendo look fun!
2300	The only thing wrong with this game is that it doesnt run on Linux. This is very, very sad.
2301	If Grand Theft Auto was made on the NES, this is what it would play like. Retro City Rampage features a fairly expansive open world with the car-theiving fun of GTA and the tongue-in-cheek humor of Nintendo games of the past. It revels in fact that it is a parody and makes every effort to remind you of it. There are enough 80's and 90's references to fill a hundred parodies, so don't even bother trying to figure out all of the source material.   I was surprised by how many unlockables there are in this game and finding all of them proves to be quite the challenge. You can also customize your character with hats and hairstyles. For me, this really put RCR as more than just a parody. It's a love letter to two very different eras of gaming that go surprisingly well together. Some of the challenges are pretty frustrating, but even that difficulty harkens back to a time gone by of gaming. Even after you've done everything there is to do, there is still some sick fun to be had by running over pixelated people with the Ghostbusters car.
2302	Just like GTA but in retro land.
2303	stole a taxi made money finding fairs on the meter made even more money finding fairs off the meter went and bought a bunch of guns 'are you talkin to me?' cut to five minutes from gun purchases i've stolen a tank from the army no one is talking to me NO ONE.
2304	Quite a good game, but it's extremely frustrating at moments. And it now has a dos port.
2305	Retro City Rampage is an amazing indie gem that goes way further than a GTA clone should ever go. Epic music, tight controls, funny references, all packed in to one game that doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It's a great length, never feels boring, and keeps me replaying it every once in a while. 10/10  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5541OA9Uyc&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLi5EVFlTWe_7D7TciBO-C7SKNchnfz3SG 
2306	I have mixed feelings but overall I enjoyed the few hours I threw into this game. It's not a masterpiece, still it can entertain you for 3-4 evenings. My expectations were really high but in the end it's nothing more than a good ironic 8-bit retro styled rush. Get it only if you love citations to death and want a blast IN the past. Nice.
2307	this is like a pixelated gta
2308	Grand Theft NES.  9/10
2309	I can't get enough of this game. It's a love letter to the days of 80s PC gaming, and to the old-school GTA topdown games. If you enjoy either one of those, you're going to love this game, even if you don't the game itself is easy to pick up and play. Hell, the game is ported to nearly every console at this point, including the MS-DOS. This is what I call a well crafted game.
2310	This game absolutely assaults you start to finish with non-stop pop culture references and mechanics from other games, but the thing is it goes so damn hard with it all that it actually comes back around and feels surprisingly fresh and original. Plus, it really is a stunningly well-executed demake of GTA when you get down to it.
2311	This game is so epic you guys must get it!  Reasons:  You steal cars  You shoot people  Open World  Retro  Humer  Customize cars  
2312	u cant imagen how big my smile was as i was watching the install screen on my dos pc  and i was happy whit the fact to have a new dos game on a floppy at all and then it turns out to be the best dos game i ever played :) exept maniac mansion XD serious if u dont like this game you better get a new hobby and give up on gaming in general
2313	Perfect :)
2314	It's a parody of GTA, only with as much 80s/early 90s pop culture references shoved in to appease anyone of that time period. This game's more like a 8 bit recreation of GTA 3 (The Player is clearly modeled after Claude) and it's honestly one of my favorite games of all time. I own it on Vita, 3DS, and Xbox 360 and I really can't get enough of this game. Buy it now if you want some crazy pixelated mayhem!   Oh, and by the way,  There's a sequel coming soon titled Shakedown Hawaii that seems to be a 16 bit parody of Vice City. I cannot wait.
2315	meme city rampage DX
2316	Very close to GTA 1, but on 8 Bit Steroids. I love it :)  Edit: Finally finished the story mode. OMG, tough final, but worth it. Go get that game already!
2317	It was a pretty decent game, up until the ending levels. The gameplay is fun, but gets repetitive very quickly. The story is pretty interesting and is full of references. I would say 'Get this game on sale', but then I got to the final levels. Up until the final levels the game was never 'cheap', everything seemed fair and most deaths seemed like they were your fault. But the final levels were so cheap, I quit the game. Instant death traps, tons on enemies all attacking you at once, and a final boss cheaper than â¥â¥â¥â¥ing air. If the gameplay looks interesting to you, maybe get it on sale, but other than that, I would recommend you avoid this game.
2318	References
2319	Great game!
2320	Reminds me of OG GTA. Games so cool my grandma was like 'damn that game looks cool' and my grandma is cool so that means the game is cool.
2321	nice open world game with nice pop culture references awesome
2322	Good i guess, wait for a sale.
2323	Grand Theft Auto: My PC Is â¥â¥â¥â¥ Edition  But seriously, it's decent
2324	a Fun spin-off at the GTA system with alot of charm.   just brought it to give some support to the Creator.
2325	The game is amazing to say the least.   The graphics are good. The game play is funny. The references are fun for gamers. It was one of my personal favorites for a long time. I loved this game so much that I bought it for my 3ds, computer, iphone, and several friends computers. It still is one of the best games ever!   The controls are terrible though so I would recomend rebinding some of the buttons.  11/10 AMAZING!
2326	Great game! Lots of retro fun. One downside is it can get repetitive, but I guess tht can be attributed to the retro gaming style.
2327	more references than borderlands and im okay with that cause the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing
2328	Hilarious simple NES styled GTA game, with left right and centre pop culture jokes. Not hard but not easy, hard to 100% and some achievements require patience and perseverance, or a good walk through. Definitely worth the price
2329	i havent played much BUT(T) i can say it is an  open...ish?  world style game where you/me do nothing but use the rpg and destroy oncoming dinocycles.... story is great? and the graphics..... there not ps4 or next gen OMG graphics but there good soundtrack is pretty cool im not big on it though and goomba stomping has grown on me so has the game btw i had a seisure beacause there was to much sugar in the graphics (trailer reference) 10000000000/21
2330	game is pure 80's gold, havent put too much time into it but the first 10 minutes are full of references to 80's pop culture
2331	8 bit GTA with killer soundtrack !!!
2332	This is a great game!
2333	A huge game for people that remember the 8bit era. The guy that put this game together really has some love for retro computers and consoles, its rich in detail and references and looks pretty awesome! 11/10
2334	Retro City Rampage is a combination of 2D kick â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, 80s references and flashing colors and graphics. A fast paced 2D GTA-clone old-school game for lovers of nostalgic games, but also for everyone who seeks a challenge and wants to relive his childhood in a retro game. WARNING: Can be freaking hard sometimes!
2335	Its like an old school GTA game gone EVEN MORE OLD SCHOOL. Oh the references and shennanigans too. You will love this game if you like roaming in a retro styled adventure game... JUST PLAY IT ALREADY!
2336	If you liked GTA1 back in the day, back in the day is back again with more content, more humor, and plenty of 80s nostalgia. A big plus is that it's only 8bit, so there's plenty of bits left over for various other things. A big thumbs up from me!
2337	Grand Theftendo
2338	Really enjoyable. A delightfull wayback machine to the golden era of 8bit gaming. The music is also very 80's
2339	Retro City Rampageâ¢ DX. A 2-D GTA filled with old-school refrences. Theres a ton to do aside from story and you will have fun causing chaos with many guns, cars, and an infanant imount of civillians to throw your rampage on. Its an open world game with a 3rd person view. Theres just so much to do here and fun to have. 9/10 great gameplay and variety, also a lot of refrences.
2340	It's 2D GTA with some hit-and-miss retro humor, and I LOVE IT. If it's $3 on sale, definitely worth it! $10--still worth it! Best thing is: you buy the game once, and that's it ;) Remeber those days?
2341	As a seasoned player of this game, I would recommend it as a 7/10, but it is definitely not without flaws. I'll list the pros, cons and debatable features from my experience so you can decide if you think you'll enjoy it as much as I did!  Pros - 4 Player splitscreen, a rarity on PC. I spent most of my time playing this mode. - Simple and yet brilliantly original car damage/pit stop system - Good variety of tracks with different routes - Car class system lets you pick the speed you want to race at - Plenty of unlockable car liveries - Each racing class has a car that is strongest at something different (one for handling, one top speed etc.) - 8 cars on track is refreshing as lots of arcade racers only have 4  Cons - Computer controlled cars rely on 'rubber banding' (If they drop too far behind they will go irrationally fast to catch you, but the same works in your favour if you fall behind) - Compatability issues, there is no guarantee this game will work on your system, I have encountered problems with it myself - The single player is a quite short, and once completed time trials, single races and split screen are the only other things to do - No online multiplayer, one of the game's biggest disappointments - No Steam workshop or modding facilities, creating your own liveries and tracks would extend the life of this game significantly - The price is a little over the top for me, for such an inflexible game   Other features - No Mario Kart copying pickups/powerups, one of the biggest pros of the game for me! - Shortcuts on tracks which you'll do well to remember the positions of, but other cars will frequently utilize - Time delayed explosive barrels, and oil barrels can be used for your benefit or doom
2342	Really amazing game it has amazing features and things like Great Soundtracks,Cars,Stages and alot of superB features   surely i dont have much to say but this game is great i am defenetly reccommend it for all of you my friends   10/10
2343	Stats (05.05.2014 Player: 1 - Multiplayer: 1-4 (Splitscreen); bots optional XBox-Controller: Yes NoName-Controller: Not tested Free Space: ~210 MB  It's not that bad! But it is also not worth 9,99â¬/$. Wait for a sale and you have fun for some hours.   Its a classic top-down-racing game. If you expect 'Bang Bang', Items and Explosions like Mario Kart, you will be disapointed. The only thing that can explode is one type of 3 different barrels. But still it is a nice game, sometimes too easy, sometimes really challenging.  About the game: There are 9 tracks with 6 different types (normal, reverse, short, short reverse, with cutoff and cutoff reverse and about 20 different cars sorted in 4 classes and for each class 5 different types with fixed stats (handling, protected (stronger in crashing and have more health points), best acceleration, best top speed, strongest nitro). Every event is connected to a class, so you have to pick one of the five types out of one class.  The Singleplayer is okay, but not addicting. Just if you want all achievements.  But the Multiplayer is fun! You can invite some friends and play with 2 player at one keyboard or with xbox-controller against bots.  Don't expect more than a classic top-down-racer and you won't be disappointed.
2344	Brilliant overhead view racer, reminds me of Super Sprint except more chaotic. Lots of cars on the track (that seem to gang up on you), lots of tracks, lots of fun. One major downer is there's no online multiplayer, Though it's still challenging and lots of fun without it, it's surely missed.
2345	As any other Racing games. Fun Hard and Challnging. Dat's all you need on racing game :) If you like A raceing games so I guess that can be suitable to you ..  Have fun
2346	Funny racing game. The controls are easy, the idea is easy. Graphics are nice. Very fun game to do with friends (splitscreen!)
2347	Bang Bang Racing is a top down racing game.  You have some other views to race with if you prefure this. Personally top down view is annoying if you never played games this way. Only i will get better if you practice some. I have couple of these types of games in my collection in here the steam matrix. This is one of my less favorite if you ask me.  It looks great... it haves some good soundtracks...... only controls that is my problem with this game. Pickup up this game whas not easy because of the weird controls of the cards. That is serieus my only small problem with this game.  The games offers a lot of tracks and cars. It's a pure racing game with no power ups. I love these games... let's make that cleal. Only I think Mini Moto Racing is much more funs. Local multiplayer no online option.  It's a good game... you can try is personally not my favo. I give it a 7/10 score.
2348	The game is really great,it has a great graphic and fun gameplay. But the game is frequently crashing....... :| too bad
2349	Bang Bang Racing is a very fun and enjoyable cartoony top-down racer with stylised cartoon graphics which are surprisingly impressive with some nice effects and a very light-hearted gameplay style in a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. So far, every race I have completed has awarded me a new car for each career event I completed as well as several game modes and tracks: the game definately doesn't seem short on content. The gameplay is fun and fast with short tracks and enjoyable racing with a recharging nitro boost system and races with plenty of AI drivers which keep the gameplay fast and competitive - but this is by no means a difficult game. As mentioned before I actually found the graphics vastly exceeded my expectations for a game of this type they are fully 3D with gorgeous cartoon-style environments and some lovely effects like the nitro boost spewing out the back of the car exhaust. I find myself coming back to this game regularly for a few races just because it is such a joy to play. Really well done.  TLDR: Great gameplay, great graphics, lots of content, very fun and light-hearted and a great overall top-down racer which I would highly recommend.
2350	Seriously fun racing game even if the only multiplayer is split screen.
2351	the game could have been so much better if the camera was not a disaster! Even when its fixed it feels awful. the graphics are good and the controller feels a bit loose when steering. 
2352	Personal Rating: 0/10  What in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hell is this? I got this game thanks to our friends at â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I decided to play it today of all days, when I'm ill and grouchy. GOOD GOD THIS GAME IS HORRENDOUS. The first signs of how bad this game was is the title screen. 'Press Enter or A to Start' A? Well, I looked at it, yes, A. An Xbox Icon was next to it too. At this point I realised I should have gotten a PC Controller.  Well, I started up the game and was greeted with a horrendous amount of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Everyone knows how important controls are right? Well, Bang Bang Racing doesn't. 'They dun â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up y'all!'  Music? No. Maybe 2 tracks overall, title screen and races. AI can't even cope with the bad controls. Screw this game, the best thing about this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ is the title of it.
2353	Bad.  Wobbly camera that make you feel ill after a couple of minutes of play. Boost mechanism that annoys, as it just feels like your accelerator is continuously loosing power rather than gaining a boost. Bad AI, crashing about all over the place, easy to over take and catch then hangs around behind you, suddenly better, overtakes you then gets worse again. Very inconsistent, even at highest level. Fat wide cars with almost no physics. Overhead camera show on average only a few car lengths ahead, making any type forward thinking impossible.  Meh. There is more but I cant be bothered to list it. :( 
2354	This game is boooring! It could be one of the best games of this kind... but.. where is the garage? if you have the barrels and oil why not power ups? where are the car stats? BTW: CPU has burning car and drove faster than me... great!
2355	Fun little car racer. Nice simple controls which means I can have fun teaching my little girl to play.  Really don't understand the downvotes due to lack of online multiplayer, there are plenty of other games like this with online support yet don't even have players to make it worthwhile and therefore online is a moot point. Also its not a AAA, its the sort of game you would play at a party or something simple.  Which brings me onto price. That is where I may negative it I no doubt bought it on sale at some point (lot of games can't remember what I bought and when sometimes.) I don't think its Japanese price of 980yen is worth it half price yes. It is a pretty game nice graphics even on high resolution.
2356	Nice physics. Cute Graphics. Good Tracks. A lot of fun. For SuperCars Veterans I recommend this game.
2357	Cute, cheap, and fun!
2358	Plus: Awesome little overhead racer. Decent with Xbox controllers. Fun coop, but has a bit of a control learning curve. Excellent graphics. Fun obstacles. Minus: Xbox controls need tweaking. No car upgrading. Must unlock things in SP to be able to coop them.

2359	Adorable matchbox racing game! What else can I say, spent like 17 or so hours playing this lol Highly recommended for all gamers of any age!
2360	Very fun little Micro Machines esque racer. Everything you could want from a racing game in this style - pretty, easy to pick up, and good fun. Handles well with keyboard or controller.
2361	Now this is a game you will enjoy playing (unlke Mini Motor Racing Evo). Good graphics, good music and good vehicle control. What more do you need from this type of racing game?
2362	It's like racing Micro Machines. It's pretty fun, but very repetitive. And not like you'd expect a racing game to be. It's just an old polished record with a scratch so it looks good, but it's constantly on repeat. All in all, not too awful. I'll beat it because that's my thing, but would I recommend it? Probably not.
2363	Got it for 84p so yup!
2364	Fun game, decent controls, and good for short bursts of racing. A short game but worth it if you can pick it up cheap. I beat it in about 3 hours. The tilt-shift map previews are good and the crowd in the grand stand looks like Mii characters from Nintendo. Charming and fun, for sure.

2366	Now this is a game you will enjoy playing (unlke Mini Motor Racing Evo). Good graphics, good music and good vehicle control. What more do you need from this type of racing game?
2367	Slow, laggy gameplay, monotone tracks, poor AI, a badly adjusted camera, bad graphics and designs, and annoying music and SFX. This is the worst game I have ever played.
2368	If you like MicroMachines-like games, this one is really for you. If you like to be angry and pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off this game would be great for you.
2369	It looks fun. It isn't fun. Then you realize it didn't actually look fun.
2370	At first reminded me of the toy cars in Burnout Paradise which everybody finds cute. It's a basic top down racer, plenty of courses and vehicles and it makes for a good local multiplayer game. It's a rare combination of fun and real, for example there are no annoying items but barrels mix up as different obstacles, graphics are simple without looking too cartoony and players regularly crash into each other without getting seriously punished.
2371	Great little game to play in that 20 minutes of free time before sleep ;) it's got pretty graphics and gameplay.
2372	OK this game is most similar to micro machines series (though it doesnt have hammers and machine guns) but all in all nice arcade top down view racing..... and it is nice family game indeed.....
2373	I found it quite good, the Graphics are nice, smooth and crisp. The cars handle as well as can be expected for an arcade game.  the boost as usual only seems to be good when you are not winning, and the catch up handicap is a pain, you can be half a lap ahead on the last lap, then al of a sudden, the computers are right behind you.  Bought it on the weeklong deal for Â£1.19, so Im happy, and at that price I would get it and not worry about the price

2375	got it for 90% off, then i sat on my front porch, grabbed a beer, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed her right in the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ while i played this game which isnt that bad xd  games casual and if you're bored its fun to play xd
2376	'Game of the year, every year.'   A revolution in the racing game genre, next generation graphics and AI that will put Half Life 3 to shame. YOU JUST NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT CURVE!
2377	I enjoyed the little i could play, the graphic issues made it all a sour experience.
2378	Bang Bang Racing is a distinct arcade game focusing not only on the speed but also on the technical driving skills. The very intuitive control system and the exciting tracks provide endless fun for everyone in the family.  Bang Bang Racing delivers fast-paced racing around every corner and down every straight. Drive high-speed, pumped-up racing cars through cones, tires and exploding barrels! Be one step ahead of your competitors, finding shortcuts, repairing your car in the pit lane, and dominating your opponents from the top-down view.
2379	Nice mini racing game, good to beginners, but hard to master. Its really a good game and for this little money you get a lot of fun!
2380	You really liked  Micro Machines , you had a major fondness for  Stunt GP  you fell in love with  Mashed   and you're head over heels for the two or three good  Choro Q  titles...  ...well...prepare to go totally nerdgasmic over...  Bang Bang Racing !  This really is the most fun I've had with a chibi racer since the original  Mario Kart . This has to be the best top down racer on any platform.  If you're into racing games in any way shape or form you should at the very least check out the demo, you might just find that you love this game as much as I do (it's absolutely superb).
2381	There is absolutley no sense of speed in this game. It feels like its running in slow motion.  It's not that the frame rate is bad, etc. It's that the speed is just really really really slow.  After a few laps round the tracks I was getting very boring as the car is going so slowly....  wasted my money (yet again)
2382	Nice mini racing game, good to beginners, but hard to master. Its really a good game and for this little money you get a lot of fun!
2383	Freaking awesome top-down racing
2384	just a really fun simple racing game, with good graphics, and great gameplay - would def recoomend
2385	The game is actually fun!  but doesnt run correctly for most people : ( The AI will always give you a fight to the finish no matter the lead you build ^^ This is only racing game i've ever gone from 10 to 1 and back 9 times in one race xD  2/5 for lack of content and preformance issues
2386	Really nice 'micro machines' racer game. Really good physical engine simulation, beating all chronos will require some effort, hell yeah !  9 circuits, * 2 (both ways) + circuits with shortcuts.  Would wreck my car again 8/10 :)  edit : forgot, but nice split screen mode too !
2387	Bang Bang Racing is essentially Micro Machines with 95% of the game consisting of boosting out of tight corners. 
2388	Bang Bang Racing is a fun racer, reminiscent of the old classic Micromachines :D. It's not that hard to master, and gives a load of fun thrills, as you'd expect from a title like this. :D Sure it's not going to blow your mind with dazzling graphics and progressive damage (of which it has none xD), but it will win you over with giggles and fun! :D
2389	my favorite RC Racing gtame :D  if you liked micromachines on amiga, skidmarks, supercars 1,2,3...  u'll love it...  SIMPLE &amp; SO FUN !!  (buy it if it cost more less than 5 â¬ but very good game !)  PS: gamepad support, multi language .....  PUT FIX camera to have more fun ;-)
2390	This game looks and feels like the old school 'Off Road' which I loved and would actually have preferred if the game play was the same.
2391	No comment is already a comment right? Lel
2392	Hidden gem!    I put this on my wishlist a while back because it reminded me of the old (really old) R.C. Pro Am game. When the Steam sales rolled around again, I thought I should give it a try. Well, i'm glad I did! This is just pure gaming fun, people.    There are so many games today, and most are just trash or gimmicky. They rarely meet your expectations. This game is one of the few that is actually about just having good fun while playing a game - you know, what games were intended to be all along!    This is easily worth it's full price, if not double. The F1-style cars were a pleasant surprise too. The graphics are great. The tracks are designed well. And the cars are also great.

2407	Friend was winning, he got double grapple hooked. We don't talk anymore.
2408	This game is absolutely stellar.  The game's strong point is the online multiplayer where you battle it out in what can best be described as a amalgymation of MarioKart, Sonic, and Smash Bros. This is an excellent party game if you have friends over.  The mechanics seem simple at first, but as you play through the game you'll realize that they are all intertwined in such a way that you can play in ways unimaginable to your newbie self. You constantly encounter people who have mastered aspects of the game that you weren't even aware of. There is virtually no limit to how good you can get. The gameplay is a nonstop adrenaline rush as you vie to dominate the poor saps (or the no-lifer!) who got matched with you.   Knowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 10x the price for access to this experience. Very entertaining, very addictive. I foresee this game being a part of my cycle for decades to come. 13/10

2415	For those people who are concerned with long term playtime: I've played this game for about what now... 2 years? I've had many moments of success and shortcomings. If you want to grab a game and play it competitively, this is your game. It won't be long until you see how far you've gotten. Now how do you begin? Well I recommend grabbing some friends and playing with them for a short while so you can get used to the controls and all the maps. As you play through the game you'll recognize there will always be better ways to run them. With that being said now go have fun with this game!

2425	Great four player competitive platforming! Pros: -Lots of playable characters and skins -Secret characters -Easy to pick up really hard to master -Great for casual parties, and competitive playing as well -Fun items to help you and ruin your friendships -Every offical map is tagged, so you can see how hard it is -Level editor, workshop support -Theres a random workshop map option in ranked so you can play some curated workshop levels in that mode as well -You can enable fun effects in custom play -Online rank system -A rather short story mode with four difficulty options and unlockable comics -XP system wich unlocks stuff with progress -Twitch integration in the menu -Community events -Custom trail editor  Neutral: -Trail shop, where you can buy trails  Cons: -The game still has some issues and bugs, however the devs are really active and fix bugs with every patch -Even tough theres a 'tutorial' in the game it hardly explains anything about the basic mechanics of the game.Its not a problem for casual players but if you want to play ranked beyond expert league you will have to look up some videos. Fortunetly the menu shows some great tutorial videos for these purposes.  Overall this is a great game if you are looking for an online competitive oriented game. I wouldnt recommend it for the story mode because its really short and theres no real story to the game to be honest. Its definitely worth it for the countless hours you can play in online.

We thought it would be fun but it has brought us farther apart than we have ever been. I am currently down 3 monitors and 2 headsets. My friend is down a DX racer and a monitor and my olther friend is down nothing because he wins every single match and ruins everything for us. Good game if you visiting your friends with a bat after each session, but if not, do not buy it.

2460	Speedrunners is a fast-paced (obviously), two-dimensional, 4-player racing game with a surprisingly high skill cap and a good amount of progression. Quick matches are around five minutes in length, which is quite a refreshing break from the 45-90 minute games of CS:GO so many of us are intent on playing every day.  While it is fun, fast-paced, and cheap, it DOES have its issues... The main mechanic of the game is a steadily decreasing screen size which bottlenecks the players' view of the map, where any player that falls out of frame is immediately killed. The major problem is that in maps that are more vertical than horizontal, the camera does not know who to follow. Oftentimes, players that are lower faze out a higher player or vice versa, entirely out of luck.  Besides this and a few other issues (random deaths when getting too far ahead of your opponents, stuck in walls, etc), the game holds its weight fairly well for such a cheap title. They NEED to implement a Group Queue option for ranked and quick play, though. This game is far more fun to play with friends, and finding them in Ranked is difficult - particularly when they're a few ranks lower than you.

Community maps are very well done and some of 'em are even playable in competitive. Some items will make you laugh your a** off when used properly - but sometimes they make you wanna smash your controller against the f*cking wall.  10/10 would buy a new controller to keep playing.

The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.

However, the game is much funnier if you're playing with friends or something like that. it took me 1000 hours in 7 months!  DRUGS 10/10 GAMEPLAY 10/10 COMMUNITY 9.5/10  
2482	Fast-paced racing game unlike any of you have seen before. Instead of cars, the game is a symbolic representation of how some gamers blast through a game without fully enjoying it. However, you actually enjoy it in this game! You play as one of numerous speed-bent characters with Steam-exclusive editions such as TF2's Scout and Payday 2's Wolf in a thriving array of maps as you race against other players and/or bots to eliminate your competitiors by getting them off of the screen while staying in the lead. There are numerous items and gameplay mechanics that can help you achieve that, such as a grappling hook, C4s, homing missles, freeze rays, wall-jumping, fireballs and more! The story is told through unlockable comics and each character has its own purpose in the game as well as multiple skins to stand out in the crowd. The game has a multiplayer mode, ranked mode, and allows you to easily play with your friends. The game is purely skill-based and while you can spend real-money, you can only acquire cosmetic speed trails that have no effect on your character's performance. If you are looking for a way to pass-time in a thrilling yet entertaining way, this is the game for you!

Just when you think you've hit the best possible strategy and timing, someone else comes along and rips that dream from you and you're forced to take it back. In 18 hours I never reached the most optimized run. I was great but there was always someone who was better and that is a very good thing. I haven't played the game for a year but in the time I spent with it there were no negatives.

2528	People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D.  They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did.   SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents.   With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.  I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3

2537	This is another one of my favorite games of all time and I have been playing it since the xbox 360 days. Destroying your friends has never been more satisfying. Also has a friendly community, (not at all toxic) which is a nice change from LoL. With its' full release the game has never been in a better state and I love all the new features it has brought to the table. Would recommend this game to anyone even if this isn't near their taste of gaming. Also all of the workshop content that users make keeps the game very fresh because original maps can get old eventually. Personal rating has to be 9/10 for its' amount of fresh content, trail making, fair pricing, the amount of fun with friends, and replay-ability the game has. (Speedrunners 2, please?!?) Love the game guy!

2539	This game is a sorta mix of Mari Party meets Mario Kart meets nearly perfect platforming.  Meaning that it will destroy friendships, ruin lives, make you rekindle them in the same moment, and the entire time you keep going 'just one more round'  A game that on paper I thought wouldn't work but ended up being yet another great title that I played a ton of.   Plays best with friends, but the community is very friendly as well.
2540	The maps are great, it has workshop support for more maps, and the mechanics in the game are excellent.  This game would be better if it focused more on teaching the player on the more advanced mechanics in the game. That's the biggest thing holding it back.

2668	A good amazing game! Recommended it!
2669	This is a fast paced insanely fun game with a great art style (reminiscent of the movie Incredibles) and a fun soundtrack. The beginning of SpeedRunners is a bit problematic for example it took me a while to figure out how to change the controls. And the story is only useful because of the new characters you can get, but the dialogue is painfully cliche. It's obvious that this is truly a great game but I would only recommend getting it if you have someone else to play with. KILLZONE gives this game a 7/10. Fun.

2788	Ever wanted to feel like an absolute badass sonic? Well this game is for you! SpeedRunnners is a fun fast-paced platformer, and I have had much fun playing this game. However, I wish there was further customization and more competitive options. I recommed to only buy this game if you have friends to play with, otherwise be cautious when buying this game.  7/10 (Great)

2892	Careful, don't play with someone you like. Especially your family. You'll hate them.  Better than pewdiepies youtube sim
2893	This is a fantastic party game and it deserves more recognition.

2896	Best game of all time.
2897	It's a side scrolling racer where the object isn't to finish laps ahead of your opponents, but instead only to get far enough ahead of your opponents to push them off the screen to their explosive death. It's got a bronze/silver age comic book feel to the aesthetic. It reminds me of the racing game included with Kirby Super Star.
2898	This is a fantastic party game and it deserves more recognition.
2899	Super fun to play with friends, but unfortunately the community behind this game is pretty much dead. If you have friends to play this game with, I would highly recomend it.
2900	the best game ever!.
2901	Very fun game to play, especially with friends. A mulitplayer where you really get the mario kart feeling. Racing, getting weapons.. shoot eachother and hold the super speed longer then your nemesis to own him/her.
2902	Just recently getting into this game, I'll never be good enough to beat the veterans online, and maybe not even my friends - but I still enjoy every second of it.  Great stylized graphics (seriously, just watch someone else play and pay attention to the level artwork in the background). A catchy big band soundtrack that's totally unique. Snappy gameplay that allows you to get better, inches at a time.  The most fun you can have with this is to start playing along with three friends who haven't played before. Figure out the game mechanics together and accept your defeats gracefully.

2906	You know, this game turned out to be a lot more fun than I excpected. It may not look great on first sight, 'What is this, a 2D runner game?'. Bad mistake. I had A LOT of fun with this game when playing with friends. Maps are well made and the game will make you shout at your friends. If you have friends to play this with you, totally recommended.  If you don't its still great ( you can search for people to play this online ), maybe wait for a sale to get it.

2976	Speedrunners is a great game to play with friends, Speedrunners is a great game to play alone. No matter how you play it, speedrunners is a great game worth every penny. Don't be discouraged by the fact that it's still in early acess, because it still has a decent amount of developer maps, and a seemingly infinite stream of good player created maps. I have played for quite a while, and the only bug i have encountered out of all the games I've played, was a small item glitch, and that should say something. If you haven't already bought it, stop trying to convince yourself not to and buy it!  TLDR:  early acess? yes.  no quality content worth your money?  ABSOLUTLEY NOT

2979	The perfect party game for classic platforming fans, yet easy enough to master for new players, SpeedRunners has a bit of everything that will keep you and your friends addicted. Watch out for items (which can be toggled on or off) as well as the continuously shrinking screen. The best comparison I can think of is Wii U's Runbow.

3075	Saw game and thought about buying it. Decided to look at reviews first. Saw lots of reviews talking about losing friendships over it. Thought they were jokes and laughed them off. Convinced friend to buy game. Played for a few days with few incidents. Playing a match with same friend. He uses grappling his hook and I hit him with a mine at the same time. Causes his hook to swing him backwards out of screen. I win the round. Disconnected from game. Friend says, 'This game is literal trash'. Uninstalls speedrunners. Go to write this review. Tell friend about it. He says, 'If you post that review i'm banning you from discord.' Good. I don't need him. Only elite speedrunners on this friends-list. Post anyway. Losing a friend has never felt so good. 10/10

3179	No game is playable if the mechanics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. Thankfully, SpeedRunners game mechanics are pretty great, some glitches in maps under special circumstances (SuperSpeed is huge for breaking maps) but overall definitely a game I'd recommend picking up, however, only if on sale. I don't think this game is worth near $20 given there's DLC that can definitely push your wallet overboard. Pick it up on sale or through a friend.  Another fix needed would have to be ping problems while on competitive. Place a max ping so those rubberbanding don't get a free shot at winning because the others hooked a rubber banding player. Just not fair.  9/10, overpriced and a tad bugged but totally a great play.

Definitely worth every penny and more. And even if you are an alien from space and dont like it, you can still refund it.

3311	This game is the boss. If you are a fan of competive and fun local multiplayer games then very few games match the finess of this title. Its fast, its hectic,there is a fair amount of skill involved and you have a wealth of opportunities to screw your friends over. Its awesome.  The game mechanic and the goal is very simple. You have run , jump and grapple a head of the pack and then extend your lead until all the others are out of the screen. Only thing is, you cant see too much ahead and your friends have got nasty abilities to screw you over with. So good luck and good speed :P  As always with local mp games, 4 is the perfect number of players. Exellent entertainment.  9/10  PS: do yourself a favor and dont play it alone, you will only find it a lesser game than it really is. This game is designed to ruin your relationships and loose frinds over.

3383	Hello! Speedrunners Is a really good game for a party or if you just want to play a small game where you can stop (almost) instantly. It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game. 4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up. And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!

3436	SpeedRunners is not a good consistent day after day game. However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.   Final thoughts:  - BUY THE GAME - If you want a good party game to play once in a while. - DO NOT BUY - If you want a game to play everyday.

3463	Yes I agree this game is great, original, fantastic etc.. exept when I found unfair mode and what exploits can be found to beat the game now once I found these exploits, I've been dashing through these AI games and regular games, which to me make this game completly broken and doesn't require any skill, once I learned the exploits it became second nature ultimately making the game skilless, the only good parts of this game I'd say is regular matched without exploits and no AI that can run faster than you. In my opinion, when you've played enough and learned enough, you become a god creating no challenges, but thats the point of games right? They have a goal and getting to the goal is a challenge, not in this game. But it's still great and fun if you don't come across anyone else in public games using these exploits, just play normally. Anyway I'm done with this game as soon as I've got all achievements. Still don't like unfair mode, almost directly forces you to use the exploits.

3647	SpeedRunners is a competitive indie racing game with a 2-D artstyle and a fun soundtrack. It has both single player and multiplayer modes and a variety of fun characters with different personalities. The goal of the game is to knock out your enemies by making them hit the edges of the screen, and you can race through a variety of unique levels with an arsenal of items to do so. This game is pure addictive multiplayer chaos. It's fast paced, it's competitive, and it even has a story! I see this game as a must-have if you're into indie games and is a joy to play with your friends.

3658	I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let's face it, friends make life a lot more fun. Except in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing KYS pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3659	When i played this it was like the character was on acid

3670	this game is like stealing your friend's phone, and then you throw it in the toilet in front of him, and then when he gets mad, you rub your middle finger in his face and walk away. 10/10 would ruin friendships again

3685	Yes I agree this game is great, original, fantastic etc.. exept when I found unfair mode and what exploits can be found to beat the game now once I found these exploits, I've been dashing through these AI games and regular games, which to me make this game completly broken and doesn't require any skill, once I learned the exploits it became second nature ultimately making the game skilless, the only good parts of this game I'd say is regular matched without exploits and no AI that can run faster than you. In my opinion, when you've played enough and learned enough, you become a god creating no challenges, but thats the point of games right? They have a goal and getting to the goal is a challenge, not in this game. But it's still great and fun if you don't come across anyone else in public games using these exploits, just play normally. Anyway I'm done with this game as soon as I've got all achievements. Still don't like unfair mode, almost directly forces you to use the exploits.

3736	Fantastic game that has been fun since I got it in early access. Now that it is fully realeased, I can say that I am having a more fulfilling experience, since it is more fun to ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISH the newbs that bought the game on release.   10/10 would recommend as a fun game that can double as a competitive one  P.S.: boxes and spikes are no bueno

3858	This game takes all the fun of Mario Kart 64 and puts it into a 2D platform engine. It's very addictive, fun as a party game and equally fun as a 'Story Mode' playthrough. Tinybuild is a sponsor of Games Done Quick and I purchased this after it was advertised on the twitch live stream. They have a very good original game in almost every genre you can imagine so this studio has something for everyone. If you're into compeditive games or even just 2D platformers you'll love this game.

4855	Turned on te game, went super speed on the second race i played 10/10 would go super speed agian
4856	It's a good game if you play online. It offers endless hours of fun. Also don't play the crap workshop levels. I rate 8.5/10. (during early access I would rate 7.5/10 because there wasn't as much cool stuff) It's one of the best games in my library.

4874	That game is so stupid.And I love it
4875	 Early Access Review
4876	Honestly, by far one of my all time favourite games!
4877	Freaking love this game. It's 2D Mario Kart. Get some controllers, get some friends, bash it out like it's N64 days all over again.
4878	  Gotta go fast    wish you didn't have to pay for trails, great game tho

4890	Very Good Game!
4891	Stands up to it's name
4892	One of best Indie competition games ! A must-have for speedrun lovers
4893	Fast paced, Challenging, and definitly Rage inducing. This is a great game for someone who wants to test their skill in momentum, timing, and SPEED. Online Multiplayer is rage inducing but if you pay attention you will learn soemthing 
4894	This is the exact type of game I suck at and I love it!! One of those annoyingly amazing frustrating rage enducing games that you see people make look easy and then BANG it really is not!  It is fast paced, challenging and hilarious with friends! a real must have for some quick banter and instant swearing!
4895	This game is 10/10
4896	I just love this game so much. When it was released for Mac I had SOO much fun with my friends. Would def recommend it, and I would buy the dlcs but its only for Windows Q.Q   10/10 Would Play NMW.

4898	Whether you play with your friends or againt random people on the innternet you're guarenteed to have a blast with this game. That being said, if you ever want to seriously rank up, you're going to need a lot of practice. The skill platforms between ranks in this game increase exponentially.
4899	A pretty good game where you  gotta go fast  and become   the fastest man alive  so you can end your friendships with one single grappling hook. 5/7
4900	Funny game i like it.It's verry fun to play with your friends.Reccomend you to buy this game

4925	Very fun game with neat mechanics
4926	Think Mario Kart or Worms for lovers of platformers. You can easily dip in and out of this so you can either play a couple of quick rounds or spend longer trying to improve.  Personally I find it funny when I manage to show a rare moment of brilliance by clawing my way to the front of the pack only to destroy myself in a comedy of errors in quick succession. Your mileage may vary.   Sometimes you'll get stuck with a group that favours voting for the same couple of fan made levels which I personally find a bit tedious to play but there is a good variety of stages both official and fan made.  It's up to you whether you want to just play casually or build on your skils and work you way through the level rankings but either way there is fun to be had and it never feels like a real chore.

4933	pretty fun with friends gotta go fast
4934	john is bad at it
4935	Holy crap have I enjoyed this game. Many people are right. It's like mario kart and Smash bros. mixed into a single game. This is perfect when you gather with friends and just play for a while. Although when you try to go competitive it just takes you to the moon. The only things I don't like are the community and the fact that it is not very well known. The community doesn't focus much on the fun of it and will scold you for using items in online play. It's not perfect but it is too much fun.

4956	great game, but there aren't too many players :/
4957	Great game, highly addictive and very satisfying when you nail it.
4958	I nominated Speedrunners, because I have a lot of fun, while playing this with my friends.
4959	Better with friends so that you can yell at them for hooking you, shooting missles at you, for blocking your hooks, and making your life miserable. Better with friends so that you can laugh at them when you win or yell at them when you lose.  10/10
4960	Best game to have fun with friends.
4961	You want play game with your friends? Buy this game.  10/10

4963	  Great game! In this game you simply just try to run faster than your opponent. ItÂ´s very fun with friends. Power ups are awesome. Some players are salty but it doesnÂ´t matter. ItÂ´s not a pay to win game. You can unlock skins and characters by leveling up. There can be little bit glitches but it doesnÂ´t affect the gameplay a lot.. I recommend this game for all kinds of players. If you donÂ´t have friends... GET SOME FRIENDS TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH!
4964	Super Fast, Super speedy, Much sonic, Much wow, Buy the game.
4965	This game is a great way to spend an afternoon yelling at your friends.
4966	i found this game by watching some youtubers and i thought that it looked like a good amount of fun, however i didnt have much money so i was a bit hesitant to buy it. After a couple of months i recieved a notification that the game was free for the weekend so epople could try it out. after about 10 hours in two days i bought the game the moment the trial ended. its an absolutely great game which i have never regretted buying because it has gameplay which is always entertaning. whether you're struggling to keep up with a pro, slowing down for a noob or having an intense match with someone on par you can always have a laugh about the result. And probably one of the greatest hings about this game is the community, this game gets nowhere near the same amount of toxic players as other games, almost all of the players are friendly happy people (i honestly believe that in all of my time playing i've only come across 10 toxic players and 1 bot). as a result i could not recommend this game enough and encourage you to get it as soon a you can.  I look forward to seeing you on the race track.

4998	It's like if mario kart and super meat boy had a baby. Except it also brings along the frustrations of those games with it, albeait less extreme. So be prepared for that, and let the friendship tarnishing commence!
4999	  the only thing this game is missing is a fail compilation
5000	Games consist of the following -Troll your friends -Troll other players -Use skills everytime -Be the secret characters  Yeah I love it!
5001	Amazing game. It's so simple, but so entertaining. I can play it for hours without being bored. From online multiplayer to story, and singleplayer. 5/5 stars.
5002	If you need local activity, buy this game. Plain and simple. I cannot even review the 1 player because I've never played haha. This is one of the ultimate couch gaming experiences. I can play with my 8yr son or my 30 year old fiance. This is a great game for all ages that never gets old. I would even pay full price!

5261	Easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay. The platforming 'feels good', netcode and matchmaking are great, and the community is large for an indie game. There is full workshop support and thus player made levels ad nauseam, many of which are excellent.  3.5/5

5334	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10

5336	This game takes all the fun of Mario Kart 64 and puts it into a 2D platform engine. It's very addictive, fun as a party game and equally fun as a 'Story Mode' playthrough. Tinybuild is a sponsor of Games Done Quick and I purchased this after it was advertised on the twitch live stream. They have a very good original game in almost every genre you can imagine so this studio has something for everyone. If you're into compeditive games or even just 2D platformers you'll love this game.

5656	Very Very Goood. Fun to play with friends
5657	This game is fun
5658	A very fun game reminiscent of Running Wild, but unfortunatley hamppered by some of the most unbalanced ranked multiplayer I've ever experienced. I recomend only if you don't care about online rankings or leaderboards.
5659	Definietly a game to play with a few friends when they're over, fun and casual, if you're not sure about purchasing just wait for a sale.

5687	This game has always been a favorite playing at a friends house. its awesome endless hours of fun! It recently became avaliable on mac so i purchased out of pure excitement. I also recently purchased a steam controller since most of my games are controller supported. well it didnt quite pan out as I planned. it doesnt work with a lot of games controller supported or not, no matter how i configure the controller. I can still play with the keyboard, but id love to see it working on speedrunners soon. 9.5/10  ps. of coarse the guy with a mac buys a steam controller *facepalm*
5688	A really fun game once you get familiar with its physics. The only complaint I'd have is the ranking system, which sometimes puts experts with not-so-good players. But this only happens when there aren't many players online, so it's forgivable.

5695	A fast paced game that is great to play with friends.
5696	'Graphics: Your toaster'  It's a good game.
5697	  Very funny and good game +100.
5698	This game is fun and fast paced with it's variety of characters, weapons, and many workshop maps.  It also has a ranked system if your into that jazz &amp; a level up system that unlocks skin varieties and new characters.   It also has secret codes for new characters - YOU CAN BE A POTATO   If you and your friends are looking for a game to tear you friend ship apart with very frustrating races. Go for it.

Oh, there's also Bionic Commando-style grappling hooks, Mario Kart-style item pickups, and Meat Boy-style 'any mistakes are your own' controls. If you've ever enjoyed a platformer before, there's no reason for you to not buy this game.

5709	Not even horror games get my heart pumping this fast.
5710	Outrun your friends in a unique 'racing' game with endless possibilities (thanks to the level editor).  To start off, the visual design of this game is absolutely fantastic- inspired by typical comic book designs and streamlined character spritework. The sound effects and overall sound design is quite nice and really fitting as well. Even though the game uses the same music while racing for the most part, they've somehow managed to make sure that it never really gets old or in the way.  The concept is simple: Run so fast that your friends get ripped into the void and explode.  With an assortment of power ups, tons of both great developer AND workshop made levels- there's almost no end to how much you can play this. Speaking of which, the level editor is great in this game and anyone interested in levels creators should take a crack at this one.  Sometimes you manage this perfect streak of constant speed, from boosters, items, slopes, and grappling (oh yes, the grappling), and it's surprising how satisfying it is to do so. Meanwhile you scream at the top of your lungs SPEEEEEEEEEEEED as your friends get torn apart by the edge of the world eating them alive.  Tons of characters with different colour palettes to choose from so that you can pick your favourite appearance, none of which affect any parameters so there's no concern of character imbalance.  If you're looking for a lighthearted racer and have some friends (preferrably around your same skill level because it DOES matter), this is a must-buy. It's on sale pretty frequently and it's generally pretty cheap too.

5720	This game has really nice fast paced gameplay and something MANY games lack and that would be local multiplayer. This game is beyond fantastic when playing with friends to pass some time. I often play it on the train with a friend of mine to pass the two hours.  And even though this review so far seems positive, that only applies to the local MP and VERY few online matches.  This game is overflowing with cancerous smurfers who abuse every single glitch, bug to just steam roll you. When you come into this game you're a legitimate entry or beginner league. So are those idiots who need to compensate something and take it out on new players. All of them either make new accounts solely to buy the game or de-rank in ranked by just letting everyone beat you.  The end result is you (newbie) getting paired up with up to 3 pixel perfect virgins who do absolutely nothing but play the game from the looks of it. You'll know it when you see it for yourself.  But as I said at the start: This game IS fun if you have friends (People you actually know IRL) to play with. I would have made this review positive but it's more likely that anyone who gets the game will go play a random game online than a game with their friends and that is why I can't recommend this game.  If you're looking for local MP, feel free to get it. (I honestly waited for a sale because I kind of knew what I was going into with the Online and I suggest you do too but it's your money.)
5721	In some update they made it so you have to unlock everything with earning XP by winning rounds, even power-ups to pick up need to be unlocked this way now. That took a lot out of the fun for me. Also the menu screens barely work and look very dodgy. Overall the game feels more like an early access or 2000-era flash game.
5722	 Early Access Review
5723	Don't buy this. It's 15 dollars for a game thats fun for about 3 hours. Not to mention, you unlock characters/levels/items through leveling up, and this game literally has one of the slowest level up systems ever. It takes up to 50 matches to go up one level, and one match can be anywhere between 2 minutes to 20 minutes. The online community is full of incredibly toxic people and annoying kids who won't stop spamming the chat with 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hackers, stop using the golden hookshot!'. The maps are very bland and short, and despite the fact there are about 25 or so maps, only 4-5 ever get chosen. The ranked matchmaking system makes no sense and unfairly places people, no matter how many matches you win or lose. The art style is simple and sleek, and I do like the art style, but the interesting artistic style is wasted on the poor character designs. Look up some of the characters, and just see how ugly they look, not just in game, but also in their menu screen images/round win images. Characters like the Japanese cat, Sherlock Bones and the Shark are just painful to look at (I just call them by what they are, because I'm not taking the time to remember the names of over 30 hideous characters).  The servers on online are also terrible. Every 1/20 games you play or so you will have nobody that lags. Every single game, everybody is lagging, or someone is lagging out the server, or the game is glitching. It also doesn't help that there are only at one time about 1600-1800 people online, and despite that it tries its best to pair you in the same server multiple times. I played a match in which it was me and 2 other people. I managed to beat the other person, but the camera was stuck on an AFK player, playing Skullduggery. I couldn't even see my character, yet i was alive, and I ended up just being stuck and running around. After about 2 minutes, I just exploded and Skullduggery won. The game is incredibly buggy, full of toxic children, and people that shout 'HACKER' at good players, and every once and a while a legitmate hacker shows up and ruins the fun.   Seriously though, over 40 characters, over 20 maps, and yet almost every character is poorly designed and only 4-5 maps are chosen? Barely any content, stupid, overpriced game with overpriced sell-out 'YOUTUBE POPULAR MEME!' DLC, and overall I just can't recommend this game. It's too small, has no playerbase, and has very little content. Fun for about 3-4 hours. It sucks that I played for 3 hours and 10 minutes, because if i didn't spend that 10 minutes I would definetly request a refund.
5724	WTF HAPPENED?!  I have played this game for endless hours and showed support for it throughout it's run on early access and had tons of fun with it. But now it's fully released and it's been released in a terrible state. The early access versions were in a pretty good state when they were launched, so how, after like 2 years of being in EA, how can you mess up it's official launch.  There are tons of online issues that I have encountered in the final version, which a friend of mine complained about in the EA version and the devs did nothing to fix any of the issues he complained about. Servers randomly crashing, Cameras zooming inso u can't see what you're doing, all of those problems are still present in the full release.  In my opinion, this is still in Early access, because not all of the content is in the game, you've locked off unlockable trails that you claim are in Beta. That means that this should still be in early access if you're asking us to be your beta testers for trails you haven't officially launched.  When the game worked and when the game didn't crash on me randomly, I did have fun with the game, I want you to understand that and I hope that these issues are fixed in the future.  As the game currently stands in it's 'fully released' version, I can't recommend it with the problems that are currently facing it. I really want this game to be a success and I fealt really sad when I saw all of these issues. I want to like this game but these glaring issues prevent me from doing so.

5728	It's not that it isn't a fun game, it is. But it's glitchy as all hell.   There are hundreds of spots that on each map that are goning to mess up you game due to some glitch. Mayby it's a ledge where you get stuck, or a platform where you get stuck or a wall where you get stuck or 'name a thing' and you get stuck. That's not including any user submitted maps, And I haven't even started about the Online or Ranked part. Literally, literally not figuratively, everyone and their grandmother is cheating.  You thought CoD was full of cheaters? You haven't seen nothing yet!  Everyone who isn't cheating is lagging out their â¥â¥â¥! Rarely do you play a game where at least, AT LEAST! one of the players has a â¥â¥â¥â¥ connection. The ONLY redeeming factor is that on custom games it's more stable, which means you can easily play with you friends.

Speedrunners is a best game for single play. Or Multyplayer in speedrunners suck â¥â¥â¥.

5733	Been keeping an eye on this game for a while. Sale finally rolls around so I buy a 4-pack. Install game. Doesn't work. Go through page after page on forums trying out any possible fix I can find. Nothing. Seems to be a common enough problem since there's a pinned FAQ topic for the game not launching created by the dev. Already gave a copy to my girlfriend so I can't get a refund through Steam without going through her account first?  This is the only game I've bought this sale. Aaaand...it doesn't work for me. For what it's worth, it works on my girlfriend's computer.
5734	With over 100 hours i can say this game was really good WAS untill the game became community map reliant and you have to learn all the new â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community maps. I would try to learn one of the new maps then another would come out before i even learnt the first one, it was a good game but community maps ruined it.

5757	Speedrunners is a fun multiplayer game that turned bad with it's latest update.  The game itself is good, the mechanics work, the graphics are fitting and the menu has mouse support... yay.  I can nitpick a little about the steep learning curve for beginners or that it doesn't auto adjust screen resolution and only runs in 16:9 (or with black bars) but that are minor complains.  The big gamebreaker is the unlock system. I have to say that I generally disagree with unlock systems in Multiplayer games, as I think, that fun gameplay (which theoretically is given here) should be the motivator for playing a game.  This game provides one of the poorest examples I have seen so far as you only have acces to two maps and four characters in the beginning. To unlock the others you have to level up, wich in my opinion takes to much time to do .  Because I only bought this game for local coop and am not interested in online play at all, this game is now pretty much unplayable.  I can not recommend this game for local multiplayer.

5800	Lets make this quick... This game... very promising on the outside and many people would put themselves in front of this game to protect it, but what I believe is the complete opposite. This was the biggest waste of my money because the heart wrenchingly boring gameplay, the first five minutes has a lot of potential but after those few minutes this became an astronomical waste of my time and money. This 'game' loses its flare relatively quick, and when you buy this game for 15$...Whew!!! what a waste!!! If you plan on even spending a dime on this... THINK AGAIN!!!! Steam has so many better games that you could get 50 hours out of easily. I wish i could've returned it but at the time I didnt know you could do that with steam. All I'm saying is... Do your research, Do not look at the intro video (All that thing does is hype you up for a dissapointment, And most importantly keep looking before you buy...
5801	Locking characters and stages behind an xp grind is just super tedious for those who want to just dive right in with friends. 1-2 bonus ones would be fine but locking the absolutely majority behind the xp wall is a terrible idea.

5935	For the map factory you can get a sick grapple at the eastern side of the map. However there is a better way to get up...and there is a item at the top of it. This allows ther person who makes a sick grappel get fuqed by the item; which could be a: Golden Grappel, Shockwave, etc...   I think this should be removed and destroyed and desinigrated. Destroy the atoms and electons that lerk inside.

5941	Buy this and you're going to have a tough time.  Can't enjoy it really. I noticed it had realeased today, so I figured it might have some new players to be evenly matched against.  It doesn't. You'll be matched round 1 against people with hundreds if not thousands of rounds in their belt. I literally got put in a game with a platinum ranked person on my very first quick game.  I mean, you could say that you will learn and catch up to the 195 current players on release day, but they're that damn good that you won't even get a chance to play enough to figure the game out. Played it for 20 minutes but felt like I had 2 minutes of gameplay and 18 minutes watching others.  Bad first impressions, just down to how difficult it would be to get into as a new buyer when it has been about for so long.

5990	NOTE - I didn't proofread this all that much, their may be a few minor grammatical/ punctuation mistakes. Sorry but it's just a review for a game :P .  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR - 542 hours on game,friends with devs, played with the best, was one of the best, can't recommend, buggy and runs baddy (and has only gotten worse), a joke of a Ranked/ 'e-sport' game, endless dev cycle. NOT Worth $15 at all!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  542 Hours on this game, played with the best, got to Silver league (when there were less then 70 in it) and 6 gold players. Made friends with most of the developers, bought it for 4 other people.  Yet I no longer can recommend this game at all, it's not worth $15 at all the average player will play like a couple hours then be bored because the lack of game modes, endless bugs/ glitches (which have become more apparent with every update) not to mention the game runs worse with each update, used to run steady 60fps no v-sync now it has random FPS drops randomly and Iâm not the only one.  The game has no game modes just small modifiers that are really just gimmicks with no actual value and add nothing to the game, the core design of this game leads it to being repetitive as hell, the workshop maps are generally terrible, re-hashes, or just not fun to play with few exceptions. There is also the fact that currently the Single player doesn't play at all like multi-player and hasn't been touched in years. Also the fact that it's in basically in infinite development cycle.  Also, the Ranked/ 'e-sport' part of this game is a joke because of how bare minimum this games mechanics are, the skill-ceiling is not low but it's really just getting more consistent at things, and using items which are pure RNG. And with that the levels after zoo and most levels in general off of the Ranked Workshop and Official set of maps are really not that great at all for a competitive scene.  I can keep going, but i think my main points were made. Even with all the time i put in and even being consistently recognized by the developers  (https://gyazo.com/9a6e9100bf84aba1287f1921e056abc9  ) being listed on the Demo page (when that was a thing) and more, i can not recommend this game because the only enjoyment i found out of it was if you are in a Skype call talking to someone the whole time otherwise it's boring, and if you aren't a person who likes to do repetitive game play you're going to have issues!

6173	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!!
6174	This is not a bad game, however there are more pros than cons. Pros: Fun with friends. Helps improve your reaction time, and your reflex with your keyboard. Cons: It is not worth 15 dollars nor 10, graphics are simple, and nothing about it shows that it deserves to be on that price range, so i recomment to buy it on sale. Rage quits...a lot of rage quits, personal experience, however this is due to the fact that the game â¥â¥â¥â¥s you, every single map have a cheap shot spot, where if u mess up u lose, there are no combacks unless u can reciver instantly, but i doubt it because of the fact that the game itself will punish u for messing it up once, if u dont believe me and u have this game go see for yourselves. Online is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t half the time because so many players are salty, and please do not play online if u just got the game because most likely u will get beaten over and over again. Conclusion: Speed runners is not a bad game, i do recommend some to get it but if u are a slow learner, or rage quits easily (because a lot of stupid and cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥ will happen) dont get this game, also like i said before plz get this on sale, i hate the producers for making this game cost 15 dollars, i honestly dont see why they would do that. One tip i will give u is practice and memorize, because if u dont practice or know the maps u will lose over and over again. To me i have a love and hate relationship with this game because there is just so many stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ that â¥â¥â¥â¥en tilts me, like camera movement will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, the starting postions are random, and half the time u will have to gamble which move u have to take.
6175	Completely abandonded after they 'released' the game.  Ranked mode is garbage since they allow custom stages and they also slapped everyone in the face with microtransactions.
6176	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, it crashes every time on the second level(the boat one). And it's the worst kind of crash too, I have to sign out to kill it. I don't recommend it because it just doesn't work.

6181	To be honest im kinda addicted to this game at first,but i thinks it's kinda dying now when i try to find online matchmaking it's really hard,sometimes i get none.Maybe the developper need to make this game like free for only like 1 or 2 days,because i dont think this game will last any longer.
6182	I'll leave negative responce for this now. Game is totaly great and fun. Especially if you play it shot or with friends.  What minuses are - it's totaly clear that devs don't play it hard. So there some glithes, some mechanical bugs and many other stuff.  Also if you want to beat game fully and get all of achievement you'll find this game totaly annoying. First: dialogs are fun only ONE time. After repeating level after level with bots in story this totaly makes this game bad. Also no ability to restart level also bad. Last thing: bots on 'unfair' difficulty are totaly unfair. By that I mean that they aren't beatable on some levels. First - they always outrun you whatever you do. Faster you run - more f*** up they became. even with fastest lap time and record you will lose just cuz'!   At all other things game is pretty much awesome! But devs, please, play you game as intended from begining till end rebalance so at least you could win 5-10 times in a row without depending on luck!
6183	  hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and going online is pretty much pointless. meh.

6185	Fireburst is a fantastic looking car combat game that lives and dies on its fire attack nitro boosts that can also kill you. When your car overheats you explode and respawn. Ramming through a red barrel will make your vehicle heat up considerably. To keep your vehicle cool there are plenty of puddles, water falls and blue barrels to drive through. Its an interesting mechanic that has you watching the flames on your windshield rather than the action on the course.  Its a game that puts forth a lot of style, attitude, presence and ascetic. Almost every locale is a beautiful vista whether its driving along side a dam or on an oil rig the game looks superb and even the most mundane areas look incredible thanks to light, shadow and style. This shadow can be your downfall, because there are no headlights even in a darkened train yard. Its easy to get stuck in a dark corner. You can always adjust the brightness in the options to see better.  The game plays good and runs smooth. Its like a lot of other arcade racers where you control with forward and backward rather than a real brake. There is a boost button that doubles as a weapon and you have the ability to see behind your car and change between a chase cam or a hood view.  The vehicles look great as well. There's a diverse array of cars, trucks, racers, muscle cars, dune buggies, jeeps and even vans. There's something to your liking each with its own stats for speed, acceleration, handling and heat resistance. They all have their own heat attacks such as leaving flaming tire tracks for opponents to drive over and heat up. A fire burst, a fire shield and a fire wall. The longer you hold the boost, the greater your range.  Of course the issue is using these attacks heats up your vehicle, so why even use them unless there's plenty of water around and even if there's a pool or waterfall, that means your opponents can benefit from them as well making it useless. I think of the combat as a gamble. Who will die faster? You or the foe next to you? That's my real problem with the game. So I relegate myself to using it only as boost when my engine is cool.  The game starts with eight racers to chose from each of which is a caricature of a stereotype that gives Fireburst its flavor, flair and style. You have the seasoned stock racer, the juggy goth, a big money businessman with a mohawk, an old hippy ladies man, a slim blonde nerd with glasses, an Asian schoolgirl that might be too young to drive and so on. They all have their own stats and they all say things as they race. Its part of the game's attitude for the old hippy to say 'I could be your father,' or someone else that says 'yes they're real.'  The voice work is good and believable and sometimes what I think is glitched. The old hippy keeps sputtering the same random comments over and over with no break in between. Perhaps it was just him or that circumstance. I've come across another visual glitch that had the game stuck in black and white until I quit the race and went to a new one.  As for the game itself there are three major modes, a challenge campaign that lets you participate in different challenges for each driver. I consider this to be the main mode because its the one that lets you unlock new vehicles and new drivers. I'll be honest and say while I'm not into drivers as characters, this game does a good job of making me want to unlock them. The real problem is the challenges themselves are difficult and convoluted due to the fire mechanic.  Some events are simple like make it through a warm-up lap and then a qualifying lap. Others force you to win or win without wrecking more than three times. Then there are some which force you to hold your boost twenty seconds without wrecking. On paper this might sound easy, because let's just put a bunch of hoses, puddles and blue barrels around, but that's what makes it challenging. Doing all of it for twenty seconds. Even doing it for five is a challenge, but you need to start somewhere. These challenges turn me off, but for anyone that's into them, they are different for each character with each one putting you behind the wheel of a different vehicle.  With the other two modes, they're more mundane, a race and a destruction derby. The derbies are built in figure eights and they're really a testament to game design. This ensures that someone will always zoom by you giving you enough time to destroy them and that way the maps stay short and sweet. The races are what I care about and there are twelve in all at least from the start. After one race, the same race starts again and that's a let down. These are closed circuit courses with two or so laps taking place in real world environments. Airfields, an oil refinery at night, a fright port, a gorgeous giant bridge similar to the Golden Gate with a different bridge below it and so on.  I stress even if these locales seem ordinary, the game and its aesthetic makes them incredible. You'll find ramps, jumps and branching paths in each of the courses. There are places to drive through parked cargo planes. Other areas have shipwrecks or driving by moonlight. The look awesome and they play awesome. A lot of work was put into each one to make it feel special with a twist. The refinery lets you drive through moonlit water. The oil rig has ramped walls and even the fright depot has jumps and tunnels beneath towering cranes.  For people that like to hand tweak settings there's a program launcher that lets you update controls before you get into the game, along with advanced settings to let you update the ini files yourself. It would have been nice to have all of this in game rather than having guess work, but something is still better than nothing. You can tweak your graphical settings the same way. The texture pop in is noticeable when outside of a race. The character and vehicle textures both take a split second to load and its a problem larger developers still struggle with, so I can see past it.  When you respawn, you're already driving and you just fade into reality again. Its a good way to keep the action going, but make sure not to respawn in any other vehicles. I've also managed to hang up on some questionable places and explode even when trying to get unstuck. It feels like that issue could have been better. The whole exploding for ramming something too rough in an arcade racer seems to take away from the fun factor. I found myself exploding far too frequent. What's odd is the fact you can explode on the simplest things, yet try as I might, i could never roll a vehicle. Sure I'd drive on the side of a wall, but never roll or explode.  There is local multiplayer splitscreen and online multiplayer, but a budget title a year after its release always has a struggle keeping players playing online.  Fireburst is a tough game to enjoy its main challenge mode. There's a higher than necessary skill level for what is essentially an arcade racer. You can always slide the skill slider to your preferred level, but even then it feels like there's no happy medium where racers can be competitive. Take out what makes the game unique and it would make for a better experience while crushing the soul of what makes it unique. Its a tough toss up, but it should stand on its gimmick even if sucks the joy out of an otherwise fun experience.
6186	Probably one of the laziest games I've ever come to play... Gameplay is sloppy, graphics are not that good, characters are just painful stereotypes, none of them are really funny, and they just come out as annoying, tracks don't match the gamestyle of the game, there's too much going on wherever you go, so it's hard to keep track of where you're supposed to go. It's a mess...
6187	Don't buy this game. Game itself is not bad, it's ok. But, 2 achievements are bugged and multiplayer mod is dead. Developer don't give a fu about this game anymore, so it's pretty deep in gravejard...
6188	Bah, I really wish there was a mixed review option. This game isn't bad, but it's not somthing I'll probably go back to again. Although I like the cast of characters and the track design is neat, the handling is the slighest bit off to feel discomforting and the entire gimmick the game is based off of does not really carry the game that far.
6189	Fireburst. I got this on a bundle some time ago, and I gave it a shot. Very, very bad decision. Imagine a game that has horrible optimization, lack of graphical options, bad controls and performance, lots of bugs and the lack of controller support (the K+M controls are obnoxious nevertheless). Now, I could be describing a bad PC port but, guess what, this game is a PC exclusive. Horrific. The game is about races in a post-nuclear world, and make games like Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (which are not good) look excellent. 2 broken achievements, dead multiplayer, dreadful campaign. If you have this on your library you will want to keep him there untoutchable, rusting in peace. 34/100.
6190	Motorstorm: Cheap Edition now on PC!
6191	After I played the demo on 360 and moderately-enjoyed it, I figured what the hell I'll pick this up during the Steam Summer Sale. I had been wanting to pick up a racing game, and this seemed to have an interesting mechanic. I really don't care for the podunk skew they seemed to throw onto it, and the handling feels very loose on a USB gamepad. (which unless you enjoy fish-tailing constantly in a racing game and not being able to make accurate turns, is not a good thing..) The graphics are average and the music, although it has some cool licensed tracks, seems to repeat the same 3 or 4 songs every race. What else is there to say? It's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ racing game. Don't buy it.
6192	This is a pretty bad racing game. Graphically it looks okay. Buggy as all hell. Controls are not great. I think the biggest deterrent is the lack of multiplayer support. I would look elsewhere for your racing needs.
6193	Multiplayer doesn't work.
6194	Good track design, poor controls, uninspired challenges, and horrific music that can't be reconfigured or disabled (unless you disable all sound). The music was the biggest thing that put me off. Switches from popmetal to wanna-be Pantera, and I didn't hang around long enough to see if there was a third song. Background music without singing would have been better IMO.  The Advanced Settings fires up a text editor and loads the INI file.   This whole thing feels lazy and rushed. Much like my review.
6195	Meh controls, Meh physics, Meh..
6196	What is this game? Why do I have it?
6197	I've tried to use this game, but after the first race it require R key to proceed, but the key didn't works. Then it ask to press Esc, and also there the Key didn't work.  For me it's impossible to play : this game didn't works! 0/10
6198	This game is terrible, but thats probably what I should expect for like $1.
6199	game is broken, supper glitchy and lacks polish. its pretty much a poor clone of motor storm with boost causing the other racers to start dieing around you, which makes things easy because half the time the boost glitches and becomes unlimited, causing you to auto win.
6200	
6201	If you can get it for Pennys then get it but anything more is a rip off
6202	One word: Rubbish
6203	He's dead, Jim.
6204	It's not that bad a game - It's a good concept in a game that just fails to appeal enough to keep playing it. 
6205	This is really, really fun game...great tone to play when bored. BUT...multiplayer died so there's no more point in buyin' it, right?
6206	Avoid it! Run away from it! It's a complete waste of money, belive me...
6207	Not even worth $1
6208	Oh so crazy racing game the revolves all about a heat mechanic. You gain extra speed but heat up your engine and need to cool it down by driving through puddles or water drums. Feels unpolished and loveless
6209	This is a competitive/PvP racing game along the lines of Motorstorm.  At first look it seems fun, and there's a nice soundtrack and some interesting looking action. Don't be fooled.  First, crippling stability issues - I had to force reboot my PC after the game killed the screen. There's numerous bugs.  It's a console port and while some effort was made to improve the feature set for PCs, there's no 4K support.  The gameplay and soundtrack? While they seem promising at first, they're all you get - about 4 licensed tracks that get incredibly repetitive, limited gameplay, it's just not fun, and the bugs and poor graphics options just make this not worth spending money on.
6210	After 70 plus hours in this game, I can confidently admit the game is broken. I can't recommend it in its current state. The game is dazzling to look at, and the sound design is nothing short of incredible with my Soundblaster Z sound card. The feel of the tracks are authentic, making it as if I'm really there. However, the game has a fatal flaw, which results in frustration and ultimate dissatisfaction. The penalty system in the game is simply too stringent. Codemasters said the issue was fixed in F1 2013, but it makes me wonder why they don't patch/fix the issue in this game.   There is nothing more frustrating to be trapped in a group of cars bunched in a corner, and getting a drive through penalty for 'illegal blocking.' Or a car driven by the AI bumping up against you, and acquiring another drive through penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior. I just spent an hour and a half in a race with 28 laps to go, and accrued two such flags in one lap. That pretty much guaranteed a last place finish. This needs to be fixed.
6211	Mini Moto Racing EVO is a game that ought to be more fun than it is. A isometric arcade racer in the vein of Rock ânâ Roll Racing and Micro Machines, from the outside looking in it would appear the stars had aligned for a brilliant modern take on the genre. The art style is adorable and bursting with charm and personality, it features an absurd amount of content, and the online multiplayer and track editor are just the icing on the cake to ensure you never run out of stuff to do. Whatâs so terribly unfortunate though, is all these good feelings evaporate once you get behind the wheel.  Mini Moto is designed to be extremely accessible, from the light as air physics to the quick and simple to navigate courses, which makes for an enjoyable first hour or so as you get your feet wet and start blowing through courses. After that point, the experience begins to sour. Races grow repetitive, often simply reversing the track or changing the lighting and camera angle slightly, and end in an extremely unsatisfying manner. Simply continuing on with them quickly becomes a grind, as youâre given such little reason to do so and the racing itself is far too shallow to sustain the game on its own.  Expounding the grind is the leveling system, which I would go so far as to say fundamentally breaks the game. Every car you drive can be upgraded with cash earned from races, but instead of scaling to your carâs specs your competitors just continue to upgrade their own vehicles the more races you partake in, presumably with the expectation youâd have similar upgrades of your own. What this means is that you are either stuck putting all your cash into one car for the duration of the championship mode, removing much of the fun out of having such a variety of vehicles to choose from, or forced to grind through the same races in order to have enough to upgrade another car to switch to without having to start again at square one. Itâs supremely monotonous and a poor design decision for the sort of game the developers created.  Without a doubt my biggest grievance with Mini Moto though, is the astonishingly bad AI of the computer racers. They crash into each other even to their own detriment, fire nitros at the worst possible time, and in general act like an idiotic band of monkeys that somehow got ahold of dozens of vehicles. The lack of any decent reward for winning races is bad enough, but when you do so against some of the worst AI racers Iâve ever seen in a game it just becomes a chore to do so. The online MP could fix this in theory, but unless you have several friends to play with youâll be entirely out of luck as nobody else is playing the online mode anymore.  Itâs really a huge shame that so many elements of EVO are a product of poor design decisions, because there are a lot of genuinely fantastic parts to it that deserve a better racing experience. The art style for the cars and tracks is fantastic, with tons of color and some great off-brand recreations of classic and novelty vehicles. The track editor is surprisingly expansive and easy to use, which could have allowed for some great user generated content if people cared enough to put the time into making something original.  But regardless of its presentation or feature list, a racing game with poor racing is impossible to recommend. I put a lot of time into Mini Moto Racing EVO, more than I should have, but regardless of how long I played or what races I chose I wasnât having fun with any of it. Thereâs something mind numbingly addictive about the way EVO is structured, pushing me through race after race no matter how little I got out of it, or how much I wanted to just call it quits because it was sucking me dry. I donât want to say I hate the game, but itâs one Iâm forcing myself to uninstall.   Itâs like a bad relationship, giving me nothing but keeping me trapped until I finally come to my senses and realize I need to get out.
6212	âº Easy to play. âº Lovely visuals. âº Brilliantly realised Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps.  â¹ Unchallenging. â¹ Wonky physics. â¹ Drunk AI Drivers.  (Note: This game was played with a controller).  Mini Motor Racing EVO is a casual top down racer suitable for most ages, with easy to grasp controls and an aesthetic that greatly reminds me of playing with toy cars as a youngster.  While there is a decent selection of maps (and most notably the Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps are brilliantly realised), they quickly become repetitive as you play them again and again through the championships - in forward, reverse and with the camera on a slightly different angle (which is a surprisingly clever way of making the same track play a little differently). There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.  While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.  The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track. There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.  At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.  It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track.
6213	DO NOT BUY THIS  I tried to finish the game in order to write a proper review, but I gave up. This game makes pretty much every mistake an arcade racer can make. The first couple of races are just fine, but later on the issues this game has start ruining it to such an extend it is no longer fun to play.  The AI: Probably the biggest issue. They are not on the track to win. They are there to make sure you don't win. Without hesitation they will boost into you from every possible angle in order to slow you down or flip you over. When the best strategy in a racing game involves restarting the race so many times until you manage to make a clean getaway instead of actually racing your opponents, you know things are not as they should be.  Wonky car handling: It's an arcade racer, so realistic car handling is not to be expected. But the cars in this game behave very vague and inconsistent, making for a very frustrating experience. Good examples of the weird car physics are slopes or ramps. You can drive onto them in the exact same spot for 5 laps and everything's just fine and on lap 6 it suddenly spins your car around on the spot and brings you to a dead stop (after which 9 times out of 10 an AI boosts into you to finish the job). And don't even think about driving off or onto a slope while steering as it will make you spin out of control instantly.  Invisible objects: A lot of the tracks are plagued with invisible objects and walls on the corners. In some corners the cars can pretty much clip through objects without issue, and on other corners you find yourself smashing into an invisible wall that is sticking out into the track.  Prize money too low: With the very low amounts of prize money you get, it becomes a real grind in order to fully upgrade a 2nd, let alone a 3rd car. And you absolutely want multiple cars in the later cups in order to use their individual strengths and weaknesses for different tracks.   It's a shame really, as the general design of this game is very good. Graphics, track design, music and car design are all very nicely done, but it's the actual gameplay that ruins it. If you're looking for a good micro machines-style racer, then look at Bang Bang Racing instead. While that game also has it's issues it is much more enjoyable then this one.
6214	It pains me to say this but I'm not going to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO basically down to the game having really bad physics. Most of my play time was spent racing with a friend in 1v1 races which were generally decided by how the physics treated the player. In some occasions a vehicle could get flipped on its side seemingly randomly and on a lot of occasions an agressive side-swipe at my opponent would leave me in a worse off situation than him! There seemed to be no realism or accuracy in the physics therefore removing any type of skill factor in the driving and racing.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBu8tufUp4   Now the game looks really nice and fun. It almost seems criminal to me to make a top-down racing game appear so nice and colorful to look at but then get let down by such a major game-breaking factor!  There's a large array of cars to choose from and an even more impressive track selection with day and night variants. I learned today that the game also has Steam Workshop for creating and sharing your own track designs!!  You have an option of two different systems to control your vehicle. The first type is the more conventional method of rotate/steer the car clockwise/anti-clockwise and the second type is to push in the direction you want to travel. Now the second method of pusing in the desired direction of travel sounds awful to me but I actually found it a more efficient way to play this game. You still have to accelerate and brake the same with both methods. It's worth testing them both out with an open mind and seeing which works best for you.  There is no local co-op feature but the online multiplayer works fine. I'm not sure about the playerbase but I managed to find my steam friend to play with without any problems and our games ran smoothly.  So many positive points about this game let down by a lack of fine-tuning in the physics. The game boasts 'cross-platform multiplayer' so possibly the physics were acceptable on a mobile platform. I think on the PC platform we expect a bit more from our game.  If you can put up with the clunky physics and have a friend or three to play with then you could have some fun for sure. For me though, it removed almost all competiveness and thus removed the fun and motivation to race further.
6215	I've changed my mind. This game is AWFUL, AWFUl, AWFUL! And i still will try to beat it.. Because it looks cute and is fun occasionally, when you manage to take lead. But.. physics are just outrages. Your car bumps on many invisible bumps on the road. If you improve handling it starts making circles if you turn a little bit harder. You can make you car fast and leap far ahead, but then you will chase the last ones and they will DEVASTATE you and make you lose the race. Yes, AI is stupidly aggressive, just going straight ahead to kill you, no matter what, on turns on long straights, etc.
6216	The artstyle and graphics are beautiful. The tracks are fun. But is it a good game? No! The AI drivers behave like they're alone on track, constantly bumping into each other and the player. And as if that's not enough the smallest collisions slow you down to a crawl, spin your car around and thus make you vulnerable for yet more AI drivers to crash into you, repeating the cycle. But if you manage to get a good start and survive the first 10 seconds the AI drivers will take each other out every too often and it's too easy to drive home a win. Unless you get screwed by lapped cars, of which there are way too many for these small grids and 1-2 minute races.  A lot of good games lack the polish. This nicely polished game lacks functioning game mechanics. Don't buy this game!
6217	No matter how much i adore cute car racing and lots of customisation from steam workshop this is nothing butt a clunky racing game with no physics or a proper A.I. It would be fun game for a some kind of tablet or a smartphone, not a pc though. If you REALLY want it, pick it up when it's on sale.
6218	Want to be angry? Buy this.  When I bought this, I thought it will be a great game, which is fun to play. The graphics are great, even if they're cartoonish, but the controls... The worst 'racing' physics in a PC game, ever! You could have problems with taking the first corner, so watch out! Prepare for it, the AI and the whole physics are against you. They will nitro your â¥â¥â¥, just before a corner. Everyone flies, but - guess what - you will be the last one on the racing line again, always. This isn't racing anymore, just making players angry. Or maybe it should be renamed to Mini Motor Derby EVO. Wanted more fun. 5/10!
6219	This game really isn't worth it. Here's what sucks!  1. AI is awful. Want to know how to get 1st place every time? Restart until you get lucky enough for those idiots to crash into each other instead of you. That works well until you start to lap them and they all try to sabotage you. Feels more like a 1v5 race instead of a 6 person race.  2. Repetitive maps. They re-use the same maps over and over, putting different spins on them (race backwards! now race at night!) and some of the camera angles cause you to completely not be able to see your car. Here's the #1 thing I want from a racing game: TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY CAR  3. A bunch of cars with little difference between them. Just take the starting car and use it until you unlock the car you get for finishing the beginner cup and then upgrade that and you win the game.  On the bright side, it has some cool TF2 and Portal 2 levels and it has Workshop support. I can't help but to think the Workshop support is just there because the developers didn't feel like making many tracks of their own.
6220	Unplayable piece of crap, it looks cute but don't bother paying for it, you will be so angry. The worst 'racing' physics in game ever, just outrageous.
6221	Owwh...... look at that mini racing cars Kawaii.... :3   The music is not bad. The graphic is nice..... lovely....  But the gameplay is the problem Car handling is very hard..... clunky.... Even racing games i play 10 years ago or so have a better car handling than this :|/  Don't get this half baked game Not recommended
6222	Buy this game only if its on sale and if you think the graphics are cute, cause thats all your gonna get. This is not a racing game. You stay out of harms way by using your nitro all at once, by taking the lead your getting all the extra nitro and you win. I thought that the TF2 and Portal connection would ensure some quality but I was naieve. There is no AI or physics, it feels like the crappy racing games of the 90's. Still I'm enjoying myself because it makes me feel like a kid with those toycars. So if your not the kinda guy that steals the little matchbox cars from kids you better move along.
6223	The game is pretty good for what it is, nice visuals, sounds, variety of cars and whatnot but it's ruined by a serious flaw. The difficulty is insane. This certainly ain't a game for the kiddies, I'll tell ya' that now. There are two problems that factor in together for this.  The first is that the physics are very aggravating at times. It is borderline inconceivable to maintain any sort of speed when attempting to corner. You will either end up having to slow down to a crawl or letting off the acceleration for a brief second and doing subtle taps in order to turn but that still annihiliates your speed. It may be easier with an analog control such as a joystick, wheel or a game pad but I haven't tried this.  The second is that the AI opponents are EXTREMELY brutal and relentless. They WILL shunt you at any opportunity they get and you WILL eventually get spun out and there is nothing you can do. Simple as that. If you do get spun out, you lose, good luck catching up afterwards. Get used to it. You could still try by saving your nitros but I wouldn't count on it.  This game is actually quite a lot of fun but you'd either have to be extremely lucky, have a lot of patience or just like losing races every now and then in order to enjoy this. For a game that you would play for about 20 minutes each time, it shouldn't be this difficult.
6224	This game as a lot of potential but it missed the point.   Pros: -good graphics -fun handling   Cons: -very stupid AI -differences between cars are very limited, you would expect a formula1-like car to handle better on the tarmac than on the th dirt and vice versa for a buggy, but no,all cars handle the same on different terrain  -uninteresting 'carreer' mode, which just consist of a very long series of single races with no variation on the type of race -lack of weapons, they would bring a nice addition to the game    I cannot recommend this game
6225	  bad AI, bad turning radius and just isnt as fun as i thought it would be. only upsides to the game are the car models and the trading cards. other than that, listen to the other reviews, its not that great
6226	bad, just really really bad. the ai is baffling and its not really that challenging. you either survive the ai the first couple of corners and never see them again or you get taken out and you never catch up. if you get hit or try and hit a opponent, you get knocked in seemingly random directions. the worst part is opponents slame in the back of you, you spin off. you do the same of them you brake. you seem to brake after nitros as well. just a poorly made game. doesn't mater how cheap, its just not worth your time
6227	Despite being like the old school arcades of Offraod and Super Offroad, the camera angles they use, and decide to change, with the shortness of the races, just drives me insane.  Decided to retry it for the cards.  If you like being able to see more than 10 mini car lengths ahead of you, and a good camera angle to see WTF you are doing, stay away from this one.  If you like a challenge, play it while hammered. That way you can blame that instead of the horrid camera angles and zoomed in-your-face short race tracks.
6228	Short answer: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  I both love and hate this game. When it's fun, it's great fun. When the AI, broken physics, and horrible collision detection screw you over, you'll wish Steam had a feature to remove a game from your library for good.  It's a shame, really, because this game is SO close to being right up there with RC Pro Am, Indy Heat, and a few other racers of this type. Some work on fixing collisions, AI, and car physics could make this legendary.  As it stands, I'd recommend you buy it if it's on sale or part of a bundle and you like this genre.  Pros: Great graphics Good assortment of levels OK music  Cons: Shoddy car physics Bad enemy AI Poor collision detection Zero replay value Three BS achievements: Mini Motor Champion (Master), Moneybags, and Mini Motor Master.
6229	Altough the basic gameplay can be quite a lot of fun, it quickly wears out, it lacks variety, there are basically no pickups during the races, you can either pick up more cash or boost, and that's about it, it would be cool if there was more variety to the kind of things you can find during the races.  But even not having them, I could justify myself keeping it if the online multiplayer was alive, or even better, if it featured some kind of local splitscreen or whatever multiplayer mode, but it doesn't, so, basically it's a very barebones package, which is a shame, because I love the handling and I think it's a pretty comfy looking game, but alas, I can't justify myself paying 1.24$ for it.  Edit: a newer and better version of this game is abviable for free on Android, if you really like the aesthethics and the handling, better off playing that one.
6230	It wouldn't be a bad game if Micro Machines didn't exist. But it plays too similar to not have a direct comparison. And Micro Machines wins.
6231	This game had a somewhat decent amount of potential, but it falls flat on its face trying to deliver.  First off, the AI is ridiculously agressive and will often slam into you as well as eachother, making having to use turbos to quickly take a solid lead ahead practically the ONLY option. Then there's the handling, it takes a while to get used to but the majority of cars will still handle like crap, making the game virtually unplayable with the lower-handling vehicles. The optimizatin is also relatively poor for what's easily considered a phone game, since the framerate can drop on the night tracks while it's near a consistent 60 on day tracks.
6232	A game that makes you wanna smash your Controller into your screen. In case you don't even have a controller don't even bother trying to play this - it's pretty hopeless.  The cause of rage isn't even one's own mistakes. Races are either too easy (start to finish wins) or just impossible to win due to overpowered opponents. There's almost no fighting, no adrenaline, no excitement. The game's mechanics are flawed: Winning or losing depends too much on the car and not enough on skill.  Unless you're a die-hard fan of the genre, this game is probably not worth playing.
6233	I love games like these so this makes me sad :( Pros:  - Graphics looks cool -Make custom maps  Cons: -Bad AI -Horrible controls almost making the cars undrivable. -the car gets stuck on things around the track at random points. -bad controler support, the turning thumbstick on the Xbox one controler wont turn the car properly. -cars wheels clip through the bodys when turning every time. -Most cars are already unlocked and dont feel like they drive diffrent at all even tho they have diffrent stats... -championship races unlock way to easy, not really much to play for in the game, everythings pretty much given to you.  im glad i only paid $0.99 for this...
6234	The worst AI imagineable.
6235	I got this as part of a dirt cheap bundle. The graphics are cute and do the job well for the kind of game it is. I struggled with the controls a bit on the Xbox 360 controller. So used to normal racing games where the analog sticks mimic a steering wheel, and that doesn't apply at all here. It's more like you move the stick in the direction you want the car to go. I found that incredibly awkward for a racing game. Maybe its just me.  I can't really recommend this for adult gamers, but maybe if you have kids they'd like it. There's not enough here to keep me playing beyond the first set of races. It just doesn't do anything for me.
6236	AI will bash you into every corner, get in first and hope you stay there. The racing mid pack is like something from a three stooges skit. The AI cars just aim for you and bash away, it gets infuriating so fast.
6237	The wonky physics and enemy AI killed all the fun for me. It's really a shame since the graphics are nice.
6238	Even AI have problems to drive thats how much physics of the cars are broken!
6239	Even AI have problems to drive thats how much physics of the cars are broken!
6240	not recommended the AI is horrible the steering is horrible   this game is horrible
6241	This game stops being funny after five minutes of playing. Then, you start feeling dizzy because the camera is too close and you cannot do anything to solve it.
6242	This game is a bit fun for one hour or so, it is so simple and lacks any depth that you will find no reason to continue playing it more than an hour. The tracks are very short, laps take 10-20 seconds, and each race takes 1-2 minutes. The upgrades are very expensive so you keep playing repeadly until you get enough money to buy upgrades.
6243	NO MULTIPLAYER AND NOBODY (PUBLISHER) CARES ABOUT THIS......
6244	It's cute and quirky in the beginning, but after a while, it's playing the same maps over and over again and peforming the exact same formula on every race.
6245	Wouldn't recommend the game, it's pretty boring and unisnspired in my opinion. Maybe something for fans of the genre, it's at least not trash/unplayable.
6246	Mini Motor Ramming NITRO  The game is presented well, but unfortunatly the AI is terrible. Not terrible as in stupid, terrible as in insane. They will constantly ram you off the road, box you in etc . They are not doing this as a clever way of getting ahead, but because they are just plain ignoring you.  If you want to win any race, just Nitro at the start to clear the rolling wave of destruction that is the rest of the pack, and cruise the 3 laps or so to victory. Repeat 300 times for every race (numbers from the Steam achievements) and Game over.  Otherwise you will be stuck bouncing off walls, other cars, until the torment is final over. 
6247	The Artificial intelligence in this game is bad with a capital B. I suppose if you can overlook getting knocked around by all the other cars the entire race you may enjoy this. Sound effects and graphics are good. I did not enjoy being bounced around the track by the other cars. If you can keep first place you will not notice this however if your in second or third be prepared to get knocked around other cars. I have not tried online. I did bring this up in forum about 6 months ago and crickets so far. I dont expect them to patch this any more then they already have. AI is dumb to the point of being unfun. Save your money for something else.
6248	fun game, but career mode is obnoxious. the ai is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and just nitros into you and â¥â¥â¥â¥s u up at the most random times. they also can push u around but u can't push them back at all so ur pretty much helpless when u enter a turn and they just smash u around cuz they take bad lines on the turns and theres nothing u can do about it...
6249	Lke Micro Machines if Micro Machines was â¥â¥â¥â¥
6250	A while back I bought the original mini motors game on IOS. I found it to be a pretty decent racer. i got some money for christmas to use one steam and one of the games i bought was Mini Motor Racing EVO. I thought the developers would have at least added some fresh new content. however, all I got was two new tracks, two cars and that's it. nothing has changed since the IOS version at all. It seems like they just got the original game and copied and pasted it on PC. Y'all should just get the IOS version and save money instead.
6251	Way too sensitve controls make this a title worth passing up, and easily forgotten for sure. That's using an Xbox 360 controller. I couldn't uninstall it fast enough.
6252	This game pretty much sucks. I have no idea why I played all the way through the expert championship.  The AI sucks and pretty much just plows through whatever's in its way, which is frequently you. The physics suck, so when the AI plows through you there's no telling which way you'll be facing or how long it will take until your car is upright again.  When I say 'the physics suck,' I mean your car handles like a balloon. Except when it handles like a plastic bag. It's the floatiest racer I've ever played.  About half of the tracks suck, and the ones that don't will feel like they suck because your field of view is limited and the angle at which the track is presented is arbitrary. (I really do mean 'arbitrary.' Sometimes the same track will be presented from a different direction for no good reason. Often the chosen direction maximizes the extent to which you can't actually see your car or the track on some turns.)  By the time you've upgraded your car, you can lap more than half the other racers by the end of the second lap. Except the guy in second will pass you once you're forced to pass the clowns in the bottom slots again, because it's very difficult to pass an AI that pretends you're not there unless you're also an AI, which the guy in second is.  Oh, right, and all the music is at best boring. Some of it is actually irritating.  Remember how annoying the yellow car was in RC Pro Am? I'd rather play that game any day of the week.
6253	Invisible walls, motion sickening camera angles, and an unfair weight balance versus opponent cars just adds up to an unpleasant racing experience. Death Rally is 100 times better.
6254	This game looks great.. on the store page. The visuals look pretty good, the music sounds nice and totally indie, it has online multiplayer, a couple Valve game levels, and workshop support. There's also a nice amount of cars and levels..  .. unfortunately the whole game is very bland. Its incredibly basic and while that isn't bad, I can't help but compare it to other games with a similar overhead arcadey style. I also didn't like that the cars had to be upgraded constantly and some cars were just so much better. I found myself having to use uglier vehicles I didn't like just to pass levels.  Despite the lack of a level editor, online MP, and even better dev support I feel Bang Bang Racing is a much much better game and would have to say play it instead.
6255	AI is terrible.
6256	I like racing games unfotunately this game could of been so much better but it fails at so many levels. It has repetitive maps, bad AI, also, the game gets boring very quickly and it has ZERO replay value. The developers could of added more achievements to this game. For example Finish first by being ahead on every lap or dead last as another achievement. There is no multiplayer for this game. No one is ever online. The only positives about this game is that the graphics are nice and that the achievements are all attainable, Otherwise if you like being tortured playing this game I strongly do not recommend it.  4.5/10
6257	Bad tracks, bad cars, crappy physics. Skip this one.
6258	Mini Motor Racing EVO seems like a cute and charming top down racing game, however as you play more and more the game becomes a complete grindfest using the same tracks over and over with slight modifications later such as the camera angle, racing at night or in reverse. The AI is terrible and if you do not get a clean getaway from the rest of the pack of the cars you will not win the race. I continue to play the game to see if the game will pick up but after 10 hours and beating all 4 championships there is nothing different than the first couple of races when you first start the game. Pretty difficult to recommend unless you want a mindless racing game where once you are first the AI will never catch up with you because, well it drives like it's drunk. Don't drink and drive or else you'll be like the AI.
6259	Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome , and I would recommend it...if not for one factor. The AI structure is very poorly thought out so the cars wouldn't give a **** about piling upon other cars, including you. I've lost track of how many times I had to restart a race due to a single pileup being the difference between first and last. Some might call it part of the game, but it just makes me want to throw my keyboard through the monitor!
6260	Looks like a fun game, but the AI frustrates me.
6261	Unforgivingly brutal AI whose sole intention is to make you spin out. Any collision causes the crappy handling to give up on you. Even if you escape the derby that is the AI, seemingly invisible walls stop you in your tracks and allow them to catch up with you to punish you further - This game makes me ragequit :Steamsalty:
6262	This is the first game in my library I do not recommend.  It is not the game from the advertising video. It doesn't feel like a micromachines / childhood mini cars experience. I rushed to buy the game but then I was dissapointed (there were no steam refunds at the time, 2013).  I have had controller issues since day one. Have tried with different controllers and all of them feels different, work or don't and have to configure them every time. Even when controls are mapped, the game plays awful. Physics will make sure you get in the last place. Forget about using turbo, you'll ruin your hard earned place. If you manage to be in 1st place for the first 15 seconds then you have a chance of winning the race but if your opponent is 10 seconds away from you in a better place then just restart the race, it is impossible to catch up.  I did however managed to run the game when I recently purchased it with one controller (it worked and felt really well) and this is when I could play the game (and used to recommend it as a casual racer) but very little time then the controller died on me and had to rely on mouse or keyboard (mouse is the best alternative so far but keyboard is too laggy). I've been struggling with the game ever since, trying different controllers every now and then but none of them seem to work like the first one, maybe it is the latest patch that brought like a new controller backend but instead it messed it up.  The level editor is really good though, have spent many hours building custom tracks.  In conclusion, it is a good casual racing game if you are tolerant to frustration but it is not a game for you if you do not like to lose.
6263	Terrible physics.  Enemy hits You - Youre Losing Control.  You hit an Enemy - Youre Losing Control.  Get stoped by invisible walls.  Its like Youre driving a tank and a little ant makes You flipping.  If not those bugs game would be realy nice, but...     Unfortunately it's not.
6264	Not a great game. Not even a good game. It feels like a phone app. So much so, i keep expecting to see the add funds dialog pop up. The steering is quirky, again, like it was designed for smart phones. The graphics are bright and colorful, and the tracks are decent, albeit, short. After about 2 hrs i'm done. ready to uninstall and not look at it again until my son is old enough to play games. If a developer is going to go so far as to develop a pc port, they really need to rework a few things, not just gloss it over. BTW: the description says improved physics...well, i have never seen a traffic cone shoot 6 cars straight through the air, in any racer. So, yeah, there are no physics.  Worth 5, no.  Young kids may like it, but it may also result in their first rage quit.
6265	The game is cute. And that is all that's positive about it. Otherwise it's easy, repetitive and boring.  UPDATE: Once you get to MASTER level, it gets harder, but it's far from impossible. Using a right car (and spending enough money on it) makes things easy once again.
6266	really boring
6267	Everything feels so clunky and there is nothing special about this game, there are much better titles of the same genre.
6268	The game is glitchy cann't even complete a career race without it locking up.
6269	A very casual and arcade racer with cartoon-style graphics. Unfortunatly, also comes with cartoon-style physics. Add a weird camera angle and lack of any real depth and you get a game you won't be playing for very long.   You're better off playing 'Ignition' from 1997.
6270	Far too annoying.I dont need to say anymore.
6271	OMFG, what the hell is this????
6272	I can see why it was only 99 cents
6273	Can't get my logitech wireless rumblepad 2 to work at all with this game, very dissapointing!
6274	THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER, ITS SOOOOOO SLIDEY AND ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT GET IT
6275	This game looks good,nice clean tidy graphics and runs fine (doesn't push hardware at all) but that is where it ends,the music is bad,the controls are simply crap and feel very basic,you can turn your car 360 while not pressing the accel and it will happily just spin and spin forever and when you accelerate and try to turn your extremely slow little car round the track you will over steer as there is no difference between the way the car turns when stationary and when the car is moving and this makes your car slow down even more ! It's just painfully dull in terms of gameplay and there is no knack to the controls where you finally see the light and say ahh soo this is why the game controls like this !!  You can use a controller and use a degree of turning with the stick and your car won't slow down as much but it's still crap,this is just a very basic amateur feeling silly little game,the car has no momentum,no physics,there is simply no feeling at all to the controls and with the game being soo slow and then you turn and your car freaks out and spins because you over tun or slows down even more it just feels frustrating.  The game is crap - buy at your own risk !
6276	Nothing Special. Fun for about 30 Mins. Reminds me of the '1000 Mile Great Rally' game a little bit.
6277	A game for you if you enjoy frustrating steering and annoying AI.  I tried to like this game, I really did. But it keeps working against me. Getting all the trading cards drops, then I will uninstall it.
6278	PLEASE! DONT BUY THIS GAME! its worth your time only if u get it free somehow. but devs are definitely not worth your money!
6279	worst racing game ever it is IMPOSSIBLE to win a race how could you make a game that is IMPOSSIBLE to win? it defeats the whole purpose of playing the game! what a piece of dogs---t game!!!!!!!
6280	Controls are just... Weird... Mechanics are not _that_ good, at all. I even don't know why I even bothered to buy this crappy game.
6281	Its â¥â¥â¥â¥
6282	The worst game ever.
6283	Somewhat bad,somewhat good. Bad AI,gameplay and such. But there's litte good things,so its not a game for you.
6284	Collision mechanics are very annoying. Little street racers is much more fun.
6285	I wan't a refund I don't like this game
6286	Crashes far too often for me to recommend in good faith. Really lame since the game is pretty fun too.
6287	Looks good , fun to play untill the AI makes me Rage Quit, the ai racers just push you around, racing was fine till i went up a few races, have upgraded my car, so logicly i should be able to race and keep up and i would but... the A I or computer cars just nitro into my car forcing me to get stuck somewhere or pile up , witch then you have to restart the race and try again.
6288	you cant even play the game
6289	The game is awesome looking at first sight with its supposedly tons of 'AWESOME TRACKS,' but by 30 minutes the game gets so bland that you want to fall asleep. Each track, even with 5 laps on, is only about a minute and a half or so. I played the game with my friends and we could barely have fun, as inning only relied on who was the last to crash into a wall. We were able to play EVERY TRACK in under 20 minutes, as all the rest of the maps are just a different time of day version of the original. The track editor was also bland as you can't make jumps or bridges, making every track completely flat. The whole experience sucked after 30 minutes.  4/10
6290	Game would be great if there was better controller support. Neither the PS3 nor Logitech Rumblepad 2 controller work well with this game without hacks.  Even with good controller support, this game feels more like a P2W Android game converted to a PC game. Just race enough and get money to finish the game, lame.   Look for the better arcade racers on Steam.
6291	Great looking game and very polished but the AI and bumping mechanics make this game unbearable. The maps need to be wider or the cars need to be smaller otherwise whoever gains a lead off the bat is almost always the winner due to the cramped space leading to constant crashes.
6292	It is a very irritating game. The tracks are nice but the game has awful upgrade system, brainless AI, irritating physics. One of my worst purchase ever.
6293	Quite a fun casual racing game. But unfortunately only for a while. Gets repetitive very soon and hasn't got much to offer. Drive, win some cash, drive, win some cash, upgrade your car.........and so on and so forth. The most annoying thing is the AI. Computer drivers are extremely aggresive and bump each other like drunken maniacs. Sometimes it looks like famous Destruction Derby, not a racing game. Whilst the game isn't very challenging, stupid AI behaviour makes it harder and gives some sort of challenge. Overall nice, little game but only for a short period of time. If you like classic games with little cars (just like Skidmarks or Micro Machines) you could give it a try - but not for a 10â¬. But do not expect too much or you will be disappointed. 
6294	To be honest, even though it has charming graphics and music, this kind of arcade gameplay ruins the feeling a lot (instead of challenging tracks, you get lousy vehicle control). Older versions of Micro Machines are a way better alternative.
6295	Mini Motor Racing EVO is a top down arcade racer. It looks nice and the gameplay gives a bit of that old micro machines fun. Too bad it can get a bit frustrating because of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI of competitors and the bad physics.  The multiplayer is dead. Completing the singleplayer will take time and gets a bit of a grind after a while. Most tracks are rehashed by reversing and turning them. But all in all you can have some fun with it, but I only recommend it if you can get it for cheap.
6296	I cannot recommend this game as the multiplayer does not work...only reason I bought this game.
6297	Worst controls I've ever played.  This is supposed to be a fun racer, but the twitchy turning, the insta-slowdown when anything happens, the crappy pickup, contrasted with the excessive speed boost granted by the turbo make for the most uncontrollable, unplayable car racing game ever.  It's not a simulator, and it doesn't qualify as a fun racer, so it's in some weird limbo.   I give it 2 out of 10, and that's because the graphics are really nice.
6298	Poor gameplay, difficulty too easy and AI inesistent: that after 20 minutes this game has said everything is had been to say and doesnt give ti me any more interest. Perhaps Graphics, cars and tracks has been realized with tons of accuracy and quantity.  In my opinion is better you spent your money with Death Rally or Zombie Driver ;)
6299	It's a flawed top down arcade racer. The AI is quite stupid and only manages to beat you on these conditions:  &gt;Your car is alwasy slower than the rest. &gt;Handling of the car is floaty and some ramps and jumps are weird to control. &gt;Your car is a pushover compared to the AI cars which are like bricks if you ram them as they did you. &gt;Random nitro spawn seems to give the AI more nitros and will pass you that way.  Because of these reasons you can only be 1st if you are 1st the first lap you drive. You can also upgrade your car which means any new car you unlock later will be inferior in every way. There are also just a handful of tracks. They introduce a few more every new championship/cup but you'll have played like all previous ones 100 times over (day, night, normal, reversed, rain, snow. You get the idea) before you see a new one.  If you want a top down arcade racer i'd recommend   Bang Bang Racing .
6300	The AI is just frustrating. This game could be so much fun if it just was about racing.
6301	Could have been way better. Terrible camera angles. Glitchy tracks. Mediocre AI.
6302	So they have tried to make some sort of oldschool kind of game, but the result is kind of mixed. On one hand you have handling mechanics that are fine, the tracks seem fine, graphics are pleasant to look at, but the weird things start at the more complex things such as car specifications. How much is 5 speed and 4 acceleration versus 5 acceleration and 4 speed? Would be pretty obvious if the game didnt have such varied tracks. You cant simply drive one vehicle in every track. Ofcourse you can upgrade your vehicle for quite a bit of in game earned coin, but here is something else - most of vehicles are not unlocked in the beginning of the game. So you dont even know how some of the things behave, while you have the money to spend/waste. So you might think that - hey ill just keep this money, because the start of the game should be easy. It is easy untill a point, then you pretty much have to spend cash to progress. And yes that means youll be spending that cash on that small selection of cars you might not like. This can easily result in a lot of money wasted on random cars that you will never drive or even if you do drive - never enjoy. So while the basics seem nice, the game does not seem very thought out in the long run.
6303	Overall - 3/5   Its not a bad game, but it doesn't play anywhere like the phone version. Its controller support is so iffy. The best way to play this game, would have been the joystick. It was a nice try to port. I have been waiting for an update to fix it, but sadly I cannot recommend this game without it.
6304	Developers: Remake the collision system from scratch. The way it is, the game is simply not fun to play. With a good colision system, 8/10. The way that it is, 3/10.
6305	Totally a waste of money
6306	extremely sensitive controls, makes it ok to play but hard
6307	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
6308	I bought it because it promised a cross platform multiplayer. Shows up in my Mac games, but i'm unable to install it. Seems the development is stopped. Shame...
6309	At first glance, this is a game where spills and thrills await. However, it soon turns into spills and frustrations. While the game features a track editor, said track editor is functional but lackluster. This game does have some good graphics, and the environments are unique, however its physics are rather wonky. Everything works as intended until you run into a hill. It seems to throw off your steering controls significantly. Finally, the game has very little replay value and switching cars halfway through a season...isn't efficient. All in all, okay game that can use some polish (not recommended).
6310	graphic is very nice, but i don't like the gameplay.. i think the game engine make it hard to control the car.. i better play mario kart..
6311	This is almost a mediocre game.
6312	As many others , I would like to like the game.  I got it from a Bundle and I cannot complain for the price, but the controls and specially the collision system is frustrating being the softer I could.  On the other hand , you need to upgrade your car quite a lot and feel like you need to grind forever , but the achievement is near to zero.  If you get it from a bundle, give it a try. Otherwise don't even look at it.  PS: If you want a good game with similar style , go for Little Racers Street.
6313	The AI is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's fun to play with friends because it's arcadey, but only for a short while.
6314	 Seems to be fun but bad execution takes it out   It's just a pity that although the graphics, scenarios and races are nice the gameplay is just terrible. Also even with the car upgraded you will never feel that really something changed.
6315	The dynamic camera makes me sick.
6316	The cars steer from the back. It's like racing in a forklift. :(
6317	Mini Motor Racing EVO is a fun game. It has decent maps, a handful of vehicles, upgrade options and an overall pleasent style. However, with all the physics related glitches, bad camera angles and an inconsistent AI it becomes a frustrating mess after a few hours of play.
6318	If you did play that old games of car whem was out windows 98 until XP windows well that is kinda dat past of game, its ok and you can enjoy but not near the price is asked, if you dont have a controler.. be ready for some deslocated fingers! xD
6319	Game concept is nice. Graphics and sound are very good. Controls are playable. However, the gameplay isn't nice.  The computer controlled opponents get advantage by bumping at the player's car, and they do it frequently. The player cannot do the same because it seems that the computer almost always get the upper hand during collisions.  I manage to finish first only when I lead all the race and don't let any opponent get close enough to crash into me. Therefore, I found the races either annoying or chaotic.  Sorry but I can't recommend the game.
6320	Graphics are decent, sound is great.  Not free to play. Demo at best. Start with a few cars and a couple of tracks. No way to earn/unlock cars, tracks or liveries in game. Every thing must be bought with real money which would bring the price well over $100. This type of payment models are the worst. And the sole reason I don't recommend this game.
6321	Only Singleplayer/Hotlapping. Expensive Cars and Tracks. Old Graphics (Race07) with brighter Colours. Only the sound saves this 'game' for total collapse. Just another F2P Title which is here to milk out their costumers.
6322	I used to be a Simbin customer for eight years until 12/3/13 due to the various issues that I have with this title. First off this game has no single player content like previous Simbin entries save for track test and time attacks. Next there is no multiplayer save for special promotional challenges and time attacks against another player's ghost car. Another thing is the sheer cost to have content equal to the legacy titles from Simbin as you will spend $100+ USD just on cars and tracks alone without even factoring in the cost of liveries of the cars purchased.  The positive points of this title is that the car audio is a step up from previous entries as the Zonda R sounds better than the GT Power pack version as an example. Another plus is that the car models are also a step up from the previous entry as they look much more detailed. Finally the physics are another step up as the cars feel a bit more responsive and can actually tell you when they will let go.  Unfortunately the cons are far too glaring to overlook and for now I'll have to say avoid this title as there are other titles that offer more content for your money.
6323	This game is not bad because is free but thats only if u dont want more games or tracks because if you do then this game its not worth it to buy every car and track in the game you need 13446 vRP points or whatever that means an in real money equals to $146.78 you can buy F1 2013,WRC4 and Asseto Corsa and Grid and you still have $3 leftand thats regular price if you wait for steam sales you can even get more for your money im sorry but i will take 4 good games instead of 1 ok game for the same price if at least you can buy the whole package for $50 i can take that but no they want to ripp you off sorry this is not worth it
6324	Exploitative microtransaction model makes the title very expensive to play. You are better off saving your money for Project Cars
6325	Total rip off. Have spent a fortune on tracks and cars and still no single player or online racing. It's totally boring in hotlap mode - DO NOT waste your money until the game is finished
6326	Just five minutes in and I know EXACTLY what this game is about... It's about greed. There is barely any physics, any realism to this. It's simply a cash-grab.  You need vRP to do anything, and guess what, IT COSTS REAL MONEY!!  Yeah, it's Free-To-Play but it's Pay-To-Win.  DO NOT EVEN DOWNLOAD THIS GAME...YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME.
6327	THIS IS A REVIEW OF DTM EXPERIENCE 2013!  Well, I was looking forward to exciting duels with quite good AI and entertainment like in real DTM races. What did I get ? Game with real tracks, cars and pilots, but WITHOUT PitStops, choise of tires, rules like yellow flags and damage. In the description of the game is: real DTM rules. Where are they ? I hope developers will add this things in free update, otherwise it is the worst purchase of the year!  SimBin what happened with you ?!
6328	This game could EASILY have become the best sim racing game on steam but is completely ruined by its terrible paywall system that they have. The visuals are very pleasing to the eye and the physics and sound add up to it to make the game feel like a very high end sim. Sadly the microtransaction hell that Sector 3 threw in really ruined the perfect opportunity to make the best simulator for racing fans to enjoy.   Its very depressing because RACE '07 and GTR 2 were both excellent and iconic simulation racing games. Maybe if they had followed the path of their previous games, RaceRoom wouldve been a simulator far better than Assetto Corsa, iRacing, or rFactor2 couldve ever been.  but no matter what i say, this is gonna get downvoted to hell because fanboys cant take having their beloved software being judged, and thats absolutely pathetic.    'Scores'
6329	RRE is a very good game - the physics and everything seem to be spot on, but I can't recommend it due to how the purchasing system works in combination with other factors which mean you don't get your money's worth. You'll have to spend well in advance of Â£50 to enjoy most of what this game has to offer and while that in itself is not much of an issue, the fact the server framework seems totally unreliable means you'll be sitting around twiddling your thumbs a lot of the time.   Sometimes the game won't work, sometimes it will. Your friend just down the road from you may be tearing his hair out because he can't get the game started after the latest patch, though it could be you doing the very same the following week while his game miraculously comes back to life. Throw in the Diablo III-style 'always connectedness' (where you simply have to be connected to their servers even for single player games) and what you have is a game that can be thoroughly frustrating.
6330	It SimBin game, so it's good. But problem is...  Game is too expensive! Single track is about 5 euros! I would buy full game for normal price. But I won't pay single cent in microtransactions system.
6331	The graphics are great, the physics feel authentic and there's no question that a lot of work went into making this a high-quality racing sim. The business model is sketchy (at best) and resembles EA over the last few years--- free games are probably around to stay, but excessive microtransactions don't have to come with them. I'd gladly pay $20 for unlimited access to all of the content in the game--- or $40 if it included community-creation tools. Just my two cents: proceed with extreme caution.
6332	there is only a couple of challenges and you have to buy alot of the cars and tracks to complete them.
6333	The game itself is absolutely fantastic and unlike many others I do think, that giving away a free base game and then charging for expansion packs is a fair deal. But what is really ruining all of this, is the fact that you are forced to be connected to the internet all the time. If you force players to be always online, yet donÂ´t have a properly working server structure, then it is a death sentence. People canÂ´t access the stuff they paid for for days. As a customer I feel betrayed, because these guys know how to design a racing game. Nice physics, great sounds, fun AI, good enough graphics. What a shame.
6334	Too little content available for the free-to-use customer
6335	Bottom line? Good racing game/sim with plenty of potential.  The constant micro-transactions start to get annoying. Even with sales on content packs and moderate discounts for purchasing vRP (virtual money) to buy content, the game ends up costing you quite a bit more than what you get at the stage of development it is in. People can deny or challenge all they want but this thing has been in a perpetual state of Beta for 4 years. It's actually unfortunate Steam 'GreenLights' products in this state. They really should be 'buyer beware'.  All the content including topping up everytime something new is released whether it's a car, pack or tracks can end up costing in the neighborhood of $200.00. Many will argue that but I have the receipts to prove it and unless you figure out the system or have someone explain, many players have inevitably made errors as to how they purchased and paid more than they could have.  The drivng itself feels quite good. Since it is a closed system, there is no easy way to inspect what is being done to see how accurate the physics, vehicle dynamic modeling or tire modeling is done. While there are moments it feels slightly weird, certain cars lifeless or canned, it certainly is not as obvious or bad as some other well known racing games.  Visually, for a DX9 based engine, they have produced a great result. It is missing any kind of rubber build up or active track at least visually. There is some debris modeling if going off road but no visuals.  There is no proper flag system. There is no daytime, nightime transitions or full 24 hour system. Damage modeling is non-existent which lends to very pushy, bumping and careless driving in multiplayer sessions. There is some mild engine and gearbox damage with specific vehicles.  Pits and setups are limited. No tire pressure adjustment at the moment and limited chassis setup. The ability to 'Save' a setup only recently became available and oddly was news as though this was a breakthrough of epic proportions.  http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/setup-saving-coming-to-r3e.118058   The game models chassis flex.  The options allow for tweaking the visuals, controllers, sound and force feedback to the Nth degree. There are some interesting concepts to the steering and force feedback settings to simulate the rack and pinion steering as well as the feel of the contact of the tire to the road. How much of that truly can be felt in the game or whether it's placebo is difficult to tell though it does feel generally good in most cars.  The sounds are really well done. Every other game could learn from this.  Multiplayer is okay when it works but often there are visual glitches with cars overlapping or stationary images (ghost images) just kind of being left behind around the track. It needs work.  It requires an internet connetion and there is no offline mode which is fine except the authentication servers or whatever they are frequently blow up and and one cannot play.  The dedicated forums away from the Steam discussions have unfortunately become progressively toxic only rivaled by iracing. I find it to be a deterrent since it is somewhat the 'go to' for info but weeding through the frequent snarky responses to everything and the jerks gets old really quick.  Compared to turn key options such as AMS though dated in some ways, at least can be dropped into a league and work and rF2 which is also league capable, this still has a long way to go. If one tries it solely on the free content, I suppose it's okay but it will get repetitive very quickly. Even with all the content, hot lapping against AI gets old and other than the built in public Multiplayer Lobby which leaves much to be desired and you won't find much that's worth the time.  As much as I enjoy driving the game and I'll say it again, it has potential, in the current state along with past issues as Simbin, restructuring and the advent of Sector3 and another restructuring along with the rebirth of Simbin, I cannot recommend it. They have missed the mark, there seems to be no direction to what should be the logical and that is a massive multiplayer environment and the reality of it being at 'Beta' levels after 4 years with no end in sight is enough to at least be cautious with this before diving in head first and spending a lot of money.
6336	This game has a great potential as a NFS, Forza or GT killer. But unfortunately it has no multiplayer, you are stuck only at one car, and you just race alone with ghost car which made this game more boring..   When I first played this game last year I thought that this will be the online racing game with complete features to enjoy without spending any penny, but I was wrong. Of course there's a microtransaction to be able to unlock those, and I have a feeling that this game would become a pay-to-win just like other F2P games out there.   Honestly, I won't recommend this game to anyone.
6337	Enjoyed what i played BUT!  It says free to play but its more like a demo You get a few cars and only 2 tracks (like WTF you have to buy tracks) All the DLC = 118 pounds You can get 3 Triple A Titles for this price  I Thought World of Tanks was Brutal on the premium but this is pure Bill Gates â¥â¥â¥â¥ right here 
6338	It's a good game. But WAY too expensive.   To buy all the tracks alone it would cost over Â£80. The game is basically a demo for a HIGHLY overpriced game.   All in, it's unfortunate that this is the economic model we are given. If there was a free to play element with perhaps a War Thunder style tech tree or something (Not sure how it would work but still) it would be possibly the pinnacle of racing games on steam.   Unfortunately what the end user is presented with is a game that would cost in excess of Â£150 to fully unlock with no option to earn any of the unlocks by actually playing the game.   It's a massive shame. I wish it wasn't like this. It was fun to play.
6339	RaceRoom Experience could've been a top tier Racing Simulator, but decided to be a 'server only' renting platform.  I can not stay supportive when I'm constantly having connectivity issues and gameplay breaking bugs. Not to mention, it cost me $300 for all the content, which makes it the most expensive, unreliable game I own (rent)  In short, you need to be connected to their servers at all times or you simply cannot play the game, and when you are connected you are constantly experiencing lag, '503' server errors, etc......  So when other great titles can be enjoyed in offline mode without issues, I cannot recommend investing in RaceRoom Experience at the moment, or at least until an 'offline mode' is offered. Which is disappointing as R3E has ADAC, WTCC and DTM racing with great sound which initially attracted me to this game.
6340	Still no soding multiplayer even thou they have been promising this scince launch it just never happens.  untill there is MP its a steaming turd time trials suck @ss and having to buy cars is a joke let me race my freinds.  yet another game with promises that just donot happen and its a shame cos it has the potential to be good WTF are the dev's doing.
6341	The game itself is OK, but the program is so hard to get running properly. Every time they update it, it screws up the graphics. It fails to start, fails to go into full screen, gets stuck on the start video. Just a whole load off issues running the game. Tried it on 3 PC's and generally get a mix of all of the above issues.
6342	I tried almost every simulation outh there including iRacing , and i was excited for a new simbin title , cuz im a fan of simbim from way back with GT legends and GTR/GTR2 , so i was expecting a good sim, insted i got some Acrila cars that u can not get used to , just like iRacing , u cant feel the road , u can master a track but u cant master the grip, its just unconected... no way neer GTR ad GTlegends and Race07...i dont care about graphics so thats my opinion on phisics and engine, a big fail from me , but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have missed me .  Now a little bit of a content rewiev Its not a free game , its a demo, if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep, i hate it , its like Star citizen , selling u a model of something and pricing it not as much as star citizen but still, its a 3D model, and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euros in cash, does it cost that much to designe a 3D model of a car, NO, so what is it , a rip off is what it is , they dont want to make a game, thats why u cant play it standalone with no internet conection, they wann sell stuff like Star citizen cuz they have seen the amoun of money SC earned robing off kids with money, Im OK with that , rip off all kids with money i couldnt care less, but u wont get it from me , i want a racing simulation , that will work even if my internet connection is down, i want to pay for a game not a car or a track. I couldnt care less what tracks name is , or what car am i driving , as long as its a nice track and a good car phisics ,so i play would play rFactor with unlicensed cars and track that work good rather then pay 200e for RaceRoom that has all licensed cars that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyers .. thats what it boilds down too, they would sell i virtual wheels and windshields if they could but they cant so they sell cars and tracks, im not in too that, so what are the alternatives  Alternatives GSC as Game stock car 2013 is a better sim on every level, exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the best sim on the market , apart from iRacing that so expensive u cant even consider it in a category of 20-30e and doesnt feel as good as GSC Also Aseto corsa is better then Race room, and its cheeper , but its not finished  So thats my review , boils down too if u have money there is no reason not to try to buy content, but if u suport financial models like that u will end up paying for wind shields ,rims and car skins, maybe even P2W like high octane fuel. If u are smart, u will suport games that dont try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on giving u a pleasure of racing against AI and ppl with as much content as u like , with mods, oficial content etc....so for me there is just GSC 2013 and Aseto Corsa that are on that level of racing, i Racing too but thats for profesional drivers not for a casual gamer..Race room expirience is a money generating machine not a racing simuator , just like World of Tanks is, Star Citisen and all other so called free games . Thank u simbin for not existing any more and making room for real racing gamers over at Asetto corsa and GSC. over and out
6343	It looks good. It runs relatively well (when you can defeat the twin bosses of patch updates and network connectivity issues). However, as I won't shell out an excessive amount of money to unlock the full 'experience', this game isn't for me. I understand that you get what you pay for, but I'd rather drop $50 on a solid racing sim instead of being nickle and dimed for half a game.
6344	Really fantastic game, sadly ruined by the cost of micro transactions. Sector 3 please just ditch the current payment model and sell the complete game for Â£29.99 and you will have a real winner with this game.
6345	Can't play singleplayer Offline
6346	Very Expensive content and just a few gaming options, graphics not that amazing. Anyway...waste of time and money...lots of money!
6347	too long developing it, until I can choose my own AI cars to race against, this is bottom of the pile.
6348	Its fun, you can use controller for this and it is very sharp and visually pleasing. However, the biggest problem is you can only get so far before you realize you must pay alot of money for new car, vinyl and track. There is no earn yourself a new ride with dedication and racking podium finishs. you spend the money just to race with new vehicle or tackle a different that was not already given to you. if you hate to pay-to-play... please stay away from this game it is no for you.  Not to be recommended to the Need for Speed (of any kind) / arcad'ee kids. If you were looking for alternative to Forza Motorsports on Xbox or an answer to Playstation's Gran Turismo, u may survive. This games mechanics and handling is similar to the console sim racers, but this PC sim is way much more serious then the console racers. this serious racing sim has a massive leaderboard filled with nothing but competitive times that other user across the world have placed. it more fun to race against ur friends times then some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pro race driver from Germany. it will be a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ if u hoped to be immersed in the game.  Again, the controls are solid, the game is sharp and presentable. but the pay to play more will most definitely kill your good vibes.
6349	At this time I cant recommend this, the game dose look good and plays well, Its beta like in ways, buggy poor menu system, the updates fix one problem and make three more. Time to delete try agin next year.
6350	Pros:  + Incredible graphics + It's free!  Cons:  - Needs multiplayer - Very complicated interface/menu (I still don't know how to win cups)  Conclusion:  RaceRoom's graphics are excellent (one of the best ones I've seen), but these incredible graphics are wasted on a pointless game! I have no idea how to REALLY play it! When I click 'Drive', it takes me to a track, but there are no opponents, and when I finish a lap it lets me do it again! (there's no end to it! It's an infine loop!) After a lap all it says is 'New record time' or nothing...  Score: 2/10
6351	Awful physics and expensive content. Shame, as I loved 07 but Simbin have nosedived with this. If you can spend the money go with iRacing, if not, try Assetto Corsa (sp?). Actually, get both and save yourself the download on this 'high end' sim. Physics... well, they may seem good if you have never driven a car. Only positives I can find is the sound is pretty good, gfx passable as long as you don't use triple screens and it is free to try so I didn't waste any money on it.
6352	Finally! A replacement for GTR2. This game is way better handling than other current rivals and force feedback is great out of the box. No need for endless tuning. Great racing experience. This game is worth it even though you have to purchase cars and tracks. BUT, and this is a big one, I always struggle to login to the server and this is a problem many people have, so much so that I sometimes give up and don't even play this game. The loading times are also just painful. Such a ptiy because the racing and the physics in this game are great.
6353	Ever since the latest update the game has been â¥â¥â¥â¥! the loading times are longer the refresh rate of the screen is slower and most of the time the game doesn't even know what to do plus the servers keep on crashing! One small thing that bothers me so much is the fact that we can't even test drive the cars anymore! how am I supposed to try out a car before buying it if I don't even know how it's going to feel?
6354	  Full of exploiters 
6355	take to long to load and my controler dont work on it and the price for it to much for a game
6356	take to long to load and my controler dont work on it and the price for it to much for a game
6357	Simply put, everyone's right. The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥. You get like...1 car and 1 map for free.  Controls are attrocious and you will find yourself crashing often.   F2P, P2W. (Free to play. Pay to win) Though I don't know how anyone can win with controls like these.    Get this crap off my library...
6358	Too complicated and really hard to start as a beginner. The controls are not intuitive at all and it's so realistic that your car is impossible to handle. Even if it offers good graphics and nice simulation it's not the best racing game you would want to play.

Pay to win) Though I don't know how anyone can win with controls like these.    Get this crap off my library...
6360	Force feedback is about the same as Dirt 1. All the cars feel like your screaming out of control in a shopping cart. Physics are really off. Do any of the developers actually have drivers licenses and have ever driven a real car?  AI is horrible, there is no awareness of other vehicles and they will simply slam into you. They drive like they are on a train track not a road.
6361	The game itself is OK, but the program is so hard to get running properly.  
6362	same simbin guys, same simbin race07 cars &amp; tracks, why would i buy group 5 pack when i can fire up the Retro expansion for Race 07- 74 vette 70 camaro, bmw, opel, volvo...its all there, an the tracks.  Raceroom has just repackaged all the sht from Race 07 an spinoffs/packs.. gtr evo, injection, an theres tracks online for free, Ive downloaded sebring, lime rock, watkins glen they all work fine look good.  to get the crap i already have since they give u nuthin with RR download, would cost over 100US. wtf man, an they cant even make it work pfffttt...lol
6363	160 dollars in dlc. here's a better business model: make the game 15 dollars and you won't have to pray and beg for people to buy overpriced DLC.
6364	160 dollars in dlc. here's a better business model: make the game 15 dollars and you won't have to pray and beg for people to buy overpriced DLC.
6365	This game in my opinion don t have great future. Need to spent a lot of money to have decent cars to play. No logic to need to buy car by car or track by track to play happy.
6366	same simbin guys, same simbin race07 cars &amp; tracks, why would i buy group 5 pack when i can fire up the Retro expansion for Race 07- 74 vette 70 camaro, bmw, opel, volvo...its all there, an the tracks.

6367	this is rubbish lol stick to race07 gtr evo or even better buy assetto corsa this is waste of money and band width i really hope this aint gtr 3 in disguise
6368	  Pros:  + Cars drive, feel and look great + Amazing sound + Good immersion and sense of speed + Amount of quality content + Test drive all cars before buying + Free competitions with the possibility to try out a big variation of content + Comes with 2 free tracks and a few cars + Solid netcode and fun multiplayer + Gamepad support  Cons:  - Obscure payment model with in-game virtual currency and microtransactions - Overpriced content (even with the regular discounts) - Not much going on in multiplayer. For paid content it's even worse. - The vast amount of microtransactions split the small public multiplayer community even further.  Conclusion:  This could be one of the most fun and populated racing sims out there if not for the publishers greedy payment/business model. Actually I like the idea to only pay for the content I want. Buy all tracks and your favourite cars of the series you want to race in and you're all set. But in reality the way it is now it doesn't work out. The pricing is not clear and fair enough. The public multiplayer community is split and barely alive. There is not enough going on online to justify buying the content. I was torn between giving the game a thumbs up or down. But from my personal point of view it all comes down to the questionable business model imposed by the publisher which keeps the game from being populated and more successful. In the current state I simply cannot recommend it to someone who likes to race online a lot.
6369	Graphics are pretty good, Vehicle physics and XBox 360 Controller support aren't so good.
6370	This game is crap. This game might be free-to-play but other games like warframe offer better quality than this. The steering is some of the worst i have ever seen in my life the car floats around the like its on ice, the engine sounds are decent but dont make up for the rest of the game. In summary dont install this game it really is crap
6371	 Confuse menu, less tracks and cars, too expensive if you want to have all till now in the game -.-   And when we talk for shopping ... i don't saw option for testing a car before i buy it (sry if i miss it), that will be so nice in case i don't like the car ... why i need to buy it?  Just a demo of the future game and i cant feel so big different between free cars -.- Not so big step forward of Race 07 only graphic changes and some problem fix.
6372	Had more than the system to run it. the controls are off, Not the greratest gameplay either.
6373	Nearly impossible to play without controller or racing wheel.
6374	4/10 which is halved of what i'd give it normaly due to lies about this being full game.  + Graphics Sound Performance Adjusting difficulity - Somehow allways feels fair no matter what you set as diff %  - Demo verssion not a free game inspite of how it is presented (Halving the score) Very uninspired track selection (give me something original! - Tatra test track and such) very uninspired vehicle selection (most of it is locked behind paywall annyways) Frusrating lack of value on Packs of cars/livieries/tracks (20ish EUR per one and you get like 8 EUR tracks?!)  I did enjoy this game once i realised that it is DEMO but i would very much appritiate if i was told that it is DEMO prior to playing it, the initiall shock was bad.    Game looks and feels great, what little of it i did play allways seemed to be good and difficulity of it was (inspite of my lack of skill) allso fairly aceptable. I did not encounter anny game breaking bugs and my constant out of track ventures were due to lack of skill. So they did pretty god job on that front and i praise that.  Trying to play championship with 2 tracks is stupid tho so i am not inclied to dignify this point too much: content is excellent for DEMO, pathetic for annything but demo.  Car selection is not too sad tho you only have access to 2 overarching categories (prototype and can cars) couple of choicess within each one, fairly solid content for this demo.  I did have major problem orienting myselve in menu, the track, car icons are way too large, list that would expand once you click the specific icon would be better. Furthermore structure of the menu itselve is kinda wonky - it'd be great if you could select category (prototype, can, formula, etc) than went to brand or year selection and than chose liviery. Right now you choose year AND category on one screen (WTCC 2013 example) and than individuall vehicle. it is not very intuitive is what i am aluring to.  Another missed oportunity and another damned Freemium demo. Skip this game and opt in for something more substantial.
6375	Raceroom experience was a very frustrating experience!  Update :- I have found a way to fix the main problem that I have with this game and that is to change traction control preset 0 from 0 to 100 in the car setup in the garage before a race (i.e. in practice or qualifying). I think what I was experiencing is called power on oversteer. Though I still cant believe that it should be anything like that bad in a real car :( Note this wont help you brake or go around a corner, it just means you wont spin off the track into the corner when you gently accelerate !  I cant believe the developers have made this game so inaccessable when all they need to do is change 1 variable and it would be 30000 percent more playable to people who try the game ! Btw I come at tihis as someone who generaly prefers more sim like games like gt legends, grid, dirt, test drive unlimited 2, nfs shift 2, race injection etc. But even with hundreds of experience on probably 20 different racing games I couldnt make it around a lap without it crashing from oversteer !   I still hesitiate to recommend this game because of the sheer anount of frustration this issue caused me  Here is my original review :-  Raceroom experience is a very frustrating experience!  This is mainly down to what I consider a fault in the physics model ! The frustrations are :- 1 (and this is the big 1) ) When accelerating out of a bend the car oversteers and crashes back into the bend it has come out of ! This is most noteable on raceroom raceway, on the corner at the start of the start finish straight.  The track goes around a corner and up a hill, yet the car just uncontrolably spins with oversteer back towards the corner if power is applied. No amount of opposite lock corrects it, and it doesnt feel like the back end is trying to overtake the front end due to too much power. It feels like its turning in a circle for no good reason. Grrr ! Though I have a feeling this is a common fault with a lot of so called sims. How many cars in the real world do you see spinning into the corner they have come out of ? This issue is probably more of a problem on raceroom raceway than most tracks. But that track in the standard yellow car (Canhard R52, sillhoutte series ?) sure does highlight it!  Btw I have a g25 wheel and pedals and a fast pc (gtx970 etc). So I dont think my problems are down to my setup. Also I have witnessed many many drivers having the same problems on that track, so its not just me. Though the experienced drivers do work around the problem.   2) If you do crash off, then the game takes 20 seconds to get going again. Either the car wont move at all or it just spins you into the opposite direction or you end up doing doughnuts. It will not spin and point in the right direction ! It doesnt matter if you are really subtle and gentle on the power or really heavy the result is the same ! Grrrr!  I think other than this the physics are very good, the sound is very good, the graphics are a slight improvement over race 07, but not as good as say need for speed or project cars. Oh and I think the actual online multiplayer mechanics are good, which probably makes it one of the best online racing games, sim or otherwise on the pc (if and for me this might be too much of an if :- If you can adapt your driving style to ignore what I consider to be faulty physics). I like the way you can test drive the cars before buying, though generally the content is too expensive. Particularly buying multiple items doesnt give enough of a discount.  Anyway, it would be a very good game, if it wasnt for what I consider to be a fault in one aspect of its physics model that makes it soooo frustrating :(

6377	I was very excited to check out this game. Sadly, every track /server that had drivers in it apparently would cost me REAL money to purchase before I can race on it. WTF? F2P my â¥â¥â¥. I'll stick with The Crew and Need for Speed.
6378	Server down. No Game. Dont make my mistake and give your money to sector 3!! Assetto Corsa is better and it works!!
6379	Google 'banned for no reason' racedepartment, then google SMS simbin, and then laugh at how awful it is and how it has nothing to do with this game.
6380	Just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ !It looks cool in the store but now i have played it and it's terrible .
6381	Microtransactions. Everywhere. Nope.
6382	Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ 20 GB, for demo game â¥â¥â¥â¥... 
6383	Let me start by saying, first off, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want to play more than what seems like a 'DEMO' of the game. Second, I got a few issues with the physics when using a game pad. It is very twitchy even with light throttle on every car when you are not in 3rd gear or higher. I have been on race tracks and in real race cars. You can tell when you are getting close to the edge of the handling capabilities. This game seems to either give you massive understeer, then when you manage to make a corner, you got the twitching problem when trying to get power down out of the corners. I find myself having to be in one or two gears higher than I should be just to keep control of the physics at the lower speeds. Having a spedometer when you are outside of the car would help also. The only way you can get a speedometer or tachometer is to have your view from inside the car.
6384	Terrible controller settings, no novice support, nobody is playing, not free at all, everything costs money, even tracks. terrible game
6385	Wouldn't even launch.  Regardless of how good the game is once you start racing (Should you get there) this game needs an overhaul of it's menu. The menus are all online, slow, massive white screens, glitchy and give error messages. I don't have a terrible PC, and this game wouldn't load at all. I got an error message at every stage.  TL;DR Its not worth the 20gbs, your time or your effort.
6386	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥
6387	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥
6388	The Game looks great! The tracks and cars are detailed. However, the controls are incredibly difficult to setup, if it detects your input. I used a Xbox One controller and could not control the vehicle at all. It says it's free, but you have the option to pick three cars on three tracks, then you have to pay an exorbitant amount for the rest of the game, much more than a AAA game would be. If you're goinmg to make a free game, make it free. If you're going to make a game that costs money, then make it cost money, but don't lure people in with the facade of free only to try to charge them more moeny than Fallout 4 or GTA V costs!
6389	very bad   you cant setup the car the damn things wont brake dont handle like a car even in manual it sucks big time
6390	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
6391	If it wasn't for the Free2Play system the game would have my recommendation  F2Play/10
6392	Great i got the game, now how do i turn the car the only thing i can do is bump into walls
6393	first i check on project car saw people comment said this game are better then that. so i check out and felt whynot is free lets download and play. after play serioustly.. i just spend this little bit time on this game i giving up. 1st two maps. so stingy ... i know dev hard work to make the game work but not free until so less map. too less car as well. game experience i felt grid win anytime. cant even close to real sim.   as i remember i play once on my friend gt5 . gt5 far more alot better.
6394	Disappointed. Game wouldnt start. Log shows playing time but never even got to start grid.
6395	the game its ok etc, unless menu but ok... finallly i decided purchase a circuit but when i realiced that its FIVE EUROS my eggs falled down so hard, and now i ask... seriously its 5â¬ EVERY MAPÂ¿? REALLY? AND EVERY CAR ITS LIKE 3â¬? comeon. this is not funny, its terrible disgusting.
6396	
6397	It's very hard to control the car even not in any corner. I will not recommend this game unless you seeking for the real life experience AND have appropriate equipment such as a steering wheel.
6398	So many better options out there. Stupid A'I', bad netcode, ripoff payment system, dated.
6399	Costs money to get anything good... :/ Description overrates the game, but it's free, so check it out and see what I mean. :P
6400	Don't bother
6401	10/10 jk this game is cancer.
6402	loo0000ng loading time.. *with millions of Os. uninstall directly..
6403	this game is terrible.
6404	This game crashes every 20-40 minutes for me (i5-4670K and GTX 760). Until they fix that I'm not paying for anything. The handling of the cars seems really good once you get the steering wheel settings sorted out. There's no single-player vs. the AI or multiplayer right now, you just drive around a track by yourself and it shows you how your times compare to other people's. The menus are the most ridiculously confusing thing I've ever seen too.  If they fix the crashing problem and add actual racing to the game, I'll be happy to get the $40 DLC. But until then it's a no go.
6405	Totally fake and unrealistic car behavior, physics, sound and graphics. Maybe not as bad as iracing, where it doesn't matter how fast you drive it always feels the same, but bad enough that you have to even in a demo purchase cars and tracks. Just crap all around and as a perfectionist, I have to say that nothing so far competes or compares to F1 2013 in realism, physics, graphics and sound !!!
6406	loading times suck. Everything has to load it would seem. Replays especially
6407	Game wont let me register to even play it so as of now this thing blows
6408	This is game ist not mine.  I think the gameplay is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sry about that.
6409	I'll start off my review by sharing an overall feeling and then list some pros' and cons' afterwards. Overall I would not recommend this game for a few reasons such as the cost modelling, undeveloped multiplayer and very poor customer support. Such a shame because this game had such promise only to fall flat on its' face.  Pros' - Decent, not great, selection of cars especially packs like DTM and ADAC GT Masters.  - Industry benchmark for sounds which intensifies the immersion.  - Very few flaws visually, but not quite to Assetto Corsa / Project Cars standards.  - Decent selection of tracks with more content on the way.  -Very few issues I had with wheel connectivity and settings right out of the gate.  Cons' - Cost modelling system similar to IRacing , much cheaper than IRacing but also none of the benefits.  - Multiplayer leaves something to be desired and they say as much upfront so think of it as early access.  - Online game only so don't expect to play the game if their servers are down.  - My biggest con = terrible customer support when things go wrong. To elaborate, approx. 2 weeks ago their main server and content server crashed, the game was unplayable and many like myself had paid content disappear for which i was not reimbursed with the content or given a refund. In fact, as of this writing I have yet to receive a reply to 2 support / ticket claims and one e-mail. With price modelling like this, you'd think they would be more interested than normal to help their customer base. This is not the SIMBIN that you used to know. I highly recommend you pick up GSC instead and save your money and save yourself a headache !!!
6410	This seems like a good take on a racing simulator. But it lacks a lot.  First, the free content of the game is limited and will bore you fast (1 track, 2 cars), I feel like we could have had a bit more, even if we get free testdrives of other cars on weekends. Also there is no multiplayer apart for laptimes and that makes it just you on the same track trying to get better times.  Graphicwise and simulation was it is great, nice graphics and it gives a realistic handling.   The ingame purchases are a bit expensive for what I'd aim for, but they are good and if you can afford it really take the game further.  It's free to play, so It's a goodie to have but overal it isn't quite finished yet.
6411	I literraly fell asleep to this.
6412	Disappointed. Game wouldnt start. Log shows playing time but never even got to start grid.
6413	If it wasn't for the Free2Play system the game would have my recommendation  F2Play/10
6414	Great i got the game, now how do i turn the car the only thing i can do is bump into walls
6415	You need to buy all cars you want to play with. Free???
6416	just sits there showing foggy cars, never loads to show the menus even after an hour
6417	Overly complicated with way too many ingame purcases, I would rather just pay for the game. It is very difficult to get into, go by Grid instead. (This game is not worth the download time).
6418	
6419	It's very hard to control the car even not in any corner. I will not recommend this game unless you seeking for the real life experience AND have appropriate equipment such as a steering wheel.
6420	Great i got the game, now how do i turn the car the only thing i can do is bump into walls
6421	I cant get it to launch, any help?
6422	You really cannot steer at all...
6423	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
6424	So many better options out there. Stupid A'I', bad netcode, ripoff payment system, dated.

6429	By far the worst racing game ever the controls are terrible and there is no AI racing only time attack modes for what i can see in the game. All i have to say is go play the forza, grid and grand turismo series they are way better then this steaming pile of crap.
6430	Is this game an alpha? I'm almost offended by the fact that the game feels unfinished, but they already have a DLC on sale. Simply make the game paid then!   You almost cannot feel the game without paying (meaning one or two free 'tracks'. All the real ones are paid for), there is no story-mode, the physic is not well done (no car damage, no aerodinamics, very limited tarmac/grass friction) and you cannot assign more than one button to the same action (meaning that I need to choose if I want paddle shifters or stick, but never both).  The game feels like a copy of ACR, and doesn't live up to his competition.  Otherwise, the menu system is very nice, once you get used to it.
6431	bad graphics..
6432	got it PCMag/BundleStars bundle with RACO 07 a GTR Evolution... Terrible game! Randomly 'alt-tabs' me out and there is no other option than kill the proccess. Not a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game is free, everything is for som points
6433	Its not worth the download. The DLC page they have in the game looks better than the MAIN MENU IN THE GAME. Says alot about the Devs...
6434	Even though this is the only free car simulator, it's not that good and not what I expected by some gameplay.
6435	As allways there is this horrible micro transactions. well not so micro in this case! I rather pay 50$ for a complete game then paying over 100$ for all the content you want! Shame on you game developers!
6436	Trying to get a full feel of the car and it auto brakes on aproach and into the turns. I can't find a way to turn it off. Whats racing with an auto brake??? I'm removing this game and would not recommend it to anyone.
6437	In options it sees my gamepad controller, but has no way to select it. Forces you to use keyboard. Uninstalled.
6438	This seems like a good take on a racing simulator. But it lacks a lot.

6439	I literraly fell asleep to this.
6440	how to register account???
6441	Cool Game,But No unlocking cars,buy tracks,and crazy load times so i would not reccomend it
6442	Not recommended at all, reasons? well, requires registration out of steam, non responsive web page, finaly got the registraton and activated my account, turned on the game, loged in using my registration details and i got server error, server error, server error.  After a long time i finaly made it to main menu, choose a race type, hmm all options are grey but one, fine, Singleplayer/Hotlapping, hmm choose car, buy, buy, buy, ok only 1 car here? choose track, buy, buy, buy, only one track here? a lot to buy but nothing included. Seriously this is NOT a free to play game its DAMN upgradable DEMO!!!!!!!  A question, why the hell they want a real name, date of birth, country of origin and country of residence details???? You do have to fill that in on the registraton page, without it you cannot complete the registration  Should be removed from steam, too many bad reviews about how expensie actually this F2P game can get, stinks like some kind of rip off, plus not even Steam cares about my date of birth, so why should i give it to a 3rd party? What is this, some kind of a phishing scam? A paradox, the most expensive free to play game i ever got my hands on
6443	i only got one car not 3 an 1 track and can only practic
6444	simply the devrlopers are plain liers the promised multiplayer over a year ago, i know damn well it doenst take this long to develope multiplayer functions and servers ther bsing way to much
6445	first i check on project car saw people comment said this game are better then that. so i check out and felt whynot is free lets download and play. after play serioustly.. i just spend this little bit time on this game i giving up. 1st two maps. so stingy ... i know dev hard work to make the game work but not free until so less map. too less car as well. game experience i felt grid win anytime. cant even close to real sim.   as i remember i play once on my friend gt5 . gt5 far more alot better.
6446	the game its ok etc, unless menu but ok... finallly i decided purchase a circuit but when i realiced that its FIVE EUROS my eggs falled down so hard, and now i ask... seriously its 5â¬ EVERY MAPÂ¿? REALLY? AND EVERY CAR ITS LIKE 3â¬? comeon. this is not funny, its terrible disgusting.

6450	Good sounds and bad controlls...i have just started the game and i do not undestand a thing.It is even not well optimzed. you have a lot of frame drops.
6451	It's clear that, on the developer's list of priorities, the game's features and ability to engage took second place to how it would be monetised. Some of the worst habits of game publishers are on display here, and to add insult to injury, the game they're corrupting here wasn't really worth paying for in the first place.

6452	
6453	It's very hard to control the car even not in any corner. I will not recommend this game unless you seeking for the real life experience AND have appropriate equipment such as a steering wheel.
6454	how to login to the game? 
6455	I will cut to the chase; it is so, so difficult to reccomend this game, even to a proper petrolhead.  When you first download the game for free, you will be bewildered with a very awkward UI menu layout. It took me a few minutes to get to the track at first, when really this could of been achieved in under 20 seconds. On the track, you will be star-stuck with amazing graphics, I will not lie about that. The graphics are up there with any top race sim. Start driving, and hooray, a good car noise, and the developers have programmed the game well to work with a force feedback racing wheel.  But that's it. Now for the negatives. The cars (even the slick racers) understeer so inaccurately. I'm no mega physics guy, but I know something's wrong when a leading class race car won't get round a bend at 40mph. Obviously there is no tyre shreak to warn you; you're on slicks. I tested to make sure it wasn't just a simulation of cold tyres = no grip, but after countless laps the car continued to behave like it had tyres 1mm wide.  Surely the elephant in the room is the DLC. You start with about 4 cars and two tracks. That is fine, it is free after all I suppose. But add the DLC costs up for all the tracks and cars, and you are looking at triple figure sums. Honestly, I'd rather just pay Â£35 for the game outright and get everything, without a free version.  You can take this with a pinch of salt as it's just a minor person's opinion. But playing for 2 and a half hours (which doesn't sound like much) has made me stand by those opinions. Since it's free, just go ahead and download to see for yourself. It's like a lot of modern games these days; very pretty, but no actual gameplay.
6456	There is no racing unless you shell out money. You may only do a hotlap. The Menu system is difficult to navigate around.
6457	this game sucks
6458	Felt like I was driving a mustang. I couldn't turn very well.
6459	Terrible graphics, terrible gameplay, terrible handling .... I downloaded this after reading all the positive comments but the cars drive like they are floating on air not the track ... 
6460	
6461	it doesnt work for me. fails to launch
6462	What a waste of time downloading this 11GB game, when all you can do is race against yourself on one track.
6463	This game is a joke right? It â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks! The AI is agressive as hell! They can slam into you, even just slightly touch you and you spin outta control, you can slam into them and they won't nudge, half the veichales picutres when choosing don't ewven show up and the handling is disgusting, just erase this game!
6464	I didnt even know I have this game. Made me sad when i found out i played it.
6465	I don't understand what my friends see in this game, it is just a really difficult to control racing car game
6466	Just bad and boring. feels like the game was rushed out or just beta, but its free so give it a try and see if you like it.
6467	First off great game/sim......................if and its a big if you can actually play it,connection errors are a very big problem in this title and i can no longer play this game due to the now famous 503 error,no response atall from many messages sent to Sector 3,very very poor at the monet and one angry customer.
6468	Cant play multiplayer anyome, if i click on multiplayer i go automatic to the official side from RRRE and cant back? what can i do.
6469	I bought Audi TT RS for 3 bucks, and I only got one single livery? If I want to get all liveries, they will cost 7 bucks? WOW..................AC has dlc that comes with 7 cars that only cost 6.99............
6470	2 words..... BUY NOW and i dont mean buy the game! rather than a free game that you have to pay to play, why not just charge for the game? the game is average at best, but every car you want costs money,  you get about 3 to choose from, practice session just gave me false start regardless of how i set off! buggy game that i would not recommend even at the high price of free! you will end up spending Â£60 just to drive the cars you want!  couldn't see the track half the time in racing as dash was too high, not very good physics either. shame it could be so much more
6471	Multiplayer contains alot of trolls with no admins to get arid of them and im a big fan of multiplayer when It comes to online games. But for this game, you get at least a couple trolls here and there in a server. They often like to ram you off the track or use their car to block part of the track. Drivers like me would rather roleplay and play the game the professional way. It only takes one troll to ruin the server gameplay and there is no body to take care of the issue. If trolls were not such a big problem, I would recommend this game, but I don't. Just about ready to uninstall this game if multiplayer doesn't get any better.
6472	I bought Audi TT RS for 3 bucks, and I only got one single livery? If I want to get all liveries, they will cost 7 bucks? WOW..................AC has dlc that comes with 7 cars that only cost 6.99............
6473	Can't say much about the base free-to-play game since I really haven't played it (just a single race) but the DTM Experience 2013 DLC is a must buy! Got on sale at the Humble Store for $6.24! This is one of the most realistic racing sims I have played...the sounds are incredible!  UPDATE: I really can't recommend this game based soley on the cash grab that it is. Even during Sector 3's summer sale the addon packs are quite over-priced. Sector 3 really nickel and dimes you for every little tiny aspect of this game. During the summer sale if you were to buy everything on sale it would have cost over $100. I bought Assetto Corsa with DLC included for less than $30. I bought Project Cars for $35 and the DLC is dirt cheap! If you have a wallet that is fat full of cash then go ahead and buy everything Sector 3 wants you to buy. Afterall, it's a great sim to race in but if you value your dollar look to a cheaper alternative.
6474	It would have been a good game   If it actually runs
6475	Well... No. At this (as they say) early state of development there are many reasons to just say 'no' to this game. I played a whole lot of racing games and racing sims and still I'm not fully aware where to put it Raceroom Racing Experience in. Sometimes, driving in R3E feels reasonably realistic, sometimes it's ridicoulusly arcade-ish.   Let's have a list of good aspects of R3E; There is a great AI, which often fights and struggles the same way you do. I don't want to say that they're completely flawless, hell no, but compared to other racing games, the AI in R3E is damn good.  The tracks come in a very polished manner and for me it was a pleasure to see such detailed tracks, full of life. Codemasters still does a better job in this but well, you can't be good at everything, right?   Also the cars look nice - not great, but nice. It's pretty hard to say when it is 'enough' regarding details, because theoretically it's never enough if you want to simulate things. But sure there are restrictions in terms of hardware resources. And it's 'free' to play, so they want to reach a big audience of course.  All along the words 'free to play' is the biggest flaw in here. When you first download the game, there are waiting 2 cars in your garage on 2 tracks, with 3 and 2 versions of it. Of the the tracks is a R3E Fantasy track, which - don't get me wrong - is damn good. Sector 3 Entertainment offers a test-drive in every car you may want to drive, at least. But let's face it - if you want to have a full garage, you're about to pay at least 120â¬, which is too damn high, considering that the cars are not even realistically balanced or even physically correct - yes, they are nice, but nice doesn't want me to pay that much money.   I purchased the ADAC GT Masters 2014 Package, the Hillclimb Package, as well as the track Bathurst and the Ruf GTRS12 (basically a Porsche 997 GT3). Hell yeah it was worth it, I had some fun, especially on Bathurst, and with some of the GT Masters tracks and cars... But the game still feels incomplete, everywhere pops up a 'BUY NOW', 'BUY NOW', 'ON SALE', 'ON SALE', advertisement everywhere - incredibly annoying.   I don't think that they ever change this, so this alone is a reason to give it a 'no'... On top of that comes the questionable physics and behaviour of some cars and the lack of settings of track conditions.  Oh and it was a pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to get my Force Feedback into a playable state, although it fully supports my Logitec Driving Force GT (I know, it's far away from being the best, thanks! :D ), which to me was a antipathic moment, also...  Go download the thing and try it yourself, but invest some hours before you buy something.
6476	Awful company. Overpriced garbage. Dumb business model. Poor game.  Even the zombie apocalypse couldn't bring this game's multiplayer to life.  It's dead. Avoid. Look at Assetto Corsa, Project cars or Stock car extreme instead.
6477	I'm one of the Alpha Testers of the game and no, I don't recommend the game. Not because of Alpha problems which are expected from all games, but the engine is not optimised. I get a fair bit of lag with NVIDIA-610M at the Lowest possible graphics. Which are pea soup quality. Now I don't really have problems with fairly new games, and no problem with the old games when it comes to performance. This is the first negative.  Second is, I don't think game mechanics are realistic. Probably depends on the person, but I didn't like them. A.I. is not good as expected from Alpha and CB, it can be easily patched.  Rest assured, if you play it on easy difficulties and have a high end machine, you will enjoy the game. Rest? I'm sorry.
6478	This has to be the worst racing game ive ever played and i played alot of them. steering is the problem. car wont go in a straight line with or without accelerating. turn slightly and the car keeps going that direction. its like the track rods are loose on the car . ive tried control pad and steering wheel. no matter what i do i cant get it to full 900degrees steering stuck at 200 and the input from my steering wheel doesnt match the input ingame. dont get me started on the force feedback there is none the wheel just constantly vibrates.  plus play for free my â¥â¥â¥â¥ you would get more in a demo. stay clear from this game.
6479	Unrealistic physics, laggy, 97% of the cars you have to buy. Long loading times even in single player.
6480	I was hoping on passing the time between Forza Horizon and Forza 5 but I played this game once and it was a mess. Horrible game. It's not even worth the price tag, free. They should be paying me to play this piece of garbage.
6481	Cars handle horridly and sound bad with it. Wait till it gets better.
6482	This game has no feedback whatsoever. R3E is the worst simulator out there, don't be scammed like the creators of this thing want you to be.
6483	Do game companies not understand, making people pay for a full game, not only, will bring them money, but it will also strengthen their fanbase, I love the devs, but they made a poor choice with the marketing for this game, it's not F2P, it's Pay4Fun, and if a game is like that, might as well pay full price for a game. If you have 100's of dollars to spend on it go ahead, but I just personally don't want to, and for me, the physics on this specific game aren't even that good, reletively speaking to games like Assetto Corsa, rFactor, and Project cars, which have pretty solid physics engines (rFactor barely xD).
6484	I was hoping on passing the time between Forza Horizon and Forza 5 but I played this game once and it was a mess. Horrible game. It's not even worth the price tag, free. They should be paying me to play this piece of garbage.
6485	I have never played a racing game with the word 'sim' in it, that is so bad.Traction, braking, and steering/handling physics are terrible. Cars seem to always steer right for some reason, and the handbrake doesnt work. Then there is the elephant in the room. Lack of content. 6 tracksand 10 cars? come on. to have to pay ridiculous money for new tracks and cars, i makes this already below par game so much more unappealing. -4/10
6486	Game is BS, UI is â¥â¥â¥â¥, controlls are â¥â¥â¥â¥, and GFX are â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6487	Pretty much just a waste of 20+ gigs of space. Any free racing game is better than this so-called 'simulator.' Steering wheel implementation is pathetic compared to any modern game, free or not. Save yourself the download and pass over this one.
6488	it is basically a free trial, just check it out for yourself. if you dont mind the 16 GB download.  the AI sucks. it has 2 tracks and 2 cars for free, the rest you pay in DLC. Physics don't seem that bad, but the Game overall feels like Alpha version. not recomended. if you have the money to buy all the carp they sell you, if you happen to like the game, you should try it anyways. base model is free after all.
6489	Free to play my a**! You get like 3 cars and 3 tracks and that's about. For anything more, you need to pay lots of money. At least start selling the game for 60 euros with everything included. Until then, this game is not recommended by me!
6490	RaceRoom Racing Experience is what the title tells you, a Racing Experience, that is what I thought, until I downloaded this game. Basically this game is a Racing game, like all the other thousands of Racing games but this one is different,  IT'S FREE TO PLAY!   (Now isn't that something you dont see everyday...)    Anyway! Back to the Review! Now the first thing I'm gonna jump right into is the  AI . So basically the AI is exactly like you in this game,  except 20x better.  They are even better at turning in this game, 'Turning? Isn't turning ment to be the easiest thing in the whole game?'  Now thats what I thought when I downloaded the game too, until I played a match of Singleplayer, this also brings us to our second thing I want to talk to you about, the turning, yes, the turning. Basically the turning is terrible, and I mean  TERRIBLE . Alright so you want to take this basic turn at a slight fast speed?  WELL NOPE ! You are basically screwed. The turning is so bad, I don't know if it's meant to make it feel realistic or something, but it is still terrible the turning. The third and last thing I have to  turtore  tell you is how all cars are... you guessed it...  Manual...  It makes me cringe just waiting for it to change each several gear to reverse, I swear it takes 5  slow  seconds to reverse... WHY? This is a  Racing Game , NOT A, 'Take A Driving Test for your License,'  GAME! Unbelivable. Well that's it! Thank's for wasting 1 minute of your life reading this review on this awful game! I swear the graphics don't look as good as the trailer shows them.
6491	Absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ing waste of time! 9.1Gb size with my slow â¥â¥â¥ internet to find that I need atleast $100 to buy cars and tracks. 
6492	I went into this game expecting great things, having loved Race 07 as it was my introduction into pc sim racing. played the game, as a racer its pretty good, but compared to the competition, Assetto Corsa, Project CARS, hell even Race 07, it just isnt good value for money if you want to buy more cars/tracks, to buy 3 cars and a track costs about Â£10, if you want to buy every car, track and livery you are looking at well over Â£100. and even if this was the best racing game ever made, with the best physics, graphics and features, it would not be worth that. if you want to spend that much on a racing game i would recommend a monthly subscription to iRacing or rFactor 2 which will certainly cover you in that regard. For a utter beginner into pc sim, it is not to bad, but for everyone else this will simply drain your wallet with not enough reward, not compared to its rivals. I wish they made GTR 3 instead.
6493	This might be the only time to actually waste money on this game considering the 70% off. Otherwise, the amount of money spent on this game just to collect cars and tracks is ridiculous for what you end up with compared to their older titles and hate to through in consoles, but FM and GT games, then not to mention the upcoming Project Cars which I'm part of and is in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guys are putting into their new game (Project Cars).

Basically the turning is terrible, and I mean  TERRIBLE . Alright so you want to take this basic turn at a slight fast speed?  WELL NOPE ! You are basically screwed. The turning is so bad, I don't know if it's meant to make it feel realistic or something, but it is still terrible the turning. The third and last thing I have to  turtore  tell you is how all cars are... you guessed it...  Manual...  It makes me cringe just waiting for it to change each several gear to reverse, I swear it takes 5  slow  seconds to reverse... WHY? This is a  Racing Game , NOT A, 'Take A Driving Test for your License,'  GAME! Unbelivable. Well that's it! Thank's for wasting 1 minute of your life reading this review on this awful game! I swear the graphics don't look as good as the trailer shows them.
6495	Worst optimized racing game i have ever played. i can't play it on high setting but my pc is higher then recommended.Low settings looks â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(like ur playing a game in 2000). Multiplayer is full of kids who like to drive cars like GTA.In first corner there is no chance to still going unless u were started in first 5.  PROS + +Free +Multiplayer +Physics are not bad +Good forcefeedback  CONS- -Shiffy racing experience -Optimization -U have less then 10 cars and the other cars are locked until u buy them -Don't try to play it with a keyboard.(I tried both keyboard and g27) If u want some racing experience and if u going to pay some money go buy iracing(u can get it free for 3 months).
6496	This is a story of a lot of missed potential. The controls are nice, the visuals are nice, and the cars feel very weighty and responsive. But, that's about the end of my compliments.  Why this is labeled as 'Free To Play' is beyond me. you get one, maybe two cars and two tracks for free. literally everything else you have to pay for. The tracks that they show off on the front page? Yeah, you have to buy all of those individually. I don't call that free to play, I call that a demo. If it was labelled as a demo and that the full game had to be bought, it'd be a different review. But, since they tried to pass it off as a free to play game that had loads of content, only to mock the person when they get in with entire screens and sections as paid DLCs, it feels like a massive case of false advertising.   And the Driving assists, oh god the driving assists. they come down like a bag of bricks and you can't turn them off. I spent a good half hour searching for a way to turn off the auto-braking, because it made my car come to what I can only describe as a complete stop around even a small corner.  unless you have money and patience, I say stick to the competitors, because this is a blatant money-grab.
6497	worst gui ive ever experienced in a game, downloaded 9gb then uninstalled straight away a â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor game. Only positive is that it was free so cant complain about the price but everything else not so much...  requiring you to spend money to unlock cars, free 2 play rubbish!!!!!!  editing the controls should be easy, not impossible to find the menu.
6498	It's been a couple of years now since I forked out real world money for a handful of tracks and cars for this game. Still there is no racing to be found either online or offline outside of the DTM 'dlc'. The name of the game is a lie.  Still just time attack modes and a token practice mode against AI.  The driving experience itself doesn't feel as good as other games from the developer's illustrious past and the immersion provided by the sound and graphics is merely passable. If you're only using the base content, then it's worth a go to enter the competitions and work your way up the leaderboards, but if you intend on splashing out some cash, there are mch better options available. I'm a keen sim racer and try out all the different sims that come on the market but can't recommend spending money on this.
6499	Pretty nice graphics, don't mind the microtransactions but I refuse to spend money until they fix the AI. The AI will just slam your car with blatant disregard and, I'm sure it's all in my head, but it feels like when they hit me I go flying and skid out. When I hit them basically nothing happens and they can maintain control no problem.  If they fix the AI I'd buy Laguna Seca, a few cars, and I'd race that track till my fingers bleed.
6500	Graphics not the best. Gameplay and controls are just a joke - Teribble. 95% of cars and maps have to be bought (of course all the good cars and maps). Not worth downloading.
6501	race room expirence more like race room bad experience why? 1 sining in was like filling out a census form  2 comfirmation email took 1 hour 3 does not work  4 very limted content
6502	Wait for Project Cars. Based on playing just 13 minutes I could already tell it was abysmal. The feel, mechanics, and animations of the car and driver were very poor. Graphics were alright, still looked sub-par however.
6503	Just getting a black screen then the movie, nothing else.
6504	You really do get what you pay for here.
6505	The best thing about this game are the sounds. The price model is bad. You can get a better AA-AAA racing title that is just as good for the price. Their older game GT Legends GTR series and Race series are just as good if not better. If Simbin/Sector3 re-release this game as a standalone game with steamworks for multiplayer with dedicated servers and traditional DLC I may consider buying.  Get the older SimBin titles NFS Shift 1/2 and Grid 1 and Autosport and Project Cars You will thank me later Until major changes are made.........
6506	
6507	It looks like a good game but I can't even play it due to the loading of races bringing you back to the main menu or it crashing.
6508	think of a Hamburger : Bottom Buns = Basic Game Bacon = DLCs Cheese = DLCs Cabbage = DLCs Tomato(Sauce) = DLCs Top Buns = All DLC  i cant even get to play -_- took ages to register, and end up on ERROR 503 - Service Portal not available
6509	I have played a lot of racing games in my time mostly on the various playstation sytems. Looking at the screenshots of the game and the trailers it looks quite something, when you download the game however things change. Firstly the 'Free to play' element is a 5 cars on a 5 tracks quite disappointing but it cost nothing. First thing that annoyed is the braking signs that suggest that target audience is 3 year olds, colour coding? aren't the distance signs good enough for a simulator.  Anyway, after starting an event in a stick shift I was quite pleased to see one hand went to change gear when required, my illusions were shattered when I came to a corner though. I pressed the right arrow key the steering wheel imediately went to full lock and I understeered into the wall so I thought fair enough I was a bit fast but I expected for the car to at least attempt the corner, (for example gran turismo you can enter a hairpin flat and you will take a curved path into the wall). I tried the next corner at a snail's pace (light sweeper probably a 3rd usually, I took it in 1st )giving an impovement, enough that I made it round. Something that bothers me is the fact it just says speed on the display is it km/h or mph? considering I was doing 190 in first in a DTM car I doubt it's either.  Next I took a paddle shift prototype, the paddles did not move at the correct which also bothered me. Furthermore, the camera is positioned so close to the steering wheel that it seems the driver is trying to rub his chin on it. Next the sounds, it's free to play I know but I expected it least to sound like an actual race car as this was. tunnels make exhaust notes but the tunnel I entered was extremely underwhelming.  All I can say is at least it wont cost you any money just time
6510	Can't believe this is a Free to play game! Have any lab rat try out yet? (p/s: don't try this out)
6511	This game seems to â¥â¥â¥â¥ out errors to a lot of people.  Pros: Pretty cars and tracks Decent physics and sound Racing and stuff  Cons: Truckload of errors while attempting to login Pay to unlock  $Milkyway error purchase unsuccessful? WHAT? It's either error this or error that. Don't touch this game if you're not made of money.
6512	Just getting a black screen then the movie, nothing else.
6513	
6514	One of the worst games I think I've played on here. The steering is terrible. My gamepad is set up fine but the cars are just terrible to control. Needs to be a little smoother to be enjoyable.
6515	Controlls are WAY to hard, only partial controller support, terrible graphics, NOT RECOMENDED
6516	free to play is not a one lap - one car - no race experience
6517	This is crap. I can't drive, tutorial doesn't work no matter HOW many updates, and bad FPS- not connected to anyone.
6518	One track one skin one car the rest is pay to play if you want them instently
6519	I tried this and it failed to impress me. I love racing games and have been playing them for 15 years on PC. I couldn't get my wheel which admittedly is pretty ancient) to work properly, found the cars seemed to have no weight. Looks pretty enough but if actual gameplay sucks then its not worth the price of admission. In my humble opinion this doesn't hold a candle to the brilliant but old Papyrus Grand Prix Legends, which is still a challenging and enjoyable experience even ten years on. I can't recommend this game really but if you can get abetter controller it may be worth the time giving it a try but the free content is pretty limited and should really be described as a Demo not Free To Play. Disappointed as so many race games seem to be aimed at the console market, Codemasters used to produce some fun driving games but now fill their arcade racers with fantasy city tracks and boring drift courses, Isn't that what NFS was for? Perhaps I'll have better luck with AC. Meanwhile back to Grand Prix Legends ha ha. I also found the menu system here really clunky and poorly thought out, I quickly got bored with the free content and wasn't charmed enough to risk good money on this yet . I know it is still in development but it still needs a lot of work to get it sweet.
6520	This is crap. I can't drive, tutorial doesn't work no matter HOW many updates, and bad FPS- not connected to anyone.
6521	Controlls are WAY to hard, only partial controller support, terrible graphics, NOT RECOMENDED
6522	One of the worst games I think I've played on here. The steering is terrible. My gamepad is set up fine but the cars are just terrible to control. Needs to be a little smoother to be enjoyable.
6523	Klunky controls but great graphics, if you got a new pc and want to see it looking great at work download it but otherwise not worth the download. although it is free so it your loooking just to kill time its not the worst choice
6524	Minutes after I registered for the free install I got spam bombed with pharmacy c**p. Never got spam on this email account ever. DON'T DOWNLOAD.
6525	Pure â¥â¥â¥â¥ not even realistic dont try it.
6526	sucks do not install!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 0/10 gaben confirmed!!!!!
6527	the game is pretty looking/sounding pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ the AI are indestructable Objects.
6528	I love racing games and this one is the worse out of them. A huge delay with control input. I click to go forwards it thinks about it then does it 10 seconds later. Want to turn not going to happen. Tried a variaty of settings with no joy. uninstalled and never being reinstalled
6529	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TITLE!! THERE ARE BETTER SIM-RACING GAMES!   I recommend iRacing, Rfactor2, Live for Speed, Project C.A.R.S, F1 Series, Assetto Corsa, Richard Burns Rally..... and Grand Turismo 5/6
6530	I really thought this would be the next gen Simulation racer that all PC gamers are looking for, while it has all the right stuff, decent graphics, not the best, but much better than the likes of Race 07 and other Sim bin games. The sounds are great too, and the physics are great, but it's missing the most essential element: Multiplayer.  On this basis alone I cannot recommend this game, you can only do time trials so many times and for so long. Another big reason why I won't recommend this game is because, although this game is free to play, the micro transaction system is too expensive. I have done the math and nothing is worth paying that amount of money for, you even have to pay for the realism mode, I mean, who does that on a supposed racing sim?  The free stuff is not enough to keep you going for more than a few hours, there just isn't enough free content to even make this a viable free to play option.  Also, the big attraction to Race 07 and other titles are all the mods you can get, this game does not support modding, so it seems, and you have to pay for everything you want, this I'm sure has detered many previous Sim Bin fans.  If Sim Bin are prepared to drop the prices on all their tracks and cars, and introduce multiplayer, or at least bot cars, then I will consider reviewing my recommendation.  Edit: Even on 50% Easter sale on all cars and tracks, I decided it wasn't worth it. Perhaps if Sim Bin put a 50% discount on the DTM experience, then I may just buy that, as the DTM Experience opens the Beta multiplayer mode.
6531	When I first saw the gameplay video and screenshots of the game, I thought it would be a realistic and exciting racing game with tons of features. Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.  Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your 'racing experience' being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.  So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.  Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.  And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.  Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(
6532	Very poor driving experience, the game is HD but the graphics don't excel.  The menu is very hard and mazed up.  As an actual ingame footage... on every challange you are allowed to controll your car after 3 seconds on which if you continuously press the acceleration button you will lose controll of your car immediatelly. No to mention that everytime you are forced to start the game on a curve.  There are 3 dificulties that you can chose BEFORE you enter a race, once you are in it, you cannot adjust them. Novice- the one that the AI breaks like your grandma' Normal - the decent way to play this game aaand Advanced - unplayable from keyboard   Few tracks, few cars. You are forced to play a specific car on a specific race.   The game looks ok from the outside but its not worthing the time waiting to install.  Cheers, predatorX
6533	This game is so c**p. You firstly have to create another account aside from your steam one. Them once you start the grapichs are aweful and then you have to pay real money to get more races and cars
6534	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game! The steering is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! I spin out every on every corner. I get disqualified because the game thinks I'm too horrible. Took forever to download. Takes up lots of space. Total waste of disk space. The game is simply put â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! -10/10!!! That's NEGATIVE ten out of ten!!!!!!!!
6535	was looking forward to this but sadly after installing onto windows 10. when i ran the game my mouse just heads to the top of the screen. if i pull it down it just runs up the screen again. so after running the game. the mouse heads up the screen again. so gave up playing did not even manage to get to the first race. have not uninstalled. just incase there is a fix. but for now if anyone knowa of a fix for this. please let me know. at the moment i will review this down. and when i manage to play the game i will give an update.
6536	I dont like that even on novice, you cant just race full speed and not spin around like a freak in curves. Yeez guys. please
6537	this game sucks it cost a fortune to use no tutorial no helping to learn controls this game sucks
6538	This game is so c**p. You firstly have to create another account aside from your steam one. Them once you start the grapichs are aweful and then you have to pay real money to get more races and cars
6539	Game was broken for me, just downloaded it and it will not work all I get is a white screen with silouettes of cars laggedly going across the screen, and nothing ever happens it has a faulty UI.
6540	Multiple Issues, Could not detect controller, Visual strobing issue when in full screen.
6541	This game is crap the cars are BAD and almost all of the cars are with REAl MONEY totaly dont download this. The UNÄ°NSTALL was faster than the install
6542	I THANK YOU SHOD BEABLE TO PLAY OFF LINE AND OWN THE CONTENT
6543	Raceroom is a good game, but itÂ´s literally pay-to-play.  So unless you want to spend alot of money on this 'free to play' game, itÂ´s not worth getting it.
6544	driving is ok, but you have to pay real money for everything.
6545	Update to review below: I keep getting spam emails from Raceroom despite trying to unsubscribe numerous times. Avoid.   ----- Game is a half decent driving sim but is ruined by the fact that anything that goes wrong leaves you facing the wrong way on the track. I can understand it happening sometimes, but when it is everytime something is badly wrong with the physics engine.  For reference I have played iRacing and Project Cars with steering wheel so know what end of a car is what.
6546	keeps crashing everytime i try to play it
6547	Still no multiplayer. I'm not waiting anymore. Goodbye
6548	this game is boring im trlling you
6549	Pretty decent for a free game no Multiplayer like Autoclub Revolution. It's basically the same game but has Multiplayer in it as well. I would recomment this game if it had Multiplayer not hot laps or whatever these idiots call it and other racing sims follow.
6550	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. You can't even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reverse it's so stupid. Waste of time.
6551	keeps crashing everytime i try to play it
6552	Didn't get any feeling at all with this game at all. I suppose you need a steering wheel to be able to enjoy it. And free to play? Yeah right... in singler player only. If you want to play online you need to hand out â¬30+ wich I didnt know beforehand.. If it would have a better feeling to it I would certainly be willing to pay for it, and I would apprechiate if that information was handed to me before I downloaded it and registered.. I think I'll just hang back a while and wait for a better option.
6553	Because of Assetto Corsa, I was very optimistic about indie racing simulators, and this game was free, so I thought I'd try it out. It turns out, it's merely a freemium game, with full-on microtransactions, and you can't do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money. It's essentially the Real Racing 3 of computers, except Real Racing 3 allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent. Let's talk about the game itself. The physics kinda work, but the car feels slippery, much like a bar of soap, and the graphics are representative of a phone game-no, not even, Real Racing 3 looks much better. Especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best. Is it a bad game? Not necessarily, I'm guessing the game is merely developing, but I feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state. Definitely get Assetto Corsa instead, it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this pay-to-have-fun affair. Or, if you're broke and need a free racing game, I'd recommend Trackmania Nations Forever, which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer, or even the demo of GRID 2, which has online multiplayer.
6554	RRRE lures you in with a premise of the Free2Play game model where there is actual fun to be had for free and you will not have to spend tonnes of money on every single piece of content.  Unfortunately, that is the case for RRRE, which cleverly uses the trademarked 'FREE2RACE' term, which means yes, you can race for free, but barely.  RRRE is not as good of a simulator as previous Simbin titles, meaning that other similar alternatives like Simraceway and iRacing will be the way to go now for the old Race07 crowd.  Do not spend money on this game if you're expecting old Simbin quality.
6555	So many micro transactions
6556	Still no multiplayer. I'm not waiting anymore. Goodbye
6557	this game is boring im trlling you
6558	P.O.S. nuff' said. seriously though, it gives you Single player, no racing with friends, unless of course you buy it, but wait thats not all! you also need to buy more tracks other than the TWO they give you, unless of course, you don't mind the game getting stale within a few races. cars? of course they have a couple, see that sweet ride over there you want? BAM! transaction. im surprised they don't try to sell individual wheels to you as well.
6559	Don't play this unless you really want to spend money on it. Since FREE players only have 1 track and 1 car to race with...
6560	This is a horrible game. The driving experience is not a good one. Dont download this game!!!!!!
6561	Very limited free game, although the in game driving is actually good the free version is so limited it has put me off playing
6562	I tried this with a keyboard and that was a big mistake. Takes for ever to load and when you got a race it's lag fever... If they had servers in my timezone then maybe it would be worth it.

6569	Expensive. I think it's better GTR2 businnes model.
6570	'Good' graphics, sounds amazing and had some good points about it here and there, but that's about it. It's a good racing simulation, with somewhat realistic effects and physics, but it's not top-notch like full retail games out there.   The catch here is it's being announced as a 'free to play' game, when obviously, it's not. You can download and test it for free, on one track, on one car, beyond that, you WILL have to pay for anything else, and i mean PAY it with your real money. I didn't even went to see how the currency on this is, all i can say is it's NOT worth it. Paying for EVERYTHING in (theorically) a free to play game is not ok.   You can't try the tracks, you can't try the cars, all you can do is PAY, and then PAY some more. It's not a F2P, it's a demo for a possibly good game, but the urge to try it fades fastly, when you have to be a 'wallet driver'.
6571	hard to hand vehicle, whats you to spend tons of cash for every thing in game
6572	Should be called 'Uninstall Simlulator 2015'
6573	this game is lame 
6574	Pay to win trash.
6575	sort out your game , keeps bloody crashing , beyond a joke now neo this and that
6576	This game created a new concept, Free to play-&gt; Pay to Play-&gt; Pay some more to be able to enjoy it -&gt; Pay some more again to win -&gt; skip all previous steps and delete game. Period.  This game could be great if the developers could figure out if they want to make a premium game or a free to play game. Choose one, it is not that hard.
6577	This game forces my computer to run using integrated graphics causing it to run terribly. And so many microtransactions making the game unplayable
6578	Everytime I try to launch the game on Windows 10 it crashes. Please fix.
6579	I have no idea why i downloaded this, first of all it did not even open, had to verify the cache and to redownload more 600MB, well at least it worked, first glance was meh, i mean the UI is outdated, and looks like few years old. What it is funny is it detected my xBox controller, and told me its xBox controller, name it, so i did, and i clicked on race with the mouse, and the practice begins, and i am like vrom vrom, and well, nothing happened :|, i clicked the settings to find my controller profile empty, even though the game knew it was xBox controller and asked me if it was a wheel or a gamepad or keyboard. . Forget it about the control, how on earth 17GB game does NOT have a tutorial, i mean mobile games have it :|, had to push the standard buttons to change the view or anything and i had to just open the control menu to look it up ' i changed to keyboard to save the time assigning everysingle button', and i was like oh yeah its working now, thats a good sign, i guess. . i started with the first car, the control is decent, but i have to say you have to accept the fact that NO ONE without wheel and KNOW how to play will even make a few turns, no assists what so ever, i dont mind because its simulator not NFS, but Project Cars sim too, and got assists too for new drivers. . I hated the first car, so i started to looking up for another car, and i found only 1 more car is avilable the rest is locked for real money, well at least let us try a BMW for a start then let us play with Fiat :D, i mean for real, if EVEN i want to buy those cars, with the horrible cars avilable for me to test, i will NOT EVER buy another car, no way in hell. . And about the graphics, its like old flat cars with some AA and the track and the surronding is old, VERY old with only motion blur and post proccessing to make it look better, the thing is the AA and the post made the cars not realistic at all, no details what so ever, GRID 2, Dirt 3, Project cars even NFS Rivals or freaking NFS hot pursiut looks better than these cars, its just sad, the oversized game makes me think of GTA, the horrible optimaization and compressing. . IF and only IF you are smart, you could EASILY say this is either demo and remove 15 GB or something and let everyone try it and make the full game with all the cars avilable, or freaking DLCs, not forcing me to download 14GB ish to try only 2 or 3 cars, with 3 tracks, i mean what have you been drinking, i think most of the negative reviews because we had to download 14GB just to TRY the game, and with a little to nothing of content. . I have no idea why some people saying this game is good, its decent for free game yes, but the financing is s**t, you act like you force us to give this game bad review, couldnt you use your brains and make test and see if ANYONE will like the concept of downloading 14GB of NOTHING ??? . I dont know if whoever download the game and liked did NOT saw or tried any other racing games, or have plazing download speed, cause it took like 2 days to download and i am really angry because i really for the first time WASTED my time even playing it.
6580	------------------------ Updated Review February 25, 2015 ------------------------ Well, I decided to spend a little more time on RaceRoom Racing Experience, and admittedly, it is a lot better than when I tried it last year. I've been able to complete single player AI racing on two tracks, and I can practice on three tracks. The selection of cars is a little better for being free, but still not enough to really keep you entertained.  I didn't try the online portion of this, partially because I'm pretty bad at this game (I'm more used to Forza and GT) and partially because most people playing online are using DLC that you need to purchase.  This game definitely has great physics, and I'll probably give it another shot using my G27 instead of my Xbox 360 controller. Unfortunately, I still can't recommend it. You can pay for a full game like pCARS or Assetto Corsa and receive a lot more content than RaceRoom can deliver in its DLC packs (from what I'm reading).  ------------------------ Old Review May 26, 2014 ------------------------ During the small amount of time I've had playing this, I honestly don't think this is a free-to-play game. Admittedly, this game feels and plays more like a demo than F2P.  Only being able to play hot-lap modes, with one track (a few variants of that one track, but still one location), and very few cars makes this game feel like a joke when advertised as free-to-play.  While the gameplay is decent enough, I feel that the control of the cars could be a little better. Using a G27, I feel as if I can't seem to turn sharp enough to get through some corners unless I slow down to rediculously slow speeds, and that's only using 200 degrees of the wheel. As a comparison, on Assetto Corsa I can pull decent turns during the curves, and that's using the full 900 degrees of the wheel.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this. For your simulation fix, I think you'd be better off currently purchasing Assetto Corsa.
6581	Every time I hit register it goes to micrasoft word for some reason and the link is not working. How can I fix that?
6582	You'll need money to play this game with pleasure(cars, maps,...)
6583	...
6584	Unimpressed with it so far. There just hasn't been enough done with this game to keep me interested at this point. After having SimBin games before this is really just the same feel with no multiplayer or career. We need racing sims to be complete upon release and not just time trials. They also need to have a racer vs AI single player career mode that moves you up through the ranks along side the multiplayer.   I had high hopes that by now more was don after seeing it a year ago. Just disappointed with it and looking forward to Project Cars to see what they do.
6585	DO NOT BUY there is no controler support even thos they claim there is cant remap any keys to do anything I can turn left and thats it I can sit there turning left cant move nothing took 4 days to even beable to load the game
6586	.
6587	this game would be great if it had mulitplayer.. or more then a single track and car to use. 90% of this game is micro transactions. everything costs money and even while i played with the only car you get for free on the only free track i still wasnt very impressed. the game is difficult to use and the menu screens are a wierd circle design which looked cool but made it very hard to read anything on the bottom because it was placed upside down. by the time you spent enough money to make this game worth playing yiu would have been able to get a much better racing simulator. if you want a racing game that wont break the bank i reccomend Race07 it is under 5 dollers on steam. its a much better value.
6588	This game really is a piece of crap, take too long to load, the steering wheel does not work, just one car and a track, I definitely do not recommend it.

6594	Free to play, except everything costs money.
6595	When I downloaded this game, I got an alert from AVAST! saying it had malware. Also, it won't boot because it says it needs steam to be running to play (which it is)
6596	could not figer out how to make my account :(
6597	Wow. Would you look at that, a game that would have been good, had they not done it like they did that garbage game NFS Shift. Its not a drifting game. The handling of the vehicles of this game are extremely horrible- at the best. Don't waste your time. I realize tires grip differently at high speed. But in real life, these kinds of cars designed to stick to the road WAAAAY more than they do in this game. Garbage, uninstalling it as well.
6598	Never recieved the activation email ... NEVAH!  10/10 would wait again
6599	laggy as hell to say the least on a high end gaming machine and not much content unless you PAY for everything in the game useless for extreme racing gamers but ok if your bored crapless
6600	This game is stupid dont have thurstmaster wheel setup... I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Italia and doesnt work. So this just sucks... dont waiste time downloading 16 gb of this crap...
6601	not that good of a game...
6602	Help  Games runs extremly laggy and slow, I been running on Full screen 1080P vsync on and off.  I7-4790K 2xR9 270X 4G  
6603	NO  IT IS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T
6604	Ok its graphics are good but as soon as I got in a race I coulden't move. So then I checked the controls and they were are broken. So I had to rebind everything and finally got to drive. As soon as I got started driving the steering SUCKED. So then finally I looked for other cars and I saw only a few free cars and they all have terrible steering.
6605	This game forces my computer to run using integrated graphics causing it to run terribly. And so many microtransactions making the game unplayable
6606	Just another free to play game that isnt free to play - you download a huge amount of data to race a few cars and even fewer tracks - Its not even a good sim (I never felt that RACE07 was a good sim, and this just has the same problems, multiplied). The cars have way too much grip and way too much oversteer - braking is always assisted and the cars are far too stable to feel like racing cars. Unless you have deep pockets, suck at racing sims, and want to feel like youre accomplishing something, just steer clear of this one (no pun intended).
6607	Graphics are nice, but driving mechanics sucks. This is a racing game... the driving mechanics should not suck, also the car sounds are not good, they should invest more on some better car sounds.
6608	I really want to like this one, but it is simply released to the public way too early. The graphics are okay, but the colors are weird, especially in terms of sky and lighting. I also experience graphics glitches like flickering shadows or polygons and the complete cockpit disappearing for a fraction of a second on some parts of the sweden hillclimb track. Soundwise, the game is relatively good. But I find some motor sounds extremely annoying and overdone. The physics are good enough for a sim, but the force feedback currently is just wrong. It doesn't reflect the movement on screen too well, which makes driving kinda confusing. The UI simply needs a huge overhaul. The overall feeling of product quality is pretty low, when you experience things like the whole menu freezing and having to kill two ingame browser processes to make it work again. The amount of free content is a joke, while the cars are okay, the two tracks aren't. Currently, the amount of available tracks to buy is too low, and important ones like the Nordschleife are missing. The pricing policy on the content overall is an impudence.  I know that it is work in progress, but it doesn't even feel like a solid beta to me. If you are looking for great PC sim racing, you'll get the best overall package with Race07 / Race Injection and its extensions. Lots of good content, good physics and force feedback, a finished and great product for a low amount of money. And if you are really into physics and graphics are not important to you, I recommend rFactor 2. It is still in development, which moves on pretty slowly in terms of content, but it has the most advanced physics simulation and very solid force feedback plus a great AI. If you want DTM, DTM Racedriver 3 will give you much more value than the DTM Experience addon for RaceRoom. And if you want the best multiplayer racing experience, well - people seem to love iRacing (but I haven't checked that out).
6609	Where to start....  For one, you only get 5 out of the 38 cars for free. The rest, you have to buy. Now, maybe this wouldn't be nearly as bad if you could actually choose the cars, but no. You're stuck with what they've already chosen, which means you could end up driving in a class of cars that you might not want two.  Secondly, ona similiar topic, you get 2 generic free tracks out of 14.  Third.I couldn't find a way to rebind keyboard controls. The handling system felt off as such. (I know this is supposed to be played with a wheel and pedals, but I've played plenty of sims without. rFactor 1 and 2, other SimBin titles, Assetto Corsa, etc.) The UI was pretty bad as well.
6610	Sorry, but no. The UI is all over the place--it is easy to tell that it was designed for a steering wheel, but why does the main menu look like a messy CS:GO buy menu?, the game's overall atmosphere, the levels and lack of sound effects (other than the exagerated car noises)--makes the game feel lonely and soulless--even the in-game messages feel robotic. and remind me of The Office when Dwight makes a birthday banner that simply reads, 'It is your birthday.', and finally the fact that any other car or track other than the one they give you is prompted with a overlay to purchase in-game funds make this game feel like a cash grab. Sad.
6611	cant even get the activation code in my eamail, they even have problems sending email to the users
6612	Holy crap only a few cars and only 1 track I believe. And mostly you buy stuff. Dont waste your time with this game
6613	The Graphics are horrid 
6614	Like â¥â¥â¥â¥.all must pay. but the sound in nice
6615	I.....I don't know where to begin. First it lags. I've got 4 GB RAM and it lags at the most important moments in the race. I tried everything. Game Booster, restarting the PC, everything. Second, the AI sucks. Those guys are crashing you and they're not even trying to avoid you. The game would be super cool if it wouldn't lag, that's for sure. AI is not a problem, just sometimes. So try you guys to solve the lag problem and maybe I will change my review about this game.
6616	DISCLAIMER: I DO reconmend this game if you are using a single screen setup.  I have been a huge fan of the SimBin PC games through the years, and R3E definitely has the feel that I like and a great roster of cars and tracks. I am not a fan of the pricing scheme they've got set up for it however... Also, if you have triple screens, don't even bother unless you want to play with distorted fish eye effect. They won't bother to add multi-view like every other decent sim. Maybe one day I'll be able to enjoy this game the way i'd like to.
6617	I downloaded this game with the hope that it would be a decent play. After dicking about registering with far too much information, I managed to navigate the horrific menu and get into game. I was then greeted with a lovely CTD, no problem, I'll check my drivers and try again. After several attempts and a bit of research I tried running in windowed mode, which worked! I finally get in game and then the real disappointment set in, the handling is terrible, the physics (what physics) are broken and it just doesn't feel right; you shouldn't have to pretty much switch the enging off to negotiate a slight bend in the road. Even using a controller, it appears that the controls are pretty much off or flat out, which brings me to my next point. This game just isn't optimised for controller use, seriously, controlling a cursor with a stick just shouldnt' even be considered by any devs any more.   Other people seem to be complaining about the content. I haven't had the patience to fully explore it yet, although I will keep it installed and give it another chance on another day.
6618	Physics are completely un-responsive, and the car's always feel like you are driving on slime and the car slides everywhere, thank you for creating a game where I can re-live the physics of racing games from the windows 95 area that whenever it rained on a track I would slip and side everywhere even when doing twenty miles an hour.
6619	Worst game in the world for racing , the steering is really bad you cant even drive the car. Dont bother !!!1
6620	good thing its free, your car slows down before turns even if you dont want it too, it nearly stops for no reason, also if you barely turn it completly spins you out
6621	this game is absolute crap ive had mobile games for free better than this
6622	welcome to warm butter on melting ice simulator! where, unless you have a million â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pounds to spend on racing simulator full experience controls, you 'drift' into every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing in the game. the controls for mouse and keyboard are so bad that i couldn't evenmove untill i changed the controls. even the control settings are â¥â¥â¥â¥, you have to double click what you want to change and then click one of the buttons it actually recognises: all mouse buttons excluded. good thing this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ is free, because if i had to spend Â£15 on this then i might have to accidentally slip and fall on to a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall of chainsaws multiple times. (dont question that) the graphics might be ok; i wouldn't know. because it takes a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing supercomputer to run decent graphics. if you have a super computer and/or full experience racing controls, then this game may be for you! if not, i advise you not to waste your time. TLDR: if you have a computer layout alike to normal humans, DONT. if you are a millionare with everything, on your own head be it.
6623	This game really is a piece of crap, take too long to load, the steering wheel does not work, just one car and a track, I definitely do not recommend it.
6624	Ok its graphics are good but as soon as I got in a race I coulden't move. So then I checked the controls and they were are broken. So I had to rebind everything and finally got to drive. As soon as I got started driving the steering SUCKED. So then finally I looked for other cars and I saw only a few free cars and they all have terrible steering.
6625	Everytime I try to launch the game on Windows 10 it crashes. Please fix.
6626	I have no idea why i downloaded this, first of all it did not even open, had to verify the cache and to redownload more 600MB, well at least it worked, first glance was meh, i mean the UI is outdated, and looks like few years old. What it is funny is it detected my xBox controller, and told me its xBox controller, name it, so i did, and i clicked on race with the mouse, and the practice begins, and i am like vrom vrom, and well, nothing happened :|, i clicked the settings to find my controller profile empty, even though the game knew it was xBox controller and asked me if it was a wheel or a gamepad or keyboard. . Forget it about the control, how on earth 17GB game does NOT have a tutorial, i mean mobile games have it :|, had to push the standard buttons to change the view or anything and i had to just open the control menu to look it up ' i changed to keyboard to save the time assigning everysingle button', and i was like oh yeah its working now, thats a good sign, i guess. . i started with the first car, the control is decent, but i have to say you have to accept the fact that NO ONE without wheel and KNOW how to play will even make a few turns, no assists what so ever, i dont mind because its simulator not NFS, but Project Cars sim too, and got assists too for new drivers. . I hated the first car, so i started to looking up for another car, and i found only 1 more car is avilable the rest is locked for real money, well at least let us try a BMW for a start then let us play with Fiat :D, i mean for real, if EVEN i want to buy those cars, with the horrible cars avilable for me to test, i will NOT EVER buy another car, no way in hell. . And about the graphics, its like old flat cars with some AA and the track and the surronding is old, VERY old with only motion blur and post proccessing to make it look better, the thing is the AA and the post made the cars not realistic at all, no details what so ever, GRID 2, Dirt 3, Project cars even NFS Rivals or freaking NFS hot pursiut looks better than these cars, its just sad, the oversized game makes me think of GTA, the horrible optimaization and compressing. . IF and only IF you are smart, you could EASILY say this is either demo and remove 15 GB or something and let everyone try it and make the full game with all the cars avilable, or freaking DLCs, not forcing me to download 14GB ish to try only 2 or 3 cars, with 3 tracks, i mean what have you been drinking, i think most of the negative reviews because we had to download 14GB just to TRY the game, and with a little to nothing of content. . I have no idea why some people saying this game is good, its decent for free game yes, but the financing is s**t, you act like you force us to give this game bad review, couldnt you use your brains and make test and see if ANYONE will like the concept of downloading 14GB of NOTHING ??? . I dont know if whoever download the game and liked did NOT saw or tried any other racing games, or have plazing download speed, cause it took like 2 days to download and i am really angry because i really for the first time WASTED my time even playing it.
6627	sort out your game , keeps bloody crashing , beyond a joke now neo this and that
6628	This game created a new concept, Free to play-&gt; Pay to Play-&gt; Pay some more to be able to enjoy it -&gt; Pay some more again to win -&gt; skip all previous steps and delete game. Period.  This game could be great if the developers could figure out if they want to make a premium game or a free to play game. Choose one, it is not that hard.
6629	Sorry, but no. The UI is all over the place--it is easy to tell that it was designed for a steering wheel, but why does the main menu look like a messy CS:GO buy menu?, the game's overall atmosphere, the levels and lack of sound effects (other than the exagerated car noises)--makes the game feel lonely and soulless--even the in-game messages feel robotic. and remind me of The Office when Dwight makes a birthday banner that simply reads, 'It is your birthday.', and finally the fact that any other car or track other than the one they give you is prompted with a overlay to purchase in-game funds make this game feel like a cash grab.

6637	controls are terrible and its realy hard to figure out what to do
6638	Couldn't even play the game  'can't launch RRRE_legacy.exe'
6639	The game isnt very good, the steering wheel only does a 90 degree turn and as a result the steering is to twitchy. Also the cars are really expensive and if you want a different skin you have to buy them. I would rather save up and buy Assetto Corsa(which is what I have done)off Steam, it is much better and the cars are free.
6640	Its P2W, i dont recomend
6641	Worst game in the world for racing , the steering is really bad you cant even drive the car. Dont bother !!!1

6648	not that good of a game...
6649	Help  Games runs extremly laggy and slow, I been running on Full screen 1080P vsync on and off.  I7-4790K 2xR9 270X 4G  
6650	NO  IT IS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T
6651	Never more. 10Gb for 3 cars and 2 tracks wtf ? and the hardling .... cars looks like from paper
6652	The controls are horrible. Its too hard to enjoy from the start.
6653	I should apologize to my past self for downloading this.
6654	You have to pay for EVERYTHING... like only 4 cars are avalible to you for free but EVERYTHING IS LOCKED, MAPS, CARS, EVERYTHING IS PAY. I really wish that there was a way of actualy controling the car as well. Everything is waaay to touchy. And you will spin out every time. Also I really wish that you could earn cars or maps without paying, EARN! Anyways thats pretty much what I have to say about this game.
6655	It would be nice if you can play and not stuck in a loading screen.
6656	The graphic's suck and the game play is terrible i dont recommend this.
6657	Subpar racing sim
6658	this game has great potential, but the physics make no sense, i dont touch the steering at all and i start swerving left and right, i turn a little bit to the right and i spin out at 20 mph. there is NO WAY to control your car, and the fact that almost all the car models are locked and you have to buy them is kinda dumb.
6659	More like Racingroom paying experience!
6660	how do you like dem microtransactions?!
6661	Don't bother unless you have money to spend on tracks and cars
6662	Don't bother unless you have money to spend on tracks and cars
6663	One word for you.. â¥â¥â¥â¥
6664	This Game Have Good Graphic And Track But, Suck Gameplay  Not Recommended
6665	Feels too easy to drive compared to other sims I've tried. It's like some kind of traction help was on all the time even on the most realistic settings.
6666	i counlldnt even go to the game all it was shown was the withe screen with cars
6667	Omg This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥!
6668	So dissapointed! I try to disable auto clutch and it doesn't work... Where is my freedom! I literally have no control over the braking at corners and it is extremely annoying!
6669	It's a good game and all, but the startup GUI is nasty and everything is a HUGE learning curve and if you want a Forza game on the PC for free, this works, I guess...
6670	It would be really nice if the game, you know, came with all of the content. It would be even better if it didn't crash whenever you try to start a race. But other than the fact that it is basically unplayable, I'm sure it would be a fun game. Sorry, but it's a no from me.

6673	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
6674	Arcade racing, pay to win, terrible interface
6675	Headache, don't do it!
6676	Looked OK, but ran like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my machine -- no idea why.
6677	horrible

6682	Aweful Game! Soooo Deleted!
6683	dont download it
6684	horrible
6685	poor controls and an overal suckey gameing experience
6686	It's the worst game i've ever played ,it crashes al the time few seconds in the game *boof* crash every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time
6687	The only thing free about this game is the screen glitching. you cant even tune the one car they give you to drive
6688	If you want to drive a car around a track then this game is for you.  If you however want a multiplayer racing game, with good physics, good interface and overall a good experience that's worth the space it takes in storage. Don't get this game.  Recommended for: People who have enough money to spend on virtual cars in a 'free to play' game, instead of an actual game that's worth how much you payed for it.
6689	look if you wanna get this game might as well get the 50 dollar 1 its way better and cheaper
6690	just like I RACING GOT TO buy tracks and cars not good. This will cost hundreds of dollars, it's only a game , not a living!
6691	Why does this game needs my origin country and my birth date?
6692	This is one of the worst racing games I ever played! I believe that the physics are really bad and the graphics. I had delted the game after a certain amount of time. The only good thing is that it's free!
6693	Awful game. took ages to download and graphics are disgraceful. Made to much of a big deal out of it
6694	Bad game fps is pretty bad and i dont like how there are only a few cars to use in the game 
6695	Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game. Let me also say I am not opposed to paying for good quality games. That being said I am a HUGE Iracing fan, which is hands down the best race sim ever made. Iracing is also expensive as each car and each track costs money and it's a subscription service. The differenece here is they are up frnot about what you will need to pay, this game is microtransaction hell. It's very confusing and when you do figure it out your looking at hundreds of dollars. So right there I lost interest, and I didn't even get to the bad joke they call realistic physics. Anyone that thinks this game is realistic has never actually driven a car on a track. If you can play the game with a mouse and keyboard it is not realistic. There is no way you could control a car with a mouse at freeway speeds let alone in a race.
6696	It was good previously un recently it keeps on crashed, crashed &amp; crashed. Can't even play. And every little things need to pay, pay and pay.
6697	I cant turn only a little bit but i always crash
6698	I cannot get it work :( I know I'm on windows 10 but COME ON!
6699	Don`t even try!
6700	10/10 would be a terrible driver again.
6701	didn't get confirmation link i wasted my 414 gb on this piece of crap
6702	Plz. Whai cars monie n sutf. just nu. i beg yall DONT! and i means dunt get it  0/10 got diabetus from racing
6703	Cannot Even drive in it no wasd its arrows no controllers allowed can't even configure the keys
6704	It's good but TOO PAY TO WIN!!!!!!!!!!
6705	Downloaded game excited to try it out and nothing....locks up every time and can't get past loading screen. Running 980ti's in SLI and supposedly it's an SLI/xfire issue. Fix your sheet people!
6706	free2play? pah only if you want rubbish cars and limited tracks, want anything good? then you have to pay 
6707	Don't be fooled by the false advertising, this is not a free to play title. What you download is actually more of a demo, as the game is filled with microtransactions. Too bad, because the game is actually pretty good but ruined with bad pricing model.  I would be more than happy if I could actually buy the game instead of being milked with microtransactions. Don't waste your bandwidth.  You are better of waiting for something like Project cars or Assetto corsa.
6708	it is a good base game ruined by expensive microtransactions and no multiplayer still. the cars handle good , graphics are good, performance is good , sounds are good. works on g25 and i suppose on all popular wheels. at the time of this review with no multiplayer and the expensive microtransactions that will have you paying WAY over $60 for a few tracks and cars, i cannot recommend it.
6709	Claims to be free, but has locked DLC content.
6710	This game is not a driving simulator, so you can buy it if you don't like simulators. If you drive in RaceRoom, you drive cars without grip, as if there was soap on tracks.
6711	this game cant go race. it just can go time attack
6712	The game feels very cheap, I couldn't change from controller back to keyboard and the controls in general are poorly chosen. Also there are limited FREE cars most you have to pay for.
6713	Doesn't Work good on my AlienWere Gaming Laptop and my laptop runs very good
6714	bad game dont get it beacause the singleplayer stinks dont spand money on this stupid game
6715	This is the most expensive 'free to play' game I ever wasted my time downloading. Nice job. Don't spend all that money you're earning in one place. I'll take my business elsewhere.  
6716	After a a 10 minute registration and the 2hour download I got into the game where there was no FOV so i felt like I was playing through a 2x microscope and to be able to control your car is impossible in itself. There is no videos settings either. I GIVE THIS A 0.25/100. NOT RECCOMENDED!
6717	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crap I would not recommend this game 0/10 sounds is poor and controls are usless if it were on CD/DVD I would use the disc as a coster.
6718	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
6719	IT WONT LAUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6720	extremly hard to controll without controller i did not use a controller but with mouse and keyboard its impossible
6721	make the graphics like the videos or dont make a video for it at all you â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
6722	Dont get it waste of time and it ask for info they should not need to know even if you fill it out they say they'll send you a code but you'll never get it
6723	10/10 Would delete again.
6724	The free version of the game has only 2 or 3 cars and only 2 tracks and I had to download 10GB for that! The game is very nice but you have to pay to have more cars and tracks.
6725	Garbage Physics. Not free to play if you actually want any content whatsoever. You start with 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cars and 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tracks. Move along...
6726	Not a good game atm. Controls are too clunky, making it difficult to drive.
6727	cant connect to server error 503 it sucks men 
6728	Free to Play in the sense that they give you a track and a car. Really more like a demo, then a real f2p. Cash Grab.
6729	Total rip off. you must pay for every single car and track, an still there is not much content, and you only can race alone on the track. the graphics are not up to date.. and the feeling of the cars is not so much realistic, rFactor 1 is still better than this. or BETTER look at ASSETTO CORSA !!! 
6730	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
6731	Can't control a car on a decent way. Bad sound. 10 min playing and now i deleting it.
6732	Removed due to a 5.8GB update.
6733	for an F2P: only hot laps, no racing, only 3 cars, game seems to be running on Race 07's engine, and driving feels too slidy 0/5 stars
6734	Can Not do anything. do not download it
6735	Possibly the worst game I've ever played. It runs fine on my PC, but the game is just terrible. If you accelarate too quickly it waill spinout. If you go off-course, 'invalid lap' shows and you have to restart. The controls that you start off with are not like the normal WSAD. Instead, its the arrow keys. I have no idea how this is 8GB on my HDD so I would just wait for the Devs to fix everything wrong, then I would download this game.
6736	This game told me it was going to take 3 hours max to download. It took 10. Don't download this even though it is free as every time one wheel touches the corner it makes the lap invalid. Remember guys, free is not always good
6737	contrlling sucks,  hard to get around as a newbie expensive, unlike another game here that is free2play but awesome this doesn't give you anything 'free'  graphics suck did i mention controlling sucks? no, just nooo
6738	Worst game i have ever played.. Totoal waist
6739	I CANT EVEN PLAY THE GAME!? This game was.....OK when I got it before about the time it came out. But I now got it back and it gives me an error when I try to play the game. So I dont know why but from what I hear now, I dont even want it.
6740	i can't play the game
6741	aful game i play on the side and can't even see nothing and plus my racing wheel is turning to sides fix it fast
6742	new update : AI runs perfectly, but the whole'watch as the engine struggles to lay down power'? whats that about?, when using a keyboard it becomes very horrible to pull away at low speeds, the engine should struggle yes. but not to an extent of making the entire car shake that much
6743	its not really a free to play game cause u have to buy the cars with really cash its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
6744	Well after all that time downloading I can't even play because of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controller detection.
6745	If I were to recommend this is game My Recommendation would be don't get this get track-mania this game is boring boring boring and the keys are oversensitive
6746	think this game is awful not surprised its free :( do not recommend at all mainly because you cant friggin turn even when configured :( never been so frustrated with a racing game :(
6747	Well I thought Origin asked too much (aka EA) when it comes to their microstransactions for all their games. While the client for the game might be free for Raceroom. The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely. Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class. Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are. If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track. Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.   Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.  So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price. The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile. They do include several tracks in the package. So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release. But you can clearly see they state 'Open Beta' as of April 10, 2014.
6748	Hard to control, and spams your email...

6750	race 07 and its addons are 10 million times better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥....get the race 07 and all dlc, 30â¬ or just get rfactor..avoid this game at all costs
6751	Slow response time for vehicles. Poor organization. Very user UN-friendly. Uninstalled.
6752	Nice Demo...when does the full game come out?
6753	I probably had the less fun playing this game than any other racing game to date.   I booted up the game and ended up waiting about 7 hours for the confirmation email to come so that I could activate my account and actually log into the game. This is the reason for my 8 hours of play time while I left the game minimized while waiting for the email to come.   I was finally able to log in and was bombarded with the cluster-**** of a menu. There didn't seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu was set up and the not-so-large amount of content was masked behind a seemingly endless menu, which was all locked behind a paywall anyway.   Once I got into what seemed to be the only track available to me, in what seemed to be the only car available to me, it took me a while to get used to not using a racing line in a game. After ten laps or so I was finally able to race around the track decently quick but was conitinuing to be annoyed by the way the game played.   The physics seemed decent enough, but as far as being any fun.. it felt completely stale and uninteresting to me. The only track available for free didn't appeal to me at all and I didn't care too much for the car either. I was using a controller to race and the game still just felt really rigid, stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more laps I decided that I was done with it.   The final product just felt to me.. well.. free. They put a lot of focus on making the game seem quite real. The game definitely has a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through, but I wasn't going to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just left me bored.  It kinda feels like a free version of Gran Turismo. Except.. not fun.. or good... From head to toe, it's just absolutely not visceral or exciting in the slightest.
6754	this game is a dishonor to race07.
6755	SO HARD TO CONTROL! DON'T EVEN PLAY IT ANYMORE!!!!
6756	This game sucks I tryed to start a race several times, but it never started. So after 5 minutes I uninstalled the game.
6757	Games Alright for a eacing game and it does have some free cars. Thats the good.  The bad is the menu system is garbage. The servers are hard to join and the races are laggy. The multiplayer is dead. good game, dumb design.  Better off buying a game that you can host your own servers, or atleast have local servers running.
6758	wont even let me login to their servers, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, LAME AS HELL
6759	just like I RACING GOT TO buy tracks and cars not good. This will cost hundreds of dollars, it's only a game , not a living!
6760	Why does this game needs my origin country and my birth date?
6761	This is one of the worst racing games I ever played! I believe that the physics are really bad and the graphics. I had delted the game after a certain amount of time. The only good thing is that it's free!
6762	Pros: -great sounds -great simulation feeling -cool camera tossing, depending on driving surface  Cons: -not Free2play! The content is on a Demo level. You can not unlock any content for free. -you have to buy every single piece of content...  -no multiplayer yet  Comment: Purchaching all tracks will cost you about 40eur and all cars will cost you about 15eur, at this given time. Graphics are not impressive, but they are still decent.  If you want to try out all the cars and tracks, this game will not exacly be a fair deal. In that case you are probably better of with another simulation racing game.
6763	Mighta been a good game I will never know, wouldn't respond to the contoller keyboard or mouse all which work on every other game I have. Read other reviews before diving in on this one.
6764	Feels a lot like a demo, only two tracks in free2play, no multiplayer modes and even the simulation mode has to be paid for. If you search for a satisfying racing sim, I recommend GTR Evolution.
6765	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
6766	I was having a problem with closing the game..
6767	I have played this for over a week now &amp; can say that I like the driving feel on the circuits especially in keep it real mode (or whatever its called) Once you get the steering settings right its real good. Hillclimb mode however is basically crap. It simulates way to much speed &amp; doesnt feel real at all. Graphics are smooth &amp; look great, the sounds are top notch right down to the gear change exhaust pops to the race brake squeels. The dissapointment hits when you find you have 1 circuit &amp; a handfull of cars to play &amp; everything else costs. The online challenges from what I can see mainly revolve around the DTM Experience DLC which you have to pay for (think its 34.99US) When you consider the latest Grid Autosport is $49.99US on steam &amp; offers a widened track, car &amp; game mode variety including multiplayer, I think maybe a better option.  That said, I am yet to play Grid Autosport and am basing my thoughts on heresay.  In all, Race room is refined in circuit mode but lacks depth without putting your hand in your pockets.

6781	THIS GAME IS UTTER â¥â¥â¥â¥! Steering is Awful, Also need to buy tokens just to play the game... which you have to buy, so it's not truely free-to-play. Rubbish, i dont even like the graphics what so ever. Do not get this game!
6782	I hate it its stupid
6783	Terrible game, poor control, full of bugs. Support team is even worse, spent months dealing with them on one single issue. Still blown away at how insane the situation played out.
6784	I wouldn't waste the time to download this game, the controls are very sluggish, and this game is screaming pay to win in the future. To top it off this game though free to play only has a couple of singleplayer modes without ai, or other people. To get access to anything in the game you better have deep pockets because almost everything is considered dlc and you cant use it unless you pay real $. Also the ui's and menus feel very clunky and somewhat overly complex. Hopefully the dev's will fix some of these issues,but for right now i wouldnt waste the time. 3/10
6785	Although this game has rather excellent graphics, a simple menu and control board, it lacks explanation. Upon downloading and playing the game, I understood the controls and my objectives. However, upon completing the practice course under the guidelines I was given, I was lost as to what to do next. I tried pretty much every button and tab and either it said it was locked or I must purchase it. Another problem was that, for such a free game, there was so much and too much to purchase. They should have just made it for purchase instead of making it free and making and infinite amount of content purchasble. I was disappointed.
6786	Waste of time, don't buy
6787	Good game, not bad that you can initially get it for free, but it has a classic part that you really need to buy the pack to make the game worth it, far too much is not available in the free part. Gameplay is not quite as I expected and I feel that GT Legends by simbin and even GTR Evolution played much better, this has a real arcade feel not simulation.   All in all, not bad for a bash but certainly wont buy the pack to unlock everything.
6788	crap free to play model
6789	Massive issues just getting registered, makes you fill out a form and is meant to return a email to you and doesn't , then on the site in the choice to resend acctivation email it asks for home address phone number blood type , ok so I made the blood type part up , but why all these personal details are required I don't know.  been round and round trying to fix this , including following the link in steam from simbin and still nothing.  So I can't review it only my attempts to get the game working, which is not happening.
6790	The most fake racing simulator i played....
6791	Simly doesn't work right.  Started the game and added my controler, it detected it well, but made me map everything myself. Using a Xbox One controller which works fine on everything else.  So of course some things can't be mapped correctly, and when I try to race, it doesnt let me use the controller for a few seconds so I often start crashed into a wall, then the controlling is terriable.
6792	I am having too many game issues to give it a 'thumbs up' recommendation. For the moment I must vote 'thumbs down.' If the game and business model improves I will revisit my recommendation. imho,ymmv : )  edit updated 10/15/2015 after ~7 additional months... This game is still in beta after 30 months from release date of February 2013!!   I am currently run the ADC pack, DTM 2014 pack and WTCC 2014 pack in RaceRoom beta.  Many improvements have been made in the past few months. However, I still cannot give it a 'thumbs up' recommendation at this time.  On the positive side the FWD cars in the WTCC 2014 pack are simply lovely to drive. Good handling and excellent FFB make for a plenty of enjoyment taking these cars around any track. The awful GUI is gone!    Items that need to be addressed by Sector3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI is decent and quite clean by having good player detection coding.  AI aggressiveness needs to be added to game.  AI are 'on the rails' when it comes to collisions - your car is not on the rails so if there is a collision between you and AI then you will likely spin out and the AI will continue running. AI needs more options and settings to make them more realistic and less automated.  Business model - Having items and picks split between S3 store and STEAM is simply awful. S3 needs to have all of the items available for sale grouped together. S3 needs to dump the VRP and only list currency.  S3 servers - Having two sets of authentication (steam and S3 servers) is redundant and causes more issues for end user. S3, dump your servers so players can still play RRRE if your servers are down, steam is down, or if players internet is down.  There appears to be no option to calibrate wheels and pedals in game. My gear was recognized and works well. However, I want to calibrate my pedals (set a small deadzone at start and set the travel of when I hit 100% of throttle or brake) and the game will not allow the user to do it. S3 needs to add in a calibration function like the one used in iracing or rf2.   Overall, it appears to me as if S3 has been working on building out the available cars and tracks and only recently are starting to focus on adding in features and updating features already in the game.  Ouch! As of today the game only has a 53% approval rating! : (
6793	you must pay to do most things 
6794	This game looked like fun, so I downloaded it. WORST GAME EVER! I have a few problems with this game. #1 I have a decent computer and can run racing games at about medium visual settings. This game i had to lower it to lowest settings and it still lagged a lot. #2 I use a x-box 360 controller with most of my games. this game it kept saying that my joystick was pulling left. I checked it with my x-box and it was fine. I tried with a keyboard but bad control and lag made it super bad for racing. #3 When I wanted to stop this highway to hell , it wouldn't let me. I tried for 15 minutes to get out of the game and it would just do nothing. Its like they don't want you to quit this POS. All together I would give this game a -2.5 out of 10.
6795	alright so i figured i'll gave this raceing game a try and i will say it first the game has good decent graphic if you have to good high end or mid rage pc with a quad care and a @ GB or higher GPU with 8 GB Ram sticks but this is a raceing sim and i like some raceing sim games but this one imo is terrablie first let me say i dont own any kind of racing wheel for pc or consoles ok and secondly i ws useing keyborad but all man i feel bad for the bad driveing physic that are in this game and i will these driveing meancanes are worst then anot other racing sim i have played ever if your a big racing sim and have a racing wheel then i would strongly suggest this game but if you did not own a racing wheel of any kind Don't play this game and by th eway this not a free-to-play neither it's a pay to play like most Free-To-play games out there and to the Developers and pubishs if this game I'm sorry but you guys could of then a Much Better job on this game serious like i sand before i have played better racing sims then this game
6796	I CANT EVEN PLAY THE GAME!? This game was.....OK when I got it before about the time it came out. But I now got it back and it gives me an error when I try to play the game. So I dont know why but from what I hear now, I dont even want it.
6797	i can't play the game
6798	This game is horrible
6799	Its a free game, obviously, and you can always tell it free. I don't recommend this game at all because everytime I try to log in, there is an error saying 'No Server Connection'. I have full internet connection and i can connect to anything else but this. So far, this game is not impressing!!
6800	decent game but not for my taste... 4/10
6801	Wow, that was a bad experience. The interface is confusing, the race modes are all locked unless you pay for them, and the controls are the worst I've ever seen. I've raced before, in real life, and it is nothing like this. This one needs an overhaul.
6802	8 GB for 1 race track is more than a little too much,. i'm guessing all the DLC is included from the start off. It's a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent - and it has external wheel and pedal support at least.   It's not bad. But hardly great either. I just have it installed because I don't have any other games that support the wheel. In order for this to really be worth recommending, it'd need a few more tracks, and MUCH cheaper car/extra track unlocks.  There's some bugs where you drive through obstacles, and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap - you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets,.. it's a bit frustrating.
6803	how to use wheel???? 
6804	NOT GOOD. Incredible bad steering (with a wheel). It's free but... just not my cup of coffee.
6805	The game was fun, but it ask too much for a computer, even a good one. The control are ok, but it having too much options and it pretty hard to memorize 30+ commands here, if you don't have a racing wheel for your computer, you're going to taste the wall all the time. It could be fun to see a gameplay that is keyboard friendly here, because the game seem to force you to buy a racing wheel.   The graphics are great, the 3D models of the cars are amazing, and a lots of polygon are on them, but since they have a huge numbers of polygon, like I said before, even a good computer will suffer from video lagging. Frequent framerate drop also happen a lot(even during the loading screen)! Also, I feel a lot of time that the game look unfinished...  Another thing here is the loading time, you will have so much time to cook a dinner since it took so much time to load!!!!  The sound is ok, but I don't feel like I'm sitting in a racecar(I have a subwoofer, still, the sound have no bass sound). The motor sound flat, and not like a 'ROAR'!!!!  The main menu isn't friendly at all, since with the new update, I got much more trouble to start a race than before, oh, and the stuff that need to be bought, like cars and tracks are not identified correctly...  Another thing that not cool is to play online, you need to buy the DTM experience pack, isn't the game supposed to be free???  I do not recommend this game for gamers that never played racing simulator before, but give it a try, maybe you will like it, maybe not.  I prefer other racing simulator like Gran Turismo or Live For Speed(and LFS is keyboard friendly), but Raceroom Racing Experience is not a game, it a demo with extremely limited content if you don't buy the DTM experience... Search farther on Steam for a good racing simulator, but don't spend any money on this...
6806	I CAN'T EVEN GET ON, IT SAID THAT IT SENT AN EMAIL WHEN I TRIED TO REGISTER, WHEN I CHECKED MY EMAIL 5 MINUTES LATER THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS GAME AND NOW I CAN'T REGISTER AGAIN BECAUSE I ALREADY USED MY EMAIL! I'M ENRAGED
6807	good graphic, good physix, nice driving but no real multiplayer and really to expensive.
6808	Mother of Pay2Play even NFS World is better than this
6809	very glitchy game. not a real experience and as a car enthusiast i did not enjoy how the cars felt whilst driving. Sorry guys but i think you can do better.
6810	This game should be removed from Free to play games section because it's not free. It really belongs to demos section. That's what this game is all about. It limits you to few cars / tracks, and if you wan't more you'll have to spend fortune.
6811	Dont get it waste of time and it ask for info they should not need to know even if you fill it out they say they'll send you a code but you'll never get it
6812	10/10 Would delete again.
6813	The free version of the game has only 2 or 3 cars and only 2 tracks and I had to download 10GB for that! The game is very nice but you have to pay to have more cars and tracks.
6814	good graphic, good physix, nice driving but no real multiplayer and really to expensive.
6815	Mother of Pay2Play even NFS World is better than this
6816	very glitchy game. not a real experience and as a car enthusiast i did not enjoy how the cars felt whilst driving. Sorry guys but i think you can do better.
6817	This game should be removed from Free to play games section because it's not free. It really belongs to demos section. That's what this game is all about. It limits you to few cars / tracks, and if you wan't more you'll have to spend fortune.
6818	Dont get it waste of time and it ask for info they should not need to know even if you fill it out they say they'll send you a code but you'll never get it
6819	The free version of the game has only 2 or 3 cars and only 2 tracks and I had to download 10GB for that! The game is very nice but you have to pay to have more cars and tracks.
6820	Garbage Physics. Not free to play if you actually want any content whatsoever. You start with 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cars and 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tracks. Move along...
6821	Not a good game atm. Controls are too clunky, making it difficult to drive.
6822	I dont like this game at all i would try to like it if i could even play it. i registered and it would not let me confirm my email. dont waste your time with this game.
6823	5/10 feels like a hovercraft simulator
6824	Dont play it. never)))
6825	This game is terrible do not waste your time on it! i tried to select several different tracks and every time i got done with the loading screen it always took me back to the same ONE track i played 5 times, If you want a racing Experience pickup GT4 or Forza4 or Shift 2. Thisis just awful, the controls dont feel that responsive as they should be. Avoid this.
6826	Single player game, I have to wonder why the developers took time to create this game. Takes forever to load and unload. The game control is OK but the single player is worthless. I was hoping for much more when I instlled RaceRoom but didn't get it. If it ever becomes a multi-player game I'll take a second look although now I can not tell anyone to bother with it.
6827	After initially being very impressed by this game, after slow and stale development is has slowly lost its charm and now is left in other racing sims dust.   SimBin are now masters of empty promises, maybes and excuses. Stay away from this game.
6828	Although I don't play many driving games, those that I do play provide an interface that allows you to drive the cars.  This game's controls are so hyper that I could do nothing but smash from side to side on the track.
6829	I can't turn good, every car has hard turning, I was expecting turning that would turn easier and make a turn at 45-89 MPH.
6830	this game has a good foundation but it's steering is actually unmanagable. This is someone to work on before it becomes a recommendable game.
6831	Black screen at launch.
6832	Good looking cars,.... nice tracks  but no good if only single player
6833	Waste of free space.
6834	SHIIIIIIIIIITY game have to BUY tracks and cars
6835	Nope, too buggy, too lousy force feedback, too much of a cash grab.    I'll check back in another year.
6836	Give us GTR 3 and cut the c**p plz
6837	This Is So Hard To Steer I don't Get it? DONT GET IT! Just Don't Its So Hard To Steer And Don't Waste Ur Money On The Cars And Tracks Just Don't Get It! I give it A Bad Review -CreeperHunter913
6838	I found the game lacking excitement. The steering was non responsive. Not like the racing games I'm use to.
6839	Very few tracks to start, steep learning curve with very little instruction. Graphics aren't that impressive, and it's an interesting model... HOWEVER, The killer to this game, which I paid for, is that 98% of the game is 'Pay to play.'  The servers are slow, the microtransactions are ridiculous, and you can't even play without an account. I'm sorry I wasted my time. I hear the studio is shutting down, and if this is how they choose to conduct their business, then I'm happy to hear that. Shame everyone there is out of a job, but at the same time, we can't stand for this model on Steam.  It's prevolent on Mobile platforms, and it shoud NOT weasel its way on here. Good riddance. I'll not be playing any more.  Not with SO MANY better racing games out there.
6840	Just get Race 07, this game is riddled with microtransactions and it uses the same engine anyway.
6841	Good looking cars,.... nice tracks  but no good if only single player
6842	Waste of free space.
6843	SHIIIIIIIIIITY game have to BUY tracks and cars
6844	Nope, too buggy, too lousy force feedback, too much of a cash grab.    I'll check back in another year.
6845	Give us GTR 3 and cut the c**p plz

6849	NOT GOOD. Incredible bad steering (with a wheel). It's free but... just not my cup of coffee.
6850	Terrible handling, Terrible community, Terrible controls. All in All, the worst racing game I've ever played.
6851	Does not support my Logitech rumblepad..
6852	Graphics are overall pretty good, Sounds are great. But my main problem with the game is that the handling is not very good and could use some work, and there is some variety of cars but not a lot.
6853	This seemed like a brilliant game, supported my controller which was good and the menus was easy to navigate. Was really impressed until i started a race. then it was disapointment after disapointment. conering is terrible no matter what car what speed or how much you brake, beleive i restarted over 20 times and tried different drive lines and break points and just about managed half a lap before i gave up. Whatever you do do not even traid paint with another car because they will just spin across the front of you and stop you dead as it glues sideways across your front bumper or make you go crazy off the track and head on into a wall.  If your looking to download this id save your time and patience for something that deserves it as this definetly does not. It says something when i have over 17 games on my pc and this is the only one that has pushed me to write a review as its that bad!!!
6854	I cant seem to get my steering wheel to perform with this game, it always over steers no matter what setting i have, my wheel works perfectly with need for speed games. would not recomend.
6855	Go buy Race 07 / Race Injection instead, a lot more â¥â¥â¥â¥ to offer than this.
6856	Deleted it after 10 minutes. Huge dead steering spot on my 360 controller. Broken images in the menus. GTA V driving is more fun.
6857	Overall it is not a bad game, however it is way too expensive for what is actually offer:  Pros: - One of the best car sounds in games. - Decent realism - Evolving - A lot of options.  Cons: - Price for tracks. - Price for cars. - Price... - DirectX 9 graphics... needs engine overhoul. - Somehow i never found a good 'handling' option for me with my G27 even if i top the charts in times. - Bad forcefeed back - Price.
6858	It was good previously un recently it keeps on crashed, crashed &amp; crashed. Can't even play. And every little things need to pay, pay and pay.
6859	This game is like a celebrations chocolate tin  Looks nice on the outside but has a sewing kit inside. What I dont understand how this game mechanic (microtransaction, menu and general ai) is WORST than Simraceway which is just about dead.... (captain Picard Facepalm)
6860	Its a good thing that its free to play, because i wouldnt want you wasting 10+ dollars on this game.
6861	Terrible handling, Terrible community, Terrible controls. All in All, the worst racing game I've ever played.
6862	Waste of time, please don't get this game. So many bugs! No wonder its free!
6863	Only 1 car for free ==' I font think players will have to pay too many money on buying paintjobs
6864	its says i am missing files idk ive looked every where to fix it but its no working for me so can someone help me i mis dll files ?
6865	if you are looking for a casual racing games not to bothered about building up your car collection get it but if you want to build your car collection don't play this because for all cars you want from the shop you have to pay and they should just make you pay for the game and then you pay for cars with in game credits
6866	4.2 Hours of accidental afk, Woops!
6867	4.2 Hours of accidental afk, Woops!
6868	Long story short, this game sucks.
6869	I was not impressed. The graphics aren't that bad, but the controlling of the cars is not very easy. The sound is not bad, but it could be better. Plus, half of the game includes buying the cars. Half of them aren't even free. Don't waste your time and money on this. Hope to see better improvements in the future!
6870	Hey, uninstalling works!
6871	It's Saturday night, and I can't run a single player race on an existing installation because of some undisclosed server error. This business model sucks.
6872	I attemped 2 races and both times I failed because of the controls. It is all left or all right, full throttle or none at all. Might have better luck with a pc compatable controller.
6873	Bad physics and limited options. Doesn't feel like you're doing half of the driving
6874	Ok so now i have played this game for a solid 3 hours and i am going to tell you guys the +ve's and the -ve's  +ve The sound is absolutely fantastic. You can hear exactly what a racing driver would hear in cockpit and as you go to the outside camera angle the car engine sounds different which is amazing. The handling model is pretty nice with great force feedback. The traction is realistic as well, you got to be patient with the accelerator All cars are really fun to drive and each car seemed to have its own characteristic which was fantastic to see in a game which is free.  -ve I have a XBox 360 controller and it seems like this game hates controllers. When i was coming into a hairpin i press the brake button but the car didn't stop and went straight on. I know where my brake button is. I use the same button for F1 so i am used to it and this issue seems to happen over and over again The online may only be in alpha but its almost perfect. ALMOST. apart from regular lag spikes for 10 sec and you go down from 1st to 4th in a race. It is so frustrating as a gamer to be leading and then lag spike and boom 4th. Also a issue is that not many cars and tracks are given for free so you need to buy most of the cars and tracks using virtual credits which you need to buy  Decession time: The game seems to have more +ve's than -ve's but that doesn't make the game better. The issues i have listed are massive issues which can cause people to rage quit and make a hole in their computer screen so right now, i don't recommend it but hopefully after a few patches the game should be one of the best racing games around. There are other small issues that i don't really care about atm: no time transition, only sunny weather, no dynamic weather
6875	Everything in this â¥â¥â¥â¥in game is a DLC, if you don't buy anything you will have literally about three cars out of let's say 100 and 2 tracks out of 30 or more. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this.
6876	There is at least $20000 worth of dlc
6877	Horrible steering lag, pay-for-everything gameplay, extrmely expensive.  I paid nothing but I still want a refund.
6878	Free hillclimb map had a disqualifying bug. This is a money pit, even worse then iRacing since the content does not justify it in my opinion.  The good however is that the car sounds are EXCELLENT! Physics seems good as well.   Overall I prefer Assetto Corsa, this is not for me.
6879	Horible game, the best part was unistalling it!

6882	Bad physics and limited options. Doesn't feel like you're doing half of the driving
6883	GTR 2 by simbin.. awesome except they messed up the patch's so it broke online play...  This .. I have played one car with one track, and .. very disappointed.  The car felt sloppy from the outside view, sounds were passable but repetitive, graphics seem dated and the menu system looks a mess.  Never mind the pay for better cars / tracks .. judging from what I have seen, this is going nowhere fast ...
6884	I honestly don't even know how or where to start with this game. It has no form of tutorial, guide, basic series of single player practice sessions to show you what you get with the game, what you have, game modes, anything. It is basically just a very very old school pick a series pick a car, hit race....that's pretty much it. I find it quite surprising that it has so many users with such a bad interface and menu structure. As a user you honestly don't know where to start.  After some trial and error I eventually discovered that most cars need to be bought, you only get....actually I don't know what you get because it doesn't list anywhere how many or which cars you do get. It's just such a bad user experience. Even ACR with all its problems and browser client mishmash was far supperior.  The first time I started it I basically just got the background cinematics and no menu. After googling around I found that you have to set a start parameter for the steam version. Why isn't this set as standard? Didn't I just install the game through steam?  So after you eventualy get it to work, you have to wonder if you actually have any sound, because there are no effects what so ever in the menu. No clicking efects, no music, no nothing. I played around with my volume until I entered a race and it was too loud.   And finaly we come to the actual driving experience....well...if you use a controller or keyboard you are basically hosed. The cars are mostly unconstrollable unless you have a wheel, and even then I'm not sure the default settings are ok. After much fiddling around with sensitivities, adaptive steering speeds and other settings, I managed to get a relatively ok setting. It worked fine for the car I was using at the time, but as soon as I changed cars, well I needed to see what I could do again.  The menu/interface thing is quite buggy and unintuitive. You have a back button to go back to the game and if you hit back inside the game, as in to go back to the main menu...it takes you back into the matchmaking menu...so basically and infinite loop of back buttons.   Now on to the plus points: After trying out multiple cars, I do have to admit you could 'feel' when one car was heavyer, or lighter, or had softer suspension and that is a very very good thing. It becomes pretty obvious that underneath the bad interface it is running a very good simulation engine.  On the polish oldtimer you can feel the heavy engine at the back trying to oversteer the car. On different DTM cars of the same era/class you can feel the different personlity of each car. I really like that. For example you can tell the Audi V8 is very heavy compared to the Merc 190 or the M3, you can feel that the Mustang has much softer suspension but is stil quite light. The FWD cars do understear in slow corners, and they do lift off oversteer just like they should. Dips in the road do make your car unstable and sometimes create wheelspin (this also sais a lot about the quality and detail of the tracks). This is especially noticeable on some longer high speed corners. The vibrators on the side of the track do unsettle your car and can make it jump up in the air.  So yes, the racing engine underheath is very very good.  The graphics do look good for a racing game. There's not much to say about them. Everything runs smoothly no stutters, high FPS. The amount of detail given to the sound during racing is quite high. It has suspension and pannel squeking.   I'm quite dissapointed to be honest, I really liked all their previous games and those did have much better interfaces and functionality. This is just slopy in so many ways.  From what I have played so far I am tempted to try it some more just because that surprisingly good engine underneath that crap interface. I haven't yet found out how exacly you enter a multiplayer race, there are some challenges and some servers, but instructions are scarce at best. I don't even think there is any form of experience or leveling, but if there is, I wasn't able to find it.
6885	There is at least $20000 worth of dlc
6886	Horible game, the best part was unistalling it!

6888	This was a very fun sim. Now doesnt even load. Terrible service especially for people that have paid content.,
6889	  I would not suggest this game to anyone, I love racing games, both simulation and arcade but this one, it's just too bad it decided to be a free2play game instead of a real game. It doesn't have many cars and tracks for a game that is supposed to be updated often. You have to pay for the stuff and it's overpriced, give me a all in one pack that will also contains all future content for a fair price then that would be good but unfortunately, it is not the case, you can see that the developer is just one other among the incompetents and greedy sheep of the modern gaming industry. As I can understand, if you buy one car, you can only choose one livery but I am unsure about that so do not totally trust me about this one. It is probably one of the only racing game that has DTM, the only one that I am aware of but when it comes to WTCC you're better off with RACE - The WTCC Game and GTR for GT. I'll be honest, the difficulty is pretty though, pretty much harder than every single rally games I have played (almost all of them), harder than F1 games and harder than pretty much everything, maybe that I am not used to this kind of racing (DTM), I'd love to but I hate how their game works, sell the game then that's it, no microtransactions, no in-store content or at least, make us able to buy a bundle that has everything in it and that would also contain everything in the future and no crap such as what Ubisoft did - selling a season pass then selling an 'expansion' that you have to buy even if you own the season pass. Other than that, the graphics are great but the worse point of this game is that it has no offline mode.    In short.  Negative:  1. No offline mode. 2. Overpriced content. 3. No bundle that has everying in it for a fair price. 4. Does not have a lot of content for a game that is supposed to be updated often.   Positive:  1. Great difficulty. 2. Great maneuverability/gameplay. 3. Great graphics (even If honestly, I do not care too much about the graphics as long as it is all the same everywhere unlike some games in particular).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game because of its big flaws.  4/10
6890	Rubbish controls, rubbish cars!
6891	Complete dogshit, waste of time. The controls are terrible.
6892	Just buy F1 2013/2012
6893	The cars are unresponsive and overall like driving drunk 10x. I would not ever recommend this to any because of the fact they might hate me forever for doing so. -5/5
6894	A couple cars, couple variations of the same track and a large amount of mini-transactions.  Kudos to SimBin to allow you to drive more than one car instead of buying them, although the rest are for real money. It has some potential to be a fun racing simulator, but I can already see that SimBin only wants your money.  I must say, it is pretty fun for the first couple minutes, until you look at the store, ALL cars are for real money, nothing you can earn by playing; A career would of kept me playing.  If you are intrested in these types of games, spend your money on Assetto Corsa - A amazing game, definitely recommend it - Instead of this milking factory.   Not worth 10gb of storage space.  3.5/10
6895	never waste ur life on this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ all uu do is spin out when u drive i waited 3h wiht slow internet for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ truly â¥â¥â¥â¥ unrealisktik as â¥â¥â¥â¥ all u do is spin around and fly allover teh track and u cant get basicly anything without paying never download not free its freemium 0/10 = â¥â¥â¥â¥t
6896	Gameplay completely unrealistic !
6897	I honestly don't know why people love this game so much. It's BAD. The frame rate is awful, and the steering is just HORRIBLE. I press the right arrow ONCE and I spun out! This game is not good. Don't be fooled by the reviews. If you're looking for a good racing game, try Trackmania.
6898	A very very â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up game that pisses on every thing you know about racing games and implements a new mecanic that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all over you.A very very bad game.â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. 
6899	this game suck
6900	This game appears good at first but quickly became a money swolowing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Do download is but do not give these people any money for this pay-to-win crap
6901	Motion blur is way too much, even with it disabled. Handling is unrealistic and difficult. Circuits suck. Not recommended.
6902	Absolutley no point to this game unless youre a really big formula 1 racer fanatic. its basically a simulation with 95% of all content is pay to play
6903	.
6904	This actually the only good free racing game in steam but my complaint is the control detection kinda buggy and the control profile also kind of confusing, I'm using xbox 360 controller, the game able to detect but does nothing. Fix the control detection and would recommend this game...
6905	Would not recommend this game as it has terrible controls
6906	Wow Howoverly unrealistic can you be? I bumped a car from behind and in UNDER 0.25s it finished a 360. Now I understand the need for realism in racing, its actually fun. But that isnt real at all.  Also you try to learn the game? It teaches you by throwing you head first into a super over unrealistic race where braking and cornering at the same time isnt bad... its IMPOSSIBLE. Yes when you race you don't want to do that, thats a given. But if you brake and turn you dont slow down at 1kilometre per second........ (just so you know it would take 300seconds to stop if you turn and break on the first corner of single race default) Which is completely unrealistic......  If you like realism in driving games Play Need for speed ITS BETTER THAN THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥!
6907	Auto-brake will drive you crazy but this game drives you crazy with it, and I almost couldn't pick a car because the game wants you to buy everything. Then it told me to register for free content and ten minutes later when I signed in I got 1 car. Then you have to adjust every setting in the UI because all the normal stuff just isnt there. On top of that it is super over complicated just to get a car and drive it. The single player mode has confusing menus too, that was nice. So much potential for a game this big, over 10gb, but it falls short in all the worst ways.
6908	Can't reccomend. Don't waste your time to even download this game. It's a crap!
6909	this game suck
6910	A very very â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up game that pisses on every thing you know about racing games and implements a new mecanic that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all over you.A very very bad game.â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. 
6911	Motion blur is way too much, even with it disabled. Handling is unrealistic and difficult. Circuits suck. Not recommended.
6912	This game appears good at first but quickly became a money swolowing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Do download is but do not give these people any money for this pay-to-win crap
6913	Played when it first came out, uninstalled the game till i can wait for better playable mode.  Installed again to play with friends, everyone yelled at me for making them DL this game.  Uninstalled for the 2nd time because with alot of updates you still only use like 1 car to pick from.  If you are looking for something to play with friends just DON'T DL THIS S**T GAME!
6914	I honestly don't know why people love this game so much. It's BAD. The frame rate is awful, and the steering is just HORRIBLE. I press the right arrow ONCE and I spun out! This game is not good. Don't be fooled by the reviews. If you're looking for a good racing game, try Trackmania.
6915	I dont recommend this game, in my opinion doesnt have real physics and it feels like its closed, you dont have freedom to use maximal potential of cars.
6916	You may ask yourself about this review, that this dude couldn't possibly know what he's talking about, he hasn't even played a full 30 minutes! Actually, I played 0 minutes. Because I couldn't get to play. Here, is why.   [I have also, a link at the bottom of this review, to show you visually what I went through.]  Firstly, on start up, my mouse cursor goes straight up to top of screen at a fast rate, and IT WILL NOT STOP. The only real reason I was able to login correctly is thanks to the arrow keys and the enter button that is found on my keyboard and I'm sure many many others as well. I couldn't acess the menu option because again, mouse was all over the fkn place. LEt alone select any game modes, and it is listed that it has at least partial controller support. Which leads us to the NEXT FK UP. :D  Second! The game screwed up my controller profiler or SOMETHING, and caused me to have to restart my rig. [Which I did not want to do at the time, but I was FORCED to by this games doing. Thanks.] Here is how!  When I connected my controller to my pc, via wireless gaming adapter from Microsoft. [drivers up-to-date], it popped a notification on screen saying, 'Device Found. Profile Loaded'. My controller did not function on the menu whatsoever, and I wouldve loved to maybe see if it needed to be enabled or configured, but again I COULDN'T because of the mouse issue and no way to navigate the menu ANY OTHER WAY[keyboard/controller]. The controller will flash with a ful green circle as if its trying to connect. It scared me for a moment because before I could fully test my controllers status, I thought that this thing just screwed up my profiler and would cause me to have another task to endure to getting it fixed, [which ended up being a pc restart]. I did find that it was actually connected the whole time, before restarting, I went on to big picture mode, to find the controller was working and navigating through the menus, YET IT STILL FLASHED. Even after disconnecting and offing the controller, when turned back on, it would only flash, but still be connected. So I restarted PC and it fixed. But how did I get out of the game? Well you'd be surprised, because THAT is the THIRD topic of error I want to announce.  THRIDLY. I could not exit the game for the life of me, I had to be a ninja on top notch to figure this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. And after everything going on previously, my mind was already strung out. I couldn't click on anything obviously, a double esc press can't exit you out, you press escape, you MUST CLICK Yes or No buttons. But I couldn't because it was zipping to top of screen. So I tried windows button. Lol nope. So I tried to start task manager, but every time I'd go to click on it when it appeared and I was 'out of the game', It shot me back to the horror-puzzle free to play that I downloaded apparently. Because it was just that, a puzzle, on how to figure out how to get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to work, and it horrified me in the process. I've done enough troubleshooting today.  In short, the only thing that was racing in or about this, was my mouse cursor. And myself. It has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my entire day up, all of this happened and it's not even Noon yet. BRUH.   Race-outofmyfkn-Room Racing Experience. [Mouse Cursor Edition]  And devs, I don't mean to sound overly harsh, but this literally has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my entire mood for gaming the rest of the week, for ANY genre, just any game in general. And even if I were to get it fixed, the drive for me to play it has completely vaporized, and wouldn't be worth a fraction of a second more out of my life TBH. It probably wasn't worth all this effort anyways. This was overall, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ saddening.  You've really outdone yourselves, guys. Congrats. Now Devs, go out to Wal-Mart, and buy the whole team a slice o' fkn cake, how about it??   Good day. Lol [ Link to evidence  https://youtu.be/g9KMsLdSwH8  ]
6917	Absolutley no point to this game unless youre a really big formula 1 racer fanatic. its basically a simulation with 95% of all content is pay to play
6918	Controls are really baaaaad and you have to buy most of the cars ;) Hence buy a $100 steam card if you want all the cool cars in this game ;)
6919	this game uses input filtering. this means that your inputs are completely decoupled from what the in-game steering whels do.
6920	Great physics, great sound, decent graphics...boring game. Slim vehicle lineup with some great tracks (many tracks you can't find on other games). My racing group and I bought in only when the 80-90% sales were on. Simply put the pay-to-play 'free to play' nonsense ruined what should have been a serious contender for Project CARS, AC etc. It has the quality to compete, but the purchase model is stupid.  No AI use in multiplayer games also diminishes the appeal. The tracks are nice but the environment is very sterile (akin to Assetto Corsa). Great controller options and technical options but doesn't deliver much in the way of envirionmental options, etc.   This is the game which should have been great. We all openly agreed we'd have paid a normal $60 pricetag but everyone I race with is turned off by the silly pay-per-car junk. That's the only reason I can't recommend this unless you stumble upon one of their big sales.
6921	games fails to launch. tried all possible fixes (recommended by developer and users)  the request refund button does not work in steam.   running a win 10 with 16 gb ram, i7 6th gen and 2gb nvidia video card  My recomandation is not to buy this game - stay away
6922	Fairly boring.
6923	Slow app, where you have to pay for everything and crashes when you attempt to race. Deleted.
6924	Feels like a demo game because of limited tracks and cars options. Graphics are just so so. It will be expensive if you want to buy all the tracks and cars. Defo will uninstall the game. I will just stick to Assetto Corsa and Simraceway.
6925	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tt
6926	well :v microtransactions are really hard these days m8s xD
6927	this game is teriblle the graphics are good but the payment concept is really really annoying basically you get four car models and two tracks to start with, if you want to get any of the other cars or tracks you have to pay real money, you dont get ingame money for racing. so you can consider this free game a demo version, an if you want to pay for everything in this game it will cost around 200$. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!
6928	10/6.5
6929	Online ONLY!  Pointless.
6930	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I HOPE YOU DO YOU BE A DEAD SON OF A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I TELL YOU THAT SON U â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HAVE TO â¥â¥â¥â¥ UR â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥ IN UR CHAIR BUYING THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I CAN MAKE THIS GAME AND MAKE NOT !!!!NOT TO PAY!! !!!TO WIN!! ILL â¥â¥â¥â¥ U UP WITH THE FLICKY DIPPIDY THE WRIST the wrist!
6931	lol what is this stupid game go to hell.
6932	This game is very good for someone who wants to see what racing sims are like but for someone who is serious about racing sims then this is not good as it is making you pay for loads of vehicles so I would not recommend it for a pro sim racers!
6933	It may be free but the expereince you get without paying makes it not even worth the hard drive space.
6934	Takes a year and a day to install. drivting is the worst. 3 gb ram is not enough. overall dont even try it. (i have 8 gb ram
6935	An 18-wheeler can make sharper turns than these cars
6936	I really wanted to like this.  It has an amazing selection of absolutely classic cars and the presentation looked solid enough at first glance.  And it was only $4 when I picked it up and it will probably be removed from the store sooner rather than later, so it may at least be somewhat of a collector's piece in the future.  With the imminent closure of GfWL it seems likely that it will follow Dirt 2, FUEL and co. into digital nirvana soon. I don't see any patches to remove GfWL in the future either. Additionally, licensed racers like this usually have a limited time of distribution anyways.  Sadly, the game itself is not really enjoyable:  The weak AI, wonky physics (especially during collisions), a dry and shockingly boring campaign (considering what amazing assets they had to work with!) with difficulty spikes early on and nothing to motivate the player to keep playing the same event over and over and over again other than the fact that almost the entire content of the game is simply locked away otherwise doesn't make for an overall great experience.  Multiplayer is an ultra-barebones afterthought and 100% dead.  It's not terrible through and through and I had some enjoyable races, but the bad outweighs the good.  This game could have been truly great, but in the end it's just full of fun-killing design decisions and overall a massive disappointment.
6937	+ Great selection of tracks avaliable in multiple layouts throughout the history incl. the old Hockenheimring. + Users with popular racing wheels need not any tweaking. Also has good force feedback that transmits plenty of road feel to the wheel. + Teaches you about Ferrari's history by providing a wide variety of Ferrari's creation throughout the eras. All of them are meticulously detailed and sound nice as well. + Robust replay feature that allows players to watch the race from AIs' perspective as well. What's more, replays can be saved too. + Better physics than Shift 2: Unleashed so you don't have to turn all the aids on in order to drive clean. + Great damage both visual and performance-wise on Formula 1 cars. + Good graphics that makes you awe from time to time despite being a tad rough around the edges. + Lots of contents for the current discount price of $3.99.  - NFS: Shift physics. There's no getting away with that. Classic cars feel quite good but the experience deteriorates in the faster cars. Make even the slightest contact with other cars and you'll have to brace for a somersault. - No option to individually tune driver aids. Auto-clutch and ABS can't be turned off at all. - DUMB AIs. They're very slow and are prone to amateur mistakes. Expect to overtake all of them before even getting into turn 1 and build a 15 second gap by lap 2. I managed to fall to last place twice in a 3 lap race and STILL managed to win at the hardest difficulty setting. - Lackluster damage in all the cars excluding the F1 cars. Slight scratches, dents, and misalligned steering rack is just about all the damage you get. - Time trial in hard difficulty setting requires you to set ridiculously fast lap times, but there's NO incentive in playing the missions at higher difficulty or completing bonus objectives. So why even bother? - Missions are mandatory to unlock the wide roster of tracks and cars. Yet only about 20% of them provide unlocks upon completion. Other 80% have no rewards whatsoever, giving a feel that developers crammed in missions just in order to keep the players continue playing. - Repetitive. All missions are either 'set a lap time', 'overtake your opponents before the race ends', or 'get a podium finish'. - You'll most likely give up on pursuing on unlocking the cars and tracks because of its tediousness. It's strongly recommended that you use a mod that unlocks all the cars and tracks.  In conclusion, it's Need for Speed: Shift, but with slightly worse overall gameplay and Ferraris. It's a great buy at $3.99, but there's no reason to bother spending $20 or so.
6938	With the physics at times, you have absolutely no control of the car whatsoever. And with one challenge in particular, the AI drive so badly, it is almost unplayable.
6939	Why I would not recommend to buy the game?  - the difficulty balancing ranges from boring easy to uber hard - In some races, you're supposed to do certain things. But you cant accomplish the goals because AI cars screw it up often - I had a hard time controlling the cars, they felt like soapbox cars to drive. While being drunk. Didnt make it easier to stay on the track, especially on advanced stages with higher speed levels - Unlogical physics. Though it is nice to have some physics in the game (basically, looks pretty good), most of the time you crash with an opponent, the opponent will stay on track while you spin round. - Career Mode. You have to win one race after another, you're not allowed to fail or skip an event, and if you're stuck on a mission, that's it. No more proceeding (Well, to be fair, that the usual way a game works, but with the aspects above, it gets tough after some time), no more new cars and tracks.  If you're into Ferraris and the history of the Scuderia, this could be a game for you however. If not - hands off!
6940	If it stuck to regular racing it wouldn't be so bad, but when it adds random driving scenarios you have to pass to continue the game it becomes annoying.
6941	Dreadful in my own experience in terms of reliability which has led me to write the review within my first hour. These crashes only seem to occur when I have my separate gear shifter peripheral, the Thrustmaster TH8 RS attached.   Poor mouse control of menus on pausing during race. Steering wheel peripherals function in one race, then completely stop for another race Switching tabs onto desktop causes the game to stop responding No save button for controls - if the game crashes on your first ever race after spending time setting up controls, you lose it all  Seems okay graphically, and as it is a Ferrari licensed game, it does have the great car models and good sounds, except for the modern F1 cars which use a generic V8 sound commonly heard in rFactor 1.
6942	DO NOT buy this game. It does not function since Games For Windows Live shut down services and no patch was ever developed as the game producer is closed.
6943	This game is a poor quality racing simulator for only ferrari vehicles. It has terrible physics and handling and is very uninteresting to play. It has a huge campaign that takes ages to play through and unlock. t is not interesting or worthwhile to play through it. I have and it was not worth the time. there are hardly any tracks and cars unlocked from the start you have to unlock them all by playing boring campaign missions. This is a terrible racing game, almost any other sim is better. And to make t even worse it has GFWL DRM which you have to make an account to sign n and play the game that you bought on steam.
6944	looks nice great driving ferrari's to bad the AI is inconsitent and cars from race to race one race cars great next floating allover like a 70 buick with bad shocks and it really is to bad otherwise game works runs smoth atleast for me @ 2560x1440 on a 40' monitor

6946	Graphic issues, terrible physics, inconsistent AI, bad gameplay. Avoid, even on sale! Get a Codemasters game instead.
6947	Horrible steering, unless you have a racing wheel, don't buy this.
6948	I know it's not even trying to be a sim, but even for an arcade racer, the physics are HORRIBLE. It's just flat out bad to drive. The older cars are somewhat less bad, but the modern ones, they feel like there are no tires on the cars at all, just one big ball in the middle, and the body of the car is just yawing around this central pivot.  I like everything else about it, and I'd like to like this game, but, alas, no.
6949	Ferrari power boat racing ... at it's worst! Maybe it works 'ok' with a wheel but if, like me, you're stuck with using a 360 controller for PC then get yourself prepared ... for lots of frustration ... The handling is akin to GTA4, only possibly worse o.O ... Forza this is not! No tuning, can't change parts ... even selecting Manual gears is 'iffy' (once you start a race it'll often revert to automatic) ... Barriers! - you'll lose control of your car often, so just slide along a barrier, right? No! Some seemingly smooth barriers will stop your car dead in its tracks :/ ... GFX are 'ok', reflections on car hoods are offputting (when using hood cam) ... selection of tracks is good ... that's the only good thing I can think of ... some nice tracks! ... Thankfully I bought this in a Steam sale for only a few quid (I think &lt;Â£4) ... but it was still a waste of money!
6950	initial promise fades away quickly , realisation sets in , cars cannot handle and gameplay is poorly executed , there are more constructive ways to pass time like watching plants grow or listening to question time on tv .
6951	I like it.BUT!!! Extremely tough game to make progress with. Made worse by not saving your twenty hours of game progress. Leaves whats good rendered pointless by this.
6952	Very, very poorly optimised game. When this is coupled with the fact that you have little control over the graphics (X360 port) and the fact that there always seemed to be quite a bit of input lag on games using the Shift engine, it makes the game unplayable on a lot of mid-range laptops. Even when playing at a high framerate this game has stiff controls, poor AI and a slightly lackluster career mode. Still, the models are fantastic to look at and the soundtrack's okay.
6953	I am a very big fan of racing games, even the Test Drive games. I bought this game by mistake, thought I would try it since Steam wouldnt take it back since I had already installed it. This game honestly is an obmination to raceing, and Ferrari should see this as an insult! Please save your money and avoid this 'game.'
6954	This is a game I wanted to love. Unfortunately for my taste, the driving model is a bit simple. I don't really like the audio engineering either. These cars have some of the most beautiful sounds ever in real life. But the game doesn't do it justice. The graphics are alright. Although it runs quite slow with very little eye candy. 3/10
6955	Total rip-off.
6956	I would love to play this game I paid for but I can't since it won't save my progress without GFWL. Please patch GFWL out of this game.
6957	This game needs 'Games for Windows Live' to run and so far this is causing a lot of trouble. Valve, why ist this not mentioned under system requirements??? CanÂ´t play the game as it always crashes with the error message 'Exception_Access_Violation'.
6958	Buggy graphics, many glicthes and works very poorly. Worst racing game I have ever tried.
6959	A BIG NO.  Graphics are nicely done, car physics are nice, you can feel the weight of the car. But the damage model is worth a frown. A big, long frown till your face can't get out of it's pose anymore. A lot of Ferrari's to choose from, once you've unlocked them by playing the campaign. The campaign is okay, but some challenges are just insane. Misty Loch is a difficult and frustrating track. It seems there is no balance in the game. A lot of times the AI is really easy to beat, even on Hard, while beating time challenges is really hard (as it should be when you play on Hard of course). The devs made a nice looking game, but the unbalanced elements are ridiculous. Don't spend your money on it, maybe only if it's really cheap. I have some fun with it, although I feel the devs should have done better. Multiplayer seems to have been dead for a long time. All in all it deserves no recommendation.  Edit: Really, just don't buy it, unless you want to decorate your (digital) bin with nice looking garbage.
6960	Not really much to say.. Visuals and sound are ok but that's where it ends.  Physics and car simulation are bad and/or just missing stuff. Cars are floaty to drive, game doesn't regard tire friction or other properties as it should. Suspension and steering modeling seems to be missing or just very simplified. All the things you would expect to be in this kind of racer are not there. Without proper handling it's rather pointless.  This is at most for casual gamers. Not recommended.
6961	Dont buy. Game is broken. Crashs everytime.  Still GFWL. Why?  Wasted money on this.
6962	Who doesn't like Ferrari? Well, iI'm a Ferrari fan. I got it for PC and to my surprise: I didn't buy a racing game, but a boat racing game! This game fails to deliver the purpose of any game: Entertainment
6963	Reason for negative: Ported from the Xbox 360 This game isnt my favourite. The game is a port from the Xbox and it never saves your controls. There are only a few positives on my side. This game is mainly focused on Ferrari as the title says.  Firstly I don't like how the game is just a failed port from the Xbox 360. The mouse doesn't work with any of the UI unfortunatley but you just have to figure out how to configure the keyboard with the buttons at the bottom that say 'X, Y, A, B'. I found navigating it quite easy because I used to play on a 360 but now im not sure why the kept that all in the PC version. The game only starts you off with a few cars and tracks which all seem impossible to play.  Now the reason why im writing this negativley is because the whole game feels extremely hard on easy difficulty and to drive you have all of these buttons that don't have any tutorials. I used a save file with the game because unlike games where all of the tracks and cars are unlocked and you just have to get money to buy new cars (Forza motorsport 4). The game has a nice graphics engine which is easially run on any computer. My older computer (Dell 9200) could run it at around 60fps. The reason I didnt list the settings is because there is none, no resolution change or motion blur disable. The game is designed to be on the Xbox with its simple graphics and forward facing sprite crowds. The sounds in the game are ok, they sound like a car would but the fact that the crowd is so loud you can hear them over the car sometimes. I would reccommend disabling all of the hud so that you can see the entire track ahead of you. The game is rather old now and it still has a community of around 200 people.  If you wan't a realistic driving game that has nice graphics I would reccomend a game like 'The Crew' or 'Forza motorsport' (it can easially be emmulated onto the PC). So overall; if you like Ferraris and one type of car only then this is most certainly the way to go, if you wan't a nicer more modern game that isnt ported from the 360 in such an awful way go for the games that I listed. This game isnt the greatest and I can understand that porting from the 360 wasnt to great back then, niether was the graphics. The game is not worth buying, unless you're a massive Ferrari fan who has an extra Â£15 or Â£3.75 to spend on the game then go for it. 50% I would say, not the best but a semi decent game.
6964	The Ferrari's are pretty... Thats pretty much it...
6965	I don't even know what to say, I can't believe I paid for this, it has warped my fragile little mind. One of the worst racing games I've played.
6966	I expected this to be like Porsche Unleashed with Ferrari. Well, that's definitely NOT even close. Three bucks down the drain.
6967	cannot unlock all cars. you end up with only about 4 cars to drive. Then, what seems like a life long challenge and set of obstacles, to unlock the rest. Forget about the cars in the advertisements. Not available. Great graphics but not as good as others.
6968	Absolute trash. Control are ungodly, 1st race ends if you go off the track for a second. Didn't even bother with it after the 1st race.
6969	Is it worth it? No, not quite. Even for less than the 2 euro I grabbed this up, a cold beer satisfies more.  The good things about Test Drive Ferrari: - official licensed cars - a nice history walkthrough  The bad things about Test Drive Ferrari: - bugs... it keeps forgetting the inputs i specified for my wheel - with ALL driving helpfunctions turned off, they appear to stay on...  Maybe the game offers more than just these positives and negatives, but I lost my interest entirely to find them out. How can a gamedesigner make a decision like an always turned on helpfunction when you manually choose to have it off. It doesn't even require extra code to get it straight   I've loved Need For Speed Porsche in many ways and hoped to get a same kind of tribute. I knew I wasn't getting a superb product for it's a pricetag, but I expected a tribute to Ferrari to have at least an okay quality. A shame that they fail to deliver the minimum expectations.  If you like Ferrari's and think you at least get a nice collectable... it's not worth it. Go watch youtube videos or read the wikipedia. I give this game a 3,5/10.
6970	Really bad physics and monotonous Gameplay. After 3 hours and lots of stages there are still the same 3 tracks, really boring. Also, normal is very easy and hard is normal. The car handling is crap at best. I know arcade and I know simulation and I cannot call this one either.
6971	This game teases you with all the cars.. that it won't let you drive.
6972	I am a massive Ferrari fan and I love racing games (though I prefer simulation to arcade) however I could never EVER recommend this game.  There are many good tracks to choose from (including Fiorano) that have been copied very well and there is a large selection of Ferrari cars to drive (both road cars and race cars), however there are many driver assists in this game that are far too intrusive and that cannot (as far as I have found) be turned off. I understand some people need or prefer to use the electronic assists but in this game even the most novice driver would be wishing s/he could tone them down. They have ruined the game completely though, for example no matter how many times you select a gear it will always select the gear the computer wants you to use and the brake assist just causes you to lock up all the time and the traction control seems to have recently escaped from a mental asylum. The worst thing though is the steering assist, even with the car parked and not moving the steering assist is frantically moving the wheel in an attempt to put you somewhere it wants to be (although I have no idea where that may be).  Ultimately there is a lot of good in this game (e.g. tracks, cars and story/career mode) however the driver assists are so horrible that they ruin the game completely and the fact you can't turn these assists off just kills the game completely.  Worst game ever.
6973	WINDOWS IS SO DAM SCARED THAT SOMEONE WILL PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT THEM GETTING ANY MONEY FROM YOU THAT IT MAKES SUCH A BIG DEAL JUST â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LOG ON WHAT A WASTE OF TIME KEEP THE PEICE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥. I WILL GO OUT OF MY WAY TO â¥â¥â¥â¥ WINDOWS ANY WAY I CAN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE CANCEL MY LEASE WOULD WANT TO OWN WINDOWS I CANT EVEN UNINSTALL IT OFF MY $2,200 COMPUTER UPDATE THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥ 130 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TIMES IF I DONT WANT SECURITY ON MY SYSTEM I SHOULDNT HAVE TO HELL I JUST LEASEING THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥S
6974	Got aids whilst playing  Would be cautious as Ebola can also be contracted from it  2/10 Story is â¥â¥â¥â¥ iMDB
6975	In my opinion: don't buy it  The tree textures are sometimes in the middle of the road, blocking the view
6976	This game need a windows live id and even if you have one you are not allowed to play because the server is down ;(
6977	looks nice but has some big issues
6978	Remember. That's MY opinion. Maybe you love the game. I don't.  This should be a great game, great idea, nice graphics, but... I don't know. That's not the game for me. Hard controls, response... It's very difficult to have fun with a game you simply can't stay on the road. I remember the Test Drives from Playstation era and this one has nothing to do with them. Sorry guys but I had frustation instead of fun from this game. I'll try a little harder but it looks like I'm uninstalling it after 1 day testing.   I prefer fun over graphics.
6979	Really, a graphics card like a GTX760 is haveing problems running this game...
6980	Great car and track selection, but car physics ruin the fun. Whats the point of dropping racing lines when it's faster to drift around the corners? A F1 car should not oversteer when going 200 kph in a corner. Having to unlock every car and track by playing campaign limits the value of the game as the AI is pretty poor, even on hard difficulity.
6981	cant seem to get it to work nonresponsive wont play
6982	Hmm...where to start! Pros: great to see a lot of care and attention to such a great car maker. Graphics are...decent I guess. Plenty of cars to choose from. Good selection of tracks.  Cons: physics engine is AWFUL. I mean, truly dreadful. It's not an arcade racer, or a sim, it's kinda meh. Windows live login required, and takes a lot longer to load because of it. Menu doesn't make much sense, and reconfiguring keys (ie, for a gamepad or similar) is very complex. Feels like it has been made by a very inexperienced developer.  4/10
6983	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, controls move on their own, game not design for windows but more for xbox. Have to pass every boring race just to unlock cars and racers wtf!!!!
6984	I'd hoped it was something along the lines of need for speed porche unleashed. It's probably not a bad game but the port from xbox feels like it's made by a failed student. When using the mouse to navigate the menu in-race your mouse curser will end up on your secondary monitor, or it'll make the menu flicker back and forth. Also you can't remap controls from inside a race, and since you don't know what button the 'a' and 'b' buttons from an xbox controller are represented by, chances are you're going to use the mouse I just mentioned didn't work very well.   On keyboard, you can't really play though. The driving aid will constantly try to correct your movement, which means you're never truely in control of the car. Sometimes it'll turn way more than you expect, sometimes way less. Sometimes you'll do wheelspin, sometimes you'll understeer. And you can't know in advance. It's frustrating.   The cockpits in the game looks awesome though and I think on an xbox the game might be rather good.  If you want to buy this game, at least make sure you've got an xbox controller.

6986	What a poor port from console to pc. Left it where it was or make a decent port. This is not playable on the pc. I regret my purchase. Menus and controller (Fanatec CSW, in my case) are very poorly configurable.
6987	Remember. That's MY opinion. Maybe you love the game. I don't.  This should be a great game, great idea, nice graphics, but... I don't know. That's not the game for me. Hard controls, response... It's very difficult to have fun with a game you simply can't stay on the road. I remember the Test Drives from Playstation era and this one has nothing to do with them.

6988	O hey, it's a GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE game. Be warned, that means it doesn't work. Save files and account hassles as soon as you sign in. Couldn't even launch the game at first, had to run it as administrator. I downloaded this game a few years ago not on steam, and it's honestly not too fun. If you like Ferrari's, and racing, be prepared to be disappointed. NOTHING IS UNLOCKED except three cars, and a few tracks. You have to work for everything. Driving wise, it's also a disappointment. Trust me on this, splurge on Gran Turismo and buy the Ferrari cars there instead.
6989	First, this is GFWL and second the wheel support us awful
6990	This game does not support ferrari racing wheel (f430 ffb). After playing for a while, i feel that this games does not support racing. You can only look at the beautiful cars and listen to music.
6991	The game is bad, even worse is games for Windows live. It's worse than EA Origin and that's saying something. Just don't get this, you will be very frustrated.
6992	As a fan of futuristic racers, this is one of the weaker iterations of that genre... The tracks themselves are very linear and don't have the same fluid speed and awesome backgrounds of similar entries. The combat / shooting mechanics feel particularly shoddy, with weapons being frantically-used and not very cool to look at when activated. The track designs generally consist of clumsily running into arches which restrict your movement throughout the racing lane. Stray too far left or right and you come to an abrupt halt after running into some of the arches. To its credit, some of the ship designs are cool and the music is decent, but if you're looking for a fun futuristic racer, there are better options available. Save your money.
6993	I was suspecting it to work out of the box. Sadly I shouldve known for how old the game was, it overloaded my PC RAM conponents and I had to hard shut down my PC multiple times. I don't recommend the game, was fun on Ps2 but a hard game to run on a PC.
6994	EDIT: Nah, actually, screw it. This game is just not playable as it keeps crashing.  I'll refrain from any comparison because the first two Driver installements had so much magic in my eyes that Parallel Lines simply can't compete. So, how does it stand on its own?  Rather fine really. It's more of a GTA than a Driver, but it's not a bad thing. Especially when you can drive bikes and helicopters. To this day, the game still looks more than acceptable. I can't say the graphics bothered me, except maybe the face models, which isn't really that important for a driving game.  Now the story is kinda usual. You get betrayed and decide to take your revenge. You know the drill. It just works!  The OST is absolutely fantastic so long as you stick to the seventies. The modern era OST is absolute garbage, which is rather sad in my opinion. Some great stuff got released that year, why did they solely focus on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ electro?  Anyway, let's get to the PC release. The game is pretty much entirely customizable. It supports up to a 4k resolution, you can edit the graphical options and what not, even the driving sensitivity. Which I heartily recommend if you're playing with a gamepad because the sensitivity is a bit too high. Also, I'd suggest lowering the circulation because you simply can't drive any fast without crashing with the default options.  BUT THEN. The game keeps crashing all of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. Get out of the garage? Crash. Finish a mission? Crash. Failed a mission and wish to restart? Crash. I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. Luckilly, the game saves automatically everytime you do something. But still, that perpetual crashing really makes finishing the game a chore.  I'd say pick it up on sale, but it's already 5 bucks so yeah, if you need a fix of GTA like, go for it.
6995	Well, what do i have to say about this game??? It is fun when you can play it, but i have tried for countless hours to play this game without it crashing, i have have tried playing it on 3 diffrent computers, some old, some new, and i have tried to find diffrent fixes, but none of them work. Lets list a few of the instances when your game has a chance of crashing, it can crash when you restart a mission or level, when you go to the main menu, when you boot up the game, when you era switch, or just randomly during a game session. I have no idea why this is happening because i am over the minium system requirements to play this game, and i don't know why there are so little reports of this happening, AND i dont know why this isnt being patched... So if you want to play this game, play it on the playstation or xbox, dont waste your money here...
6996	ehhh..... just stick to the orginal driver on ps1/pc or go play GTA.
6997	An open world game with a hideous poorly thought out map is a non-starter even when considering the standards of when this abnomination was released in 2006.
6998	decent story but a boring world and bad car controls make it a 4/10
6999	A rather questionable port, not worth it outside of nostalgia.
7000	Making a driving-based game with â¥â¥â¥â¥ car controls is a pretty risque move.  Oh, and slow mouse in menus...it's been ten years, but devs still think it's a good idea. Hint: it's not.
7001	it's a porting. Don't buy it it's laggy even if i record 120 fps
7002	A typical Ubisoft game, backward engineering at its finest
7003	It's not nearly as good as the original Driver game by reflection.
7004	No jump feature.... seems pretty poor compared to Driv3r that I remember so fondly from my youth.
7005	Not recommended.   Rubbish.  Outdated.  10/10 would not buy again,
7006	Don't do it !!!! No matter what the price .........
7007	Utterly terrible, kill UPlay with fire.
7008	Uplay is garbage.  The game is fun, but I'd recommend avoiding it due to the obscenely restrictive DRM.  Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together, Ubisoft.  &gt;:[
7009	Runs like crap even on my GTX 670, theyve known about these issues with stuttering frame rate from day one and they've done nothing. Do not give them you money.
7010	bad port , also uplay :/
7011	The game itself is extremely fun-- I also own it on Xbox 360 and have spent hours on it.   The required Uplay account is the reason I can't fully recommend it -- Uplay runs constantly in the background even after you quit the game and slows down the computer. Ubisoft is notorious for badly-thought out DRM and it appears they haven't quit yet. If I were you I'd get this on console instead.
7012	Why is uplay involed. It ruins the game as I can't join friends due to stupid nat errors which I have done all I can to try and fix but the game won't have it. The game it self is good fun but uplay makes it impossible to play with friends.
7013	Let's get this straight: I absolutely adore this game, it is really fun to play and see how you improve over time.  Even better if you have a couple of friends to compete with on the leadersboards or play a bit of multiplayer. You can even make your own tracks in the editor which is pretty easy to get started in, but advanced enough to make crazy minigames and really slick looking tracks.  If the game will actually run at all for you that is.  It seems to be a coin-toss if this game will work on your system or not, and if it actually does run it might still lag even with really good hardware. I'm running it with a HD7970 and an i7 3770k so it runs well just because of the brute force. My laptop on the other hand has a decent high end i7 (for a laptop) and a HD8870M and I can't even run the game on low settings in 680x480 (for reference, the laptop can run Battlefield 4 on low sort of okay in 1080p) without having lag. Other people have problems with the game not starting at all or crashing frequently.  EDIT: Track central is now fixed and works just as well as it does on Xbox 360, removed the 'it's not working very well part'.  It also has DRM in the form of uPlay, which will start when you try and start the game from Steam. It was pretty terrible in the beginning but seems to have improved a bit over the year (still would rather not have it). uPlay also handles the multiplayer part of the game if you want to make private games with friends and that part is incredibly broken too. Pressing invite from the in-game friendslist just crashes my game and I'm one of the lucky ones that it's the only problem I'm having with it.  To sum things up I would recommend the game if I knew it would work properly, but with all the problems it has it really seems to be dumb luck wether it will work. The infrequent patches haven't done much to remedy the situation in the last few months so I honestly cannot recommend it when it's so broken for a big portion of the people that bought it.
7014	This is the worst pc port i've ever seen. Originally this game was released on xbox where the framerate is locked to 60fps so it wasn't a problem there to link the game speed to the framerate. However on pc if your fps drops just under 60 it causes the game to stutter and become unplayable. I heard this problem occurs mostly on mediocre nvidia cards so if you own a high end graphics card of another producer you could be fine.   On top of that you need Uplay(+account) in addition to Steam which is completly unnecessary and the Ubisoft service was horrible when i tryed to explain the problem to them searching for a solution.   Despite all this i played the game in window mode on 800x600 resolution on lowest settings because it is really fun and i would love to recommend it to everyone who just has the slightest interest, but i can't under these circumstances.
7015	UPlay sucks balls!!! Never get this game unless you are sure you are willing to use the crappy services of UPlay and let it 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' you computer... 1-time key works ONCE!!! can't play it ever since I installed... DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!
7016	It actually saddens me that I can't reccomend this game, considering the enthusiasm with which I approached it. Right upon launch the game forces you to make a uPlay account, which is not that bad one might say. Then, you are introduced to the uPlay overlay which is laggy, non-intuitive and an overall pain to use. After 30 minutes of trying to get in a game with a friend, during which we encountered silly errors ('Steam is disabled for some reasons' [sic]) the only thing we could do is give up. There seems to be a tendency nowadays that every publisher is keen on forcing us to use their in-house unusable bloatware. Tell Ubisoft that you won't take it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT BUY UBISOFT GAMES.
7017	How to play Trials Evolution: Gold Edition in one step!!  1) You don't, cuz Uplay says your key is used already and â¥â¥â¥â¥s you.
7018	If I could every play this game, I would love to, however Ubisoft is a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥ heads, so i bought the damn game and now i am locked out of it.
7019	After a recent update, I am no longer able to play with my friends at once. Very upsetting since there is not any other game like trials on the market. If anybody has suggestions, let me know!
7020	Terrible pc port  better of buying it on console
7021	dont buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ excuse for a game. Its amazing on xbox but the devs havnt fixxed framerate bug where it plays at a constant 10 fps for the majority of people. After 6 months of being released there is still no change
7022	Proprietary uPlay account required, does not actually run in Steam. You have been warned. It DOES say on the store page, at the very bottom under additional requirements. Either advertise it at the top or let me put in a refund, I'm tired of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
7023	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR ANY OTHER UBISOFT TITLE ON PC!   If you do choose to ignore my advice and buy one anyway then you will be greeted with the follwing things upon launching the game:  1. Your standard pre-launch setup (expected) 2. A window that is clearly not your game appears (unexpected) 3. It says 'updating Uplay' 4. It takes almost an hour to 'update Uplay' 5. Create a Uplay account (even though you don't want to) 6. You type in the key steam has given you 7. Repeat step 6 another 4 times 8. Become banned from uplay for entering an 'incorrect' key too many times 9. Try restarting Uplay 10. Be faced with another hour long update 11. When that finishes, why not have another!  Thats as far as I have got towards playing the game that I payed for 2 hours ago and haven't played yet. As far as Trials Evolution goes, it's a great game that I have played on Xbox for a long time. I reccomend you buy it on Xbox, and if you don't have an Xbox then wait until they are cheap. This wait will most likely be shorter than the waiting time for Uplay to update. Have fun! 
7024	I like this game. It's fun. But I can't play it.  I can look past the frame rate bugs, I can get over the fact that you have to use UPlay, I can live with the occasional error or crash. But the last few times I've launched the game, I can't even access 'Track Central,' where you will download user-created tracks. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen. So the only part of the game I can play is the single-player developer-created tracks, all of which I have already completed.   This would be an absolutely fantastic game if it worked. But there's too many problems that all combine to create a steaming pile of terribly-ported, poorly-optimized, broken, buggy, frustrating donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7025	Played this game shortly after release and decided to come back today... After failing my password four times on Ubisofts GARBAGE UPLAY service that I never use but on rare occasions like this my account has now been suspended. .....   I cannot recommend a game I cannot play. This is total bs and DRM like this is unacceptable. I just wanted to drive my biker into a wall a few times.. apparently that is too much to ask from Ubisoft. Thanks, you have reminded me why I love independent developers.  Stay away from Ubisoft.
7026	I'd love to review the actual game, but I can't. I can't get it to run, because of idiot executives at ubisoft want to use DRM to the point you can't do anything. Takes forever to login, and once logged in, the ubisoft server is down. Just rip it off a torrent site if you want it. DO NOT BUY. Pirate this game or skip it altogether since that is what ubisoft is forcing it's customers to do if they don't want a million headaches trying to get the 'uplay' garbage to work.
7027	Garbage forced UPLAY, extremely poor console port, changes made are not for the better compared to the original, bad camera angles and controls. Just a shockingly bad effort. Only game I've ever got a refund on steam for.
7028	Game is great but not saving here for some reason. It goes back to 0, that sux!!!!!
7029	tried multiplayer  didnt work  tried uplay multiplayer  killed myself
7030	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cd key doesn't work. what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this â¥â¥â¥â¥? I put it in a few times and they temporarily banned my account. â¥â¥â¥â¥ Uplay.
7031	UPlay makes it not worth the trouble.
7032	Multiplayer hasn't worked properly since the alpha. Whenever asked about it, the devs just ignore you.  DON'T BUY THIS PORT.
7033	Uplay sucks. I can't connect to the server because I haven't registered the game yet, but I can't register the game because I'm not connected to the server. The game has pretty low graphics but still lags like hell and skips frames but I can't lower them more because there are no advanced graphical options. You can still have a bit of fun by laughing at the bad translation though. Made in China.
7034	I'm never usually one to moan about console 'ports' (not that real 'ports' exist anymore of course), but this is utterly dire. Doesn't show track times of anyone in my friends list for whatever reason, when I know 6 other people on steam who play the game. Framerates are aweful, leading to very choppy gameplay. I could only fix this by playing in 800 x 600, but even then the experience was nowhere near as fluid as it should have been. If you have an Xbox 360, shell out the extra couple of quid and get it for that, its an ultimately more rewarding and fun experience. The game itself is fantastic and it seems a shame I have to be so negative about it, but I really am totally unimpressed with this title.
7035	This is one of the worst games i have ever bought.It lags(Even with really good computer),Music is terrible,Graphics are disgusting,Wost controls ever,and much more.I only bought it because it was $5.00.Worst $5.00 i ever spent.  DO NOT BUY!!!! Feel Bad You Bought Such A Crappy Game? Here Have A Cookie  http://eleventhstack.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/chocolate_chip_cookies.jpg 
7036	I wish that I could recomend this game to people, but chances are that you won't be able to get it to play. If you're one of the lucky ones, it's fun though. Loved it on Xbox. Hate it on steam and it should be removed or actually fixed, but I highly doubt that will ever happen.
7037	Multiplayer will not work for me no matter what I try. Customer support is poor and unhelpful. Singleplayer is not good enough to carry the game on it's own
7038	This game sucks, because I skipped the CD Key thingy and now I can't play the game because it says that it's wrong when I put something in.  
7039	Runs through uPlay, buggy software that makes it harder to run the game. Do not buy because of uPlay.
7040	DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE UPLAY. And really, does _anyone_ like that crap?  It's what I get for not reading reviews and assuming it would be as awesome as the console version. Uplay BS is completely incompatable with Big Picture mode. It pops up a login window behind Big Picture that you can't get to without a keyboard. You _have_ to create a Uplay account. I will not do that for this one stupid game. I have Steam to manage my games. I don't need another buggy service. I loved the game on Xbox360 but this is unplayable for me. I wish I could get my money back for this garbage.
7041	I bought this game on accident before I noticed the Ubisoft logo. Once again they've taken beautiful artistic software that a team of hard working developers no doubt poured their imaginations into, and done an absolutely terrible job of optimizing it for PC. Truth be told I am completely against purchasing Ubisoft games specifically for this reason. I am on an Alienware M14xR2. I can run Metro 2033 on max graphics with decent framerate or process the insanely dynamic physics of Max Payne 3 with no slowdown. But I can't roll a motorcycle across a one mile patch of dirt without lagging down to 20FPS through the majority of the track? Ubisoft should be inspected for their lack of interest in the quality of their product. Their games should not be shelved until they are properly tested and implemented for the pleasure of the many many consumers who hand over their money for unplayable games. Having said that, I'd give this game a 9/10 IF Ubisoft released a patch that fixed the absolutely abysmal framerate
7042	As of January 2014 - Unless you want to risk a terrible experience, get the game on XBOX 360 instead.  I am a fan of Trials HD and Evolution on my friends XBox 360 saw the game was coming to steam and was excited to play both games on my PC sadly it is a terrible port that does not appear to have been optimized for many computer types.  Whilst a few people are reporting no issues with the game more and more people are experiencing severe lag, stutters and freezing as well as random crashes with no errors, at all resolutions and video setting configurations. This game is based alll around timing and precision so when these factors are broken to begin with it is nigh impossible to play and extremely aggravating.  The game also uses a clunky uPlay DRM launcher, not a massive issue for me, but yet another stepping stone unfortunately.  Before buying do a search on the forums and discussions to see if there have been any fixes for the game yet as currently it is in an unplayable state for many.
7043	It lags in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ manner, very repetitive, boring after about 10min of gameplay. And I didn't even want the damn game, But Steam won't refund so apart from the fact that steam is awesome SCREW YOU STEAM I LOST $30 ON A â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME.
7044	Want single player? buy it, great game, keep in mind you have to login to uplay first, which I HATE. want multiplayer? don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it. me and many other people can't play multiplayer for MONTHS and months, and no real fix ever came. stay away from uplay and windows live games, and if by any chance anyone from those companies is reading this, I want to say â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU, I hate you from the bottom of my heart for games like these.
7045	I am glad I bought this on sale for $5, otherwise I would've asked for a refund. It's a terrible port that you cannot play, even if you have a high end PC. Get the xbox 360 version.  Also, there is nothing wrong with Uplay. The only issue I have had with Uplay so far is the saving for some games, like Splinter Cell Blacklist. My saves are saved on my local machine, so if I reformat and don't save them, then they are gone.... So why would I need the internet to connect to my save file? o_O
7046	This game is very badly optimised for PC with constant frame ripping and jarring slow-down throughout levels. I ain't the only person having these problems and I see no fix from the developers, so don't bother yourself with it!
7047	Why does this â¥â¥â¥â¥ have to run on uplay?  Also game was fun on xbox, on here it just lags and wont load any textures and wont play in fullscreen...complete â¥â¥â¥â¥
7048	Uplay sucks and so does ubisoft support
7049	Don't ever buy this game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ uplay. If you just want to have fun with friend, don't buy this game either 'cause you will never be able to play with them.
7050	what a nightmare to install still not working
7051	love to write a review but the â¥â¥â¥ rapers uplay dont have any servers running. 90+ mins of updating â¥â¥â¥ rapers uplay account logging in updating many times only to be told â¥â¥â¥ rapers uplay site not working. steam you need to separate yourself from â¥â¥â¥ rapers uplay because its hurting your name.
7052	This game does not support Intel Graphics Cards ! So all the textures are messed up ! It should of had a warning but Ubisoft just wants to grab your money so they did not feel like putting a warning or at least make a patch to make it compatible ! What a shame ! Also I heard if you don't hhave the bext graphics card this game will lag .
7053	Awful multiplayer full of issues most of which make it impossible to get on, no real solution to the issue out there and from what I can tell ubisoft support are useless, do not buy if you wanted it for the multiplayer (like i did)
7054	The store page says it 'Requires a Uplay account'. What it doesn't tell you is that launching it through steam actually launches UPlay, rather than you just logging in to the game with your UPlay account. This is pretty disgusting, I do not recommend buying this game here. Go and get it directly through UPlay.
7055	Requires installing uplay, which in turn requires me to create a ubisoft account to be able to launch the game. I did not notice this before purchase, and I'm not going to register to yet another service just to be able to play a game that I already paid for. Money wasted.
7056	UbiSoft uPlay ruins this. Don't give them your money. Torrent/pirate it instead!
7057	I loved this game but it forces u to make an account then u need to put some code or password i dont know :(
7058	Multiplayer still doesn't work after hours of trying to get it working.  Worst port I've seen so far after Dark Souls.  Don't get this if you want to play online or use custom Tracks.
7059	Uplay sucks. Also, you can't progress if you genuinely suck at the game, which is kind of demoralizing.
7060	DO NOT GET!! third party ubisoft bs -.- :(
7061	I hate this I just bought this game and I went to play it but ubisoft told me I needed an activation code!! I never got an activation code. Can someone help me pls.
7062	Bought this in the sale for some multiplayer fun with a couple of friends. The multiplayer does not work. There is no fix available, and it appears that the issues have been around for a while. Wait until someone you know can guarantee it is working.
7063	I am running an MSI GE-40 9O0C with an i7-4702QM, 8 gigs of RAM, and a GTX 760M. It is completely unacceptable that a port from a XBox 360 game does not run properly when installed on the same SSD as the OS. It appears that the game stores memory in RAM for 4-5 run-throughs of the same level, then disposes it, thus 1 of 5 attempts works passably.
7064	Was a fan of earlier versions, but this one takes everything in the wrong direction. It's too graphics intensive and loses the highly responsive arcade style that made it fun. Oh and the music will make you stab yourself in the ears.
7065	Uplay is stupid.
7066	Uplay as usual means multiplayer doesn't work....
7067	Uplay. Ugh.  Avoid until they remove it.
7068	Bad Port i bought the game early only to have to wait to play due to poor preformance and glitchy graphics
7069	Disclaimer: Hundreds of hours played between HD and Evolution on Xbox 360. I love the Trials series, and am a huge fan of this particular game... on Xbox. You'd think the PC version would be better - especially since this series started on PC, right? ... right?  Wrong: PC version of Evolution does not contain the DLC available for the XBLA version, nor is it available at all. Including the tracks from HD was nice - but why leave the rest out?  Ah, Ubisoft. They'd sooner correct you on your interpretation of their carefully crafted misleading statements than actually address a consumer issue. That's exactly what they've done here in the forums. #effubisoft  I bought this game on Steam because I wanted to replay one of my favorites, taking full advantage of the better hardware on my PC. To some degree, that's what I got - the game (mostly) runs at 60 fps @ 1080p - which is great and all - but this version suffers from some real problems... and let's face it - this is Ubisoft we're talking about. They have no intentions of fixing them.   The Problems:  - Uplay (the creamy filling inside Satan's â¥â¥â¥-pimples)  - Poor optimization: stuttering (bad in a game of skill)  - Graphical glitches: mainly all the sprites on screen flickering in unison (distracting in a game of skill)  - Poor multiplayer functionality (some of the most fun I've had with T:E on Xbox is with multiplayer)  - Social media integration that can't be turned off (some might see this as a plus, but I see it as Ubisoft listening too much to focus groups - if I wanted to do stuff like post my replays to youtube, I'd buy a bloody capture card - and nobody I know wants to see the facebook logo in between every match.)  - As stated above, DLC was never released despite 'Gold Edition' title and misleading statement about 'all' content being included. (As a developer pointed out, the statement was not technically inaccurate - but as many forum-goers have said, the statement is all too easy to misinterpret, especially given industry conventions.)  - Uplay (Uplay)
7070	This is a great game but not on pc. The port is one of the worst ports i've ever played. The game is laggy on a good pc and it takes ages to load and sometimes it doesn't even open. I managed to play about 1 hour and now it just refuses to open at all. This seems to be a common, unfixable problem. If you really the game, buy it on the xbox marketplace. At least that version works...
7071	Crippled by Uplay.
7072	HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING POGO STICKING CHRIST THIS IS BAD ON ALL â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LEVELS. THIS GAME IS A HUGE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LOAD OF STEAMING OGRE â¥â¥â¥â¥. LETS START OFF WITH UPLAY. WHEN UDOWNLOAD THIS GAME UNEED TO SPEND A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HOUR FIDDLESTICKING WITH UBISHIT. I JUST WANNA PLAY MY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MOTORCYCLE GAME. SECOND, GLITCHY AS A BETA RELEASE OF SONIC O6 ON HL1 ENGINE. THERE WERE LITERLY BRICKS IN MY CHARACTERS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ WHEN I STARTED THE GAME. AND I KEPT GETTING â¥â¥â¥â¥ING POP UPS IN ANOTHER WINDOW ASKING ME TO CONNECT THIS GAME TO FACEBOOK. THE ONLY THING I WANT TO CONNECT THIS GAME TO IS A TRAIN THAT GOES STRAIGHT TO HELL WITH THE CEO OF UBISOFT AS THE CONDUCTOR. THE TEXTURES ARE SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GLITCHY IN THIS GAME ITS LIKE ONE OF THOSE HOUSES YOU SEE ON A MINECRAFT SERVER THAT LOOKS LIKE A PATCHWORK KILT OF FECES AND VOMIT. WHAT SHOULD EXPECT FROM A COMPANY THATS NAME SOUNDS LIKE WHAT AN ASIAN HOOKER WOULD SAY WHEN YOU PENETRATE HER â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7073	The game itself is fantastic, but due to Uplay being complete â¥â¥â¥â¥... you can't play online due to unresolved NAT issues...  10/10 For Trials single player gameplay  0/10 For Ubisoft being complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ and leaving this games online aspects broken since launch...
7074	Excitebike 2. 25 years too late. Trials was fun right up until the point I regretted spending money on it.
7075	Horrible SLI support. Which basically breaks the game experience.
7076	I cant seem to play Trials Evolution: Gold Edition because of Uplay not being able to work.
7077	Buggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. no maps were loading correctly.
7078	10/10 game, excellent, fun and enjoyable for all ages. Only one problem, UBISOFT. Somehow manages to ruin the entire game. Many examples:  -Ubisoft runs in the background even after closing the game, thus slowing down your computer  -Ubisoft Manages to destroy he multiplayer, Cannot even join my friends due to 'NAT errors' that i tryed to fix countless times. NAT is good on any other game i have ever played  -Ubisoft Manages to ruin one of my favourite xbox 360 games  -Basically this game summed up in one word; 'UBISOFT'  Don't buy this game for PC, you are much better off buying it on xbox 360. If you don't own an xbox 360, still don't buy it for PC. The only thing the works on this game is the single player and track making. Multiplayer is completly 100% broken. Its so sad that such a good game gets ruined by a terrible company. GG UBISOFT G â¥â¥â¥â¥ING G
7079	Played Trials since Trials 2, and then Trials Evolution on Xbox which I sunk over 500 hours into as it was the ultimate 'Got nothing to play' game, and an incredible time killer.  And coming to PC could have been the best thing ever for it, but then uplay happened. Regardless of if you can tollerate uplay or not uplay is a plague, uplay ruins gaming experiance and uplay takes advantage of Steam. Either stick to uplay or rely on Steams DRM. uplay games on Steam are going to be the death of Steam.  If you can overlook or tollerate uplay restricting your access to your games constantly thehn this is great buy. As it's a very simplistic yet addictive game to pick up when you have nothing else to play. However I can't stand uplay.
7080	doesn't have the cd key and doen't know where to find it.... what can i do then?
7081	Do NOT get this game, not worth it at all, the game doesnt even launch, and it also installs Uplay, which has the worst DRM, worse than EA's DRM. The thing I'm most regretful about this purchase is that I can't get a refund.
7082	I tried to play this with my brother and we could not get through a single track. Not because of difficulty, but because the frame rate was so low, and the game kept making my brother 'bail' from his bike. I had higher hopes for this game, and while fun, it feels like it isn't worth the money.
7083	PC Version still has a lot of issues with framerate and connectivity. Technical Support from developer is terrible. Lousy port + UPlay = Don't Buy This.
7084	doesn't have the cd key and doen't know where to find it.... what can i do then?
7085	Buggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. no maps were loading correctly.
7086	I cant seem to play Trials Evolution: Gold Edition because of Uplay not being able to work.
7087	Played Trials since Trials 2, and then Trials Evolution on Xbox which I sunk over 500 hours into as it was the ultimate 'Got nothing to play' game, and an incredible time killer.  And coming to PC could have been the best thing ever for it, but then uplay happened. Regardless of if you can tollerate uplay or not uplay is a plague, uplay ruins gaming experiance and uplay takes advantage of Steam. Either stick to uplay or rely on Steams DRM. uplay games on Steam are going to be the death of Steam.

As it's a very simplistic yet addictive game to pick up when you have nothing else to play. However I can't stand uplay.
7088	This game is terrible theres a graphics glitch that makes everything look horrible,in addition,you have to download uplay in order to opperate the game.
7089	Freakin' frustating game, not for people easy aggrevated. Plus, you need to use UPlay and it suck â¥â¥â¥â¥! Yuck!
7090	lemme ask you a question what the differnce between this game and dog doo. Nothing it dosent even have mr. Krabs or anything that a good game has. It even has a good title screen. 9/10 sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥
7091	I am a big fan of Red Lynx but it hurt to see this 'Ultimate' version - Trails comming back home to PC. I have spent hundreds of hours on the XBOX versions, including DLC, but this version, for various reasons, does not come close.  Why?  There is probably not only one answer to that. UPlay, 'Console port' (controls are great, optimization is not).
7092	Does not include all dlcs from the Xbox 360 version.
7093	Can't get the game to run, any one that can help would be much appreciated.
7094	If you're looking to break your monitor/PC/ anything near you, this is the perfect game for you.
7095	It was fun until i got a new PC and now i cant use thee activation code to play the game... Uplay sucks
7096	I really wish I had seen that this uses UPlay.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ Uplay.
7097	The game itself is not bad but â¥â¥â¥â¥ the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Uplay-Client. Takes ages to get even ingame with your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ synchronization processes. Thanks again for reminding me to never buy an ubisoft game again.
7098	This game is ridiculously frustrating. The worst thing about it is when you are playing a track where you either instantly fail or you instantly win and if you fail you have to wait 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing seconds to play again. They need to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing implement a faster way to restart a track. Also the piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ubisoft launcher is only exitable if you kill the process with the task manager or something. The game keeps running in steam because the launcher is running.
7099	Great game, except there have been many reports (me included) of this game running choppy on high end computers. It is dissapointing that redlynx would do this, and the worse part is that they seem to be very careless, not releasing a patch. Though it is not unplayable, but when you notice it at first, it's a game ruiner.
7100	So far I've tried for about 3 hours to get this game working through Uplay, which you need to use in order to play it, and have not managed to get it running. Uplay support has been everything but helpful and im most likely going to see if i can get this refunded through steam...
7101	I bought the game for the full price, seeing as the Demo had been good on the Xbox.  I should've just bought it on the Xbox instead. The game is literally Unplayable. Every time I try to launch the game, it says 'Installing Uplay' and the screen goes away, after that, it SAYS i'm playing the game for 30 seconds, and then goes back to online mode in my friendslist, and I've never actually been in the game. Uplay is probably the problem here, and I would appreciate it if the devs would actually make the game playable, because spending this much money on a game is absurd.
7102	This piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ excuse for a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is bugged â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Playing 'staring game' with my â¥â¥â¥â¥ is a great deal more entertaining.
7103	Horrid. The game itself is good, but because the game has 3rd party DRM (Uplay) it has no ability to connect to the internet, meaning all of the user created tracks (which are the only good ones) are unplayable.
7104	â¥â¥â¥â¥ UPlay. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DRM services like this that make people pirate video games.
7105	needs uplay to play like everyone else have said...  great game buy it on xbox instead if you own one.
7106	DO NOT GET THIS GAME! At least not on the computer. It is horribly laggy, (I have a pretty good computer and have tried multiple fixes), Has horrible texture issues, and it is overall so bad it makes it impossible to enjoy the game. The game is great on Xbox, so get it there, and not here. The game also makes you get Uplay, Ubisoft's digital distributor. Uplay is the worst!. Trust me, you do not want to suffer like I did just to experience lag and texture issues. I was excited to play this game, but event though I got it on sale, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
7107	Forces you to use UPlay, horrible optimization, laggy, slow. It feels like the game is running at 20fps (even tho it says it's at 60).  Don't buy this. I heard that the console version is good. But just stay away from this on PC.
7108	Steam really needs to be more informative about games that require third party user accounts. I doubt that anyone with a decently specced PC (or indeed many others) ever reads system requirements, where the information is hidden. It should be next to the 'add to cart' button. Part of the Steam deal is that it is a no nonsense platform, and it is implicit in the purchase that you shouldn' have to deal with others in order to get what you paid for. That's why if this is not the case, we need to be told. VERY CLEARLY. Or better yet, kick out the distributors who insist on this rubbish.   TL:DR; GAME REQUIRES 3RD PARTY ACCOUNT
7109	This game doesn't even deserve to be on Steam. Now before you disagree let me explain...  It isn't that the game itself is bad, it isn't. BUT THE GAME DOESN'T EVEN RUN ON STEAM! It runs on Uplay, another gaming hub made by ubisoft. Because of this, you have to create a seperate Uplay account and install Uplay to even get it up and running.   After you get into the game, very few user made levels will load for you. The game itself is great though, so it's really a shame that it has so many issues outside of the actual gameplay. Sometimes, after crashing during a run, the game will say that you have a new personal record even if you have made it much further than that run. You could even crash on the starting line and get a record! This causes a ton of wait time as you have to wait for the new best time to process and save before restarting the level.   The MAIN problem that I had was that even after exiting the game and completely closing Uplay, steam still said I was in game. This is a MAJOR issue. There was no way to take myself out of the game, and this made it impossible to play another game on steam or even close steam. Even going to the task manager and ending the application didn't work. Only restarting my computer finally took me out of the game and that simply cannot happen every time you want to play Trials. That's just a terrible port.
7110	Uplay is a piece of **** soft, made for money only, who the **** need a second steam-like on a steam game ??????? Still got trouble to launch the game sometimes for no reasons, the game just crash and i keep restarting, i should have illegaly downloaded it since devs just don't give a damn about fixing bugs anymore
7111	1) Requires UPlay (not terrible but my dumbass would like a warning since I hate it, I just forgot to check if it was from Ubisoft) 2) Will not run for me on a system that runs everything else. Crash to desktop when loading a map...everytime  
7112	Forced UPLAY. Messed up textures. Laggy gameplay.
7113	If you can manage to complete the replayable 'Logging into Uplay course' then the game isn't half bad however the stupid amounts of DRM make any ubisoft game a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to play.
7114	Don't even bother. You have to install Uplay, and then you need to be logged into both Steam AND Uplay any time you want to play it! It's absolutely ridiculous.
7115	1) Requires UPlay (not terrible but my dumbass would like a warning since I hate it, I just forgot to check if it was from Ubisoft) 2) Will not run for me on a system that runs everything else. Crash to desktop when loading a map...everytime  
7116	The required UPlay is a hassle. Canât even select the language I want to play the game in.  The game has a very easy start. Generally, just pressing accellerate and nothing else will win you gold medals. I hoped for more. It gets better later on though.  The in-game menu is full of spam. Facebook here, stats there. Really annoying.
7117	Barely even can play. I install it, wish to play, have to sign up with the auto-installed UPlay from ubishit, can't remember my password that I made when I was twelve, contact Ubishit, get no reply for a month, contact again, go through password recovery, finally get to play, updates needed, thanks Ubishit, update, log into the game, terribly keyboard support, slow on a GTX 770, exit game, uninstall.
7118	great game plauge by terrible DRM. I've enjoyed playing trials since it was a little flash game on miniclips. I was eager to give this new game a try since it has been exclusive to the xbox. Overall it's a great game, the underlining mechanic is still solid and very enjoyable, the addition of the skill course where you do silly stuff and eaaily access user generated content makes this feel fresh. However, the included Uplay DRM is terrible, you have to make an account with Ubisoft, the game load it everytime you play and instead of steam achievements and cloudsave, Ubisoft decided to do it themselves. Most of the time the cloud save works but I've had instance where it didn't save my progress (only lost 1 or 2 track). Achivements are useless since no one see it and it burry in the terrible UI. The worst thing about Uplay though is the unresponsiveness of the server, the game attempt to save your score after everytrack and it can take anywhere from 5 to 30 s because it has to sync with the server, it basically killed the momentum of the game especially when you just want to jump right back in. User generated contents are awesome but it also very slow and laggy to browse and download. I have to sadly give this amazing game a no for recommendation. If Ubisoft come to their sense and get rid of the terrible Uplay this game is a must own.
7119	Another garbage PC port from console, it's not as bad as Dark Souls but is still annoying and at times unplayable; particularly the 'Icarus' level which tells you to tap the UP and DOWN arrow keys repeatedly in order to 'flap' some fake wings. Guess what? Doesn't work on PC at all.  It forces you to use Uplay, no surprise there. It's terribly optimized. My older PC, which could play many last generation games such as this with high levels of detail, could not play this game. From what I recall this is due to some long unresolved problem with AMD.  It's only worth a purchase maybe (and that's a BIG maybe) if you can pick it up on sale for $5 or $10, and you're a MTX/Trial bike fanatic.
7120	So I think I've played this game enough at this point to give an honest opinion.  This game sucks. Let's go through the reasons why.  1. The graphics - Okay so the graphics aren't terrible, the problem lies in the game engine. You'll have to force your video card to run at full throttle if you have a modern graphics card. For whatever reason this game will not trigger full utilization of my graphics cards. Another huge problem is that textures pop in and out, from blurry to sharp. Objects will pop as well. This makes this game very irritating to play since you need to see the things in front of you in order to know how to approach the next jump. This brings us to our next problem.  2. The camera - I understand that this is a console port, and like every other crappy Ubi console port it suffers. This was evidenced in the graphics and is also apparent in the view with which the game is presented in. It's essentially like a 3D version of the NES classic Excitebike where the view is from the side. However, the viewing angle is schewed a little more toward 70 - 80 degrees. This is very annoying and does not allow you to complete many of the levels on the first attempt. Granted the levels are divided into segments via checkpoints which you can 'reset' to when you inevitably crash. Which brings us to...  3. Level Design - Get ready for some of the most repetitive gameplay ever, with only very small variations on the gas / lean / jump theme. Some levels have some humor to them, and at the end of every track your guy dies in assorted fashions, but the novelty wears off. Some of the levels are just plain infuriating, having predetermind events that affect the layout of the course, often with varying results. Speaking of varying results...  4. Physics - Or complete lack thereof. I still can't figure out why your bike sometimes will act as if it has weight to it like a real motorcycle, yet other times its as if it is floating on a single point that refuses to stabilize. For example, you can land a jump and your bike seems to be planted and you can give it gas and it responds as it should. Another time you can land off that same jump and your bike is almost uncontrolable and just wants to flip backwards no matter how delicate you apply the gas. It makes no sense and ruins the game very easily.  5. - Controls - Quite possibly my biggest complaint with this game. So you control the balance of the bike with gas, brake, and lunge/lean. I say lunge/lean and not just lean because there is no way for you to gently lean your bike forward. Any bit of input toward the right results in your rider thrusting his face over the handlebars. Which interferes with blancing landings and climbing wills since this motion will pull your back wheel off the ground and usually results in an endo.  6. - Uplay - Is a joke. If you've ever had to use Uplay then you understand. Whats the point of buying the game on Steam if we're forced to use Uplay?  Save yourself some money and go find an old copy of Motorcross Madness. That is a much more entertaining game and is over a decade old. Oh and textures won't pop in and out...
7121	This game does not support integrated graphics, so a number of rigs will run with bizarre, frustrating textures. This game also requires Uplay, another client like steam, which can be trouble. Servers are problematic, cheaters rampant! Do not buy!  Edit: Works fine on my new laptop, but I haven't touched it in a while.
7122	The game is great, Uplay is not.
7123	Doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work. Refunded. Uplay is trash. EDIT: Just found out it doesn't work on windows 8.1. I can't get a steam refund either. Trials fusion it is I guess.
7124	Requires Uplay platform, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
7125	It was fun until i got a new PC and now i cant use thee activation code to play the game... Uplay sucks
7126	This Uplay/Ubisoft crap is hardly worth the effort. If you're willing to jump through all the hoops to play it, go ahead. Otherwise, just leave this game be.
7127	This was a double dip for me as I originally played this on the 360. Fantastic game, but not on Steam. Forced Uplay which is absolute garbage and it doesn't run well at all on my machine, which isn't exactly low end. Texture popping, lag in the menus, framerate dropping way below 20 most of the time. Even on low settings this thing is awful. Terrible port, which is expected from Ubisoft. Learned my lesson, won't be buying Ubisoft again if I can help it.
7128	Let me say first this is a great game. However I cannot fully recomend this game for it making you use Uplay. Its a pain and means I have to go out of my way to play it. If you can play this superb game some other way DO IT because it will be easier. Dont be fooled this is a fun acade like game that is worth playing if you feel the need to go out of your way and set it up. If the Uplay accounts where not involved I full heartly recomend this to about anyone. I only have about six hours into this game where I came in expecting to put in over 200 hours because Uplay accounts are a pain to set up. It is in my opinion the best game in the franchise.
7129	Admittably I've had a reasonable amount of fun with this game in the last couple of days, but I have two main problems with it.  First of all, the controls are clumsy when you get a bit further in the game. They feel quite good at first, but after you've unlocked the most agile bike with the A license, you realize how clumsy the controls actually are. At least if you're playing with the keyboard, you can't gently shift your weight on the bike to one direction or the other. Just a slight tap on the left or right arrow will make your guy push as hard as he can on the foot rests, which will cause him to leap in the air with the light weight A license bike, completely messing up whatever you intended to do, like climb a steep hill. This makes it quite impossible to enjoy the more challenging stages. The stages honestly seem to be getting progressively cooler as the game goes on, but the clumsy controls ruin it. The 450cc bike will probably be the last one you'll have fun with.  Secondly, it forcefully installs Uplay on your machine when you install the game.
7130	Contradictory to my recommendation... screw this game and the horse it rode in on. The learning curve is nice and gradual until you reach the 'Hard' and 'Extreme' levels. You will want to shoot yourself in the knee cap with a sriracha tipped crossbow bolt just to numb the pain in your head trying to endure this level of difficulty in a game. Have patience. You will definitely need it. That or a warehouse full of extra controllers needed to replace the ones you will imbed in the foundation of your home, so far they will never be seen again. Great game, painfully hard.  REVISED: I don't recommend this game anymore. I can't in good conscience condone this sort infliction on anyones soul. F%$# this S$%T.
7131	Horrible computer port. Graphics aren't anything spectacular, but it stresses my GPU to the point of lowering the frame rate to unplayable levels. They've done nothing about it in the few years its been out. Uplay also needs to be launched, yet more Ubisoft DRM.   Skip. Its great on Xbox, sucks on PC.
7132	Do not buy because it has lame â¥â¥â¥ DRM â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and requires you to create an account. No thanks.
7133	This Uplay/Ubisoft crap is hardly worth the effort. If you're willing to jump through all the hoops to play it, go ahead. Otherwise, just leave this game be.
7134	If you lose your key, you're screwed.
7135	Contradictory to my recommendation... screw this game and the horse it rode in on. The learning curve is nice and gradual until you reach the 'Hard' and 'Extreme' levels.

Great game, painfully hard.  REVISED: I don't recommend this game anymore. I can't in good conscience condone this sort infliction on anyones soul. F%$# this S$%T.
7136	GET THIS ON CONSOLES!!! Do not make the same mistake by buying this horribly ported piece of garbage on steam. First, it forces you to make a Uplay account, which is completely unnecessary. Second, My computer surpasses the specifications, but still the horrible framerate renders this game unplayable. I bought this game on sale thinking i would save some money. Instead I wasted five dollars. I own Trials HD on Xbox and I really enjoy it. I have no doubt that this is an amazing game, but the PC port is embarrasing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. The reason I have 3 hours clocked on it is because I left it running by accident and then, 3 hours later, restarted my computer.
7137	FOR F.Åª.C.K SAKE ANOTHER BROKEN GAME BECAUSE OF U-PLAY  This is a great game BUTTTTTTT......  * U-Play is one of my most hated programs * You need U-Play to run this game * The multiplayer DOES NOT work (i spent 5 hours maby more trying to get it to work) * U-Play has deleted my saves multiple times  ________________________________________________________________ Ubisofts method of helping people is stupid F.U.L.L F.Åª.C.K.I.N.G S.T.O.P   https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/FAQ/9/4241/multiplayer-connection-issues-in-trials-evolution-gold/kA030000000eZ3WCAU  ^Litterally does not solve anything... ________________________________________________________________  Also other games that Ubisoft has broken that i know of  Farcry 3 Farcry 3 BloodDragon  Atleast Black Flag Runs great  ================================================================== If you are able to connect with a friend at this very moment plese let me know ==================================================================
7138	i would love to play this game but uplay didnt agree
7139	Requires Uplay. 'Account creation unavailable, please try agian later.'
7140	This game is terribly optimized, it runs like â¥â¥â¥ in my computer, and UPlay is the worst thing ever. It's a shame considering that the game itself is pretty damn good. UPlay is the new Games for Windows Live
7141	I can't in good faith recommend this game. Don't get me wrong the game itself is pretty fun but there's a big drawback to being able to play this game. You have to use Ubisoft's Uplay service to play the game. So not only do you log into Steam to launch the game, you then have to log into Uplay to play the game. Even if you're only playing single player you have to log in twice.
7142	This game requires Uplay. It does not mention this on the store page, like it does with Ubisoft's other titles, but you do need to have an account.   A real shame, as I really want to play this game.   GG Ubisoft
7143	Literally unplayable, the worst performance I've ever witnessed
7144	Trials Evolution looked like a good game and since it was on sale I decided to buy it. Unfortunately not only does it use Uplay which is annoying for anyone who hates third parties and account that need to be created. But Trials Evolution developers have decided that the graphics card that millions of people like myself use are 'inferior' and if we have that graphics card we can not play. The graphics card I talk of is intel which is a popular brand and is perfectly fine running other games I own. If you do use Intel graphics card do not get this game because it will resemble being on LSD. A stupid choice by the developers that means everyone in my situation that has bought the game is unable to fix the problem without spending an insane amount of money on a new graphic card. Thank god I got this lump of **** in the sales.
7145	This may be a negative review, but it is because the specs on my laptop do not work at all with this game. I have an Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics card on my system, and it works relatively well with most games, but with this game specifically everything goes out of wack. All the textures glitch, the game stutters like mad, and it is an overall unenjoyable experience. The game should run well on a better system, and I would love to be able to actually play this game without the lag and texture problems.   If you have a mediocre system, then I would highly reconsider buying this game.  If you are suffering with my graphics card, then I would  definitely  reconsider buying this game.
7146	can anyone tell me why this game keeps crashing?
7147	It depend on the person, But for me it was so boring..
7148	Terrible. Firstly, this uses Uplay, from WITHIN steam. expect disaster left right and centre as the two dont mix. Secondly. an arbitrary screen resolution limit is placed on the game if your computer doesnt support DX11. Don't worry this game doesnt use directx only features, it just limits you to 1280x720 if you can only support DX10.  DO NOT BUY THIS. YOU WILL REGRET IT
7149	Wow, what an utter failure on PC. This was an obvious port (even though they added stuff) and its probably the worst optimized game I've seen on PC in years. Were way past this terrible port phase arnt we? This requires you to log in to Uplay as well. I run an above average gaming rig and this game lags on lowest settings. The devs dont give feedback about fixes or reply to users posts. This was a waste of a good game and they lost a Trials fan by releasing it.
7150	Don't get me wrong, I LOVE a good, fair challenge (see: Dark Souls) but some of the levels in this game...what the HELL?! Maybe I just lack the patience to try a single jump 100 times, but the pay-off isn't even slightly worth it.  EDIT: Oh yeah. Forgot to mention how terrible UPlay is. It's absolute garbage.
7151	This game is almost unplayable due to the lag and general choppiness of the graphics. I have an i7 3630QM, 8GB of RAM, and two GeForce GT650M's and this game is still painful to play. I'm sure it's not an issue if you have three GTX Titans, but I feel very sorry for anyone who bought this and doesn't have dedicated graphics.
7152	Fun, but you get tired of it very fast...
7153	It forces you to use uPlay and for that alone it's not worth it. Double DRM can seriously f**k off. Also, 20 euro for what is a glorified cyclomaniacs. So glad I picked it up for 3 euro in the Christmas sale.
7154	the game wont work for me so i have wasted money and i loved this game on xbox very dissapointed
7155	2 complaints  1: Meant to be on xbox, very poor on pc. 2: UPLAY
7156	I have paid 16 pound for this game which I cannot play. Why? Uplay is down. I cannot switch to offline mode because I need to log in to online mode at least once before playing.   'A Ubisoft service is not availiable at the moment. You can try again later or switch to offline mode'  How long do I have to wait? I could pirate this game and play now. Uplay is a pointless waste of everybodies time.  Pros Screenshots look good  Cons Can not play game due to Uplay being unavailible.
7157	Stupid Uplay software means extra time waiting for extra downloads, and more account management which isn't helped by the fact that it wont tell you if you wrote wrong account or password, and once you try and reset password it wont tell you either, so add even more time waiting for an email which is never coming because there is no account bound to the email address entered... can't you just let me play the game I just bought? ffs
7158	The UI and UX is awful. Load times are abysmal not to mention uPlay shenanigans. I fortunately got the game on sale, but that still doesn't make up for the fact this is a really shoddy port. Unless you have DX11, you can only play at a max of 1600x900. Yeah. The game barely keeps at a smooth framerate, even with all the settings low. I would be okay with uPlay if only it weren't for it trying to upload to leaderboards EVERY SINGLE track, causing a 10 second pause between every retry.  I really want to like this game, and I do, but actually getting to the gameplay is a different story.
7159	STUPID. the game has buggy textures (on the bike and parts of the background) You use a code to play it on uplay, I used the code on uplay and forrgot my password and put my gmail as a acount i do not have SO i cannot play the game (Unless there is a way to get a cod/and to fix the textures) D:  10/10 for the game 1/10 for the fact it doesnt work on windows 8 2/10 beacouse of the code system
7160	Fun, but you get tired of it very fast...
7161	Terrible port, completely unplayable for me on a 670. Take care and make sure you try the game whilst you can still get a refund.
7162	I wanted to play this game, but the game wanted me to log into Uplay first. â¥â¥â¥â¥ that â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7163	Awful. Waste of space on the HDD.
7164	The UI and UX is awful. Load times are abysmal not to mention uPlay shenanigans. I fortunately got the game on sale, but that still doesn't make up for the fact this is a really shoddy port.

7165	I've stuffed 100s of hours into this game on Xbox, so when I heard it was comming to Steam, I was so happy. Then Uplay happened. This was worth the trouble of going through it, but that darn Uplay! Never works! I was finnaly able to make an account but it won't let me sign in! 'A Uplay service is unavailable right now :('. I thought I'd let it go over night then the same problem. Whoa! Offline mode! 'If this is your first time usig Uplay on this computer, you must log in at least once before using offline mode'. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU*Sips Tea* UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU UPLAY!!!
7166	hello i would like to point out that your game is not available for mac, as a very valuable customer of trials, who has it on every console except now for mac, you may wanna make this available for mac, as i lost my job and cannot afford trials fusioin, maybe this will help but im just a needle in a haystack dont be in it for the money be in it for the fans
7167	Don't let the 3d graphics fool you this is just a shiney expensive 2d flash game. My fault for not doing a ton of research before I bought it on sale. Requires uplay registration and conectivity as well.
7168	Uses UbiSoft UPlay, not worth buying it for this alone!
7169	What a major, utter dissapointment. Was waiting to acquire this game for quite a while cause I loved the first one and it's such a mess, performance wise. It's complete garbage, hot garbage! It's obviously a non-optimized console port, from the Xbox 360 era, you can clearly notice it from the first slideshow of a playthrough. I can play all kinds of games old and new, and this game plays like crap. If this was some sort of turn-based game, well... performance wouldn't be really much an issue but being a Trials game it requires precision, fluidity and smooth framerates at all times and all of that is missing. Plus it's ridden with u-caca, that p.o.s. DRM platform by Ubisoft, it's even more intrusive and bothersome here than it is in the acceptable and enjoyable Driver: San Francisco game, for whatever reason.  I recommend to skip this game and instead just get Trials 2: Second Edition, it's still fun and plays really well. Go for it when on sale!
7170	Great Game, but to bad it doesnt run because Uplay is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7171	gigatrack can suck my â¥â¥â¥â¥
7172	You have to use Uplay to play this game
7173	Requires you to create an account and login through the Uplay client. That would be fine if Uplay actually worked!
7174	Great game theory. Controlling the balance of the rider is clunky. The rider does not return to center when the joystick returns to center, instead choosing to lean forward or backward depending on the last input. It is possible to center the rider, but the high sensitivity (Which is not adjustable) makes it very difficult.  Installs 'uplay' spam.   Would not recommend.
7175	Don't spend money on this. The game has no support at all from Microsoft, in most GPU's it lags a lot with HUGE fps drops. I would suggest getting a Demo before buying it or it'll happen like me that I bought it, play it one month and then uninstalled it because it was impossible to play due to the fps drops.
7176	Doesn't work. Damn Uplay doesn't launch it! edit: It's okay
7177	Uplay, it's that bad.
7178	Uplay ruins the experience...
7179	i cant get my code. so dumb dont buy this crap
7180	This game is good from the little i've played but for some reason every time I try to play a track the game crashes I don't get anything like this from any other steam game and I assume it is because of uplay.
7181	very broken dosent matter how good your computer is it has huge lag spikes finding a match takes half an hour compared to the xbox versoin this game is as broken as fudge
7182	Out of the 200 or so games I own on Steam, this is the only game that I want my money back. This is such a horrible console port it's like a time machine to 2005. Ubisoft is terrible. Uplay is terrible. This game is junk.
7183	wont even launch, stuck in a loop between steam and uplay. â¥â¥â¥â¥ DRM AND â¥â¥â¥â¥ UBISOFT.
7184	The fact that you have to download some Uplay crap makes me just literally uninstall the game immediately.  The framerate was utterly terrible and it seems the key control response seems way off.  After 0.5 hours of this game I did a 'Rage Quit' and uninstalled it.
7185	lags like a mother â¥â¥â¥â¥er on my msi laptop
7186	This game is full of bugs, not worth the Â£15.99. It's barely worth the Â£1.99 i paid in the sale. Even worse it struggles to run over 20 fps even with a gtx 770!!!
7187	This Game is complete garbage. I bought it just to play multiplayer, but so far it is refusing to allow me to do so. I want my money back. Rating: 2/10  Don't waste your money.
7188	Warning! Will force you to install UPLAY! Disappointed. Cool game anyway.
7189	I didn't mind UPlay, but then I took a BEX to the knee (a thousand times in a row).  For some weeks, thanks to UPlay I could successfully launch this about one of twenty attempts.    Pretty unjolly console port with frame rate issues and other weirdnesses. Some nuances of the control scheme bother me far more than in previous Trials games. I'm not a fan of this one, and Trials Fusion seems much worse still.   Rating:   DON'T BUY THIS  
7190	Lesson learned about reading the reviews before buying a game. it installs a DRM and demands an account creation to play this thing. I would have gladly paid $20 for a pile of dogshit but this game doesnt even come CLOSE to the high standards that dogshit demands. Its like playing excitebike while on a bad acid trip. I'd rather play excitebike to be honest.    ____________________DO NOT BUY THIS GAME___________________
7191	This is simply based on my personal experience with this version of the game. I purchased this game already for the Xbox 360 when it came out and had a great time with it. Since I loved it so much I bought it a second time so I can play it on my PC. I made a mistake thinking I'd get the same experience with this version.   Unfortunately it was a $20 poorly invested. This is a shantily put together PC port. Despite my machine having more than enough power to run this game, I can't even get this thing to run at my monitor's native resolution (1920x1080). I've done research and found this has to due with cards that can't run DirectX11. Only the thing is, my card DOES run Dx11, so that doesn't make sense.   Even so, running it at a vastly lower resolution, the game is still choppy, ugly and unplayable. Throw in the fact that you have to run this crap using Ubisoft's crappy Uplay software, I find it extremely difficult to recommend this product to PC gamers.   If you own a console, buy it on there. But this PC port is best ignored.
7192	Had it on Xbox 360 and it was really good. On here it runs poorly and the online multiplayer doesn't work at all. There are almost no maps available to download and play either. Not worth getting
7193	UPlay is such a steaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. The game itself is fun. I can play the demo lovely without the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is Uplay. Shame Ubisoft are a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
7194	Surprise surprise Ubisoft blew it again. Crashes immediately with no fix in sight, â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ubisoft so hard, this is my favorite game that I can't play now
7195	DONT BUY IT. THE STUPID ACTIVATION CODE DIDENT WORK FOR ME SO THE GAME PRACTICLY RIPED ME OF 5 BUCKS.
7196	I have not yet gotten a chance to play this game because I never got an activation key. Biggest waste of $20 in my life. I would recommend this game but NOT through steam, download directly through uplay or something.
7197	Broken. All I can say.  This was an enjoyable game but the last update, which was quite some time ago, broke the multiplayer. If you want to play all by yourself go ahead and pick the title up, but without company it turns into a RAGE game real quick.
7198	 WARNING :  Ubisoft forces you to install 'Uplay'(Ubisoft game client) on your computer in order to play this game.  The version pushed by steam currently(13/11/2015) is buggy and the game wouldn't launch. Instead of spending Friday after work playing the game I bought on Steam, I had to contend myself to finding fixes for uPlay on forums. After all of this, they have the gall to advertise you other games(which have nothing to do with this one) within uPlay before letting you play.  I guess it's easier to create worthless software and force it on everyone, than it is to create VALUE that people will come looking for themselves. If I wanted uPlay installed on my computer, I would install it myself.  The developpers did a great job on the game if you like the genre, I just can't stand scummy behavior by publishers so that's why it gets thumbs down.
7199	I do not recommend this game if you have access to the Xbox 360 or PS3. This game gives the illusion that it would be the complete version of these games, but it is not. This has only the core games of HD and Evolution. The DLC available on 360 and PS3 is completely nonexistent here.  If you want to play these games, get them on the console, not here. If you don't have the console? Then this is still a really good game despite that. The core games are good and great. But the lack of DLC spoiled the purchase for me and so I got a refund. If you find enjoyment in this, go for it. But if you have the consoles, buy this game on there.
7200	â¥â¥â¥â¥ you steam you had to make a game that needs to have a stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing program that makes this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ work properly so steam i hope you take a large metal pipe and shove it up your tiny little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! You damn plebs. 0 out of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 10!
7201	the game cant be played if you are using a intell graphics chip.
7202	very bad pc port. if you play with a controller it might be ok, but frustrating bad controls with a keybord. Framerate drops from time to time makes the gameplay even worse.
7203	It sucks
7204	Don't buy this game, it is not optimized.. So if you have a old computer like me there is a big chance it wont even work sadly enough.
7205	It didn't require uplay when i bought it, now it does. wish i could get a refund
7206	The game is fun, however almost everyone trying to play is currently running into NAT issues. So, if you're playing solo it's a good time. As soon as you want to try online play or racing a friend forget about it. Game's been broken awhile and the devs aren't doing much to help.
7207	Just bought this game on winter sale, should have checked the Steam forums for the red flags. The game is unplayable due to constant stutters at a consistent interval, they even persist within the UI. I can knock the settings to 640x480 windowed and all effects disabled and the same framerate and stutters exist. I repeat the framerate is unchanged from 1080p AA advanced effects to 640x480 windowed! The quality of this console port is unbelievable! All I want is a refund but Steams policy is clear no refunds are issued. Thanks alot Ubisoft/Steam for still offering this game in a highly popular flash sale while it's unplayable and obviously without the support of the developers Red Lynx. Worst part is it was like this from beta to full release and all patches ignored the problem and all devs gloss over the issue even though the fans called them out. I uploaded a video to show, its much worse In realtime and it creates even worse input lag. Watch the in-game clock to see the freezing.         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Trials Evolution HD Gold edition Stutters and Freezes&nbsp;
7208	First this whoke crap of logging on to uplay is stupid same thing with EA's bullstuff. I had to make a stupid account I don't want to play the game, then it wouldn't let me make an account. Now I have one, I logged on to the website did all the annoying stuff. Now I still can't play the game, it says I need to log on before I can log on the first time. Game won't play, uplay is gay I hope it goes the way of GFWL&gt;
7209	This is a vastly inferior port of the Xbox version. There is a bug where the game will sit and do nothing for 2-3 minutes every time you finish a track. You end up spending more time waiting for the game than you do actually playing it. The issue has been marked on their forum as Known Issue for 7 months and they still have no fixed it.
7210	Don't buy this game, it is not optimized.. So if you have a old computer like me there is a big chance it wont even work sadly enough.
7211	Need to finish 1st on EVERY tracks to get the next ones. And when you can't reach the 1st place, you're stuck. Personnaly i'm stuck at 1/3 of the game. This sucks !
7212	No XBOX maps or DLC No Support No Thriving community No Help from devs No getting rid of uplay No fixing of problems  Don't give them your money. And maybe not anymore money for their games in the future.
7213	very bad pc port. if you play with a controller it might be ok, but frustrating bad controls with a keybord. Framerate drops from time to time makes the gameplay even worse.

7215	Love love love the game. HATE HATE HATE Uplay. Seriously. When a game this good is often neglected for the simple reason of not wanting to deal with the bloat that comes with it, there is something terribly wrong.   An other wise fantastic game marred by Ubisoft opting to, yet again, throw their garbage Uplay app in your face. And to be perfectly honest, it wouldn't be so bad, but it's yet another username and password, and yet another thing that has to be updated constantly. Try playing this game using Steams new remote play and the Uplay app will almost surely bomb the whole experience and make you hit up google just to find a way to play the game without Uplay. It's that bad, and it's a damn shame they continue to force this nonsense down our throats. I will not buy the new Trials game, or any other Ubisoft game until they do away with it. I've had it.
7216	AAA graphics and sound, with Flash app gameplay (seriously, the only controls are accelerate/brake, lean forward/lean back; it's a game to be played one-handed). Entertaining enough to be worthwhile if you find it for under $5, but don't bother otherwise. Thankful that I bought it during the Black Friday sale.  Be warned, it requires registration and login to Ubisoft's Uplay network, which is intensely annoying.

7218	The Devs really need to listen to all the feedback they are getting because the port over to the PC is nothing short of shoddy. I have frame rate issues on this game and I really shouldn't. I also have to wait an age for the game to save my score at the end of each level. These are things that should have been sorted out eons ago! I simply can't recommend this game as it stands. If you really want to play it, download the Xbox version.
7219	I'll play it when Uplay isn't shoved down my throat.  I'm sure the game is fine though.
7220	it sucks i payed for it downloaded it made a u play acount but i still can't play it because it says i need an activation code but i didn't get one
7221	This game requires Uplay to play it, I wish it was possible to get a refund on Steam.  Warning! Do not buy!
7222	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing uPlay, Multiplayer servers are down. Although the singleplayer is really good when League is loading.
7223	It sucks
7224	Don't buy this game, it is not optimized.. So if you have a old computer like me there is a big chance it wont even work sadly enough.
7225	Years have past and they still have no fix for frame rate issue. Looks like red lynx go`s on my 'game studio`s that are â¥â¥â¥â¥'list. Congratulations.
7226	It was pretty fun up until the ski level. Then I just lost interest and unfortunately you can't play any other levels until you beat the ski level. I wanted to ride motorbikes, not skis. Would be nice to skip that awful level and play some others but I guess the game doesn't want you to have fun. For this reason and Uplay, I cannot recommend this game.

7230	Well If you forget your information fear not! This game will be easily impossible to play since their support sucks
7231	â¥â¥â¥â¥ uplay and broken game launching.
7232	Game kept crashing on me on both my Windows 7 system and Windows 10. Coudn't get past the first few seconds of the music on load.  Returned for refund.

7236	i cant even play the game its a pos
7237	i cant even play the game its a pos
7238	This game is awful, pure crap. Plus they stopped supporting it, I haven't seen a patch since release day.
7239	I couldn't make it into the game at all. It crashes on the start screen. I'm using Intel HD 5500 integrated graphics, so that may be the issue.
7240	The game is very good. Uplay is completely rubish, it asks you to connect to steam, it is slow and really a pain. To play on the internet is completely disabled by that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ app from ubisoft, the greatest crap creator! Thank you for vaccination to any of your games. Greetings!
7241	Well it's hard to either recommend this game or not. But since the negative things overweigh, I choose to not recommend this game.  The positive things: - Mowing down zombies which explode. Fun! - Bonus for mowing down even more zombies, wohoo! - A game that doesn't need any explanation and is simple.  The negative things: - Driving can be very frustrating, since you very often get stuck on some stupid corners. And half of the time you're maneuvring back and forth and back an forth and back an forth, while insulting the bad controls with a very foul language. I'm from Lower Bavaria / Germany, which makes this even worse. - You never see what's coming, since the camera angles (no matter which one you chose) takes away any sight or fun. - Time limits, time limits, time limits. Of course not every mission has to be completed in a certain amount of time, but it's annoying as hell if you have to. Why do game makers don't realize we hate time limits as much as we hate escort missions? - Most of the time you're searching for a route to your objective, instead of just driving and giving zombies some hell. The map is very confusing and of course your objectives are at the most far end of the map. The military has helicopters, but meh, f--- this s---, let's just send a normal car instead. The city's completely overrun with zombies and world is in peril, but that's fine. A normal car will do juuust fine! - The cars are a joke. I understand that you're beginning slowly with a taxi, a limo, a van, and that every car has its specific speed, passenger seats and maneuvrabilty. Thats ok, because one has to begin slowly. But they are boring and it's not really getting any better. No special cars or anything. The bulldozer and the tank, which are FUN AS HELL every meter you drive them, you're only allowed to use in one, maybe two missions. Yeah, just take the fun away from the player, I don't think he doesn't mind at all. Let's tease him with greatness and bash him afterwards. It's like getting the biggest and most-fun weapon of a game and than losing it forever and never being able to use it again. - The ending. Really? It seems the creators of this game lost any interest or motiviation or had been cut really short in terms of available time. It seems kind of unfinished.  The things that don't matter: - For a simple game like this it has an evolving story. Which doesn't make sense. Because yeah, let's send a taxi driver in a city overun with zombies to get some crucial things, while the bulldozer and the tank and all the military stays at the base. Are you kidding? Why not a person on a bicycle, just to make things interesting? Yeah, take this, zombie! *bashes zombiehead with club*  Things that could make this game awesome: - A camera angle which actually puts some fun and clarity in the gameplay. - More cars / vehicles which also look differently after upgrading. - Cars that feel like cars and not like toy cars or bricks. - The option to buy upgrades before you start the mission. Not finding powerups during the missions. You can include an arcade mode where this is enabled by default, I'm fine with that. But for story mode it's uninspiring and fun-breaking. Even with the upgrades your machine gun only has 300 rounds - if you pick up the flame thrower, the machine gun's gone. Mission briefing, upgrading the car, killing zombies. This should be the way. So what is the problem? One can never concentrate in mowing down zombies. Instead you're constantly on the lookout for said powerups.  Overall, it's a decent little game, which could be an effin awesome game, if they just would have put some awesomeness in it. I did not finish the game and after failing in a mission several times and watching videos of the last missions on YouTube, I'm glad I didn't finish the game. It would be absolutely not rewarding.
7242	Zombies, cars, big weapons and gore. What could possible go wrong? Well, the chunky controlls on both, mouse + keyboard and Xbox controller.  Surprisingly, it's worse with the controller, not with the keyboard.  
7243	good game,louds of blood,,good story,...........but in blood rase mode game is crashing WTF/?????????????????????
7244	Right, well it's miles better than the first one anyway! Which is to say, it's not a great game by any means, but it's certainly... playable.  Basically, y'know Micro Machines: Military Madness? What's that, you don't? Oh, it's this really great (as I remember it) Mega Drive tank racing game! Well anyway, this game is like that game... but not nearly as good. Go play that instead.
7245	I would have avoided wasting 10 minutes, if I had cleared the mission. I would have cleared the mission, if I had killed the zombies faster. I would have killed the zombies faster, if I had a fair amount of ammo. I would have had a fair amount of ammo, if I could aim the car correctly. I would have aimed the car correctly, if I could have controls that aren't clunky. I would have controls that aren't clunky, if the gameplay was better designed.  I would have liked this game, if the gameplay was better designed. 
7246	Viewpoint and Controls: Two basics that Zombie Driver screws-up. Each on their own would be bearable, but not being able to see where you're going and not being able to respond appropriately when you get there is a killer blow. The campaign is alright but you'll have more fun playing one of the normal Zombie/Alien Shooter games that doesn't hinder you with an unresponsive/over-responsive vehicle.  
7247	the video shows it to be great, but the reality is that you can never really drive fast and ram zombies. the controls are so clunky, the game is too easy, and the cars drive way faster than you can possibly comprehend the map that is loaded with obstacles. if you play this game your time will mostly be spent bumping itnto walls and trying to turn around or changing from drive to reverse. its such a shame that a game can fall so ahrd on the basics like controls. maybe its because i played on keyboard, maybe not. also you cant change any graphics settings.
7248	I thought this would be a great game, going around using your vehicle as a weapon and killing all the zombies. However, everything in the game is against you. When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die. You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors. Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged. Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car! At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car! The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful. You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more.
7249	A lot of fun for a few missions, then the problems quickly add up. I've never seen a game like this with such a large amount of small annoying problems that all add up to one big disappointment. I was constantly shaking my head and squinting my eyes in disbelief at the stupid little ways in which they did most things that they could have done differently/better. It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great. Or actually probably not since it's vehicle combat meaning you only fire in one direction: forward. Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and â¥â¥â¥â¥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again. lol.  There are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail. The bottom line is that this is just not fun for long because of poor design concepts and new flaws popping up constantly as the game progresses.  5/10
7250	Visually cluttered to the extent that I couldn't see the track clearly enough to drive round it competitively, so either the game is too fast paced, or the track needs to be more clearly defined.  Gave up before realising that I'd driven the same race several times and that I was supposed to select the next one. It's not the worst game on Steam, but it didn't draw me in as an intuitive and fun experience. It's rough around the edges, but atleast it's cheap and works.
7251	The controls for driving in this game are terrible with keyboard. I will most likely change this review as soon as I get a controller if it turns out to be good. 
7252	ZOMBIES ARE NOT THE ENEMY. THE CONTROLS ARE.
7253	i have had the worst experience with this game when i run it it has an unknown error ive spent hours trying to figure it out and nothing  
7254	Vehicle and camera movement are awful, otherwise this would be a fun game.
7255	Fun while it lasts, but alas hit 'n' run is about all you get.
7256	Great looking game, great idea, but the steering is horrible, and it ruins the game.
7257	Thanks to the awful camera system I only lasted five vomit-inducing minutes. I've no idea how people completed this game. They can't be human.
7258	The game was interesting and certainly a unique concept but unfortunately I found the game unplayable. The car acted clunky and unreallistic. The voice acting and sound effects were less than great. Of course this game is in early release so I am sure they are dealling with this.
7259	What a terrible game.  Firstly, the map has too many things I collide into. In a game like this, you'd expect to be driving around at high speeds, mowing down hordes and hordes. But no, instead when you navigate around you must take your time and try not to ram into every little thing! It slowed down the game so badly, and this has got to be one of the worst parts, since the 1 hour I spent was carefully driving slowly, so I don't bump into something.  What about the other 30 dreadful minutes I spent? Well, let's say it was just killing a few zombies here and there, but it wasn't exciting in any way. Just shooting them, drive away, shoot, probably run over them a bit, it wasn't too satisfying really. The bosses were also ridiculously hard for some reason, I just stopped though by the time I killed the 1st one, it was so boring.  Oh yeah, I completely forgot there was a story that was just shoved in, trying to interest you, but it didn't. At least they tried to make one though, but I would've prefered nothing.  I hate this game. I spent a dollar on it and I still regret my decision.
7260	This game is more of an arcade type of game with not very many upgrades. Also the gameplay wasnt even that great. Honestly the only slightly cool thing in my opinion is the zombie bosses. This is more of a game for people who like a challenging driving game and pick up upgrades on the side of the rode. Personally I dislike it and I didnt know what I was expecting when I bought thankfully I got it when it was on sale for a cheap price but I still wouldnt suggest it to anyone of my friends though.
7261	this game got my confused i always wanted to PLAY a zombie theni bought this and i get just automobile, you never get to see driver is he realy zombie or not?? so huge let-down for me..
7262	Driving is stupid as ape. You should only use WASD for driving...
7263	Graphics are HORRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY  3/10
7264	2016 and still there are games where you can't bind keys. WTF dude.  Basically, if you don't have qwerty keyvboard, can't play.
7265	you crash in every wall..useless speed..
7266	ä¹°äºç©ä¸äºï¼ï¼ï¼ä¸ç´æ¥éï¼ï¼ï¼ Some ERROR has occured and it can't be played.
7267	the game is ok, can be boring, can also be fun. if you like cars and killing zombies can get some power up - But very repetive, you have to do some quests or side quests to move on.  If u are into cars and into racing things, this might be for you, you will also kill some zombies in the progress but don't really expect too much fun from the game though.  i give this 6/10
7268	Gave it a shot- it was $2.49... its ok. cars handle differently, and hitting zombies with them has impact. Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid.   EDIT: OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option.... Free Camera mode is a little better. And the game threw a Defend this Area type mission... but its still made me dizzy a bit. I think the camera is too close and has to adjust itself too often since you can be driving quite fast. so yea.... i still would not really recommend.
7269	So I picked this up in the weeklong sale for $3.  The gameplay seems fun. I like the upgrade system and the car handles generally well.  I asked for a refund because the camera movement is crazy and makde me feel ill. I haven't ever gotten that feeling from a game before but Zombie Driver HD got me feeling sick. So buyer beware!
7270	Sweet Jesus.  from the wiki: 'Motion sickness or kinetosis, also known as travel sickness, is a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement. Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness.[1]  Dizziness, fatigue, and nausea are the most common symptoms of motion sickness.[2] Sopite syndrome in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness. Nausea in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship).[3][4] If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting won't relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person could vomit until the cause of nausea is found.'  Well, 'the cause of the nausea' has been found and its name is 'Zombie Driver HD'. Seriously, if you were to design a game to cause 'a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement', this would be it. Zombie Driver HD, is basically a vomit simulator . . . in HD (or should that be 'stimulator'? I dont know. I've just been playing it, so im fairly disorientated).  I would highly recommend trying the demo before you buy, as watching the trailer does not do justice to the epic degree of nausea felt while actualy playing.  Then again, you might, (like I did), think 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. It looks cool. Im getting it.' More power to you. You too can be the ower of the most powerful 'multicolour yawn' inducing set of camera options in gaming. 
7271	4/10
7272	hated everything
7273	its not leting me play
7274	I take back what I said, this 'HD' upgrade isn't so great, a lot of the new content is just filler and the voice acting is so bad that it's awful, good thing it was cheap.
7275	It looks cool, it seems cool but i dont like controls, feels akward, ammo ends too fast
7276	Stopped playing due to the awful camera-movement. 3/10
7277	Fun but very,very,very buggy and glitchy.  Fps drops to 0 in cutscenes and at random during gameplay. The map doesn't load in the story mode. And more that I probably forgot to list.  If the devs fix these problems and I have this brought to my attention, I will change my review because the actual game is pretty fun but again, the bugs just ruin it.
7278	I had really high expectations for this game because of its awesome ideas and sweet trailer. I was sadly disappointed.  The game seems to be a cheap port of a mobile game, with car handling very suited for tilt controls, or at least a gamepad, but certainly not a keyboard. The gameplay is dull, and early on too difficult. The voice acted cutscenes seem too long and there is no way to skip them, forcing you to endure their pain.  Overall, do not buy this game on Steam. Even at 50% or 75% off, it is a rip off. It's probably on some sort of app store somewhere, go buy it there.
7279	This game does have some decent aspects to it but nothing exceptional and the ending was....less then complimentary. If you can get it on sale for $2 or less its worth it because there is some fun aspects to it but overall the game is in my opinion not worth more then that.
7280	This games was great on my other laptop. However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia). If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up. If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.   There have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck. This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card). My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).  The game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned). If they fix the game i will change my recommendation. However seeing as though i cannot play it i would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.
7281	I recieved a coupon through crafting a badge that showed me this game. It actually allowed me to get this game for a dollar. I was pleased - an inexpensive game with an interesting and fun sounding idea and an equally interesting and fun looking trailer? Sign me up.  No no no, wait, take my name back off of that. Now. I changed my mind. First impressions told me that this game was goign to be fun, to be interesting, and be overall very enjoyable. It isn't. The controlls make the car hard to manuver, amn near impossible to kill anything with, and overall, it simply feels broken. I figured, then, with the story mode being lackluster, I could probably get some enjoyment out of the Arena mode. Locked in an arena with a near endless supply of zombies. Just you can your car to fight them all off... Sounds good, right? Just as boring. Jombies drop like rocks at the touch of your car, and do almost nothing to it. I started the first arena in hard mode - ten minutes later I got the gold medal by doing nothinbg but holding the fire button and driving in circles.  Terrible game.
7282	Pretty basic and boring.
7283	Runover a zombie. Get yelled at by your boss. Runover some more zombies.... Thats the whole game... â¥â¥â¥â¥in... 9 euros
7284	Don't buy this game. It has its fun moments, but there are way too few of them and most of the time you're bored while playing it. The levels have no gimmicks, no variety, nothing. Just skip it.
7285	Worst game i've played in a while. Bad controls, boring, not fun at all. My belief is this game started as a joke.
7286	It was on offer and cheap
7287	This game is so bad. Luckily I only spent 70p on it. First person mode or bust.
7288	WARNING ! This game give nausea !!!  Even if you never get nausea by playing, buy this game only if you want to vomit.  Read the forums, there are discussions about that.   The game is cool, but it's actually unplayable.
7289	Vrrrrrm vrrrummmmmm.... okay, why? You run over zombie stuff and shoot big creatures...  It's pretty boring. I guess I get bored too easy, I don't see it as a racing game, I mean, you can try to beat it within a certain time limit, but games that have time limits, you don't tag it as a racing game.  So what you do is run â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and then pick â¥â¥â¥â¥ up and then drop â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.  THis game is not worth it.
7290	Repetative gameplay, annoying controls. Don't like.
7291	Top down driving game/zombie killer. Recalls classics like the first GTA's and Death Rally. 2/5
7292	
7293	This should of been a free flash game.
7294	Another garbage game full of cheater's ! ( is not right to play from TOP 10 )   TOP 10 in this game are cheater's with Cheat Engine !  Steam id :  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011536129  - TOP10 ( is already V.A.C. banned )  Steam id :  http://steamcommunity.com/id/RADO787/  - TOP 10 ( is already V.A.C banned )   This 2 kids are in TOP 10 clasament from Zombie Drivers ... !  Why i need to pay money from this game ??? For what ???  To see TOP 10 CHEATERS ???  WHEN DEV. remove all cheaters from TOP 10 LIST ... i change my review in pozitive review !
7295	Game doesn't work with my keyboard or PS4 wireless controller. Could only play a little bit going back and forward and using the emergency break a little bit.
7296	Not really my cup of brains...
7297	It's a mobile game, and personally I don't want to play them on a expensive computer.
7298	Controls are crap. Not sure at which disount I got it, but I think it was a waste.
7299	even Mobile Phone Grapics are way better
7300	the ground is always blue and glitchy  i would not play this for 50 cents p.s its also really buggy
7301	Don't spent your money for sh*(ts
7302	not really that great of a games. So many better options out there. Design is really lacking. Doesnt create a desire to keep playing.
7303	This game gets boring really fast and reminds me of free games you play on a phone! I got it for 99 cents and would have to say I wouldnt play it if it were free! Not worth downloading onto a gaming rig at all and I laugh at reviews that say it is great.
7304	To be honest, I wanted a Netrual button over here, its unffair to say that this game is crap, but there are some points that avoid me to enjoy this 100% Tobe honest I have played only the single-player campaign. need to say that for cons this game is well balanced, has a fair challenge, great graphics and has a nice twist on the over-used zombie formula. But the game has some very annoying issues, first of all the campaign drags itself far too long. 30 levels with many many missions types repetead over and over again,how many scientis do I need to rescue ?  And : Stop at the marker  Zombies left in the area : 2 Stop at the marker Zombies left in te area : 3 Stop at the marker Zombies left in the area : 1 
7305	It's okay to play for a few minutes at a time but it gets very repetitive. Bought the game on sale so it's worth the $2.50 but I wouldn't pay full price for it.
7306	Wou;ld've liked this game more if it had more mission variety since 70% of the missions is mostly rescuing survivors.
7307	Don't bother buying, did not start properly. Despite trying ways suggested in the support forum I could not get this game running. Emailed my problems to the support team but no answers from them.
7308	ZDHD didn't agree with me. The gameplay is too shallow to be entertaining, environments to crowded to enjoy the top-down driving aspects. Controls didn't work too well for me, either.  All in all: Stay away.
7309	The HD version officially makes the game not fun anymore. It ruins it. Sure the graphics and atmosphere are much better, but it's now escort missions and uneeded boss fights. Not to mention it likes to grab the camera away from you to see the objective like you are some dummy. Oh and you can't pause to look at the map anymore, which is by far the most annoying thing.
7310	As I write this review I'm on the verge of vomiting. Not because I'm being over dramatic, but because I'm literally nauseous from playing this game. I thought it was just me until a read another reviewer suffering the same symptoms. The graphics, theme, and content of the game are fine. But it's the gameplay that made me sick which consists of you driving endlessly round, and round, and round... Oh gosh I'm making myself sicker just thinking about it.  Perhaps if the maps were bigger and had a better layout, I would have no complaints. But because of my negative experience I say stay away from this game if you get car sick easily. It's too bad because I was looking forward to this game. At least I only paid something like $2.  By the way I just took a pill for motion sickness and I hope it kicks in real soon.
7311	Ignore all the positive reviews, this game sucks. I only played it because the steam trading cards this thing gives , have a pretty nice value regular cards about 20 cents and the foils over 2 bucks. if you want some steam money , then buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ while its on sale, grab all the cards , and never talk about this game ever again
7312	The looks nice and is quite interesting. Although I have DLCs with additional missions and so on, I didn't used them. The game bored me after about 15-20 missions. It's all about killing zombies. Without co-op it's not worth playing longer than just to relax few times for about 20 minutes. Also the ingame font is really small on big screens and resolutions. And since you can play with controller it should have better fit for big screens.
7313	The game is kinda fun but the biggest weakness is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing driving, which makes up about... all of the game. The only reason this game is so bad for me is that every 10~ seconds of holding down the button to turn left or right the car will randomly say 'hey i see you wanna turn in that direction, welp â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.'  Seriously in what world does a driving game not listen to the directions you give it. I mean the shooting is ok and so is the whole gun and repair mechanic but the fact you cant drive three feet without your car suddenly not listening to you is impossible.
7314	I had a coupon for this game and I think I paid $2.50, I'm kind of regretting spending that much money on this. I mean it was an entertaining game, the problem is its not worth the money you pay, not even $2.50 like in my situation. A few days before I got this game, I had 2 coupon codes for 2 other games. One game was in the $10 price range and the other game was in a $5 price range. In total, the price was $1.75 (these coupons were bigger). One of the 2 games (the $10 one) I would've gladly paid $7 or even $10 at max for, while the other one (the $5 one) I would've paid $3.75 at max for; this game I would've paid at max $0.50. So I guess its a good game, just not worth the money you pay.
7315	Every generation has their own 'Citizen Kane', mine was 'Citizen Kane' and actually, so was every other generation's when you think about it.  Zombie Driver HD (ZDHD) is very honest in its marketing, I appreciate that. Let's all golf clap for ZDHD. Now, on to gameplay:  If you enjoy driving, with Zombies around - this game is for you. If perhaps you prefer a more cerebral experience - why on earth are you reading reviews for a game called 'Zombie Driver HD'?  If you're into a tablet port where things go splat - great, here's your game. Enjoy, splat some zombies and have fun. I don't doubt that you'll have fun as this is a fun game - just not for me.
7316	It honestly just feels like a mobile game. The game is so bland and uninteresting and it's so fast paced you don't even know (or care) about what you're doing, whether its finding a survivor or just running over zombies (basically the only two things you can do in the game). That being said, all you really do is    run over zombies and    try to steer a car with a wonky turning system. This is literally a game about driving, they could have at least gotten that right. The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes. It tries to tell a story but 20 minutes in you'll be scratching your head at the pathetic dialogue and nonexistent 'plot'. You just drive over zombies. It's not god-awful, but even on sale for $3 I want my money back.
7317	Game is broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and devs refuse to help or tell you if theyre working on an update or a fix.  I couldnt not be more dissapointed..hope this game gets pulled off steam.
7318	My Playstation 2 called from the garage and wants it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game back.
7319	Game is great. But wont work on my win 7 64bits and nvidia cart. Game goes crazy avery time after few min.
7320	You will never find a game like this where the designers had to cheat to make it work. No matter how shallow an angle you will stick to the object you hit. You take seconds to get moving from a stop where the other cars go right to full speed. Any oversteer puts you right into the opposite wall. There are times you are looking at the screen wondering how the hell you ended up the way you did. No matter what you buy you will never have an advantage. Save the money and save the stress.
7321	Fails every time to start. Steam integrity check finds 1 corrupted file every time and re-downloads it. Fails to start again. Everything else on my PC works fine, no viruses to make the files corrupt and such.  -/10  Once it starts and is running I'll evaluate it.
7322	Rolling giant boulders downhill smashing all that stands in their way ought to be immensely fun. Somehow, it isn't here. They've done this weird vs. approach where you and an opponent throw boulders down the slope at each other's gates, first one smashed loses, and that's good enough for an arcade game. Along the way you smash dwellings, inhabitants, and similar bric-a-brac to get money, which buys you fortifications you can use to defend your gates against your opponent's rock.  Problem is, the fortifications don't actually do much of anything to deter an incoming boulderâmaybe they would if you had time to lay out defenses strategically, but because everything takes place in real time you're never given the chance to build your defenses with any kind of deliberation. So with the vast majority of the game's mechanics going un- or underused, it becomes a mad rush to launch your boulder first. Which quickly becomes less than interesting. It's entirely possible that the available defenses become more useful and engaging to play with in later levels, but the game doesn't hold my interest long enough to get at them.   Which is really too bad. The art and sound design are unreservedly fantastic, with this great whimsical Terry Gilliam Python-era animation thing happening. I just wish the game was as much fun to play as it is to look at.
7323	Egh.
7324	This game is original and fun for the first few levels, but if you are going for 100% achievements then the developer's trolling placement of the keys on some levels gets increasingly rage inducing as you are forced to try over and over again to fluke trick shots by smashing into edges to abuse the janky physics engine.
7325	 Premise is great, execution is bad.   The goal of the game is to roll down a track  (where your opponent can place tower defence style traps to slow you)  and smash down the enemy door to win.  The core issue is no matter how much you chip away their boulder to make it smaller or they chip away yours it seems to take 3 to 4 hits to a door regardless of your rocks size. This in turn makes most of the tower defence aspects laughable.  After you learn of this critical balance issue in multiplayer it becomes a mad dash race to the finish and the actual tactics of defence building serves no point.
7326	Kind of interesting but the gameplay wears thin before it's over.
7327	It was on sale for a $1 or $2 and I decided to try it. Most of the negative statements made by other reviewers are correct, this game gets dull quick. What caught my inteterst in deciding to buy this were the boss fights but they felt too easy to conquer and not much thought put into them except for two bosses but yet still easily doable. It was a good idea of a game but I think if it function differently it would of been a fantastic game. Do yourself a favor and wait for the deal, if still interested.
7328	Rock of ages sounded soo neat and interesting, however it's just an overthought remake of marble madness or a clumsly attempt to create the game of bowling. Rock of ages is wasted effort in turning this sow's ear into a silk purse.
7329	Laggy, with unresponsive controls. Like bowling or pinball, only worse in every way.
7330	Purchased this game after watching many lets plays of it and was really excited to see it on the steam sale for only 4.99. Downloaded the game only to find out the game has had many issues with getting the game to even start. So the long and the short of this is I not only spent 5 dollars for a game that doesn't work but I also spent three hours trying to trouble shoot only to find out it wasn't worth the 5 dollars or my time. The game looks fun but if they can't fix this major issue than there is no point buying it
7331	This game is fun for the first few minuts, After that, it gets very repettitive.
7332	I had a long think about this one but ultimately chose not to recommend. The reason is the game just doesn't change enough as you progress. The first few levels were OK but it was extremely repetitive and not in a good way. As the difficulty increased so did my frustration. The map changes each level an you have to spend a run or two to figure out the paths and shortcuts along the way. This means you generally lose the first three times you play it. Of course the AI knows exactly where all the shortcuts and cheats are so it blocks you from taking them, but as you are still learning the map you make a lot of mistakes. I played for nearly two hours and am done with it.
7333	This game caused my computer to crash every single time that I attempted to play it. I tried numerous times, and on each occasion, the game would freeze and I would be incapable of exiting it, going to task manager, or even shutting down my computer. I uninstalled it so as not to waste time. I'm sure that if the game actually works for you, you'll have a good time, but I couldn't recommend a game that didn't function as intended.
7334	I was intrigued and somewhat excited by the trailer of the game, so I gave it a try.  Unfortunately for me, I tried the first level using mouse and keyboard and I wasn't able to properly control the rock, not to mention complete the level. After moving to the gamepad the game felt a little better and I found rolling the rock challenging enough for my (average) reflexes.  But when the gameplay expanded to include building towers, I felt overwhelmed and not that excited about. It's not that the game is bad or something, just that it is definitely not for me.
7335	I really had high hopes when I bought this game. Sadly, the camera angles during gameplay are so bad, I can't see where I'm rolling. I've rebinded my keys and it still doesn't help me see. As soon as I jump, there goes the camera and any enjoyment I had.   The art and level designs are nice, but this is just unplayable for me. I'll update if I have any luck in this mess.
7336	Rock of Ages is great in the aspect of being the only game like this, but the game get too repetative and get boring real fast.
7337	This one is like a weird racing game. For those who enjoy racing games, especially where there are obstacles and also things you need to run over with your vehicle, this might be a good game for you. I'm not really a racing fan, though, and didn't realize quite what the gameplay would be like when I decided to try it on a steam sale. The rock is not easy to steer and I wasn't having enough fun to put in the amount of practice that would be needed to get better at it.
7338	Honestly it did seem good at first, now simply put it was not my cup of tea
7339	bought it for 1,99 â¬ during the steam summer sales.totally not worth 9,99 â¬ (normal price) i would hardly pay 0,50 â¬ for it watched some videos with it and it seemed fun,but i got bored also,the multiplayer is sh*t if you don`t have a friend to play with.
7340	A really sub-par game, I seriously don't understand why the there are so many positive reviews. Basically, if you play the first level of the game, you've played them all. People keep saying 'Monty Python-esque' but I don't see it. I suppose if you think Monty Python's humor was solely based on using historical paintings to make â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ jokes, then you would consider this game to be very Monty Python.   The gameplay is pretty basic: you control a boulder and you try to roll it towards the enemy's castle. Defenses are placed in your way to slow and destroy your boulder. The game is also a race, the enemy also is trying to destroy your castle's gates and you place defenses to slow the enemy boulder. Sounds fun, right? Defenses are pretty flimsy and easy to get around, so when facing the AI's boulder, all you really have to do is make a few choke points. So as a tower defense, its really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing poorly designed. There aren't any punishments for falling off the stage, so the player is prertty free to go as fast as possible, and take large leaps across the map, making any defenses placed by the AI completely useless. Controlling the boulder is pretty easy so there's no real challenge in making these leaps above defenses.   The game becomes super repetitve and there aren't any rewards for the player. Sure, you get to watch a silly cinematic, but on the whole, they're really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7341	Its fun to destroy things as the boulder but it has a weak tower defence part that seems to be only their to make the game longer. I don't recommend it at 10 dollars.
7342	Entertaining when it comes to historical comedy, but bland and boring when it comes to gameplay. Rock of Ages is not for you if you don't like repetition. As I played the game the entertainment value that Rock of Ages once promised became scarce quickly once I realized that every stage was just a 'get your rock out quicker than the opponent's to win' type of game. Not recommended.
7343	I hate to leave negative reviews, because I've played a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games on steam, and hav'nt even bothered to review them.  This game could have been amazing, because it has that arcade feel to it, (thanks ATLUS) but unfortunately the Single player is just wrong. You have a minute of super monkey ball fun then it becomes a tedious tower defence with poor controls and no control over the ai launching attacks faster than you at the same time. The game would have been really fun if it was:  1: The levels get harder to navigate but you can still roll and build up points/levels 2: No poorly implemented tower defence aspect 3: AI building faster and better than a C&amp;C hack  
7344	I went from excited about this game to too frustrated and uninstalling it in under an hour. Perhaps I didn't give the game enough of a chance, but my patience ran out.  Pros: Interesting art style. Unique gameplay. Multiplayer mode.  Cons: The game became frustratingly difficult quickly. I feel like there isn't any real information provided about the tower-defense portion of the game, so everything is trial and error.  TL;DR: Interesting concept, not for me or, I would think, most people.
7345	As a casual diversion it excells, but to be honest there isn't much to this and you wont be playing it for very long.
7346	I can't earnestly recommend it.  It's quirky enough to be intriguing. It's weird enough to be interesting. It's well done enough not to be crap.  It's not smart enough to be funny. And it's definitely not good enough to be worth playing.  Just look at the hours spent from the positive reviews.
7347	Neat Idea, but executed poorly. Think of a tower defense where you can just go around the defense unharmed. That's Rock Of Ages. The multiplayer would be fun, but the problem is the lack of money, tiles for unit placement, and viable strats are very few and far between. The different rocks are worthless for the most part, and there is too many useless units you can place down on the ground.   Single player story is funny, but it's the same thing over and over. Boss fights are pretty lack luster as well. Sadly the only thing this game has in common with Zeno Clash is the music. While it is not as memorable, you can still hear those jungle â¥â¥â¥ beats.   Wait for a sale if you are interested. There's just better games out there.
7348	I dont recomend this game at all and completely regret wasting $10 on it.
7349	A bit too boring.
7350	The controls are very loose and the visuals are not up to Monty Python standards, which this appears to be partially based. If you want a rock rolling game, I prefer the phone one.
7351	If you need to think about getting this game. Don't get it. If you are 100% sure this is a game you want and will enjoy. Get it.
7352	Boring, unchallenging and without sense, this game was rather disappointing. I hope I didnt pay much for this. Only upside: It's stylish as heck.
7353	If you spent money on this Mountain of Cardboard crab â¥â¥â¥â¥. Then you should â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KILL YOURSELF. This game is just rolling a stupid â¥â¥â¥ Hot ROUWK into cardboard cutouts of DIllWeiGhtS and Greek â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es (beetches). â¥â¥â¥â¥ BULbY!
7354	Would only crash when opening so I refunded it.
7355	I could go on about this game but I will be brief: This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and not fun.
7356	lag, Extreme tutorial this game is so BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7357	Fart sounds.
7358	Don't
7359	lag, Extreme tutorial this game is so BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7360	boring as hell... damn u summer sale even at 80% OFF not worth it.
7361	Fart sounds.
7362	I'm actually pretty surprised at the rave reviews this game has gotten. It was hilarious and very Monty Python-esque, but my gawd is the gameplay itself repetitive as all hell.  There really wasn't much motivation for me to keep playing past the first hour of gametime, and I never had any desire to touch it again. 
7363	My laptop can't run it, gg.
7364	Fun minigame experence. Fun for a bit. Buy low.
7365	After spending half an hour rebinding my keys and trying to get the controllers to work (which poorly works, very poorly supported) I finish the first level with the keyboard, on rebinded keys, only to find the game reset the keys to defaut on level two. I hard saw such a poor pc port, it might be fun on console but on pc, it's utter â¥â¥â¥â¥
7366	At first blush, this game appears to be good, wacky, irreverent fun somewhat in the vein of Monty Python. The gameplay is full of original concepts you will find quite literally nowhere else, and I admit, at first I was gripped.  The honeymoon period, however, wears off quickly, as the game begins to throw more and more  unfair, unbalanced tripe  unintuitive gameplay elements that weaken the core experience, and the single-player mode drags fairly quickly; there's only so much some quick satire of history can do for me.  If you can pick this up for a song, go for it, but don't expect it to entertain you long. It's a neat experiment, but ultimately I don't feel that it's one that succeeded.
7367	A historically accurate 1v1 tower defense game where you control a boulder using the rolling physics to maneuver the boulder to bust down the enemy gate's HP while also defending your own gate's HP. I found it fun for a short while before quitting due to lack of interest as it can get pretty repetitious because for the most part you're basically just maneuvering a boulder through or around the enemey's tower placements with jumps and the basic movement controls, though the boulders can come in different variations within the match you're currently in should you purchase them with the money you earned destroying structures and smothering people.
7368	Rock of Ages is a very Monty Python-esc type game in which you use your bolder to crash through the enemies defenses until you manage to break through their castle doors and squish them, all whilst you try to stop them from doing the same to you. It's kinda fun, but unfortunately the game gets very old, very fast.  5.8/10 - It's painfully repetitive. Its gameplay is (almost excruciatingly) simple. And by simple I mean repetitive. And by repetitive I mean painfully repetitive to the point that if you played one duel you have essentially finished the whole game's plot to entertain right then and there. At least the actual core gameplay isn't half-bad if you're a person who sort of liked the Monkey Ball franchise or anything of that genre (which I sort of did as a kid) and it does have multiplayer. Even then it's not worth $9.99 in my opinion. Just get it on a sale.
7369	2/5  The cinematics are uniquely stylish, but the gameplay is bland and quickly becomes repetitive.
7370	THIS GAME IS THE LITTERAL HELLSPAWN FROM SATANS BUTEHOLE
7371	Oh my god. This game is frustrating as can be and not very fun at all.
7372	If you looked at the videos, you've basically seen everything that's good about the game. The gameplay is fun for a while but gets boring and dull half way thought - so much so that I've quit.
7373	It is fun, but not much the thing I've expected.
7374	I hate to say it but I simply cannot recommend this game. Not because it's not fun (it is!) not because it's not clever and witty and funny (it's totally all 3!) but because it is such a royal pain to try and play thanks to the attached DRM connection requirements. It does NOT run through Steam and instead requires an outside connection to the developer's servers which work spottily if at all. Basically, it's a fantastic little game and the price is right but actually playing it feels like a chore.

7376	I found it extremely Boring, avoid it.
7377	If you looked at the videos, you've basically seen everything that's good about the game. The gameplay is fun for a while but gets boring and dull half way thought - so much so that I've quit.
7378	I didn't quite get the appeal of this game. It seems like a mobile game brought to PC (which isn't that bad) but the simplistic nature of rolling downward and hitting stuff seems a little to simple (even with the power ups). Rated quite well, just not a game that I can get into.
7379	This Game Is Too Hard Thats all For Now
7380	I don't know, it's got some pretty nice Terry Gilliam ala Monty Python art humour, but otherwise it's just a question as to why this game exists.  The buildings you build don't really have much of an effect on anything, and it is pretty much usually just 3 rocks into the enemies keep to win.  So essentially it's just who can race 3 rocks down the course the fastest.  Nice to look at though.
7381	It might be fun for half an hour, but this game doesnt have enough in it to be interesting, roll boulders down a twisted path, avoid losing your boulder, reah the end before the AI, that's it. It does have funny little cinematics.
7382	Bought this game based off recomendations, even though it looked like a game I wouldn't enjoy. Wound up being a game I think is horrible *shrug* if this game was free I would still not recommend wasting the minutes of your life playing it.
7383	Very boring and unrewarding game. There is no reason to buy it. I did, and I regret...
7384	One of my first Steam games. The game has a really unique art style and storyline. I can really appreciate that about this title. It certainly feels like an 'indie' title built from passion.  I tried playing this several times by myself, and with friends. I always ended up scratching my head trying to figure out the game mechanic and why it is alluring. It really isn't that fun. It is like extreme bowling or something lol. Everybody seems to get bored after a round or two.
7385	It was Summer Sale, I had just bought a great game pack and there was some money left. That is how I got this game, played for like half an hour and that was it. It just gets boring pretty quickly, that's it. Some people like it, some don't.
7386	Way too difficult to Control, not incredibly funny, Took me by surprise to have some sort of tower defence when the enemy goes up against you as well, a bit laggy, controls are WAY too sensative, I tapped the D key, nearly turned my Boulder right around, almost a complete 180. Not enough things to destroy, music is bleh, Animations are a bit Flash gamey in cutscenes. I got it for about 2 bucks on sale, Kind of wish I could get a refund, cause now I have to see this game every single time I go into my Library, but that's a Steam thing, Kind of wish there was a thing like steam bucks or something, but anyways, this game also downloaded a lot of stuff on my PC I don't think are needed to even RUN the game. So I am a bit worried, a couple of files in my Computer files named a bunch of random Letters and numbers really, Kind of scared me really. So Let's Recap.   Bleh Music   Poor Animated Cut scenes   Oversensative controls   Useless Tower defence system cause the CPU is cheap   Not enough destruction   Lame comedy   and non-refundable experience. (But that's Steam's Problem really, Serious Steam, Please find some way To get your customers to get refunds! Like store credit for half of what you payed for the game would be ACCEPTABLE In my book!) I do not recommend this game, some people like it, but my expierience is just terrible with this game, I beat the first level and was jumped by the whole tower defence thing, I put down as many towers as possible in tight places. The CPU Just rolled right on through them at high speed, not hitting ANY of em, so yeah, CPU Is cheap.  
7387	So I tried this game back on the Ps3 and didn't like it. I didn't remember why though and saw this for like a buck and thought i'd give it another go.  Now I remember!  The humour is nothing like Monty Python because it would have to be funny. This humour consists of fart jokes and refrences ala 'Epic Movie'.   The gameplay is the most tripe â¥â¥â¥â¥ I have seen in quite some time. You roll a boulder down a short path and hit the other guy's door. Takes about 3 good hits. The other component is placing easy to dodge traps/barriers in the way to slow the other guy down.  Sounds like it could be fun but it is poorly executed here.   The story is throw-away at best.  The music is non stop medevil style dance music. It gets old real fast.  Pass this game up. Its not worth anything.
7388	You roll a stone through the enemy's obstacles, where you then have to destroy the gate. You'll progress through a story with some wierd cutscenes. The reason that i don't recommend this game would be, that i think it's quite wierd. Also there's not that much to do. Just control a stone. It is fun, yeah. For about 10 minutes. Some people might get a lot of fun out of this game, but i didn't. Also the price is a bit too high for a game like this.  Remember this is MY opinion.  If you want it, buy it on sale. It's not a game with very much content.
7389	Why did I buy this?
7390	You roll a rock down a course. It's not very fun after the initial five minutes
7391	I didn't like it... But I will give it credit where it's due, it's something different.   All and all, it was alright, but there's a huge jump in skill when playing single player that just turned me off completing the game.
7392	A silly game where you roll boulders against your opponent's castle. You can try to put obstacles so his boulder does not get to your castle first. Whoever hits the castle three times first wins the game. Yes... that's all there is to it. 5/10 Do not buy.
7393	The game seems fun and is for a short while. What you are doing is rolling a ball through down a hill and destroying defenses in the mean time. Although I liked that it was something new, it didnt got me to play it for a longer period.
7394	This Game is a rip off it has the one major flaw of not actually starting. I can not even get to the title screen, and what is worse is that for some stupid reason it has logged me however many hours becasue when it crashed the first time and I tried to relaunch it I was told that the app was already running which meant steam counted it as me 'playing' when i left my PC on  I would oove to be able to comment on the gameplay of this game but unfortunatley I am not able due to thsi game destroying bug, and yes I have tried numerous soloutions and my computers specs do meet the requirments. Please be carefull when buying this game as it is likely you we not be able to launch it, this is a problem I and many other people are experiencing
7395	This game is about as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as you might expect a game where you play a rock might be.
7396	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7397	Not worth it. Interesting idea but boring gameplay.
7398	A silly game where you roll boulders against your opponent's castle. You can try to put obstacles so his boulder does not get to your castle first. Whoever hits the castle three times first wins the game. Yes... that's all there is to it. 5/10 Do not buy.
7399	I bought this game near when it first came out on steam. I wouldn't launch and there was no solution to the problem and steam support couldn't help me. about a year and a half later I tryed to lauch the game and it worked but no one plays it anymore so I was very bored. dont buy this. its really not worth it.
7400	A nice game for $3 or less, you will only play it for about an hour or so.
7401	I couldnt stand playing this game anymore after a hour or two... Its the same over and over and over and over again... I guess it could be fun if you like this kind of crazy and different type of games. But if you are like me, more of a traditional player, i would suggest avoiding it.
7402	Boring and Repetitve in my opinion, new obstacles are added but doesn't change the game alot. It is very funny though.
7403	Eh, not much fun or replayability, should be a mobile game
7404	Not at all what it seems like. I didn't like it at all. #wasteofmymoneyandtime
7405	For me it was fun for a few hours only, even with friends unfortunately.
7406	Quirky, fun, but not sucked into the game in one go. (And controller support is poor at best.)
7407	As much as it charming, it is partially unplayable for the controls are rough and sometimes unresponsive. I wanted to like this game, but I just don't.
7408	Crap Game !!! 1. the control with keyboard and mouse so badly 2. The game is Cheating 3. Waste of money
7409	I rather play bad rats
7410	Im sure this would of been great game to play if it actually ran, everytime i launch the game goes to black screen and minimizes  i click on it in my taskbar it does a black screen with some audio then closes again checked forums lots of people having this problem tried 4 different fixes restarted computer twice, restarted steam twice, redownloaded it twice, validate game cache twice, nothing works would not recommend waste of Â£6.99
7411	If this game is exactly what you are looking for, get it. If you wonder if it is the right choice, avoid it.
7412	ROCK OF AGES WORST GAME EVER MADE THE MULTIPLAYER DOSNT EVEN WORK RIGHT THE STORY LINE IS BAD THE PHYSICS ENGINE SUCKS BALLS TRYING TO DEFEND YOUR GATE IS POINTLESS BECAUSE THEY CAN SMASH THERE WAY THROUGH YOUR DEFENCES THE MULTI PLAYER IS THE WORST EVER BECAUSE TRYING TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS IS LIKE TRYING TO INSTALL MODS FOR MINECRAFT ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAIN IN THE â¥â¥â¥ AND IF THATS NOT ENOUGH THERE MULTIPLAYER NET WORK DOSNT EVEN WORK UNLESS YOUR PLAYING WITH A DUDE FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD......MY EDVICE TO YOU FOR THIS GAME IS DONT EVEN BOTHER WAISTING YOUR MONEY ON IT THE COMPANY THAT MADE THIS GAME OVIUSLY DIDNT PUT ANY EFERT INTO THIS GAME AND IF YOU DID BUY THIS GAME THEN YOU HAVE JUST WAISTED YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME THANK YOU FOR READING THIS AND TO WHO EVERS THE IDIOT THAT PUT THIS GAME ON STEAM REMOVE IT AND GO TO HELL

7415	sad piece of crap seen bad games in my time but this is the icing on the cake â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t levels â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t story â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t enemys and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t ai this is a game i would say off  please trow it out of the games for sale and make it a free gift game  cause its not even worth the 2 euro iv payed for it in the sale low grafics with a to hard tried monthypython type jokes that dont work  bad controls noncense options advise dont buy this boring bad game
7416	Hard to control yourself.
7417	Honestly, this game kind of blows. It's just not fun.
7418	Just No, Please DONT! also best tactis Mamuths and Airships
7419	bull snot
7420	Buy this if you are a casual player who wants to have fun for a couple hours and enjoys easy games which offer no challenge what so ever.  Unpolished PVP multiplayer mode. Traps are completely uneffective.
7421	  No no no no no no no...    Played it once, because friend bought it for me.   I don't recomend it at all.
7422	What the hell? I don't even own this game.
7423	roll this game right off a cliff
7424	  I do not know why but please do something about it      
7425	I like the idea of this game. But that's where good things ends. Concept demo shows absolutely nothing. It shows less than screenshots. I probably would fund it if there was good concept with gamplay mechanics, narrative or visuals to catch my attention. But sadly there are none.  And last remark. You did Vive version wrong. Instead of putting cart into center of room-scale you should attach it to seated position. That's how all seated games made for the Vive.  Most of the Vive owners couldn't try your demo because of it. They don't have keyboard and mouse in the centre of roomscale space. I personally configured steam controller for this. But it's no excuse or how it should be.
7426	Audio plays faster or slower based on the speed of the cart. The speed of the cart keeps changing following ups and downs of the terrain. The result is a soundtrack that gives a headache. I think it would work a lot better if only the beat was changed, not the pitch.  In VR, you can't recenter the view on your current position. So if your desk/chair is not centered (Vive), you'll get a stiff neck on top of the headache.  You need 3 hands: one for the mouse, one for the Q/A/S keys, one for the arrow keys.  Graphically, textures are poor. It's not bad for the terrain when moving but it's really ugly when stopped and on the character and cart. Objects pop all over the place. But at least it's fluid (~200FPS on my GTX 970)  In VR, when jumping, one goes through the ground when 'landing', then back in the sky, the ground, ... ad nauseam.  I'm sorry Exosyphen, but this doesn't make we want to fund the game (although to be honest, I wouldn't have anyway, it's not the type of game that I fund).
7427	That was really bad. It fails to be a tech demo because there is no tech, and for it to be a prove of concept it lacks of concept.
7428	must find a way to recenter the headset!!!....I sat on my computer desk.. with head turned 180 degrees over my shoulder...and blindly hitting keyboard keys....can you please make this more user friendly?
7429	Horrible. No instructions or nothing and cart stops. And for a 'tech demo' you are wondering where is the actual tech? Graphics isnt much to look at. Sorry but really cant recommend this and not excited towards the release either.
7430	I do not reccomend this game, slow, controls are bad, sound is off. I dont feel at all like i am on a track.
7431	More like a rollercoaster demo. Which lacks a lot of what they, I presume, want to achieve with it. To be frank, indiegogo campaign with a very rudimentary demo... probably not. There are a number of cardboard rollercoasters that will give you this fix and better. Not that this was a bad ride but it lacked some serious polish in everything but the 3D tracking. Also, if you have the slightest inkling of motion sickness - you've been warned.
7432	The game does not work with oculus rift, it looks like a gme that i will play but since it does not work now, i gave it a no
7433	Dyad is a 'yeah what ever' game. IÂ´m quite disapointed for spending 3,50â¬ on it. The psychodelic look is cool, but the gameplay is not that dynamic. And you canÂ´t put it in fullscreen, only in window mode! Come on!  If you want a realy cool psychodelic, adictive and awesome experience, buy Super Hexagon instead! 
7434	Really disapointed. You appear to need an xbox controller to even play it and even then the controls are imprecise and the actual gameplay is simple and not that psychedelic (it seems the between level bits are more psychedelic than the game itself). The game is very simplistic - like tetris with only one shape. Do yourslef a favor if you want a psychedelic game go buy Space Giraffe (or any other Llamasoft game really)
7435	Just bought this game at 85% off, and it looks like it is potentially a lot of fun, but for me and apparently some others on the forums, the game keeps crashing when you try to play a mission. For 85% off it was really cheap, but now I wish I'd have spent it elsewhere.  EDIT** Upgraded my video card from the GeForce 9300 GSO to the GT 730 and the game works fine now.
7436	ummm, I got this game for free, pretty sure it is meant to be played only when you are on MASSIVE ammounts of drugs
7437	I played about an hour of the repititve music over and over collecting new balls lights each level each pretending to get harder the the last 3/10 wouldnt even play on acid...
7438	Extremely repetitive, absolutely nothing to write home about. Buy audiosurf instead, you'll be much happier that you did.
7439	 Don't be fooled by the light-hearted trailer , this game is pretty repetative. I'm glad I bought it during the sale, because it certainly is   not   worth the $15 it demands.   Although I only played for less than a full hour so far, this game is exteremely boring, and the repetativeness and variationless expreience provided by the trailer is exteremely misleading, especially in the first few levels. The music is horrible and subtracts from what seemed like a good experience.  Plus, the controls are crap. Imprecise, along with vague tutorials and faulty guidance system makes for a horrible game.  This game is so bad IGN gave it a 10.
7440	Very poor keyboard support, UI is laggy and slow in fullscreen, not sure why, frame rate is good, but navigation is glacial. Gameplay is n ice looking, but simple. Got bored.
7441	I can't recommend it because it is really buggy. I spent my money to play this and now it crashes as soon as I try to play a level with no explanation. Computer is sound, it shouldn't be an issue. Others have encountered the same issue, or a similar issue with no response from the Dev. It hasn't been updated in over a year either, so I would guess it just isn't going to be. Don't spend a lot of money until it is updated. From the response of others, I would say the gameplay is fun. But that's only if you are lucky enough to get there. I recommend reading the discussion pages before a purchase t see if you want to take the chance.  EDIT Update: Speaking to the developer he said this error occurs on some sets of nVidia cards. He gave no indication he had any intention to fix this.
7442	This game freezes up a lot for me making it nearly unplayable, and it opens 3 CMD.exe s' that stay open while the game is running.
7443	I have mommy issues
7444	LOL OLOL LOL OLLOL LOL LOL LOL LOLL WTF?? Why is this a thing?? LOL
7445	Yeah it's my kind of game but i think some people will like it
7446	very disapointing. it is very colorful but the gameplay is BORING!  I also learned that they still make games without fullscreen support when i bought this.
7447	I really wanted to play the game, but there was a bug that consisted on a ghost menu layout that covered three quarters of my screen... It disapeared after finishing the first stage of a level but the real problem was with the infinity and remixed levels where there is clearly nothing more than only just one level.
7448	does not run and no fixes despite countless users complaints - just glad it only cost me 1 Buck
7449	Simple gameplay with no variation. What this game really needs is:  different weapons (missles, sideshots, smartbombs, ect.)  real enemys bosses other ships that chase you more action!  SUMMARY: You drive through this tunnel and collect glowing orbs to speed up. Thats it. There is no other action. I was really expecting more.  There might be some gamers who like this, but for me it was too boring.  I do like arcade gaming but this game has nothing to offer to keep me playing.  The psychadelic visuals are nice, but the gameplay is too undemanding.  If there would be just more action this could be a great game...
7450	I had a lot of fun playing this game on Windows, shame the developer didn't deliver on the promise of releasing a native Linux version.
7451	paid for it and it doesnt even line up properly on my screen no matter what resolution i set it to, plus sometimes it doesnt start properly so i have to restart it.  Terrible, 0/5 stars
7452	Kind of disappointing, to be honest. The dizzying feeling that I expected and hoped for in this kind of spiral-chasing game just wasn't there. Maybe it's something about the graphics? Not '3D' enough? After all the encouraging reviews and the very enthusiastic trailer, I really had high hopes. That 'psychedelic overload' that was promised just never came, and neither did I. :/
7453	Repetitive. barely rewarding. The 'psychedelic' graphics the creaters boast about interfere with the game every now and then due to clutter. Definitely not worth 1,40, let alone 14 euros
7454	Pro. -good music -nice visuals cons -floaty control -confusing gameplay -can't input music Final score 3/10 NOTE just buy audio surf
7455	  Ive played it a little... So far I don't see the appeal..I did get this game for free however. I'm a fan of different styles of games I guess..
7456	It's not bad but not what I expected. I thought it would be a game where you can enjoy the visuals and relax at the same time but it turned out to be way more competetive/demanding than I imagined.  Basically, if you want a fun and innovative game try it out, however if you're looking for a relaxing game where you can sit back, try something else
7457	''Dyad, Mostly Positive' Huh, I guess the game was really cheap because there really isn't much to it. What was it when I bough it, like, three bucks?', I thought to myself. I scrolled down the page and-- FIFTEEN DOLLARS?! Before any of you even THINK about buying this game, let me tell you there is nearly NOTHING to do in it. All there is is exactly as the game looks in the screenshots. Here's a description:  You're a... Thing. And you travel through these tubular things, and have to collect things while avoiding things. That's... about all it is. Level after boring psychadelic level, there's just nothing new. They introduce a new 'Enemy' about halfway through the game, but several levels afterwards you'll just get stuck like me. The levels become rediculously impossible (only halfway through the game) and there aren't that many levels in the game, but I'd be amazed if you could even get THAT far because it's SO BORING.
7458	Disappointing. Some great possibilities here, mostly squandered.
7459	headache simulator
7460	Full screen is broken in Windows 8.1. Trying to find playable full screen settings has made the game unplayable.
7461	cant get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing to play. â¥â¥â¥â¥ers
7462	Just, just DONT buy it!
7463	Very poor keyboard support that makes the game nearly impossible to progress in on a PC. Very simplistic gameplay that consists of only pressing X on orbs to chain yourself forward (An ape could do it in it's sleep). Certainly not as psychedelic as it proclaims to be and if this weren't on an %85 off sale I would've been â¥â¥â¥â¥ing livid.
7464	Despite its interesting premise, it actually gets pretty repetitive and potentially boring. Levels are long and have a uniform structure to them, so you're pretty much doing the same thing over and over until time runs out, and then possibly a couple more times if there are multiple stages of a level. Precision was also difficult due to the abstractly moving targeting reticle. The music can sometimes be catchy, but it just didn't make up for how bored I was getting, not to mention feeling sick from the blurring visuals. There's a lot of content here, but without a plot to justify the tedium, I don't want to play it.

7466	Needs MAJOR BUG FIXING. It crashes so much, oftentimes right on the start screen. I am not the only one who experiences this problem, and until it is fixed, i do not recommend this game. I managed to play level one before it crashed one time, and I can confirm that it is a VERY pretty game, BUT IT IS UNPLAYABLE AT THIS MOMENT.
7467	Overpriced, repetitive, derivative. All of the achievements are for challenges (trophies) which are timed in such a way that you basically can't make a mistake or have to start over (RIP average completion rate of library). Controls feel very imprecise for the task at hand. Caused motion sickness for me. Crappy console port with bad menues. Had to unplug other USB devices to be able to use my Xbox controller.  I don't remember how I got this, must have been part of yet another shovelware bundle. Wouldn't recommend.
7468	It may not be pretty, fun, or interesting in any way, but I'm glad they decided to make this game take up 15 gigs by not compressing their horrendously unfunny FMV cutscenes.
7469	Funny concept, but there's just not enough actual game in this thing to justify buying it. Button mashy, extremely linear, might be worth picking up at a tenth of the cost.
7470	I paid $2 to warn you that this is one of the worst games I've played in recent memory. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain.  Seriously, I don't care how you feel about Twisted Pixel's other games, or if you liked Road Rash or other combat 'racers', or what. This is not good. It is not fun. Nothing was fixed from when it was the turd jewel of the Xbone's console launch until it was shoved out the door onto Steam months later to desperately try and make some money back on this abomination. The game is ugly, it is repetitive, it opens with a friggin 12 minute cutscene, and it has no respect for you, your time, or anyone involved in making it.  Do not purchase, period, easily one of the bottom ten games on Steam that isn't just a broken mess.
7471	It had everything to be awesome. We are on the same page as FC3's Blood Dragon. Great pitch, crazy-â¥â¥â¥ what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ universe, dark humor and absurdity. They shot some of it live, they pushed the cheesy button to the max. They've done it all.  Yet, it only last about half an hour before it goes into plain gaming nonsense. Beat'em all are usually pretty damn repetative, this one is no exception. To make you forget that you just mash buttons with no clear goal in life and waste your time, they give you cutscenes, some kind of story, sometimes puzzles to fiddle with, etc. In Lococycle, the story in itself is a trap and we knew that before even buying the game : the story is a (good) joke. So no story to counter the button mashing boreness. But there are cutscenes right ? Yeah, to tell what exactly ? So puzzles it is ? Nope. None. Zip.  Yet, there are the dialogs between Iris and Pablo. That's 90% of the fun you can expect to dig out of the game. But past the tenth time they shoot the same exact joke at you, you may start to feel a little bit too much bored.  In fact there's nothing else to do except mashing buttons in any order you may please. If that's your thing, just forget everything I said and make sure to buy the game. If you just like good games, I suggest you shouldn't.  To me they've messed up the most important part of their own trip.
7472	This game sucks real bad. Lots of problems with the xbox port. Lots of bugs, Can't play in 64 bit direct x11 mode ( that was a con to get you to by this crap of a game ). And the game is not fun to play.
7473	Though it's obvious the developers had plenty of fun in creating the game and the FMVs, the fun isn't translated to gameplay. It's mostly filled with quick-time events and extremely simple buttonmashing that barely qualifies as combat. It's absolutely not a racing game like the tags suggest. One or two somewhat fun moments aren't enough to save it from being a lackluster game.
7474	Do you enjoy beating a dead horse?You'll probably like the jokes in this game then. Do you want to watch a whole terrible film that over-explains a pointless storyline? You'll probably like the intro in this game then. Do you want to engage in endless button mashing and repetitive mini-games? You'll probably like this game then. Not me though.  We get it. The bike is dragging a spanish guy across the country against his will. He screams the whole time.
7475	It's goofy in line with Twisted Pixel's sensibilities, it's an okay button masher with a bit of dodging and QTE, and it crashes damn near every time it writes to the hard drive. Checkpoint? Crash. Upgrade? Crash. Trip to the options menu? Crash.  I was starting to find some fun with it, but after my fourth crash - minimum - in under 30 minutes, I'm done.
7476	LocoCycle is an extremely timing-focused button-mashy experience. What challenge there is comes from avoiding obstacles and reacting to QTEs. The story seems to be trying really hard to be funny, but it never made me laugh so much as groan or wish I was playing something else.  I put 2 hours into this game because it required no real effort and I was curious were it would go. Unfortunitely, the late game starts to require some effort, and I'm really not invested enough to care. Game over.
7477	Looking at screenshots of this game feels 15 times better than playing it. I will admit that some banter between the bike and Pablo is funny (not 'haha' funny, but 'exhale quickly through nose' funny), but the cutscenes are just terrible. The gameplay is best described as a polished endless runner-type game, but with unexciting combat and levels. If they actually made the bike feel like a bike instead of whatever it is now, that might've gone a long way in making the gameplay enjoyable.
7478	Game is broken, have had it for months and tried to run it periodically, never starts. I've contacted both steam support and the developers directly, neither of which have helped me. Do not buy.
7479	Not the best game in my opinion. The controls are harder to use and the bike doesnt do whatever u want it to do. The bike moves to slowly and nothing ccan be done.
7480	Poorly done Xbox port - game could be enjoyable if it wasn't so technically flawed. Unplayable.
7481	dont know how to control the glitched motor cycle, this gave me a despair which it was the first game i ever bought on steam. unless you like the game like this, dont buy, i mean this game by crappy indie.
7482	Absolutely terrible and boring. It had so much potential, I don't know where it all went.
7483	While this started out as an interesting and funny idea. The control scheme (especially in the many tedious mini games) quickly became annoying and in some parts even un playable. The sections with shooting hava permanent down draw on the aiming reticle making consistent aim all but impossible. Even with keyboard controls it remains painful to play. Props to the idea... but F- on the confrols scheme.
7484	This game seems like it could be fun, if you have an Xbox controller to use. The game seems to be built around the Xbox specially, as all the controlls and on screen directions are using a controller, and you can't seem to get the computer controls during the game. This makes it a guessing game as you try to figure out how to play, and is rather frustrating. However, the comedy is good, but the cutsceens take a bit of time.
7485	The FMV sequences have about the same production values as a porno.  The premise is ridiculous.  There might be some promise in here for a good sense of humor or fun game play ... I'm hoping that whatever it is, it comes soon.  I'm intrigued enough to play it for a little longer, but so far ... it doesn't look very promising.  On the bright side, it's in the indiegala bundle and so it was pretty cheap.
7486	LocoCycle is a good change of pace from what I normally play; FPS and RPGs. I bought the game about 4 hours ago, and have been playing it since. It is more fun than I expected and runs great on my system with no slowdown or graphics glitches that I could see.  An Xbox 360 controller is storngly recommended. With a wired 360 controller, I had no issues, until a couple of sections where you have to target objects using a reticle. I'm not sure if my gamepad was just not calibrated or this was intentional, but these sections were quite frustrating because the riticle kept moving to the bottom, making aiming very difficult. I hope this was just bad calibration on my part and not bad design. The game also did not save any of my progress, so I lost all my upgrades. Not that I mind replaying up to where I was all that much, but I hope this will be fixed soon.  If you can get past the ridiculous premise and down right silliness of this game, it can be quite a bit of fun. While the game mechanics are very repetative, they actually threw in a variety of enemies to try to keep it fresh. This game has it's flaws to be sure, but it's my new guilty pleasure.  Update: The game is still not saving my progress, and I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause. Maybe it is a permissions problem, but nothing I have tried has worked. I have disabled my anitivirus before launching the game with no effect. I've set the game and Steam to run with Administrator privileges, and I've tried both 32 and 64 bit options, but nothing works. My rig is a follows with nothing overclocked.  Core i7 2600k at 3.4ghz 16 gig of Ripjaw ram Nvidia GTX 780 Gigabyte ga-S68xp-ud3-ssid motherboard with built in 20gb ssd  3 1GB WD Caviar Black hard drives Windows 8.1 64 bit 850 watt 80+ gold certified power supply  I run pretty much anything maxed out at 1080P without issue. Right now this is the only game giving me problems. The game does seem very stable, but not being able to save my game sucks. I really hope someone comes up with a fix. Until then I will have to change my initial recommended buy to not recommended.
7487	So I own this, and the question is, Why? This game is what happens when you mix peyote and cocaine, I think. Live action with a bunch of D-list actors and what I can only describe as the most insane plot for a game that I have ever played. My only problem with this game is not the crazy- its the lack of good gameplay. If they would've spent just a bit more on gameplay and less on 'comedy', this would've easily been quite fun. As it is, its mediocre at best. 5/10
7488	The gameplay is good but I don't like every other aspect of the game.
7489	Has some funny moments but they are few and sparse, with long stretches of mindless button mashing and cruise control.  Great game to launch if you have trouble sleeping.
7490	Just all around odd.  Great smooth graphics and some stunning visuals sprinkled about. Game play quickly becomes boring and repetitive.  Not so much of a game as it is a button mashing chore.
7491	The premise is funny, but the gameplay isn't. And the game takes up more than 15 gigs, which is ridiculous.
7492	Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ cuz you need a controller 0/10 would burn copy i want my money back
7493	Only worth it if you're going to play with a controller. I was having a pretty good time and then for no really good reason they decided to stick a set of timed minigames into the middle of a level, the third of which seemed impossible to do without a controller. I decided to humor it, but then the game wouldn't immediately recognize my controller when I turned it on, and when I restarted it it put me back about 20 minutes worth of gameplay, which was when I decided I was done with the game.
7494	You can tell they never prepared this well for a PC version. When you first start playing and are learning the controls, the controls it shows are for an Xbox controller. You can go into the controls within the settings and see the keyboard controls, but when you're starting out and it shows on-screen to push a button to do something you can't pause the game and look at the keyboard controls when this happens. So, you have to just push every button on your keyboard until you find the corresponding Xbox 'A' button on your keyboard. The how-to-play menu also, is in some Arabian language or something. The rest of the menus are in English, so I don't know why that particular menu is in some other language.   Combat.... The combat is very slow. You can hit your melee combat button 10 times with a .5 second interval between each button press and you will only do like 4 moves. Your health isn't even shown by default for some odd reason. You have to hit 'tab' to show your health and the other stuff in the bottom right corner.   The game does have a nice upgrade system. A good amount of upgrades in various categories as well.  That's pretty much all the good I have to say about this.  Just remember these are my opinions. Please refrain from going all brainless on me and argue with my opinions.
7495	Interesting concept for the game. Just is not really much fun. It plays and is more or less a on rails shooter and if you want to get the story you have to read the subtitles (other main character speaks only spanish) and not pay attention to the quick time events. A lose lose.
7496	Bad Game. Gameplay is boring, graphics are ugly and frame rate is â¥â¥â¥â¥, repetive (just mash b and press a to jump to a different enemy). Humour is lame.  This would be have been reasonably well received on ps1, got poor to moderate reviews on ps2. And as an Xbox One 'exclusive' this is embarrasing.   Lastly, I run most games at 1080p, some at 1440p including high end shooters. This game engine is so poorly optimised it won't run at 1080p with a solid frame rate, yet looks about the same as ps2 era games.
7497	A truly terrible game..Not a single redeeming or even ok feature. Graphics=Glitchy and just all round bad Sound= Damn terrible Gameplay= Non existant  And its attempt at humour is diabolical  A bad game thats so bad its fun ...This is not..Its just a bad game AVOID AT ALL COSTS
7498	Feel free to disregard this review, I think I played this for all of 20 minutes, but let me tell you - that was enough.   I don't care how much Tom Savini and Lloyd Kauffman you wave in people's faces, a bad game is a bad game. The humour feels utterly forced and the 'wackiness' and 'zaniness' is just too much to bear.  The game itself looks and sounds pretty nice I suppose, but the 'gameplay' as far as I got was press A, then X a bunch of times, then A if something flashes! Oh, you can hold down B for little while now. If you like. No. No, I don't like. Add in that you trail along a character who only speaks Spanish, so you have to read the subtitles while trying to play. Flip this game. Flip it right up its gaping bottom.  You may say that it's my fault for not playing on - you'd be right, but consider that anyone designing a game should make someone want to keep playing. This made me want to gnaw my own wrists.
7499	Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ cuz you need a controller 0/10 would burn copy i want my money back
7500	Absolutely F*cking Dreadful
7501	An easy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ linear gimmick-em-up.
7502	This game is just...god awful... stay far away from it if you value your braincells
7503	didn't like it,outdated graphics, mediocre at best.  Graphics 4 sound 4 gameplay 4 User interface 4 replay 2  overall 3  would not buy on sale
7504	YA, IM PRETTY SURE I DONT LIKE THIS GAME ALREADY.. IM A GOOD JUDGE OF GAMES..
7505	A little casual game that needs 'masses' of space (15,1 GB).
7506	Nice and funny. Oryginal concept for kids. Not for PC gamers (does not realy work with Keyboard).
7507	Avoiding the game would be a better option unless your a die hard fan of the series. A reskin of the 2013 version on the same engine.
7508	buy 2013 instead, it had more features and had KERS to make it more interesting. also my force feedback has been wonky so far with 2014 which is a problem that I didnt have with 13 for sume reason.
7509	hmm.. well there isnt much to report. It is exactly the same as 2013.. Literally nothing different except engine sound, 8 gears, and less traction to similate the new 2014 F1 cars... And a couple of new tracks, per the F1 season.  Other than that it is F1 2013.. Like, same everything, as if the files were not even touched. Just simply cut and pasted. No graphic updates, no new menu styles or colors, no new voices, just nothing..  Got halfway through 1st practice session at season opener Melbourne and turned it off.  a waste, unfortunately
7510	As you would guess. This game is basically F1 2013.5  However Codemasters are the only company in the world who could copy and paste a game and still make it worse. Sidepod glitches are worse in my opinion while Autospin curbs still exist and the online is more unstable than ever!  For the record. The game is still quite fun and challenging to drive on the wheel, however pads have InBuilt traction control which gives them zero wheelspin and better tyre wear. In wet conditions the gap between the wheel and pad can be as large as 3 seconds, which is simply crazy. This is making league racing almost impossible, which is the only reason i play the game.  Codies have had 5 years to improve, the game however has made no significant improvments, While luke spring, Steve hood continue to ignore all of the community and continue to make broken games!  F1 2015 will be on a new engine (So they say...) So this for me is the game that will make or break codemasters f1 games. The chances of a improved game are slim, but we can only hope!
7511	I really want to enjoy this game. As someone that has played F1 2011 onward this is somewhat dissapointing, it's far too Arcady for me, F1 2013 was a good challenge, this isn't, even with all driver assists off the car is easy to control. The steering does not feel connected to the car at all, when I'm stood still and I turn my wheel 90 degrees, the wheel in the car does the same, when I'm moving this is not true, there is still assistance on the steering and it really frustrates me. I never know how much I need to turn the wheel to go through a corner, because it changes depending on how the game feels.  It's a big shame, but save your money and get F1 2013, or for a really good experience, iRacing. Hopefully CM will fix this for F1 2015, but I won't be pre-ordering this time.
7512	To be perfectly honest, dont buy this game if you are patient enough to wait for the next gen version. This game has only gone down hill.   The only reason i will get many hours on this game, is because i consider myself relatively good at the game (So i can race competitively in leagues) but its also F1. Thats the only things that are keeping me interested in playing it.  There are still many bugs and glitches that NEED to be fixed. There are many issues regarding Pad users and Wheel users in which the two are very unbalanced seeing the pad users to have a lot more traction.   Now if you are simply the arcade 'career' mode racer (which i have nothing against) Then fine you may enjoy this game.   However if you are interested in actually getting some sort of immersion and competitiveness out of this game, you wont find it unless there is a patch for this bug, which i doubt will happen.   Its a poor effort F1 2014. To be honest it doesnt even replicate the 2014 season very well either. The engines sound poor, the steering wheels arent replicas to real life, its just a copy paste of 2013, but with different sounds and lower downforce.   Get it on a sale or something.. There is no way this game is worth Â£30 of your money.
7513	Like the PC gamer review quote '   With its fundamentals unchanged and last yearâs foray into classic cars removed, F1 2014 provides very little beyond a perfunctory car and track update. '  I am not impressed at all.
7514	As time changed my opinion about this game changed too. Just realised how crap this game really is.  Very few changes from 2013 only BAD CHANGES.  For me the biggest con is the handling despite being a pad user. I hate that I have very bad grip in high speed the car just doesn't wanna f__ turnin, when you are in slow speed corners the entire thing is just so crap, you drift fullthrottle through every single accelaration zone, the car isn't a challange to drive. NO LOCKUPS even, in high large brakes I can barely lockup in the wet with abs off.  In my opinion if u want a good experience u better DON'T get this game. Becuase on this game you DONT NEED TO BE SKILLED TO BE FAST, you just need to full throttle and full brake out of every corner, also didn't even talk about the mariokarting where u go down to lean and just full throttle and upshift.. just disgusting. Leagues have been ruined thanks to the handling too, people couldnt do wet races also people had to make seperate pad and wheel leagues because of the pad having overpowered traction, which was crazy, there are many videos about it on youtube.   By the way you cannot say that I dislike this game because I suck at it. Because I am in the top 50 in some of the tracks in time trial.  Final thoughts: Don't get this game I do regret getting it. Just get f1 2013 or f1 2010 they are the best. Don't ask me about f12015 but I heard that has issues too so yeah. Thanks for reading.
7515	This is a game that feels like a low-effort gap filler thrown out to fill the gap between F1 2013 (the last 'good' game of this generation) and F1 2015 (the first game on next-gen).  Even basics are poorly done - such as the Williams being set in the game's data files to a Renault engine rather than a Mercedes.  With mods to rebalance the cars and correct things like cars with the wrong engines, it's a lot better.  But don't bother with it now. Just buy F1 2015 and play the 2014 season mode instead.
7516	Don't get me wrong, it's still a fine game and if you enjoy Formula 1 you'll still like this game. But with all the additional content 2013 has, and being the same price (May get it even cheaper in a Steam Sale) I'd rather recommened that version. Besides some rule changes and the Russian Grand Prix, there's nothing new to be found in this version plus no classic modes found in 2013
7517	If you like F1 2013 and want a reskin then look no further. It's right here for Â£30.
7518	This game is sadly just F1 2013 with modded cars... I'm filing for a refund. This is really bad guys.
7519	Rubberrishhhhh  You don't even have to look for ABS or TC.  This game's physics is crap.
7520	Its F1 2013 with some new paint on the cars, some different sounds on the cars. Does not feel like a new game rather than a 2014 season DLC. Dont buy this unless you skipped atleast the last game if not the last few games. 
7521	I've had it since release day and currently not sure how I fall on this one.  Essentially F1 2013 updated for the season (same engineer, voice commands etc), Codies have at least incorporated the new rules to a great(ish) extent. You'll now take the tyres you set your fastest lap in Q2 into the race so you can go balls-out (if you make it) in Q3 for pole with a set of the softs.  The sounds in general seem pretty good. The engines of the three maufacturers are represented and could be recognised from the onboard footage I watch week in week out on the BBC, Sky,  F1.com , YouTube etc.  In terms of gameplay it appears fairly accurate. The Mercedes disappear up the road and the WIlliams, Red Bulls, Ferraris and to a lesser extent, the McLarens, scrap over the other podium spout and the top 10 order.  The total lack of control of ERS is a significant negative for this game though. In a year where the charging and discharging of the non-combustion engine has become an even more pivotal role Codemasters decides to bottle it and take that away from the driver.  The 'classic' content from F1 2013 was a huge plus and one I revelled in personally. To not only not improve on but to remove it from the franchise was a bit of a kick in the teeth. The Scenarios and Season Challenges are welcome continues but it feels somewhat lacking. These new generation turbo cars would be complemented by some 1980s turbo kit.  Multiplayer-wise, to date, I've really struggled with this game personally. I've probably spent more time in lobbies than I have racing. Can't think of a game version I've not tried and a lot of games have just ended up being full of kids with keyboards; no interest in a race. Just a destruction derby a lot of the time. I have no time for people who don't leave you room and would rather turn into an accident, lock wheels, than turn away and maintain momentum.  Right now I don't think I'd recommend it as you can be charged a bit of a silly price for it. With it not being next-gen and most of my friends eing on Xbox One or PS4 I've not had to shell out for a console version as well this year.  Do I recommend this game? As it stands, unlesss you're a big F1 fan - and you don't already own it - I'd say no and I wasn't expecting to say that.
7522	I seem to be saying it year after year; F1 2011 is Codemasters finest Formula One game. It's disappointing to say it once more, but it's fact. This 2014 game is a step forward in on track driving but still lacking in immersion off track.   The game is enjoyable on the whole and the price drop is welcome since there is alot of copy paste going on. The ontrack handling is very enjoyable requiring skill but the cars are more realistic and manageable, the brakes on the other hand seem to have been dumbed down in difficulty. You can really push the brakes now and there is a nice little audible that give you a hint in advance of any lockup. It seems to work well for gameplay. The lack of traction in general has made racing the cars on the limit a hell of a lot of fun and very satisfying in getting those perfect laps, or if you over cook it a little and go into a drift.  The rules changed and removed KERS making overtaking a little trickier, but that in turn made successful overtaking more satifying. The AI is still not very bright; at overtaking and can easily be lead into trying it around the outside, where it has to slot back in behind. Also sometimes it get offline and seem to just give up trying to take the corner and lets numerous cars go by before it slots back into the train.  There's no 3D modelled interactive agent, no paddock or motor homes. No interaction with the media and no press interviews for podiums. All hurting the game series since losing it in 2012. The animations are all old, even the HUD graphics are 99% from F1 2013.   I'd recommend it just on the racing, but without the immersion it falls down to it's older brother, F1 2011. Don't get me wrong it's a step in the right direction, but I wouldn't endorse it as is to friends when F1 2011 exists. F1 2011 might be outdated, but it holds all the longevity gameplay items the newer F1 games by codemasters can only dream about,
7523	Career mode has received absolutely no significant updates, you cannot pick your driver number, your racing suit has the name and nationality of the driver you are replacing, there are no podium celebrations, and certain tracks have not been updated, notably Monza, the runoff of parabolica is not paved as it was this year.  The fact that F1 classics is missing also takes away from a game that is only a slightly changed version of F1 2013. Don't waste your money on this game.
7524	Whilst I'm actually very much enjoying this game I have to say it's a bit of an insult to loyal fans of the series which is why I can't recommend it.  So what if they are concentrating their efforts on the new next gen version, if that's the case then the release price of this game should have reflected that. It's a very lazy 'update' that is made apparent when you first see your car being pushed back into the garage. The guy standing at the front of the car is pushing last years model and his hands are more than a foot away from the new cars and is very offputting, immediately detracting from any realism you were hoping to feel. AI is just as dumb when it comes to moving off the racing line and will smash into you rather than avoid you if you are going slower on an out lap. The rules can be totally ignored by the AI drivers which is especially evident when there's a safety car out. For example, I'm leading the race and lined up behind the safety car, just going into the final bend where the SC is about to go into the pits, nowhere near the finish/start line. The car in second place speeds past me and I get disqualified for overtaking with a safety car out. So basically it's still plagued by the many bugs/flaws of its predessors and has to rank among the laziest 'updates' I've ever played, yet still I enjoy the game. Weird I know but that's how it is. 
7525	At this point in time I can not recommend the game due to its poor wheel support I was hoping for a lot more in a way of settings I have full rig and this game does not use my setups full potential.  I spent close to an hour trying to find a suitable setting through the game and through the profiler with no luck.  I thought 2014 may be a little different to the rest but its pretty much the same just with a make over and some new tracks  I will follow codemasters and see if they tweak the wheel support feels like the game is more controller based  If it's on special grab it but at the current price unless you're a dedicated F1 fan it's not worth the money   I will update and change review if anything changes but for now wait for F1 2015
7526	This game totally makes you miss f1 2012 or f1 2013 ( KERS button ruined this game), 2015 doesn't seem any better, MP problems are just the beginning, Codemaster is a master at getting rich every year off F1...If your a fan of F1 get it, If not F1 2012 is still the best one....
7527	Turned off all assists after the initial test lap.  The feeling that I was playing anything even remotely like an F1 simulator was just not there.  26 minutes later, asked for a refund.  Avoid.  
7528	I was looking forward to playing this game but now I am really disappointed. Why? This is really a backwards by code masters. I hope there is much improvement s in the 2016 game.
7529	game constantly freezes
7530	Steering with Keybaord is horrible compared to F1 2012.
7531	Unplayable if you've only got a joystick or a keyboard - your control will be very unstable and you'll end up spinning your car around and hitting the barriers like an idiot. You need to buy a wheel which cost Â£80 at least to get an actual racing experience.
7532	Absolutely terrible port of this game, a ton more effort should have been put in. Even the default key bindings were mind boggling, and the just assume you're going to use an Xbox 360 controller, um well what if I want to use one of the most common peripherals for a computer instead, aka the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing keyboard.   Oh well. I do like the game, but don't waste your money on it... I hope they actually make a PC version of the 2015 edition, rather than just port it over. 
7533	  Now I don't play many racing games on my PC (long live the xbox360) but my buddy shared this with me from the family thing and I thought I would give it a go, now the last f1 racer was the Codemasters/ego 2011 game and to accounts the only things better is the textures and updated team drivers..  The power unit sound is just a loud high pitched whine. the braking actually works but the steering is now bs (playing with a keyboard) so good work the worst and the best part of 2011 game has been swapped. Where did the honest career mode campaign mode go?  Maybe it's just being on a PC (that far outstrips my old console) but it seems as a game far worse than 2011 f1. There are plenty of improvements from the radio calls to the degradation and picking up marbles, to the new animations to how you react to impacts.  maybe I just like the sport itself too much, or the old game but that's my opinion, if ya want it to take it if not **** of
7534	A reskinned version of 2013 with little to no improvements. Uses the same outdated game engine of 2013 just with a different paint coat. Even the devs admited this years version was a reskin push out that they spent little time or effort on to focus on the new next gen game engine that '15 and '16 use. Also lacks the force feedback and wheel weight for newer wheels (g29 / ts300 ect) just like 2013 does.  All in all, at this point 2014 is a pointless title that doesn't substancially improve on 2013 and is inferiour to 2015+ (ESP '16) in every single aspect from graphics to espcially car simulation, handling, braking, AI, tire ware, fuel consumption, weight transfer, ect ect. If you have a newer wheel like g29 / ts300 that work with the next gen consoles then you can forget F1 titles prior to 2015 (the first next gen only f1 title) as the force feedback doesn't work with the last gen games ('14 and eariler).  Now that 2016 is out it puts this and all previous titles to shame in every way, but especially this one as '14 is by far the worst of them. If you want the full, most immersive F1 experience, with the best features, then get '16.
7535	Don't be stupid like I am and buy this game. No, seriously, it's horrible. Same can be said for 2015, which is so much worse. I'm giving Codies a last chance with 2016, or I will demand they hand their F1 license over to another dev. But yeah, not much to say, apart from it being a patched F1 2013. And there's barely anything new, if any.
7536	In a stub: + Graphics are awesome - The physics engine is absolutely rubbish, the handling is not at all convincing!  DO NOT BUY any of the Codemasters' if you are looking for a realistic racing experience.  My story/comments: For a long time I've been playing Grand Prix 3 &amp; 4. I like a realistic racing sim, and these games really hit the mark in physics, although the graphics are outdated. As such, I had tried a demo of F1 2012 a few years ago and recalled I didn't like the handling, but I did appreciat the graphics and detail. As such I thought I'd give Codemasters another go and bought F1 2014.   On the plus side, the graphics are amazing even at lower settings, and the attention to details off-track (such as entering &amp; exiting the car) are nice additions that could make a very realistic experience.  That said, the basics that the racing experience should build on are - in my opinion - rubbish. Of course I have not driven real F1 cars, but the physics just don't add up to something that represents reality.  I tried the standard settings, but also spent numerous hours trying to adjust the handling with the options that are handed to the user. My experience is as follows, using a pistol grip RC racing transmitter: - The steering in-game is considerably slower than my steering input, as if there is a maximum steering input speed. This makes for a dead and disconnected feel to the car and I have to start judging how fast the game will allow me to turn in in order to hit the apex. The appropriate way to go about things is to make the car respond as quickly as I do, at which point the car will respond quickly but (likely) lose balance with under- or oversteer because in reality the cars are not made to turn in so suddenly. - The throttle is ridiculous: It is all too easy to cause wheelspin, which is logical. However in no way the car can break out at the rear more than +- 15 degrees, so the only consequence of too much throttle is less forward drive. This is very noticable in low-speed and long corners and upon exiting corners. - The brakes are like ABS on your road car: However hard you may try, it is near-impossible to get the wheels to lock up, even at the most unforgiving settings. - Going off track is not an issue because the car is won't destabilize like the real thing. - Contact between cars or cars and trackside objects is not convincing: Not only are the cars stronger than they should be, the impacts don't show any sort of absorption, deformation or anything: It's like Codemasters re-invented pong with high resolution rendering.  The F1 2012 demo had similar issues, and funnily enough the last Codemasters racing simulator I tried before that (DTM Race Driver 3) had similar issues too. I don't know how they do it, but it's messed up that a game from more than 10 years earlier outperforms their game in how realistic the handling feels. The impression it left on me is that I don't ever have to bother with racing simulators by Codemasters ever again; I'll stick with Geoff Crammond's awesome 'GP4' and with the 'Race' series by SimBin.
7537	I used to like this game so I got a wheel and pedals. *Turns off all assists. *Feathers throttle. Spin. *Turns on TC.
7538	In 30 hours of gameplay my carreer savegame got corrupted 3 times and I had to star all over again!! Never again!!
7539	The grip is terrible holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ im on legend and using a mclaren with mix 3 fuel but â¥â¥â¥â¥ I'm still getting 22th in austrialia cause of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ grip.
7540	Still has bugs (lost chars)
7541	A faithful port of F1 racing, just not a game I care to pick up again.
7542	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME It's another copy and paste. Codemasters don't care about F1, they care about a profit and thats why they gave us this terrible game. I REAPEAT DO NOT BUY!
7543	*sigh*  Can't help but feel a bit ripped off by this.  Apart from a new circuit and different car models/sounds, there is little to no other difference.  The game engine must be exactly the same. Penaltys are no different - still as awful as last years game. Blue flags are terrible.  The garage crew are exactly the same as last year. I know this obviously doesn't effect how the game plays... but it does show how lazy Codemasters have been. They must be laughing their heads off this year and calling their buying audiance utter mugs.  Glad I only paid 20 quid via CJS Keys.
7544	I paid for the game after checking my laptop was capable of runnig the game but when it loaded the first part loads and then i am left with a black screen, cant work out why cant find a fix either, cant work out whats going wrong
7545	The game says it is trying to open, it gets to the first loading page then crashes and kicks you out of the game.
7546	I'm so done with this game...
7547	Very bad game.
7548	Well where do I start. I think ill just emphasise on two to three main points here. #1 Im 22 races into Career mode, I havent had one single circuit without rain in either Prac, Qualifying, Racing. Annoying as hell. #2 Everytime i come in for a pit stop, i get held up to about 7+ seconds, and cars that entered the pit lane 3 seconds behind me get out in front. CONSTANTLY. #3 On Expert AI, I can outrace by 20-40seconds by the end of a 50% race. In Legend mode, i get beat by 20seconds+. Thought it was ment to adjust to your skill level. Overall, Consistantly bad. But I play anyway.
7549	If you are a wheel user who is happy to pay for what is essentially the same experience as F1 2013 (and one that has arguably less content) but with the new cars and tracks, then F1 2014 might be for you.  However, if you use a controller then steer clear, do not waste your money! The handling model is ruined in this one. Driver aids are forced upon you and it makes everything drive like junk. This is applicable to you whether you used assists before or not. Though if you didnât use assists then the difference is even more aggravating. All the nice driving feel is gone. For them to claim this was in the name of accessibility is just baffling. The games have always had options to turn assists on for new players. Why couldnât these new assists be included in said options? How does it make sense to force them upon people who purposefully turn assists off!?  What is left is a game where driving is a chore not a challenge. The cars feel awful but at the same time you will find it hard to ever spin or lock a tire. Instead you will be stuck throwing yourself into corners like an idiot because the traction control will just do the work for you, otherwise you canât keep up. Driving fast with a controller in this game feels like cheating and going back to 2013 I was well aware of how much worse of a driver it had made me.  In terms of content the only real addition is a shortened career mode, in which you advance through teams by setting their drivers as rivals and beating them in a best of 3 races. I actually think this is pretty cool and I hope it stays in the series. Apart from that everything is the same but they cut the classic cars and tracks, along with a lot of the new driver testing stuff.   This is what you get when you take a franchise that already struggles for new content because of its annual release schedule, then tell the developers they actually have less time than usual because their 2015 version needs to be next gen and released early than usual. Hopefully it makes up for this mess.  Skip this one. 
7550	Excluding 2010 (GFWL), 2011 (GFWL), &amp; 2015 (mess):  2014 is best for beginners  2013 is best for hobbyists.  2012 is best for money savers __________________________________  About 2014 specifically:  + Good graphics + Good gameplay and difficulty options (accessible to everyone) + Streamlined interface (accessible to everyone) + Small download   - Harder to find multiplayer sessions if you live in North America (even if you change region, due to far apart time zones).  - Racenet login issue in-game (despite being registered)
7551	I would not buy this game, it is boring and repetitive, even if you are a true racing fanatic, this game is not for and could be considered as a waste of time and money foe some people, there are much better racing titles for the price
7552	download 2 mods, debug and f1 2016 mod.   attempt 1: IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CRASHES AFTER LOADING THE RACE.  attempt 2: IT CRASHES AFTER LEAVING PITLANE FOR THE GRID attempt 3: (removed mods) IT CRASHED AGAIN GSJGFSDIJG&lt;ILDJF&lt;LGDF&lt;JGLDFJ   overall i rate 1/10, used to be 7/10
7553	This game is exactly the same as the last one, oh no wait, it's even worse! The only thing they've changed is the sounds and have made the cars handle rubbish! This is definitely the worse F1 game ever made, I prefered playing F1 2009 on my PSP and that was awful. The AI seems fine in Career hovever, on co-op they seem so OP that you can never seem to keep up! It's the same with general online multiplayer but it seems to be the opposite of co-op as when the cars are set to legend they seem to work as if they are set to amatuer. This is not a years worth of work really disappointed! Wait until F1 2015 guys see if it's any better!  Update:  F1 2015 is just as â¥â¥â¥â¥ as this game...  Update: F1 2016 is also a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game do not buy...  Update:  F1 2017 is also a wank game...  Update:  F1 2018 is just awful. CodeMasters should just die...
7554	Played this game for a few Hrs. This game looks and plays very similar to F1 2013 but without the classic tracks and cars. If you already own F1 2013 then there is nothing much to get from this game as all the features and interface look 100% similar. In game graphics is good but the cars sound average.  I played this game using a gamepad, the car doesnât handle that well in wet conditions, and there is too much power applied unnecessarily which results in the rear wheels spinning. Also, there is no KERS activation button in this game. It is automatically applied as and when necessary.  F1 2013 was a great game and still costs more than this version. If you own that then there is no point in buying the 2014 version unless you want to drive on the Russian GP track. This game is good for first time F1 game buyers.
7555	Drivinig is not that realistic.......response time is a little slow.
7556	Garbage.  The game doesn't run on Windows 10, apparently. I've tried reinstalling, verifying game files, backing up and restoring. There's absolutely zero movement from Codemasters on this.  Not impressed.
7557	also the place, game bags have gone from a stim in ps4, to you there, from nothing pulls extensively. The developer and codemasters-you are pidoras
7558	I was very disappointed to find that this is very much an arcade style racing game. I wish they're was a way to completely turn off all the assists, meaning even with the assists turned off in the game menu I can definetely still feel the traction control preventing wheel spin.  Setting up my T500 will take hours of frustrating testing and tweaking to make it feel like I'm acctually in control of these cars. Code Masters? More like Code â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. They've butchered something with great potential by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥izing the controls and not spending the time to make it feel real.   If you're a 10 year old boy with a game pad, you're gonna love this game. If you're looking for a serious F1 racing experience, look somewhere else.
7559	I award this game the 'Worse than CoD' award for recycling not only 2013 in general, but for uses the exact same steering wheel on ALL cars except the RB10 and STR9, along with using LAST YEARS STEERING WHEEL on the Williams.  This game is a pathetic cash grab and I feel stupid for trusting that it wouldn't be terrible.  Wait for 2015, then wait a week to put down your money on the game.  edit: In response to comments.  Cars handle practically the same as 2013, not a huge night and day difference like it was between '12 and '13. Not enough there to make it a standout point.  No the steering wheels are NOT exactly the same in real life. The electronics behind the systems ARE (provided by Mclaren) but the actual physical designs are NOT.  Yes i WILL knock Codemasters for not doing their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing job properly. Yes i WILL knock them for not even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bothering to remain faithful to the sport in a game where 90% of ALL of 2013 is literally copy/pasted. And no i can't recommend this game on that basis because you're giving Codemasters 50 bucks for a ctrl+C/V.
7560	After buying this game i reckon i should get a free trial of 2015,cos for 50 bucks if 2015 is anything like this game i would want my money back, i paid 20 for this and feel like i'm watching a flame go round a track. what do u reckon codemasters like my code?  As an update to my comment about F1 2015,everyone says not recommended,as i thought,so glad i didnt buy it,hence the comments made here as i cannot review a game i dont own,dont own so very happily.Looks like the only thing codemasters is working on in F1 is reverse gear,they are going backwards with this title,its getting worse,and codemasters keep taking our money thinking 'hey this must be a good game, people are still buying it'. When will we all learn!!!!!
7561	Steam is asking me if i would recommend this game. It's hard to recommened wheteher or not to buy this game while these circumstances are messing up with my joy while playing this game. First of all if you are looking for a simulator then this is not a game for you. Even on the hardest difficulty it is very easy to over pass your opponents like if you would be racing on the easiest settings and when it comes for your opponent to overtake you it's nearly impposible for them to do that unless you make a mistake your self. This game needs hell of improvments when it comes to the AI and the most dissapointing thing and which makes me rather say 'do not buy this game' is that the F1 franchise is lacking on new content. I can assume this game is almost the same thing just as F1 2011 if i don't include in the new main menu, challenges, graphics and drivers and teams. On the other hand graphics are impressive and innovative compared to F1 2011. The career mode gave me the feeling as if i would be an athentic Formula 1 driver, but again it's nothing new. That's about it, I can barely find anything that would satisfy me since i have the feeling of playing a recycled game. If you never purchased an F1 game from codies then go for it, I am pretty sure you wont be dissapointed, but if you already did then stick to your older F1 game and you could just get a MOD for the new seasons. You wont be missing out much. As an F1 consumerist i sense this is a recycled product (not garbage, just recycled), so just go get an older F1 game and say NO to this one.
7562	The game will not work with Fanatec wheel . Steam is such a bad site to get any help with . now with a tx wheel settings always change
7563	I'm a massive F1 fan, I use a G27 wheel. I play a variety of racing games including iRacing, F1 2013 and Asseto Corsa on a semi-regular basis.  Codemasters, is a large company with many years of experience.  Given that. I should not be able to real of a list of things they should have done better.  The Williams livery - no excuse, I should not have to mod an official F1 game (there are already several good mods for this) so that I can have the cars look like they do in real life. It's absolutely ridiculous.  The AI - Far worse an effort than last year, the AI feel like they are driving completely different cars to me, at some parts they brake way later than I can, at others, they have so much more grip they must have made their cars from magnets and put iron in the roads. They catapult themselves between far too aggressive and far too meek, almost bi-polar even.  In 3 months there will be several high quality AI mods and this complaint will be rendered null, but I shouldn't have to wait until a modder, on his own time makes a mockery of codemasters.  The performance - My graphics card is overheating on high settings.  Well obviously you say, get a better graphics card! Well, yeah, that too. But I've been playing the older games on the very highest settings, including using graphics enhancing mods and they look ab-so-lute-ly gorgeous. Surely, SURELY I should be able to make use of the same level of graphics? No, I absolutely can't, not only that, but they are significantly worse, the reflections are blocky and the colouration is distorted, the mirrors remind me of my N64 (yes, I exaggerate, but not by nearly enough) (already there are fixes on the steam forum for this, if users can fix it within a few days, why wasn't it like it in the first place?). It's just plain worse. And given that it's pretty much the same game as last year, I shouldn't have that problem.  Content - Well, we all knew that this was going to be a stop gap until F1 2015. But that doesn't make it better. This feels very slim compared to the earlier titles.  It just frustrates me that these are issues, as sure as the Sun sets there are many other issues, but these strike me in particular as things that are easy to fix, should never have been an issue in the first place or just smack or finances being the goal and not the game.  Having said that, it's not all bad. I like the physics changes... But the bugbears have struck first. 
7564	Same as F1 2013, only new tracks, new cars, new sounds, some cosmetic changes. Same (old) engine as F1 2013.
7565	DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR USING WINDOWS 10 ---------------------------------------------------  Do not buy not just F1 2014, but any other F1 game if your on Windows 10 especially if your using gamepad as your diving controller. For gamepad users, I assure you everytime you play this game you will get this bug/glitch where your car suddenly starts to move either to the left/right (commonly right). I\'m not fully blaming Codemaster for this bug/glitch, I started to suspect Windows 10 that might cause this problem. Overall the game looks pretty cool, I thank the person who made the graphics look so realistic also the detail in the car, crowd, grass, circuit, etc. Sadly I can\'t give a good review about the game until either Microsoft or Codemaster fix this tiny problem. Remember that many people put a lot of effort into this game! Bought a steering wheel, upgrade their RAM so they can play the game lagless, wasting their time eventhough there are important things to do, and so much more just for a game.  Anyway if your using Windows below 10, I can promise you that this and all F1 games works perfect and smoothly (if you have the minimum specs of course). Peace Out!
7566	The worst racing game I've ever played. Desync and sidepod glitches still plague online races and the cars are not realistic or fun to drive at all.   This video showed my first impressions, but since then these views have changed hugely:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  F1 2014 - Day One Review!&nbsp;
7567	If you've played any of the other offerings in this series then this incarnation will be largely familiar. While the handling is quite different and does reflect some of the changes in the 2014 season you could just be driving the old V8s as the developers haven't bothered to implement the more refined features of the 2014 engines. In fact, there are fewer engine features in this game than in the previous games. Now you've just got the loud pedal, the stop pedal and DRS. There's no implementation of boost or energy recovery, something that seems to be a key factor for the real cars. Whether the developers didn't have access to this sort of information, thought it would be too complex for the average gamer or were just too lazy to put it into the game it does mean that if you're thinking of upgrading to the latest version to get the features of the 2014 spec engines then you're going to be disappointed. If you're happy to carry on with the V8s and an earlier driver line up then hang onto your cash and wait for the new technologies to be properly developed.
7568	Can't even get the game to work. Keeps crashing to desktop and no matter what I try to do to fix it it doesn't work. Read so many forums about F1 2014 CTDs but nothing seems to make a difference. Waste of my time and money.
7569	If i could get my money back i would.  There are no multiplayer matches avaialable and it's doesn't support head tracking???
7570	Having had a comparision to a long history of F1 Games from early atari via the penical of Geoff Crammond's masterpieces and lows like Alain Prost's racing all the way through to the current crop you can assume two things. I love driving games, especially simulations, and I am a bit of a mug, as I buy (almost) all of them. Seeing the progression of Codemaster efforts I can't help but shake the feeling that they are fallowing the market, no doubt backed up by the in game logging system that shows them statistical distributions of which features are used how often and so on. I am not sure that works for me.   In short: This game is great for casual to intermediate racers, but the simplification of the game has taken a lot of the simulation feel away. Please buy it if this is your first go, or if you prefer your racing fast, furious and not too serious/dull. It is definitly great fun and even a bit of a simulation. Having said that, don't be a mug and buy it if you own 2013. Just don't!  Long version: On the positive side I think F1 2014 is making a good stab at recreating the new feel of F1. Squeeling tyres, odd engine noises and the changed breaking distances are all reflected. In addition the racing is very emersive and overall the game gives you a good race in most scenarios. For example I expected the new track in Russia to be boring as F1 drivers stated that the simulator didn't represent the real fun of the track, as it flowed much nicer in reality. However when I started timed laps around it I got into a rythm pretty quickly and before long really enjoyed the track, which can only mean one thing: Nice job Coders :)  When starting the game you get a nice intro (very much like 2013) and all the visuals are at the same level as 2013 with the odd tweek here and there. For example sparks flying from underneath the car are noticable and sometimes really get into your virtual face. The handling is also improved somewhat with a sharper feel, reflecting the oversteer nature of modern F1 cars. Scenario modes are there as before, increasing in difficulty, but if you have played them in 2013, then 2014 doesn't offer anything new. But scenarios are in general good fun. I found the rain / wet track scenario quite hard but that might just be me. Compared to other online racers, who post rediculously high scores, I seem to be middle of the pack.   In a season challange you again get the chance to pick an opponent from anywhere on the grid and as long as you beat them best of 3, then you get their seat. Starting this challange on medium I was surprised to be dumped straight into qualifying on a new track in Austria (although I had vague memories of the layout from F1GP2). Steep learning curve? You bet. Especially for novice drivers. But great fun.    There are some differences that are fairly neutral. No boost button anymore, No gear rations to set and a couple of other minor changes not worth mentioning here. Suffices to say the format of F1 has changed in reality and this game reflects this. But it does lead to less to do and think about. Given that there is little new besides the sound and some drive models I can't shake the feeling that it is too little change for the better. One thing worth mentioning is that if you opt to return to the pits the 2013 version had a nasty habbit of continuing the engine noise. That has been fixed. On the otherhand desperatly trying to switch to a one stop strategy at Imola was impossible, even when calling for option tyres from the car. The pit crew just ignored me forcing me to stop again :(  Pit stops, corner cutting penalties and so on have all be retained although the execution has ever so slightly changed (you can switch this penalty off as well ). And this is where my list of gripes start. This should not be taken too seriously but I was hopping since 2011 that this would be fixed and it still hasn't happened:  I am missing:  1) freedom to set up the car asymetrically (different settings for every corner of the car) 2) What about dampers, gearration at the beginning of the season and so on? 3) The black and white nature of the commentary and news articles (I raced from last to 8th in a caterham on high difficulty level, one place behind my rival (Vettel) and ended up with an animation of my driver shaking his head in dispair - that does kill the mood 4) Why not let us drive the pre-race lap to check out the track? 5) cartoon physics and damage model - I am sick and tired of getting nothing but wing damage. Please sort it and negotiate harder with the FIA. This is probably one of my major gripes, especially since it now includes mid air drifting when jumping shikanes (you can try this on most 90 degree corners). It is also still true that in a pile up cars have a tendency to 'stick together' because the collision detection still does not resolve object interlocking correctly (In the real world two objects hitting each other end up repelling each other, but not here). This has been a basic 3D Vector coding problem since the 1990s, and while some games have managed to solve this, codemasters is alas still stuck in the past (although it is not ruining the game!).  6) The AI still has major flaws around lapping (slowing on the racing line most of the times when met in corners) and their tendency to drive into you from behind at the start of races is also somewhat annoying (of course with no penalty). 7) Can we have a story line please? You sort of had a half hearted story in an earlier version but killed it.  8) Please give us better grafics than the playstation. We can handle it. 9) I would like testing (could also be the tsrat of the story line) - especially pre-season to help with developing the car in a direction I like.  10) accuracy of the penalty system is still poor. Sorry, but if 2 wheel are still on the road (U-Turn in Canada) even if the other two are not, then there should be no penalty - just as an example.  11) Career progression is unrealistic. If you drive the socks of a Caterham and continously put it in the top 10 over 5 races in the season you will be offered a contract by one of the top 3 teams. But not in this game.  12) What about two way communications around pit stops? Please fix that and enhance so that when tyre wear is low the pit might ask how it is going? How about having multiple race stratregies amd an option to switch to plan C?  Therew are many more wishes, but the above could all have been done with a little bit more work and they are not ground breaking either. All in all this is a genuine attempt at getting something new represented in the F1 world, but the price does not reflect the changes made, which are overall minor tweeks. Not all of them to my liking. Simply put, by going after a broader appeal Simulation fans have ended up loosing out again. That is frustrating to say the least. It feels shallower and the physics execution is more like TOCA then F1. I still can't feel the build up of downforce as the speed increasese, and I can't gain a tenth here and there by doing very carful car set-ups.    I know that is not what thew majority seems to want, but then this is my review and they can write theirs.   Dear Codmasters:  Please rework the phsyics from scratch (car, damage, collision, the lot).  Please give us more simulation options that make real differences on how the car feels, and  bring us a propper career story line.  Yours faithfully  Chris (F1 simulation addict)
7571	Buggier than F1 2013 which was already bad. Online play is just stupid with all the bugs and the random lag.
7572	im sure theres a game here somware
7573	Game cant even launch it crash everytime again and again Steam tries to relaunch it and i get like 22 crash dumps in my steam folder , i realy wanne play it!!!!! tried reinstalling steam ect
7574	every time i play this game something always happen it just keeps on quiting and playing i did not press anything and sometimes when its fullscreen it just exit immediately
7575	F1 2014 is a bleak version of F1 2012/2013. Effects and Graphics less polished. Game engine seems more forgiving and noobish even on hardest difficulty with all driving assists off. Embarrassing really. Hopefully Codemasters come back with good versions on the new consoles this year. In the meantime, buy and play F1 2013.
7576	This game i may say if something i don't want to waste my time with as i am a pad user Yes sure pad users have better traction but we under steer like crazy, so this game is by far more worse than 2013. it would be nice though that in 2015 there would a fair balance between pad and wheel user. through out the past 3 games there has been something wrong with it. F1 2012- if you was to go online you would actually find out that the Sauber is Faster in equal car performance F1 2013- the pad users had a better steering input thus saving tyre life which was a BIG thing for the game F1 2014- the wheel seems to be Superior than the pad.  please make f1 2015 far more better and make it equal just please other wise you could be losing a fan
7577	Being a Huge f1 fan i was really looking forward to playing 2014, first of all i was disapointed they had dropped classics mode from 2013 witch i found to be alot of fun. 2014 is basically a stop gap untill the next gen graphics engine gets used in 2015:  PROS: New circuit to race on  CONS: Poor graphics Bad Physics Cars feel really slow  To be honest this game could of been a dlc for 2013. hope this helps guys and girls 
7578	To begin, I am a major Formula 1 fan and usually pick up the game every other year to see all of the major changes for the games. I started with F1 2010 on the xbox 360 and then F1 2012 on the 360 before finally making it to F1 2014 on the PC.  Pros: - Runs at a solid 60+ fps 1080p while recording - Graphics appear to have become better since 2012 (although i was on console for that) - Learning curve is reasonable. You can pick up the game fairly easy and every couple of races you can turn up the difficulty a little bit or turn off some assists to get better. - You get to experience the new turbo F1 cars.  Cons: - One major graphical error that bothers me to no end is that fact that when you are in the 'TV Pod' camera mode as well as the driver's camera mode, the mirrors provide you with absolutely no information. The mirrors look like they came straight out of pole position. Legitemately, the reflection of cars in the side mirrors give you no benefit because pole position had better graphics detail and animation. - Home menu and submenus not necessarily the most intuitive - After exiting fullscreen through an Alt+Tab, the game cannot be put into fullscreen mode again without exiting game and launching game again (this may only be a problem for me but, I have to launch it using Nvidia Geforce Experience or it won't be fullscreen at all) - It's the same game as years prior (Coming from 2012 to 2014 and from console to PC, the only difference I notice is the graphics, the cars are supposed to feel completely different and be harder to drive with the new regulation changes, but I feel as though I'm still driving the 8 cylinder naturally aspirated F1 car with blown diffusers from 2010 and 2012.)  Overall: If this is you first game in the F1 series, get it. If you already have a game but are looking for an updated version with an all new feel, don't. The game is a Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V of previous years. Unfortunately this is the Madden of racing games and I don't see the game changing this pattern in the near future.  Graphics: 6/10 Sound: 8/10 New Features: 0/10 Overall Quality for New Player: 7/10 Overall Quality for Returning Player: 4/10
7579	Career mode sucks. You can't adjust your car in the way you want. Car loses its stability during season etc...  They tried to make something good but in the end it became something bad.   Previous F1's are better such as 11
7580	After playing F1 2013 i thougt that the F1 2014 would be better, but this was only a dream. I shift gears with using the engine sounds and there aren't good or useful engine sounds, you dont hear when you can shift, you must look when you have to shift. and the traction controls are awkard as much.
7581	What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ is with this ffb? it's almost undriveable like this turning of every assist and yet i seems to auto turn and randomly starts turning when going in a straight line etc. what the hell.
7582	Thank you for another broken game. Is that all is being released nowaday?
7583	BUY 2013 INSTEAD!!!!  As a huge fan an owner of F1 2010, F1 2011, F1 2012 and F1 2013 I have to say that this game is downright awful.  - Rain raices are literally impossible  -&gt; Seriously, spend 5 hours on finding a setup, and AI still is always 2 seconds faster  -&gt; Spin out all the time, even with an analog controller and wheels/pedals. 1% Throttle = too much  - Penalties are still ridiculous  -&gt; AI crashes into you in a corner - you get a penalty  - Annoying graphic bugs  -&gt; Reflections in mirrors are lowest quality and have color issues  -&gt; Rosbergs car (no. 6) behind you? Reflection shows Hamiltons car (no. 44)  - Wheel support is lousy   -&gt; Force feedback is horrible, unplayable with a Thrustmaster T500 RS  - No updates since day 1, and none to come  -&gt; Developers are lazy and refusing to fix this mess  - AI still too stupid to pass you   Bottom line: Stay away from this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7584	It's ok, but I wouldn't advise you to get it if you are only going to play it once in a while. The career mode is exactly the same bar some feature that shortens the season - who is going to use that? Online at the moment is more laggy than it was last year, but I should imagine they will fix that. Quick race, proving grounds and a pointless evaluation test are what it says on the tin. It goes without saying that Codemasters are clearly focusing on their new 'engine' for 2015, however for 30 pounds i was expecting a little more than an update from 2013 which only adds 2 new tracks takes away classics and gives us the seasons cars, drivers etc.  As a conclusion, I was expecting more from 2014, however my enjoyment from the game is still pleasing in my perspective. 2015 will be a decider if Codemasters can cut the mark on the 'next gen' games market and I am very much looking forward to the game coming out.
7585	Not work in carrier.
7586	I expected this to be less arcade-like on the highest 'difficulty setting'. Physics are non-existing, quite a disappointment is an understatement here. Oh well, at least this allows me to memorize Tilke layouts before actual GP weekends...
7587	Very dissapointed in this game, its just a Copy &amp; Paste from F1 2013 with 2 new tracks, and new V6 engine sounds. Not worth the price tag it was selling at. If you have F1 2013 dont bother buying this version as you will be sadly dissapointed.
7588	Got this one cheap, wouldn't have bought it for it's full price, since I already have F1 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. If you have 2013 I can't recommend this, if you don't.. get the cheapest from 2011 to 2014. Personally I still find 2012 to be the best out of the series.
7589	FIX THE GAME
7590	If you just want a f1 game, this one just fine. If you want a sim f1 game, this one is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7591	SP is unplayable. AI is behaving so randomly, it's ridiculous. I reduced assists more and more, and am now at expert difficulty with Toro Rosso, it's always the same.  Cars in front are impossible to keep up with during the race (doesn't matter if I'm 5th or 15th, my position just depends on the first few corners, with Toro Rosso it could be anything from 1st to 18th....). I probably use DRS once a race. But there's always one car in my 1s DRS window behind me. The cars behind me push ALL the time no matter what tyres, no matter how many laps they already have on the tyres, no matter how fast I'm actually going or what setup I have.  They hop on the brakes at least 50m too early but suddenly have amazing grip and acceleration out of the corner. Again it doesn't matter what tyres/setup/car and so on.  What a mess.  Just to play with my X360 controller I had to switch to 'other controller' or something... suddenly I had so much more control, I could turn difficulty up by two levels............
7592	        YouTubeâ¢ Video:  SHOCKING interview with Codemasters F1 2014 employee&nbsp;
7593	I've played this for about 100 hours now, its not good, lets just leave it at that.
7594	Wait for the new 2015 game same as the last one.
7595	This was the biggest waste of money i've spent on a game.
7596	This game is very bad worse then 2013.  Codemasters should be ashamed of them selfs.  This is just a reskin with a big price tag, all the bugs are still there. There working on 2015 so thats why nothing was put in to this game but what i seen from the leaked 2015 images its looking 2015 will be a reskin with higher res graphics with the same game engine.  To be honest Codies should lose the contract for F1 games there so bad.
7597	I'm not a fan of F1. I just wanted to see how it is to drive such a car. It broke my nerves so much that all I wanted was to uninstall it to revenge. A game is to have fun. This is not one of them. Don't get me wrong. For those who play the series maybe it's ok. But after 18 times the same race (couse i wanted really bad to beat my rival) i managed to be 4th, last lap and out of nowhere, with zero speed, i got out of the way and turned over, that was the last thing i could stand. RIP F1
7598	THIS GAME IS THE BIGGEST â¥â¥â¥â¥ EVER!!! DONT BUY IT!!!
7599	bULL SCHITH--IM LOST 10 PLACE FROM PENALTY SECEND UALIFY--BUT FAY--NO BLOCKING-NO RAMMING--THIS BULL SHITH--I SMILE--BUT THIS IS --IM DOMINATION THIS SESSION--THATS fia..:D 
7600	the sound of the car is sooo bad!!! dont like this game
7601	im not impressed with the online play as no one seems to be online, almost impossible to find a race i have had the game for 4 days and probly only raced 5 races online
7602	3/10
7603	awful game not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7604	I played this game for a very long time and could never get used to the handling model. They textures were pretty poor and so was the force feedback. The in-game wheel movement was disorientating and the whole thing ran poorly.
7605	Do NOT BUY this game. UNLESS if you have wheel, but this game isn't very good for PC AND keyboard. Waste of money.. I actually thought this game would support keyboard but turns out they don't support keyboard very much.. And it is hard to steering too.
7606	This game is no where near as fun as the first one. I played it for 10 minutes before i couldnt stand it anymore. the car feels like it is perfectly attached to the road. it feels as if its on a rail or something and you have no clue as to the speed that you're traveling. F1 2013 had none of these problems. it allowed the players to feel as though they are one with the cars. and feel the sensation of speed. F1 2014 is not at this same level of quality. It feels like an unfinished game, that was rushed out early.
7607	When NPC's crash into you, you get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing penalty
7608	WARNING The game requires Gamespy servers for online play. Server were permantly turned off 31st May 2014. This is no longer a fully functional product.
7609	This game is kinda bad, it feels extremely choppy and it's showing high framerates, the bike physics and mechanic really suck. If you're looking for a MX game look into THQ's MX vs ATV, much better game.
7610	Pretty crappy game compared to Reflex, only graphics are good and one track (Lommel). Got it for 3$ it's about how much it's worth. No fun, poor mechanincs.
7611	Launcher does nothing but crash even after re-install and tweaking. I have a very robust machine that would eat this game. Wouldnt waste the money
7612	Does not supprt HD7970 Graphics card. Can not play.
7613	this games keeps crashing everytime at the point of loading a race
7614	I want my money BACK !!! This game is not a motocross game ! this is a normaly race game -_-
7615	Terrible control, bad graphics, don't recommended.
7616	I dont recommend this game because it is so cartoony and i reget getting it you are better off with mx vs. atv. you have to buy tricks! you should just learn them not buy the tricks. i have had this game for about 1 hour and i reget everything about this game. if you want a dirt bike game... MX VS. ATV not this crappy mud game.
7617	Ew, awful game. Dumb silly things like boosts and only being able to 'scrub' on certain jumps. Overall, if you want an excellent motocross game, ANY MX vs ATV game will suffice. Literally any of them. To drive the point home, REFLEX : 10/10, Supercross : 9/10. Unleashed : 10/10, MXGP : 7.5 / 10, MUD : 3/10. I'm so happy i was able to get a refund.
7618	buggy and clumsy
7619	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game was awful, I regret my 2 minutes playing this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ already.
7620	this game isnt great reaction response is really bad and im not going to talk about the grafics or i will become angry. don't buy this guys
7621	This game is mud or dog poo.
7622	MUD spelled backwards is DUM. MX vs ATV is way better.
7623	Might be ok if you only want to use a keyboard, but with a joystick it is not enjoyable.
7624	felt and looked like it was made by a 12year old using 'coding for dummies' abosulute â¥â¥â¥â¥, do not reccomend
7625	its allright but i dont like it that much
7626	Terrible...... Worst Physics possible.. absolute trash
7627	WORST MX GAME EVER! IT'S SOOO BAD, CAN'T BELIEVE!
7628	The game crashes immediately on start up.
7629	horrible if its under the 2 hour mark refund it. if you like horrible arcade moto games and free aids the go ahead and get it anyways
7630	Game does not work. It crashes on the race load screen. .......................................................................................................................................................Ok going back and reading some stuff online for some reason this game is crashing on the race load screen for alot of people and the only way to fix it is to turn the audio off in the initial load screen. I guess this game would be alright if it actually functioned and had some kind of support. the graphics are ok and it supports controller play.

8902	The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?  Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.  If you reference  SteamCharts  [steamcharts.com]  for Stadium, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 90 and 190. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.  It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.  Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.
8903	Trackmania Sunrise came out in 2005. Ten years later, this game is pretty much the same - not any better.  There's a reason it's cheap.  I wish I'd spent a little more for Canyon or Valley.
8904	Beware: Nobody plays this game online. Only abt 100 people. If you're looking for the old fun times, they're not here. Actually claiming this still being an online multiplayer is bending the truth.
8905	 '5 reasons why 'Celebrat10n TrackMania2 Pack' is a disappointment!'
8906	The price you're going to pay will be for the service of Maniaplanet that offers you editor plugins, import of custom blocks, creation of title packs, monthly updates etc. that weren't available in the free version.  So if you're going to use any of those services, the price will be worth, otherwise you will waste money to be in a version less crowded than the free version.  Note that TMN ESWC servers are still open and that if you want to play TMN Forever without FreeZone you need to buy TMU Forever for 30 â¬. As some reviews, this is for the fans of the serie, if you only enjoy driving on your own maps, keep playing on the free version.
8907	It's literally the same thing as Trackmania Nations Forever, which is still available on Steam and completely free.  I guess if you really want to play a free game but in HD, go for it.  Oh wait, no. Don't actually. Install the demo, it allows you to play on official servers and compete in official maps. You'll pretty much get the full experience that way. If you really want to buy a Trackmania title, try one of the other Trackmania2 games. Canyon in particular has a neat drifting gimmick and looks a lot more visually interesting.
8908	It is just TrackMania Nations Forever with 'improved' graphics.  I hardly call it 'improved' because it is released in 2013 but there is no major graphics upgrade, only more sparkles, better sunlight, shadow effects. Other than that, there is nothing special.  But the bad thing is the textures. The textures look extremely pixelated on 1080p, HORRIBLE. And this is why this game disappointed me so much.
8909	I brought this game years ago and now i can't play the game after it was brought out by ubisoft they reckon i dont own or have a key then how was i able to write a review i have tryed trackmanias suport they sent me to ubisoft then i tryed steam i get sent to ubisoft all that ubisoft does is send me my account info that then states i don't own the game or have a key key
8910	I love Trackmania in all its forms but this particular version is a huge disappointment. Put simply, it doesn't offer anything new over its free-to-play predecessor Trackmania Nations.   There's also the issue that because Nadeo has split the game into three separate versions; Stadium, Canyon and Valley, it has managed to separate the community of players. This has left the multi-player servers somewhat sparsely populated.  In short, if you you're a Trackmania veteran, you donât need this. If you're new to Trackmania you can play essentially the same game for free, so go and play Nations and see what all the fuss is about.
8911	Trackmania's uniquely in-depth track creator and rule-of-cool physics could have added up to a great game, but the community has utterly killed it.  I was sold by the demo servers. The tracks were interesting and varied, the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time. So you buy the game, open the server list and pick the first one that isn't plain black text.  And then it all comes tumbling down.  Half the screen is filled with needless leaderboards, ugly buttons that don't do anything and other pointless bells and whistles. The other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you'll be lucky to beat even once. Most of the time they're so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path, and that still won't help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it.  If this were the game the demo claimed it would be, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you're a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version, just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that's been mutated in a demonic, unforgiving shell of its former self.
8912	If only it didn't crash every 10 minutes it might be a good game.
8913	I found this terrible because i bought Trackmania Canyon, Valley and Stadium, all of which i downloaded but once trying to play the game, it claims i have to repurchase them since i didn't buy them in the first place according to ManiaPlanet, Which means i wasted money on games that won't work, if someone knows how to fix this, i will much appretiate it.. but for now, i am quite irritated
8914	  Why should you care about my review?    I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the 'dream' of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.  edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)    Pros    -- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.  -- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a 'playlist' for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.  -- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.  -- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.    Cons    -- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on 'Stadium' from Steam, then decide to play 'Canyon' in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.  -- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the 'Start Game' button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.  -- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit 'more blue' or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42' screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)  -- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use 'multiple profiles' but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say 'You must connect online to launch the game.' I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.  -- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.  -- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).  -- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)  -- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to 'take' as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.  -- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.    Conclusion    There is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.  If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.  Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.
8915	I expected an actual racing game. You know several laps of competition with other cars, maybe pushing them out of the track.  Instead this game is about repeatedly racing very short segments until you get them perfect (or just manage to get to the end for the more challenging tracks). As soon as you make a mistake you can reset and restart instantly by just pressing a button. You can do that alone (against your ghost) or on a multiplayer server where you can see the others but there is no interaction with their cars.  If you're the type of obsessive gamer that loves retrying something hundreds and hundreds of times, then you may enjoy this. I wanted to do some fun races, that's not it. 
8916	You want technicall driving? Get a race sim.  You want crazy stunts and awesome tracks out of the workshop? Get Distance!  This game is just not worth your money when there are much better racing games out there.   Overall, I would say this game is actually pretty solid. Good physics, decent controlls, nice track editor. But it's multiplayer is quirky and the sheer focus on perfect technical driving is tedious and requires more effort than its worth. It's fun, yes, but it could be  more  fun.   Which is why I recommend you look elsewhere for fun racing games. Trackmania was cool when it was one of a kind. Now, it's been made obsolete by newer and better racing games.
8917	I played the first TMNations Forever Stadium and I suppose this is kind of better with graphics and so on, but honestly I enjoyed the first one more considering the community was a whole then. Now the community is just split and no one's playing TM2... Also they didn't need a second game for these small updates. I am not very pleased with this game especially not considering it actually costs money now. You HAVE TO buy it. Nadeo did fine on their own makin the first one. I stopped playing because of this game.   I recommended the first game because the community was awesome, but gotta put 'No' now in the recommend-box.
8918	Opponents are WAY too hard for their level and the track editor is brokem. Me coming from the old trackmania games, they were easier and the editor works! Avoid this and other trackmania2 games. Save up to get Trackmania United Forever and save money not buying seprate game. If you want stadium, then get Trackmania United Nations, witch is free.
8919	This game WAS good. I did used to enjoy it. Now because i have a new computer but same account it doesn't let me even make a new account because the product key is already used. Even playing off line it says 'Not Playable'. I think a refund is required. Absolutely annoyed.
8920	Easy track challenges are mild fun, while harder ones have artificial difficulty relying on good short term memory for blind corners, and requiring perfection from blunt inputs. My game stutters, making things more frustrating when going for gold medals, and multiplayer is outright confusing. You might enjoy it, but I didn't.
8921	HTTP ERROR 500.......... Servers are dead. Can't play.
8922	If only it didn't crash every 10 minutes it might be a good game.
8923	DO NOT BUY: Requires an access to internet in order to play whereas it's not written on the store page. In addition,  the game fails to start if it cannot access Google (and it  does NOT check for ANY other servers ) , stating that you are not connected to the Internet. DRM SCAMMING INSIDE (Just for your information, I have 0 hours on the game because I cannot play it, for the aformentionned reason).
8924	This game really should be the best racing game in the genre ! The graphics are fantastic extreemly sharp and smooth flowing. The tracks are fun and can be challenging, their is also a track builder if you intrested in that sort of thing. So whats the issue..... If you want to race with other players online completing x amount of laps and see who comes first you cant. No such mode.
8925	Even though the game is fun, Maniaplanet is not very good. Also, asking $10 for a game what is almost the same as a free game (Trackmania Nations Forever)? It's good they don't ask $20, like for Valley. And then people moaning about the price of Valley because 'it is as good as TMÂ² Stadium'? It is because Valley is more original. Stadium is just a consumer rip-off.
8926	Bought for cheap against my better judgement having owned a previous game. There's nothing wrong with the game. the way it plays, the graphics etc are very good.  what kills the fun is the servers filled with awful tracks. quite why so many people build tracks where if you don't judge it just right you fall off the road or don't make a jump you loose and have to go back to the start I don't know. Tracks where its really difficult to even work out where you should be going as the roads cross all over the place.  don't get me wrong i've some some really fun times on this and older versions on good racing tracks. make a mistake, just slows your time down. you don't just fly off into the distance and have to start the damn thing again.  such a shame because when its good its *really* good fun
8927	Opponents are WAY too hard for their level and the track editor is brokem. Me coming from the old trackmania games, they were easier and the editor works! Avoid this and other trackmania2 games. Save up to get Trackmania United Forever and save money not buying seprate game. If you want stadium, then get Trackmania United Nations, witch is free.

8929	Easy track challenges are mild fun, while harder ones have artificial difficulty relying on good short term memory for blind corners, and requiring perfection from blunt inputs.

8930	You want technicall driving? Get a race sim.  You want crazy stunts and awesome tracks out of the workshop? Get Distance!

8931	Never buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, It was a very good line of game under 10 years ago and now then i just have bought this I become very angry. Will be better if you spend this money on yourself.  0,00000001/10
8932	If you happen to choose between this and TMUF, don't buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8933	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
8934	Yet another game you can't play without joining some community you never heard of.  There is an offline mode, but the game just won't start in it.
8935	They're gonna â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over with keys
8936	This game have so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing multiplayer, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing creating multiplayer acount.Spend trackmania point to send private msg to your friends GENIUS !!!!
8937	Easy track challenges are mild fun, while harder ones have artificial difficulty relying on good short term memory for blind corners, and requiring perfection from blunt inputs. My game stutters, making things more frustrating when going for gold medals, and multiplayer is outright confusing. You might enjoy it, but I didn't.
8938	DO NOT BUY: Requires an access to internet in order to play whereas it's not written on the store page. In addition,  the game fails to start if it cannot access Google (and it  does NOT check for ANY other servers ) , stating that you are not connected to the Internet. DRM SCAMMING INSIDE (Just for your information, I have 0 hours on the game because I cannot play it, for the aformentionned reason).
8939	I've got a track mania 2 canyon and the stadium but it does not work because I do not remember and I do not e-mail password word, if I try to teha other users, it says the key to the game is already available. Otherwise, a good game, but can you help Pliis!
8940	An accurate description of my experience with this game so far:  Bought it because i've been looking for a good racing game, and the original was always rather fun to play. upon loading it up, you don't actually load up TrackMania2, You load up one of those absolutely pointless multiverse systems. You are then poked and proded to log 50 times before you can get to anything that even says TM2 Stadium. Being that I don't quite care much for social aspects of racing games (infact, i have no interest in them other than to drone offline usually) I of course told it to go away and said log in offline.   Seems simple enough ok, maybe i can get to play the game; TrackMania2 Stadium -&gt; enter -&gt; 'Title not available' ...iight, cool sounds good. So, went to go for good measure try to make an account; Lol no thanks after about the 4th screen, Especially concidering the networking of the game seems to run on peer to peer which is heavily throttled by my isp. So I gave up, and went to look on the forums (always an exciting experience, as i'm sure many know.) Found nothing regarding offline play for the most part, other than some posts in russian that weren't really relevant.   Are my issues with this game easy to get around? Possibly, Though I don't quite care to jump through hoops for 2 hours though for something supposed to be relaxing. I'll probably end up getting it fixed someday but, For the purpose of relating ease of access to certain things^^^  Is this game a game for people who like an easy offline racing experience? No, wouldn't say so. If you're down with all the multiverse fluff then it could be the game for you but; I'm sure there are plenty out there for who it is not their idea of fun.
8941	After the update says key is wrong try a another one RAGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
8942	My experience of this game is only getting these messages: 'You are not online' + 'This title isn't playable'. More worthless game, than steam cards that I bought this with.
8943	Don't buy this game!!!! It's really fun to play but after a while it says Your Play Time Has Expired, which means you only have the game for a limited amount of time. either way I can't play anymore so it really pisses me off!
8944	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't buy it
8945	good game but why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do i have to sign up to play
8946	I've got a track mania 2 canyon and the stadium but it does not work because I do not remember and I do not e-mail password word, if I try to teha other users, it says the key to the game is already available. Otherwise, a good game, but can you help Pliis!
8947	I cant connect to the master server. From what Ive read, once you connect once, offline modes/single player are availible. I cant connect at all so the only things I can do in this game are change my graphics settings and edit my profile. I'll only recommend when I'm able to try out the game.
8948	Trackmania Nations Forever was fantastic game. TrackManiaÂ² Stadium is not. Why? Multiplayer servers for Laps games, my favorite game mode, are empty almost all the time and in the singleplayer someone with big brain made a change to count your time only once in every five minutes. This resulted in 4 minutes boredom and 1 minute full of stress. When you played Nations Forever you could make mistakes and it was still very fun, because you could try again at once. But now, you'll make one mistake and you must wait 5 minutes to try again. Nations Forever was fun, fun, fun. TM2 Stadium is waiting, waiting, stress, waiting, waiting... Hence I am not recomending this game, because with one simple change they made very fun game to be extremely annoying to play.
8949	Maniaplanet really runied this game, over complecated it and being added onto steam also caused a mix of tracks for download on workshop and tracks on TMX. I have so many problems with Maniaplanet, the layout is horrible, the 'game selection' system on the menu is pointless and the friends system is broken (or just to damn complex and stupid, says people are offline when they're online etc..)   Basically, Maniaplanet (and probably Ubisoft) runied the amazingly simple and great base game.  Remove maniaplanet and 10/10.
8950	Okay, so, I have to warn you before I begin this review. I am biased. Against TM2 (Track Mania 2) and towards TMU (Track Mania United). Let me tell you why.   Review of Track Mania 2 : Stadium
8951	Don't buy this game!!!! It's really fun to play but after a while it says Your Play Time Has Expired, which means you only have the game for a limited amount of time. either way I can't play anymore so it really pisses me off!
8952	I was playing Trackmania United Forever for about 2-3 years. Single player maps there had some sense,you were able to learn to drive from them and were builded from blocks that actually fit.   Those maps in TrackmaniaÂ² which are marked as red and black are NOT more difficult to play. They are NOT designed to make you learn how to drive. They are designed to test you how far you can go till you ragequit. The creator of these maps probably ran out of ideas so he started to build them from some random blocks, adding crappy must-go-slow turns, hell even disabling 1st person camera on wallrides. The only good thing that happened to this game was adding the cyan edge lines on the blocks.
8953	have never played any of the other track mania games so i was not sure what to expect this will mostly be personal prefernce on this on i think seeing as how popular the series is.  start with the good nice graphics, level of detail is good cars get dirty ,rotating axel shafts are visible cool to see fun for a bit .  the bad have to sign up for an on line community to play (i hate signing up for stuff especailly when you just wanna play) game is pretty much an arcade time trial raceing against ghosts, even in online. not what i was expecting there was other modes for online it did appear but i could never find a server for them. says there is a big campaing mode but its not really like a campagin from any thing like i am used to eg, dirt, grid, forza basicily just more time trials and a couple of lap type races throwen in nothing really in the car customizaition. lots of track editing options not really into to that though, some of the custom track on line can be pretty bad. so ya i can't recomend, basicly just a non contact time trial arcade if thats your style get on sale,
8954	my first match was so bad i had to ask for a refund. and the game was only 2.49!!!
8955	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't buy it
8956	Nah the f2p is better..... the menu is bad and not user friendly it took a long time before I knew where to press
8957	Why are you want to play a racing game that is actually a kind of 'I want to be a guy'? Lots of stupid tracks that requires you to try about thousand million times to get to a single checkpoint (sometimes it's only for a half way to the cp), and sometimes if you're respawned in a cp you can't just finish the track because the checkpoint is placed so you never be able to get enough speed to get over a single obstacle. This is that sucks. â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.
8958	Maniaplanet really runied this game, over complecated it and being added onto steam also caused a mix of tracks for download on workshop and tracks on TMX. I have so many problems with Maniaplanet, the layout is horrible, the 'game selection' system on the menu is pointless and the friends system is broken (or just to damn complex and stupid, says people are offline when they're online etc..)   Basically, Maniaplanet (and probably Ubisoft) runied the amazingly simple and great base game.  Remove maniaplanet and 10/10.
8959	Game loads but whenever I click on the stadium it states it cant download content. I cant even play the game :(
8960	good game but why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do i have to sign up to play
8961	Disappointed. The game isn't exactly the best, but it would still be positive. However, the DRM and UI is horrid.
8962	TrackMania SHOOTER games has hi-jacked this game. I cant play this game anymore.  Fix it Nadeo.
8963	Extremely boring. Trackmania sunrise was awesome, but this game only have a similar name. If u want fun arcade racing better buy burnout.
8964	this game barely makes sense and you have to sign up with a seperate account to play. if you like flaying yourself because you're sorry for leading a hedonistic life, then this is the game for you.
8965	This has got the be the third re-release of the 'Stadium' type racing. The first one was free then they force close the official server and force you to buy again. You know usual UbiSoft behaviour.  Will the next installment have UPlay packed together or cost 60$, Maybe both it's UbiSoft we are talking about after all.
8966	Okay, so, I have to warn you before I begin this review. I am biased. Against TM2 (Track Mania 2) and towards TMU (Track Mania United). Let me tell you why.   Review of Track Mania 2 : Stadium
8967	Because I don't want another second wasted on this game, I copy pasted my friend his review, and totally agree with it;  I spent half an hour just trying to figure out the horrendous user interface of this game. I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (â¥â¥â¥â¥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)  Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations.
8968	If you've never played a Trackmania game before, this is a great game, and the other reviews will tell you why.  If you've played Trackmania United or Trackmania Nations, do NOT get this game. It's precisely the same as Trackmania United's stadium component with slightly better graphics and a smattering of new blocks. Trackmania 2 my â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8969	After 2nd install game says that key which I linked to my old ManiaPlanet acc don't work. What a s*it of game.
8970	Crashes on startup
8971	not a particully interesting game unless your interested in those annoying custom races from GTA online. The game runs fine but still is very uninteresting.
8972	What was a free game has become a game rife with microtransactions. Can't recommend.
8973	this game has poor gamepad support and the controls are just toooooooooo complex.
8974	DON'T BUY  This is the worst game I have ever played and I've played citizen burger disorder and that was honestly way more fun then this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
8975	what an absolute waste of money :/  Trailer made it look good, but its NOT!  Crap graphics, crap physics I am glad the Track Stadium had a demo as I nearly bought that but thankfully didnt waste too much money.  AVOID this crap at all costs, so many much better racing games out there!
8976	This is a decent racing game, but the interface and game design just make it so frustrating to play.  Pros:  - Fun physics  - Racing against ghosts is a great way to learn the maps  Cons:  - UI barely works with a controller  - Unable to map all buttons on an Xbox controller  - Only get once chance to set best time for a map  - Requires secondary login to 'planetmania', if you forget this your game is gone. No way to recover account with just email address.  I bought this game for $2.50 and I feel like I paid too much. I would advise you stay away from this one.  Jager
8977	One of the worst 'racing' games I have ever played. People will tell you it's about going fast and doing stunts but it's not. Most of your time will be spent trying to figure out just what the level designer was thinking if you play online. Most of the tracks are cobbled together messes that have no real flow to them, meaning you'll be doing fine one second then flinging over a guardrail because you didn't turn at juuuust the right fraction of an inch to make the next turn causing you to start over. After a few hours of spamming the delete(reset) key, it became evident that racing new tracks was more of a chore than fun. Stick to the free to play version, this is not worth money.
8978	Game is good but most online tracks appear to be made by gibbons and are so poorly made you can end up flipping your car on a badly laid straight road. Im sure their are some good tracks but hey, im not eating my way through a tonne of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to find maybe 1 twinkie. Maybe
8979	Crashes on startup
8980	Because of the fact that this game is so much alike Trackmania Nations Forever I am going to compare them. This game, just like Nations, has only one envirement stadium. Game types are almost the same, there are alot less players in this game than in Nations. This game has better graphics and social side (friends and private messaging) of this game (as one of ManiaPlanet games) is alot easier to use. You can be on server and just decide to join your friend or just see how many players are on server where he/she is without leaving server and returning to main (home) page of the game.  Well, I guess you wonder why I spend all this time to write this little and negative about game. Its kinda addictive and right now I have more friends playing this game than Trackmania Nations (or United) Forever.  Its up to you to decide is it worth money or are you just gonna play demo.
8981	Official servers = good tracks except there is desync issue with cars.  Community servers are filled with garbage tracks (90% easily). There is no difference betweeen easy and hard, all have garbage design because you always have to drive perfect. One mistake and you are stuck because you don't have enough track to accelerate so you can't do anything. And how to learn track when mistakes are not allowed?  Proof - go on custom servers and see how many drivers can't even cross finish line and many of those who finish have way of times of several top drivers.  Play demo as it allows you to play on official servers.  It's pathetic that simulations like RACE series are easier to drive than this pure arcade.  And, there is Ubisoft which split community into 3 different titles.  DON'T BUY.
8982	I cannot recommend getting this at full price if you already have the original Trackmania, even if you only have the free version. There is little new content to be found - all assets seem to be re-used from the original game, except a few extra shaders have been slapped on.  Controller support is as half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as ever. Navigating menus is a pain on a controller - at some points it will favour whatever your cursor is hovering over even if you're only using a controller to play, and at times it's hard to determine what is actually selected once you navigate to a new menu. Which brings me to another point: the game's UX/UI does not have a single bit of improvement over the original game.  And to top it all off, the alternative environments (Canyon, Valley) are separate titles which need to be paid for and launched individually. Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together, guys. You're using Steam as a publisher, so why even bother making an in-game portal for switching between a bunch of games I don't even own?    I only paid Â£2 for this so I'm not too bothered, but since I've seen all it has to offer I have no reason to recommend it to anyone.
8983	Not a very good racing game, gets boring after a while.
8984	-Buys game. -install the game. -launch the game. -the game gives me a black screen. -deleted. -refunded.  If you know how to fix it let me know. i'll give it another chance and write a new review ;)
8985	Awful piece of ..... And wasn't even able to make money back.
8986	If ever I wasted money on a horible racing game this would be the one. I was really hoping for a unique fun racing experience and instead I get a game with no replay value at all. Race a bunch of people to beat a track time. I really wanted something a little more fun. The physics are the biggest joke of all. If you prefer actual race simulator games stay far away from this one. I wish I would have been warned before I bought it.
8987	everything went straight to hell the moment Ubisoft got in. (im talking about the community not the gameplay or content)  
8988	Thats the worst game i have ever played dont buy that â¥â¥â¥â¥ if u are agressive u will â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur pc....
8989	Yeah... I thought this game would be a good Game to get... But you just spend you're time Restarting the Race because you fall 1 second behind.... This is not a Game I would recommend playing unless you are ok with a Crappy Physics Engine and Pin Point Acurate Racing to the point where if you just hit the wall once... You have to restart. Which leads me to another Problem... There is no proper restart button... So you have to waste more time restarting the Damn Race then you spend in the race itself... All and all I'd give this game a 2/10 Rating
8990	An update. That's what you paid $10 for. That's not a bad thing - the sence of speed got taken to 11, and the visuals look amazing, but there are a couple nit-pickey things that make the older Nations Forever the better choice.  For some reason, it never remebers what skin I choose for my car. Every time I start up the game again, it swaps back to the unasigned gray car if I forget to change it. Another thing that suffers is that offline mode does not seem to work, which sucks, because I really like playing 8-player hotseat games against myself as another means to get good at a track.  I don't know. I'm going to have to thumbs down and reccomend the older Nations Forever unless you want the slick-neon sheen that 2 brings to the table.
8991	Complete and utter garbage. There is no other way to describe this game. First of all, you have to sign up for a 'Mania' account before you can play. Nowhere in the description or once you launch the game itself is that ever clearly explained. Then, once I finally created the freaking account and started up (and navigated around a menu system out of UX designer's nightmare) I found out that for some reason the game does not work with an XBox 360 controller. Digging around online I found that the makers of the game have been aware of the controller mapping problem for FIVE YEARS and have never bothered to fit it. I was really looking forward to building my own tracks and racing around, but in the end TrackMania was a massive, colossal dissapointment and frankly I will never, ever give any Mania Planet games even a second's consideration.
8992	*They removed everything that was great with the UI from the previous game *They changed sounds to ??? FUBAR ugly ones that sound out of place and flat *Forced blur with no option or config file to disable it *No podium at the end, just a splashscreen with results meaning there is no point with custom models. *Extreme shine on things to make it seem like actual new graphics.  In other words, they completely and utterly Ruined this game, added some new tools and functionalities to make map-making easier and more diverse. And the result is a stinking turd any trackmania or racing lover should stay away from. Trackmania United is much better than this 'new' game.
8993	Top Gear Magazine's #1 Greatest Game of the Motorsports Generation? I disagree. This game forgets a lot about what makes racing great, and that's turning hard left for several hours and having all of your blood pool to the left side of your body. Pure ecstasy. MAYBE, it really is the greatest game of the motorsports generation, but you know what? That's just because we unfortunately no longer live in the Nascar generation. The young European crowd has flooded the scene with their dopey F1 cars(adult sized go-karts) and their Tokyo Drifters...  Any serious fan of cars should boycot games like this, it makes a mockery of true 'motorsports' like Nascar, circular rally racing and slot car racing by focusing on stupid stuff like formula racing. Uh, hello? Formula is for babies!  Because I'm a generous Nascar fan(seriously we Nascar enthusiasts are the friendliest bunch on earth) I will give this game 4 screaming V8 engines out of 9. Do not test me again Nadeo, your next game better be an all American classic.
8994	The servers for this game are terrible and always fail to load. Do not buy
8995	No shooting.
8996	Game was boring
8997	sucked - don't buy   30 second races, kiddie controls (stop,go, left right)  get sonic transformed - way better
8998	This game is not fun
8999	I planned to buy the game and share with my brother to play. Unfortunately it cannot fully access to another online account(my brother's) when I opened family sharing, went into demo mode. Only my own account is fully accessed.
9000	This is a fantastic game that also happens to be fantastically optimised. However, I bought it god knows how long ago and hadn't played it since then. While loading it up today, it says my code for the game is already in use and as such my copy is invalid. â¥â¥â¥â¥ DRM and â¥â¥â¥â¥ any company that still uses proprietary launchers for games (Looking at you, Ubisoft and EA)
9001	I Would have loved this game if i could play with friend but always says could not contact server...

9003	check points are bull .... if you fail and restart you might as well close the game down and re open it up seaming you are never going to make it and they should bring in a reset where it takes you back to the beging off the track not the last check point so you can play the game
9004	its just a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to get going and the track editor is a pain to use i do not recomend this game iunless you have A) constant(good)internet connection. B)patience and C) a decent pc to play it on. just dont get it i herd tmTURBO came out and i definetly wanna try that but i do not recomend stadium if you meet the cryteria i explained above.

9110	Since playfire rewards made me play this piece of... worthless software again, it reminded me just how terrible this game is, so I thought why not review this and help potential victims avoid it.  If I had to describe this game in one sentence, it would be - demands perfection, doesn't offer precision.  The game tries to be an electro version of super meat boy, and while the music is fine and likable, the controls are just awful, everything feels very stiff, and unresponsive. The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all, in fact I think they created a set of levels that were perfect for a game of this type, and then they just inverted them totally to make them this bad, they are just atrocious. Also levels sort of 'react' to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing... trust me it makes things even worse when you are achievement hunting as the ingame playlist is randomised and you can't lock it to a certain track that would actually allow a human being to beat a level in time for an achievement. Another HUGE minus would be that every time you restart a track, there is a stupid unnecessary 3 second long countdown till you get to play.  If you want an x/10, i'd give it a 4, only because of the decent music, but seriously, if you are looking for games like super meat boy, avoid this.
9111	Rush Brosâ¦ Oh my, where to begin.  Itâs incredibly rare that I come across a game so absolutely, irredeemably awful Iâm forced to leave it after a mere twenty minutes. Thatâs a shockingly short amount of time to spend on a video game, free or not. And yet, Rush Bros manages to be that rare kind of awful. I honestly think that the developer was actively trying to scare people away from their game. The menu alone is enough indication of that.  Let me break down the basics of just what exactly Rush Bros is for you. You are one of two âRush Brosâ, your goal being to get from one end of a 2D level to the other. So, yes, itâs a platformer. But wait, thereâs more! The gameâs claim to fame (can we even call it that?) is that your music library (or, if youâre too lazy to actually point the game at your music files like me, the set of techno that comes packaged in) determines the way the levels play out and react. Cool, right? Yeah, that sounds great! I get to listen to my music, and it changes how the game works! Wow!  Well, unfortunately, very wrong. This feature is barely used for anything but a spike or two popping up and out of the floor every few beats, or a lever that needs to be pulled on the beat (a mechanic which, by the way, is very poorly explained). Itâs incredibly lame, and it means that Rush Bros is nothing more than a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ platformer with some funky tunes.  Now that weâve established Rush Bros is completely devoid of originality, letâs talk about the graphics. Theyâre bad. And I mean really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad. Once again, it manages to be that one breed of terrible that not only assaults your eyes with character animations which look to have been haphazardly assembled in flash by a sixth-grader who just figured out how key-framing and looping works, but it also has the audacity to apply filters to the entire image which, after only five minutes, will leave you with a piercing headache. Think Max Payne 3âs most egregious examples of cutscene visual tomfoolery, except constant, always there to taunt your eyes with what could have been clarity instead of a bloom-addled, disco-infused fever dream.  Oh, and of course, the controls. Or rather, what controls? This game has controls? Couldâve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldnât move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that youâve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the âplayâ portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete despite the fact it tells you right from the get-go âHey, we made this game for controllers! You should use one!â Well, are you sure you made this game for controllers, XYLA Entertainment? Because from where I stand, that really doesnât seem to be the case.  Once you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty itâs impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if heâs composed of primarily molasses. I cannot tell you how many times in the mere 20 minutes I spent with this steaming turd I died due to the horrific controls.  Oh, and donât even get me started on how hard it is to actually start playing the game in the first place. I still havenât been able to figure out how any of it works, since when trying to select the singleplayer stages, I kept getting requests to join the games of others. And you know what, I donât blame those who spammed me with the intrusive offers, either. Hell, Iâm sure I did the same, because despite the fact that Iâm very obviously trying to play singleplayer through the singleplayer-labelled Arcade menu option, the game seemed to love pairing me up with total randies from the boundless realm of âThe Internetâ. Iâm still not sure if I managed to get into the singleplayer at all, actually, seeing as how every time I finished a stage the game showed me the statistics of an unnamed, invisible second âplayerâ who never seemed able to finish the level before me. Or maybe the game was just unable to identify that I was playing alone, which seems far more plausible.  Credit where creditâs due, the in-game soundtrack (read: not the one you import) is actually pretty good. I enjoyed the techno tunes included, and must admit itâs mostly because of them I even stuck around long enough to get past the first few levels (which are only about 30 seconds each, by the way). However, whatever algorithm the developer is using to apply the âbeatâ to the in-game geometry is flaky at best, since it always seems to speed-up or slow-down completely at random. Hey guys: if the feature youâve touted as revolutionary and unbelievably innovative for the platforming scene doesnât even work with the music you tested and included it with, I think there may be an issue somewhere. But hey, Iâm no programmer, so what do I knowâ¦ right?  To sum things up, this game is awful. Why I even dedicated a whole 1010 words to it is actually beyond even myself. Stay away from it (not that you honestly ever intended to buy it) and spend that cash elsewhere. Iâm just glad I got this smear for free.
9112	Rush Bros attempts to marry the minimalistic, highly difficult platforming of games such as Super Meat Boy and I Want To Be The Guy, with the music generating gameplay of Beat Hazard or Audiosurf while putting a heavy focus on multiplayer. Unfortunately it fails abysmally at being comparable in even one of these aspects, with almost every feature going against the basic concepts it tries to establish, resulting in a game that I could barely force myself to play.  The problems with the platforming star with the controls. Your character feels as if he's made of putty, plodding along at anything but a rush and sticking to walls like glue. This is a problem firstly because the entire game is based around speedruns which become almost impossible to pull off when movement is akin to running molasses and are you're character is constantly getting stuck on the environment. Secondly, because the level designs haven't been tweaked to compensate for this slowness, with much faster hazards and gaps that are virtually impossible should you miss a speed or double jump powerup.  On top of being frustrating to navigate, the levels or to be more accurate, tracks are chock full of tedious backtracking which often sends you all the way to the start of the level after you grab a key or open a door. Checkpoints are also a point of contention as there is no rhyme or reason as to their placement or even inclusion. Some tracks feature nearly endless checkpoints before every obstacle, others without a single one to speak of which needless to say vastly changes the difficulty level.  Although it's clearly the main focus, Rush Bros manages to somehow be even worse in multiplayer games do to the completely unbalanced powerups that randomly pop up during play. Once again it goes against the core speedrunner mentality, instead resorting to unnecessary gimmicks that cheapen the thrill of winning a match.   The final aspect is the use of custom soundtracks to change and augment tracks, but it is so inconsequential and often unnoticable that it's hardly worth mentioning. The actual music that is included is of a suitably low quality, and the graphics are incohesive with each background seemingly plucked at random from the user generated reject of other games.  I had high hopes for Rush Bros, and even after playing it feel the concept of a music generated platformer has a lot of potential, but the execution here falls apart with every lazy step it takes. Though it's becoming exceedingly rare for me to play a game where I cannot find even a single redeeming quality to latch onto, but Rush Bros truly does nothing of note and there is no reason I would advise anyone to play it, not even for novelty's sake.
9113	Upon starting the full retail version of the game you are greeted with a EULA for what is stated to be the DEMO VERSION of the game that includes some truly pernicious terms of service and also some plainly rude language telling the customer that if you try any funny business you will incur a bunch of legal costs through arbitration, also it is unclear about the scope and nature of the data collection the game will be doing or why a simple platformer needs to store any personal information about me on an out of country server in the first place.   I don't think I have ever seen a EULA that looks quite this bad before. So I was like 'is it just me, or is this â¥â¥â¥â¥ unusually oppressive?' and I did some googling and the thing shows up on game review sites. Apparently I am not the only person who thought it was kind of weird.   http://www.game-debate.com/articles/index.php?a_id=2096&amp;game=Rush%20Bros   If the product can't even clarify whether I am agreeing to one for the full version of the game I just purchased or if instead I have just installed some sort of demo version, I am certainly not going to accept any agreement that looks like this.
9114	The concept intrigued me, but the execution fails like mad in this game, where the order of the day is less on platformer skill and more on memorization - if you do not a) locate and b) precisely follow the 'correct' route every stage, you are not hitting the time trial goals, and if you're not playing to hit the time trial goals, there is, as far as I can tell, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to this game. Aside from playing against a friend (or random people who can drop-in from Steam, which is a decent enough feature), there's really no reward or drive to keep playing that I can tell. All(? there are 47 I want to say) stages are unlocked from the beginning and... I dunno. I wanted this to be good and it let me down.
9115	who really thought of buying this  no seriously
9116	thank god it was free.
9117	Avoid this game. Laggy controls and repetitive levels. Do yourself a favour and get a Bit Trip Runner game instead.
9118	Rush Brothers is a side scroller Ã  la Knytt series with a knack for speed and precise platforming, a mix that sometimes performs well, other times lets you wanna throw your controller/keyboard off your room with the whole console or computer.   The game has been marketed as a competitive 'musically-driven' platformer and I could agree with the former adjective since the Steam multiplayer allows 'challengers' to hop in your game and play, and frankly, it's mainly not a single player experience the one granted by Rush Bros. However, aside some neat dance beats and speaker-like pulsating backgrounds it doesn't seem to me like music has ANY influence in the gameplay, whatsoever, as I was expecting something along the lines of Amplitude or Rez (the dawn of the PlayStation 2) -- at least THAT level of interaction.  But nope. We're stuck with a platformer where you can't trust springs or else you'll likely land on some sharp spikes and I'm sure that if Sonic the Hedgehog were in this game he would sue Xyla Entertainment for character abuse, and most puzzle sections throughout the levels can be pretty long and frustrating -- something that doesn't sound so 'fast-paced' after all, let alone played with other people on the interwebs.  Other than the blatant lies we were gently offered by marketing, however, this isn't a game I would consider abysmal after all. In fact, I liked the art style and I think it's pretty neat, something I haven't quite seen in other indie titles (Knytt Underground comes close but it was released AFTER Rush Bros). Not terribly original, but it's surely an upside. ...and that's it, really. I contributed to the game soundtrack as Forgotten Dawn back in the days, it was a good experience, but honestly, I always muted the in-game music. I preferred silence and the lonely game sound effects over the generally ear-shattering OST.  So overall, this game is pretty subpar compared to other platformers around and it had plenty of potential at hand for becoming a truly engaging musically-driven experience, with or without friends in your lobby.
9119	Pure frustration,good concept but not good enough execution,randomized traps that depends on music without any discernable pattern.  some levels demand perfect execution of moves,irrelevant of traps/music,too bad the controls are not provided for it since it does at best 90% of the commands issued,and that 10 really does matter.  In the end,if it wasn't for playfire I wouldn't even play it again.
9120	Not a bad game per se, but nothing particularly good about it, either. Platforming is pretty basic, controls seem a bit off, visuals are nice but not really outstanding, being able to use custom music is nice but the stage elements that depend on the music don't always work well with that. This game is bundled often and I'd say go for it in a cheap bundle, but I wouldn't buy it on its own.
9121	Music game that has nothing to do with music... Without power-ups it's unplayable.
9122	Not worth $9.99. Anyone interested in this 45-stage obstacle race course game should buy it in the Indie Gala Intersteller bundle for $1 like I did. Not worth a cent more.
9123	Awhile back I wrote a review for this game. I thought about it and then I thought, 'Wow, this is bad.' After thinking about it some more, I cannot reccomend Rush Bros. Why? First off, the controls are pretty laughable. Standard fare of jump, action. But one thing that I didn't expect was the slide button. Basically, you press it and you get a speed boost while sliding. You know what that means! SPAMMING TIME. Falling off of edges isn't uncommon. I bought a two pack to play with a friend, multiplayer is fun for 5 matches, then it gets boring and repetitive. You can also put your pirated mp3's into the soundtrack. The only thing it changes is how fast the map can do things like, throw obstacless at you, make conveyor belts more annoying, etc. I will admit that the original soundtrack is good. But, if you need a rhythm game to play, just get BIT.TRIP Runner or Osu!
9124	Save your money. Controls are terrible and the gameplay is boring. If I got this for free, I'd feel overcharged.
9125	Rush Bros is a interesting platformer with a couple of cool concepts. But tries too much by using conflicting concepts. The game would be better as two separate games that only use the concepts that support each other together. Because it tries to be a speedrunner where you can run against each other or alone against time. But also have different styles of level designs almost each level. Most levels you need to backtrack for keys. That's fine but not when you're speed running. The randomness of the level reacting on the music is also goes against the speedrunning. And you have some trail and error dead traps in the level design.  The controls feel a bit off in the beginning and I think it's because of the stickiness when you wallslide. In most games where you can walljump the wallslide is fast but here it's really slow. And it's counter intuitive to the speed running. It's really annoying and I don't get why they made it like this.  I really want this game to live up to it's potential. The music is great and the art style is pretty cool. It just isn't working as a speed running game. If you just play too casually complete the levels it's fine. But the whole racing against each other and time just doesn't work for this game because the developers wanted too much. It could have been an amazing platformer like Super Meat Boy or Electric Super Joy.
9126	Godawful piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. It's super boring. The music feature makes no sense at all. There is no purpose. It's buggy as hell, keep getting stuck. Lags when loading songs 25%-30% of the time.  Just stay away from this garbage.  You are warned.
9127	This game seemed like something good on paper, jumping around to music and competing with other players, however about 5 minutes after purchase I realised this game is a bug infested waste of time. It tries to mimic other great platformers however it horribly fails to do so by giving you and un-fun and minimalistic challenge of running across an empty space without power ups only to get a better score than another player. On top of that the game is filled with bugs, I often found myself challenging other players to a race when I clearly selected that I wanted to race alone. This game in a short summary is a waste of money and a big disappointment.
9128	This game would be awesome . . . if the gameplay follow. When you see graphics, musics, you think of a Meat Boy like game, very fast, you never stop. Here you never stop, but because you feel so slow ! Jump even has a little second before actually seeing the character jumping ! In a game like that, you cannot mess whit the gameplay at this point =/
9129	After playing the game more to give it further analysis here are my thoughts.  The game is 'okay' but not worth anything more than $2 because of how boring and stale it feels. It often tries to tote itself as a precision platformer but fails to deliver on adequate platforming. The jumping feels awkwardly clunky and more often than not you will end up falling because it doesn't recognise input for more than 100ms which is unacceptable. The game falls off and the level design is interesting but the platforming mechanics feel weighted and not precise at all. My biggest gripe with the game is that it often tried to get me to play against other players in a race before I have even played a level, I would toggle off this option and immediately after a race it would re-enable it; If I wanted to play multiplayer I would have chosen that option from the main menu.   Pros Interesting level design Beautiful backdrops  Cons Music is annoyingly intrusive  Clunky platforming Annoyingly integrated versus Art that resonates with music felt off beat and distracting   The game has interesting ideas but fails to execute effectively and in a way that isn't frustrating for the player. The seamless multiplayer is nice but its lack of remembering when I had toggled it off quickly became annoying. I found myself muting the game to not have to listen to the music. The game was interesting but there have been plenty of game available for cheaper (even free) that I would avoid this and look for something else.  I would have to rate the game a 3/10
9130	I like the idea of the game, and there isn't really much else out there specifically designed for head-to-head racing like it is, but I super cannot get into how movement in it feels. The controls are at least consistent, but everything feels weighted and timed wrong to me. I kept going for a while to get used to it, and it did get a little better, but it's more like less wrong at this point, not actually right. The levels I played did seem reasonably well designed for running through them once you get to know them though, and the soundtrack is great, so there's that.
9131	Absolute crap platformer masquerading around as a time-attack super meat boy clone. Moving obstacles change speed depending on whether you're moving or not, and controls are unresponsive, making your character seem sluggish and unpolished. Rush Bros. feels more like a beta release than a full game.  Oh, and who sets online versus mode as the default on first install? (turn 'Accept Challengers' off to play single-player mode)
9132	Honestly Rush Bros. looked really promissing when I saw the trailer and I was really excited to play it but after getting my hands on it I can safely say that pretty much the only thing the game has going for it is the soundtrack and even that may not appeal to some people. Visuals, level design and animation quality is something to be desirable on Rush Bros and story is pretty much non existent. The game might be fun if you play with someone else but playing it alone, as I did, will probably be a waste of your time. Even if you're a fan of platformers I doubt that you'll have fun with this one on yourself, playing with a friend might give you somewhat a good time and probably some giggling when someone dies but I honestly don't recommend Rush Bros. in any circunstances.
9133	The only reason I bother to download and play Rush Bros was to get the achievements. A lot of them seemed simple enough. Finish this level in under a certain amount of time to unlock the achievement and what not. What I didn't realize is that in order to get the achievement, a person would have to be nearly perfect to obtain it which was made difficult by the fact that the obstacles were set to the rhythm of the music in the game making it extremely inconsistent. This made achievement hunting more unbearable and annoyed me to no end when the controls in game were unresponsive at times. If anything, Rush Bros tries to copy Super Meat Boy and the like with a musical element added which ruins the overall gameplay. I'd avoid this title unless you like dubstep or want to give this to someone you want to really annoy.   Overall Score: 3/10
9134	I got this in a bundle somewhere. It turned out to be excruciatingly boring and frustrating, and with a terrible soundtrack.  There seems to be some kind of story just based on watching the intro, but when you start the game - surprise, there is no story to be had.  Controls seemed tight and good, but the game play was tedious; you're just bouncing back and forth, falling down long tubes sometimes and then having to jump back up again, fetching something like 'keys' to advance in the level you're currently in. Repetitive and bland, I caught myself yawning after a few minutes. I am the one person who hasn't tried Super Meat Boy yet and having seen some videos and screenshots from SMB, I fear this game has drawn inspiration from it, decreasing my lust for ever trying it.  The music transported me back to the late 90's, at a semi-bad rave party somewhere in Holland, complete with teenage â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ glow sticks-in-hand, with a hyped-up-washed-out DJ present, and other peoples puke on my shoes, trying to play some bad game on my cell phone while waiting for some high-on-E someone to find some drunk other someone, and looking forward to throwing them both into a cab before going to a great dive bar or private party instead. I actually felt so embarrassed by the music present in the game, I had to turn it off completely while playing, in fear of my neighbors believing I am capable of enjoying listening to such crap. There is no car spoiler or Blaupunkt speaker big and bad enough to warrant anyone playing this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sadly, removing the hideous rave/techno music didn't make the game any better.  Definitely not my cup of rave bottle water.
9135	The idea behind Rush Bros. is that the platforming you do is affected by your music. And that very well may be the case if they fix a few key issues. Having played only a short amount of this game, I have some first impressions;  - Menus are cluttered and messy. I found myself accidentally restarting levels instead of moving on to the next one because I couldn't easily see what was going on in the menus. When you pause a level, it auto selects 'return to main menu' and makes you scroll down to 'back to game' (doesn't sound like a huge issue, but it's a pointless problem). What's most infuriating is that the options are unavailable within a game. I repeat; in a MUSIC BASED GAME, you have to return to the main menu to CHANGE THE MUSIC VOLUME. I cannot stress how backwards that is.  - Animations are... off. I can't really describe it. From the screenshots, you would imagine that the game plays and looks a certain way. But the animations are... jarring. The graphics are also somewhat confusing, with some obstacles killing you despite looking exactly the same as some that don't.  - No sense of speed. You move quite slow. I imagine speeding up the character would help the game.  - Music should impact more. All it does is change the speed of the character's headbob and some of the background.  All in all, the game doesn't really live up to what it wants to be. And that's a shame.  
9136	Edit from the future: A patch came out that said they've fixed the achievement bugs. I don't want to play this game anymore, but at least they fixed the stability issues that I've complained about in this review.  Original review:  ===  First the good stuff: amazing music. I would recommend paying for the OST.  Now for the bad: Its buggy. I have been trying to get the 'No death' achievement on the 'Spikes Everywhere' level. It is hard enough, but when I was able to complete the run, I did not get the achievement.  Tried it again (wasn't easy and took many tries) and I still didn't get it. Found a solution online that said to restart steam. I did and I tried again. I got the speedrun achievement (I've gotten very good at this level).   I was able to get a no death run a little while later and guess what, it did not register. After ~2 hours of playing, I gave up. I know that I got the achievement, I don't need steam to tell me I got it.  Tl;dr: Get it for the OST, not recommended for doing record runs.
9137	This game is nifty, and can be fun in short bursts, though I can't stand to play it for more than 10 minutes at a time. Might be worth getting while on sale or as a freebie, but I wouldn't bother with full price. It claims to use your own music for gameplay, and in a sense it does, but it only uses it very minimally. I give it a resounding 'Meh.'
9138	Boing Boing zombie, restart. Boing boing boing, zombie, restart. Boing, spikes, restart. Fun music though.
9139	Control of the character is awkward, pace feels slow (in a racing game). Unlink most other custom music rythm hybrids (Audiosurf, Beat Hazard) it doesn't seem to change anything gameplay wise. What you end up with is a mediocre stylized platformer, of which the indie game scene has a nearly infinite supply of.
9140	Boing Boing zombie, restart. Boing boing boing, zombie, restart. Boing, spikes, restart. Fun music though.
9141	The music changes beat too quickly and rapidly, making for good techno music but terrible platforming.
9142	The creators of Rush Bros manage to completely miss the basic concepts of their own game, while managing to make it look somewhat pretty and have a good soundtrack. They fail to make the platforming fun or even feel right. It seems like they spent very little time getting the feel for the game correct. The animations are also fairly poor. Even the colorful visuals and music can't make up for it what is really just not a fun game to play. If I paid $10 for this game I would be pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. In fact, I got this game for free as part of a Play Fire Rewards promotion and technically got paid for it, but I am still not happy with my decision to play this game.  If you want to play a game that does the Racing-Platformer concept correctly, I would suggest SpeedRunners.
9143	I would have expected the controls to be better on a game like this.  Pretty good (customizable) music, a good game idea, and a pretty cool art theme unfortunately didn't make up for the controls feeling a little sloppy and haphazard.  Great concept, but the game is pretty unforgiving and frustrating, leaving me unlikely to pick the game up again.
9144	Avoid it! i took it free from GMG and at least got 3 cards, LOL
9145	Horrible game, probably one of the worst platformers I've ever played and that's saying something. even though I got it for free, I feel scammed by the low quality it presents, the controls are quite clumsy as hell and the background music ends up being monotonous and boring incredibly fast. Don't waste your money or your time here, do yourself a favor and get super meat boy instead of this crap. completely unfun.
9146	Not fluid and often shows opportunity for more to experience, but makes it unreachable or intuitive.
9147	Not fluid and often shows opportunity for more to experience, but makes it unreachable or intuitive.
9148	I really, really tried to like this game. The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason. Again, I really wanted to like this game but some of the core parts of this game just don't click with me.
9149	While some decent music, the game doesn't really excel at anything, controls do feel tough and levels can ofter be frustrating.
9150	The MOST IMPORTANT thing in a game like this is how responsive the controls are. The nput lag just kills any chance of this game being fun.
9151	For a game that seems to revolve about the idea of speed and racing, the game does an amazing job at denying you any and all sense of speed. Characters aren't very quick, and lose all speed immediately upon touching any wall surface, as they were made out of glue. The sticky nature of wall interaction probably hinders platforming more than it helps with walljumps. Rush Bros seems confused at what it wants to do, putting walljump training wheels in a title that seems to want people to compete at platforming skills.  The game also is very bad about giving you information. The 'tutorial' level has none of it, leaving me confused and stuck at some point trying to figure out what the game wanted me to do but wasn't going to tell me. I received multiple 'challenge' notifications from random players on the tutorial stage which certainly was adding to the confusion. Levels can be confusing and hard to navigate the first time about, with some having you run deep into death traps before realizing you need a key from some obscure branch in the level, or just letting you figure out that there are no more paths available to progress and the end of the level is actually in the beginning.   The music-driven part is honestly such a non-factor that I almost forgot about it. I suppose it could affect your timing based on track played, but is that really a good thing? I don't think so.  Memorizing levels seems to be more rewarding than competent platforming in Rush Bros, and memorizing levels for the short minute-or-so experience is just never going to be rewarding enough.
9152	Rush Bros is a hardcore platformer taking after the likes of Super Meat Boy, but fails to understand any aspect of why people enjoy these type of games. Precise controls, level consistency, and a feeling of fairness all elude this game and that makes it impossible recommend.  The game's gimmick is that parts of the level move with the beat of the current music track playing. It's an interesting idea but one that shouldn't have gone past the prototyping phrase, where it should have been discovered how badly it works out in practice. This includes traps and not every object responds to every beat, which when mixed together with the sub-par beat detection makes this movement almost impossible to accurately predict. This also causes certain songs to make certain levels ridiculously hard, if not impossible. A few of the later levels take this mechanic to such extremes, I firmly believe that they are some of the worst levels ever included in any game.  The other main issue with the level design is invisible traps. Pretty much every level has spikes, but some of them in some levels will shoot at you when you get close. There's no way to tell which ones will do this. Spikes will even shoot at you from off screen with no warning. What this unfortunately results in is rather than skill-based platforming, you simply have to memorize the levels to do well. That's not real difficulty, it's poor design.  These problems combined with sloppy controls can make this game very frustrating and it's not hard to see why over 90% of the reviews are negative. While I did enjoy the music the game has to offer, it would be better to save your sanity and pass on this one.
9153	I wanted to try this aside from the negative reviews but nobody mentioned how it is quite literally broken the controller doesn't work for â¥â¥â¥â¥ and at some points you can't even progress because you can't even make the jump well I'm not upset because I bought it for 2 dollars BUT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! it's not even fun when it does work 
9154	It becomes extremely clear to you exactly what is wrong with this game in just a few short minutes. It tries to combine platforming, music/rhythm games, and head-to-head racing. Unfortunately the attempts at each of these individual parts are deeply and fundamentally flawed, and are not designed in such a way to meld together properly. Running and jumping does not feel fun (and we could stop there since that is all you do), racing against the clock or a friend are fundamentally the same thing due to extremely poor level design that relies on memorization, and the musical aspects of the game are almost entirely non-existent. Background images and certain obstacles might jive a little bit with the drums and bass of a track, but ultimately the music, whether it's from the included soundtrack or your own library, has no significant effect on gameplay. So if there's no rhythmic response and the racing aspect is not there, what you're really left with is just a very subpar platforming game. This is such an easy impulse buy but it is just terribly unfun and disappointing.
9155	Probably worst game I ever played. And I played many crappy games. That game is just annoying. Not hard, ANNOYING. BIT Trip games may be hard, Isaac may be hard, 'World hardest game' may be hard. That sh*t is just annoying. I don't like controls, I don't like mechanics in this game which by the way are't explained to the player. It looks for me like once it works with music and other time it do not. It can be cause of other issues, some levels with harder tunes are almost unplayable. Level design is, mostly, horrible. graphics at least are consistent but still not too good. Music is OK but nothing better. That's one and only music game I disliked. At least I've got it for free but it's not worth anything more.  Still want to buy it? Go to any website with flash games. Anything there should be better than 'Rush Bros'.
9156	Absolutely bizzare, and not in a good way. The game is very clearly designed around completing levels as fast as possible, yet it controls shocingly stiffly. The game fails at its most fundamentally basic level, and that's before the awful level design and the terrible art. The six or seven levels I played was all I could take. I'd have to get paid to boot this one up again.
9157	This game is.... Eugh.  I saw this game when it was on sale for abou 2.49 on the store and it looked pretty damn cool. The graphics were flashy, the music was authenitc, and if you didnt like it, you could even add your own custom soundtrack! The gameplay looked fast paced, and it looked really fun.  .......Until i played the damn thing.  The gameplay is really slow and and you're not going to get to pick up the pace unless you spam the roll technique. And while that is sometimes expected, it really lowered my expectations for fast-paced and fun gameplay.   And while the graphics ARE flashy, yet a bit easy on the eyes, they're a bit TOO flashy. Its really hard to focus on one thing, then move your eyes to focus on another with all of the detail this game has to offer, and I feel like they tried way too hard and ended up overdoing it. I'm not saying its eyestrain or that it is'nt pretty to look at, but it slows down the gameplay even further when you cant even focus on moving from one place to another.  The only thing I liked about this game is the amount of customization and free-roaming time you have. Like I said, you can make your own soundtrack and even change the color of your character which lowers the amount of bad restriction this game forces you to deal with. And, prove me if i'm wrong, since i uninstalled this game, but i think you can make your own levels. And you can even invite friends and go against eachother for bragging rights, I like that in a game, but not with this kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay.  If you're the slow type who likes flashy-in your face graphics, your opinions on this game just might differ from mine. However, I didnt enjoy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ one bit.
9158	I'm pretty disappointed.  This game looks and feels like a flash game.  Now, I can get along fine with that, but the problem is that as a platformer, the physics feel like a flash game aswell.  The jumps feel linear and unresponsive, just like a flash game (even when playing with a controller).  Which is the biggest sin for a game like this. Jumping doesn't feel like it should in platformers.  On the plus side, it has great music, but thats about it. 
9159	I got it for free from Playfire, so what is wrong with it?  The gameplay is decent and you can add your own music if the default one is too boring. But the achievements are the worst thing about this game!  How can you finish the levels in such low times? For example, on the first level you need 35 seconds. I can barely get under a minute!!! Also obstacles from certain levels react to the music's rythm, so you will most likely die due to dubstep plying while going through that level.  Only to play for fun, not for the achievements.
9160	I can't believe this is sold for real currency. I can't believe someone might of bought this for real currency.
9161	There are much better games in that genre, not worth playing.
9162	stay away. get super meat boy, electronic super joy and bit.trip runner instead. the game is a mixture of the three games mentioned above, but fails in every aspect. the levels are bad designed, the music is a bad techno clichÃ© and the interface makes me want to puke.
9163	Pretty nice, but definetly not worth 10 euro!
9164	Horrid controls, unintuitive game features. I don't like platform games much at the best of times. And Rush Bros is nowhere near the best of times
9165	I don't like this game. I think there are better games than this one.
9166	This 'game' is just awful. When I first saw it, I thought it was gonna be something similar to Electronic Super Joy, so I figured, why not?  Nope, it's   garbage.    The controls and mechanics are bad, it's not challenging at all (though the devs would like to think so) it's just terrible overall. It's got a couple decent songs though, but that's it.  If you want an awesome, electronic music driven platformer, get Electronic Super Joy.
9167	This game expects you to be at the top of your game from the start, while you're still figuring everything out. Confusing mapdesign had me walking around wondering where I had to go. The controls are feeling laggy but if you go just a little bit to far you die and end up respawning again. And again... And again...
9168	I can feel only pity for someone who actually paid for it
9169	Playfire, why would you do this to me? I thought we had something special :( In all seriousness though, this game is awful. Thank god I got this for free. The controls are just so unresponsive, so the game is nearly unplayable.
9170	The game is god damn hard. The death is following me! I play so hard, but I can never ever get any achievement, that I have completed the game more eailer than the achievement description. Check out that the game didn't record my time once......... (I do restart steam client so many times, but it never works.) So luck, it is just a free game from GMG.(But can't get the playfire reward, damn it!)
9171	Got it for free, still not worth the price. Frustrating mess dependant on level memorisation. Music is cool though.
9172	Playing this game is painfull. Bad controlls, boring and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ maps, and actual lack of multiplayer (you can only see how another player playing same map at same time but you can't interact with him) makes this game terrible. I got paid to play it(playfire rewards) but i think 2Â£ was not worth this. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!
9173	Multiplayer broken. Connection is constantly lost. Crap indie game. At least it was free.
9174	Music : Good Game : â¥â¥â¥â¥!
9175	Not recommended, don't waste your time!
9176	It was a terrible design decision to make parts of the level 'move with the beat', while at the same time, having a randomly chosen music track. This ruins the speed and rhythm of the game. If the track deigns to, you'll be stuck behind an obstacle. Most obnoxious are the spike traps that block your path and move up and down, which again, 'move to the beat', so even if you wait for the specific moment it switches between up and down, and try to go under/over it, 'the beat' might still decide to change it again and squash you.  The controller often stops working when you open the start menu, which is annoying, as you'll be restarting levels over and over because the achievements are horribly unforgiving and one or two deaths is too many.  When racing your ghost(not optional) the camera will change focus slightly away from your character so you can watch your ghost. I don't see why you'd ever want to watch your ghost. The music will probably be different, so the level won't be the same, so things your ghost didn't have to deal with will smack you right in the face.
9177	This isn't a very good game at all. It sounded like something that would be good, and, hey, it could very well be, provided the levels were randomly generated, and didn't have any of that backtracking garbage.  I had high hopes, and was wishing this game would be something like Electronic Super Joy, but multiplayer, with randomly generated maps, and custom music. I was mistaken, and given a sloppily excecuted game that doesn't feel rewarding at all, and instead seems like more of a chore.  I'm glad that I didn't pay for this, and won it in a giveaway, because it really isn't worth the money.
9178	Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to be honest.
9179	Awful, broken controls ruin what could have been, at best, an average game. Avoid.
9180	No single player tutorial, no one on multiplayer wants to play the tutorial. I barely even got to see the controls at the start of the game and some guy had finished before i could move.  2/10

9182	i liked the whole idea of it. the execution was terrible. playing multiplayer, your friend could not hear the music you play, they run off of their own music. for a game that has a map that works off of music, you should really work on making everyone hear the same thing.  3/10 - maybe 3/10, on a good day.
9183	It's almost a decent platformer, but the levels never really get that interesting and the controls are just a little too floaty.
9184	It's almost a decent platformer, but the levels never really get that interesting and the controls are just a little too floaty.
9185	Got it from Indie Gala bundle for 1$. Developers thought combining this kind of music with platforms would be a great idea, but it's not at least in this game, game is bad, music tracks by them selves aren't bad, not enjoyable to me, but good for ppl who like this kind of music. Controls in this game are not really calibrated or accurate to do that you meant, even when using an Xbox 360 controller, all the levels in game are just not fun, after getting all cards this game drops I already got bored of playing it. Also game tends to connect you by it self to play with somebody or in the other way, without asking you, which is very weird. Seems one of the typical games coming from Greenlight that are just a bit more worked that a lot free flash games around the internet, also gameplay not feels better than an average flash game.
9186	Good Points First: It looks nice and they've gone to some trouble to make it a challenging 'vs' speedrun platformer  Bad Points: The difficulty curve is vertical and the controls are not the best you've ever used (to put it politely)  Even if you get past the controls (and it's not easy, they really aren't the most precise things ever) there are issues such as 'it's not always obvious what kills you and what's doesn't'.  This is a textbook example of not playtesting your game with enough people. The developers clearly 'are good at it' but if they'd gotten 10 platform gamers to try it, they'd have been told  'Make the controls tighter' 'Make Obstacles more obvious' 'Back-off the difficulty a bit - a least earlier on'  This lacks that magic 'when you die you know it was your fault' factor - I can't recommend it.

9188	Got this for free and it still wasn't worth the money. This game is too busy trying to orchestrate an orgy between Audiosurf and Super Meat Boy to actually be good or fun or not absolutely homosexual. Kill yourself.
9189	Don't buy Rush Bros if you want to play it online. If you want to play it locally, in splitscreen, go right ahead, but the online multiplayer is pretty much dead in the water. The game has you race against an opponent in lovely neon colored levels while playing (your own personal) music in the background.   It requires good timing to get through the level in time. That is, if you can find someone to play with in the first place. Unfortunately, that's the hard part.  Because of that I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It would be a waste of your money.  [Rating: 60/100]
9190	not worth a penny.
9191	Horrible game. Absolutly no storyline, awful in game control. But one plus - it's music. Music in this game wonderful.
9192	 TRIAL AND ERROR   In a sea of indie platformers that are the product of days spent basking in the glow of CRT televisions and arcade cabinets; one emerges, dropping the beat on you with more force than Skrillex could ever wish to conjure. Rush Bros uses it's rather Dubstep heavy soundtrack, or your music, to bring life to its obstacles. Fans of games such as Amplitude or Frequency may dig the notion, though I'm not sure this iteration has sold me on these concepts by way of platformer.   Rush Bros controls well, allowing players to wall jump, and slide, with collectable power-ups for speed and double jumping. At its core I think rush brothers could be a good platforming experience, with ideas pulling from recent indies such as Dustforce and Super Meat Boy, with a musical twist and an identity crisis. The art style makes use of dark blacks and neon lights that can be seen in a number of rhythm games. Although fans watching videos of preview builds will be glad to know that the art has been much improved since.  The level design, on the other hand is wherein my issues lie. While touting the moniker 'Racing Platformer' amongst a myriad of marketing materials, levels can be very tedious. Platformers can really strive when you find a level's pulse and the inherit rhythm of good design. Tapping into your music to alter the pulse is a great idea, though every time I entered that sweet spot, I would crash and burn into a wall of over complication.     It seems like many of the levels require you to back track, to progress further, this in itself is pretty disrupting when you are racing. While subtle changes do occur, they don't seem to follow any consistent beat, it was hard to tell if each pattern was solely based on the song's BPM, (beats per minute) or on the music. This can lead to some unpredictable obstacles that can contradict the music they are getting direction from. It's not rare for the harder levels to take up to thirty minutes on your first run, though I suppose this may count as an endurance race.   Rush Bros does offer a nice simultaneous multi-player experince, as well as drop-in multi-player, adding a bit more depth than a leader board. Fortunately the drop-in feature can be disabled, it's nice to have, though it can be frustrating racing someone before you have memorized the complexities of each level. I applaud adding a bit more competition than a high score or target time to chase.      FINAL VERDICT     Masochistic joystick junkies may come to rejoice at the feet of Rush Bros, though I felt the game struggles with its identity. When I think of a rhythm based racing game, I would assume simplistic design based primarily on the flow of game play. Simple to learn, hard to master is a great strategy for platformers though I did not find it in Rush Bros. Although fans of complex platforming with an affinity for Dubstep may find it to be the perfect game.

9193	I didn't like this game at all. Waiting for 10 frickin' mins to play people to find out that the music really doesn't seem to affect anything. What's the point?
9194	A game likes this needs perfectly smooth controls - a feature Rush Bros. unfortunately did not implement. Annoying levels, weird and stiff controls make this game a pain to play. Rush Bros. is by no means like any other rhythm/racing games - and I don't mean that in a positive way. Get   Electronic Super Joy   instead.  Gameplay: 2/10 Sound:4/10 Graphics: 4/10 Overall: 3,5
9195	Rush Bros. is the rare type of game that manages to fail at its core mechanic. It is a rhythm platforming game where an algorithm determines the pacing of traps and projectiles based on the beat of a song. Unfortunately the developers have chosen to make the soundtrack a variable, meaning that every person who plays the same level will be met with a different experience and, more importantly, a different level of difficulty.  The level design often betrays itself and the player; where a certain coloured platform may be safe to stand on, another platform of the same colour will instantly kill the player. Similarly, traps may fly across the screen and kill the player in a manner you never would have expected. Nothing is ever clearly explained or defined before the player encounters an obstacle, which means you'll often have to play through a level multiple times before understanding how it actually works. It's a level of artificial difficulty created by the developer as more of a joke on the player rather than competent game design.
9196	Broken controls, annoying and poor level design. This game is just not fun to play :(
9197	This game is a pile of brown bananas! Got it for free, and was still over priced. It's an embarrassment to have it in my steam library.
9198	Thank god it was free.lol
9199	If you like Super Meat Boy... give this a miss. Floaty controls with levels demaning precision. And if you got here because of the reactive / dynamic music element then I couldn't see it - it's already been bested by older games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard.  Avoid this. There's much better platformers and much better music games out there. And this attempt to merge the two is the lesser of the sum of it's parts.

9205	It's not the worst game I've ever played, but I don't think it's worth $10.  The game advertises itself as a music based platformer, with a bit of a heavy emphasis on a competetive multiplayer aspect (which I couldn't test since nobody on my friends list owns this game). Playing through the levels makes me think of a Tron-themed Super Meat Boy, except sometimes the obstacles and so forth are extremely unforgiving (forcing you to completely restart the level if you don't get past). I like challenge, but there is such a thing as too much.  The 'music based' part is where the game disappoints me, however. Not because of the soundtrack - the game ships with some incredible music, and even has native support for your MP3s if you decide you don't like what it comes with. The problem however, is in the way the game uses the music; or to put it more accurately, how it  doesn't . Occasionally there will be little blinky lights or pulsing disc things that will react to the beat, but nothing seems to react to the music in a way that actually effects the gameplay itself. I don't go faster with higher tempos, the obstacles just travel along the same timing patterns...I could load a slow, sad Sinatra song and get the same game as a high tempo Pendulum track.  If you can pick it up as a freebie somewhere, go ahead, but don't drop $10 on it unless you're incredibly rich.
9206	Worst control ever. Idiotic colors. Really bad game mechanics. Even worse menu. The music is good though.
9207	Its just so so bad and you get bored super fast
9208	THought it would be rythm based, was not. Kinda boring
9209	Precision platforming and awesome sound track that looks cool, but quickly becomes rage inducing with the bad controls. Add that with low frame rate and forced multiplayer and you have a game that just isn't fun to play. This game taught me a lesson. Even if it looks cool and has the support of critics, dosn't mean it will be a good game.
9210	I sincerely have a strong desire to test every game, to give my opinion on every single one of them instead on going by reviews or 'specialized' sites. I do read those things to have an idea of the game, but I still like to give a chance to every game, mainly if it's an indie one. But this one is disappointing... I don't usually make negative reviews, because I know how troublesome it is to make even a small game, but if you want a piece of advice, then go waste your money on something else.  This game is nothing like promised, the stage doesn't respond very well to the songs, only a SMALL portion of it (spikes, some platforms that pops from the ground and crates that will 'smash' you or whatever those things are) will move with the song and some of the objects that are affected will move totally out of the rhythm of a custom music and the gameplay is slow and boring. If you want to get some speed, you need to keep smashing the 'slide' button or put your hands on a 'Speed-Up' powerup. Seriously, multiplayer racing platformer? If you want to race a friend in a 2D platformer, go play Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or 3. In the other hand, it's a great game if you're having trouble to sleep. Surely you will feel sleepy in about 2 seconds.  Has a good soundtrack, though. Still, not worth the price.  The only good thing I got from this one was the 100XP from the badge.  Too bad a game chosen by the Greenlight, with an incredible concept, turned out to be so boring, so badly executed...  2/10, because of the songs.
9211	Can't really recommend the game. It lacks a certain fun factor. Instead of being difficult and challenging it's just hard and feels boring.   The music is nice.
9212	Pure junk. Don't load anything that has more than 10 min of play - Bought this because it had Infected Mushroom music. Pure disapointment - avoid like the plague.
9213	A rewal waste of money and time its just like playing a bad version of super meatboy with your own music that the music barley has any inmpact gameplay wise
9214	Sadly this amazing artstyle and music was wasted on terrible gameplay. However I am in favor of an improved sequel. In my opinion this game would be perfect with a higher focus on platforming and less on avoiding those damn lazer spikes that keep popping up. Also it's a misc thing but the ability to customize your 'bro' would be amazing (and I'm not just talking about his color). Also the difficulty spike is rather large and I actually have an easier time beating some of the later tracks then some of the previous ones (20-30 specifically). Perhaps turning this into an action platformer would work. Having little or large robots trying to block your path would be better then the many other issues you have to deal with (not saying all map hazards are bad).  all in all I'd hate to watch this die to bad unresponsive controls and frustraiting percision when it has such an amazing artyle and sountrack
9215	Overall I do not recommend this game. After playing the game for 116 minutes, several flaws in the games are apparent.   Restarting the level becomes tedious because there is no key that just restarts the level. You have to press escape and click on restart and the yes button. This might seem minor, but when making a mistake over and over you could be restarting the game about 20 to 50 times trying to get a better time. Then comes the three second wait every time you restart, there seems to be no reason for this at all.  There is no way to view the level so it is all trial and error. You spend minutes memorizing levels and having to react very fast and if you don't you have to restart. And restart. And restart. The level is constantly different due to the music and you can't lock a level to a single song. So after memorizing the level you still have to adapt because the beats of the song change the objects movements.  There are a few bugs in the game such as warping through walls or objects. Some objects that are moving that kill you leave a hurtbox that should not be there and unfortunately you walk into nothing and die.  Leaderboards is meaningless due to all the glitched scores. Some people have beaten a lot of the levels in 0.0 seconds making it all pointless.
9216	Wow, this game just isn't fun.  I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but the controls are not very responsive, the levels are repetitive and nothing in the game seems to be affected by the music - the main gimic that it uses to sell itself!  The level where you have to backtrack over the same part of the level 4 times was the final straw for me.  It doesn't matter how good the soundtrack you've got to accompany you, who enjoys doing exactly the same thing over and over again?
9217	why do i have this game
9218	It looked fun in theory, but the gameplay is so lame and uninteresting. I should have read the other reviews first, this one is a total fail! I can't imagine it would be fun with a second person, in fact it would be embarassing to show someone else this game. The concept of the game is great, the execution is a flop.   The game you actually want is Electronic Super Joy, that one is excellent. For some multiplayer action, SpeedRunners is excellent. Pass on Rush Bros,...
9219	want to try it ? buy it when its on the big time sale ( 90% off ) ,dont buy it otherwise. its kinda messy , laggy and overall not want i expected. None is availiable for online vs and although i bought it for +1 game in my list , its gonna stay in the list.
9220	Great idea but poorly executed.  First of all it doesn't play 99% of all music of off your CDs. It only plays downloaded stuff No one plays online. Split Screen barely works if it ever even works. My personal opinion is to avoid this game
9221	Terrible game. Its a cheap rip off of Super Meat Boy with the addition you could press a button so you can play your own music. Not to mention you can't even pass 30 FPS.
9222	This game is so unoriginal, the same levels put to different music that either you are forced to listen to oryour music which can indeed mess you up in some levels. Oh, and did I mention that all the levels are already unlocked? Yeah so much for an actual game.
9223	Plz remove from steam store people are commiting suicide because this game gives you pure cancer -_-.
9224	Okay I am going to break down what I thought about this game;  Loved; - The Music, ability to play Versus.  Hated; - Figures, camera angles, limited areas to go, same thing everytime...
9225	Buy Speed Runners instead
9226	My wounds did not heal 0/10
9227	I have never seen a game fail at what it sets out to do quite like Rush Bros. It's honestly quite a mess from start to finish. I mean, zombies are shoe-horned in for no reason whatsoever, so that should give some indication.   The levels are about as 'affected by your music' as Turba is. But at least in Turba when a song gets fast, the game does too. Supposedly the traps change speed, but it honestly just make them look like they were programmed by a drunk guy. Speaking of drunken programming, the music selection system is the worse thing I have ever seen in my life. There is no way to choose just 1 song. You create 'playlists' out of entire folders. So if you're a normal human being and have just 1 folder for music, it selects your entire library recursively, with no way to easily remove or add in tracks. You also can't reorder or select tracks for play easily at all. For whatever reason, you can also change your music track in the middle of a game, if you can get the music controller to show up. The biggest kicker by far is that turning on shuffle affects the 'previous track' button, making it painfully obvious this was just a mediocre platformer and they just tossed in the music as an after thought. The default music is generic techno rubbish. It's so generic I couldn't even tell if the game was stuck on a track or not while playing.   The platforming aspect is bad as well. They make you backtrack (in a fast-paced platformer...) as soon as level 2. The level design is confusing and you actually end up getting lost your first time through even though there are signs telling you where to go. They just put doors and such in locations that you easily overlook. Level design also repeats fairly often, as if it were made with a random level generator. Some parts of the design are just horrid. There's one section where there are a bunch of springs you have to get past, except it's next to impossible to get past them without being flung back. The levers you have to pull force you to spam a button instead of pushing it once like any other sane platformer. You can get double jump and speed up powerups, but they are useless 99% of the time.   Overall, this is just terrible. In the only highly rated positive review, (by the developer no less) it touts one of the key features is 'you choose the levels'. Perhaps this is one of the few features that actually work (incidentally I had to spend 5 minutes trying to figure out how to start a level because there is no 'Play' button, so maybe not). The EULA is also so insane it would make Square-Enix overjoyed. It is honestly just a platformer with a music player shoved in. Platform Racing 2 is far better in every way (including music selection) and that was a free flash game from 2008.
9228	Ragemaking crap full of glowing stuff..  I hate this game... i'm dying all the time.. RIP 3 keyboards
9229	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est games of all times, if i had a chance of buying some gay porn instead i would definatly do, anything is better than this game. not worth its money at all. â¥â¥â¥â¥ da police
9230	Rush Bros is another average quality platformer. It does have some positives, especially the art style, music and general presentation. But the core gameplay experience is poor by platformer standards. The level design is not at all rewarding or fun to play, and the controls are imprecise and awkward. I lost interest, picked up the rest of the cards and got outta there.
9231	Supposed to be played with friends. Tried the single player, and was immensely bored with it. The option to have your own music playing in the background is supposedly a feature the game boasts, but really now, how many of us don't already do that, playing our own music while playing a game?
9232	It's not awful. Just don't buy it. Play an actual platformer or racing game or music centric game that does the job better instead.
9233	Got this game for free, installed it, got the cards, now I've done all the fun things about it
9234	  This game is  AMAZING!  EXTREMELY TERRIBLE! I do not recommend this whatsoever. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE! Why did this even get Greenlit?!
9235	Why do I own this?
9236	Typical racing game with music!
9237	I gave this game to Ross on Steam Train and he hasn't played it 0/10
9238	Good concept, bad execution. Forgettable.
9239	5.4/10 made in unity, not bad, has couple good ideas, but generally not good enough.
9240	I have no idea what's going on with this game but all I know is that it sucks.
9241	Terrible, don't touch it.   Retro 2D rubbish, low effort money grab.  At least the 'developer' warns you up front by telling you that you should be using a console controller, confirming immediately that it's not a PC game and has no place on Steam.  Implementation is twitchy, graphics are shoddy, gameplay isn't very smooth or well paced.
9242	11/10 BEST GAME!!111ONEONEONE!!1111! Never before have i seen a game with such great story and depth of character, sometimes i had to stop the game and shed a tear for the characters. My personal favorite bit was when you break up the Blood orgy in the sewers underneath kushtown, it was very challenging and you had to adapt your playstyle several times throughout the battle, such as when Shrek cam along shouting Ear paep at you. This is the best game i have ever played. -69 out of 1
9243	Honestly, I can't play it. The controls are so off, nothing is smooth. It's just not a fun game. It has potential... But I'm not sure if it'll ever reach that potential.
9244	  DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine
9245	Interesting, but having a timetrial game that's levels are manipulated by music defeats the purpose of the time trial. Time trial or race games should be repeatable and not have variables that can affect how fast you can finish.
9246	It's super meat boy with music instead of actual fun or challenging or any other important thing Also the music is not related to the gameplay whatsoever
9247	I would be more likely to grate my head against a grater and eat the pieces then play this again. Controls just aren't responsive enough
9248	I want to like it it. I really do, but no matter how hard I try, I can't. First, it takes WAAAAYYY too long to select your own songs, and there are too few traps with too small maps.
9249	Just like Super Meat Boy. But instead of being fun, there is multiplayer and lots of music and colors.
9250	This is arguably one of the worst PC games I have ever had the misfortune of playing.  Pros: The music isn't terrible, and you could hypothetically use your own music too. The multiplayer can actually be kind of fun at times.  Cons: Everything else... Before even playing the game, the starting menu can be confusing. When trying to start the single player, you'll likely end up trapped in charcter customiztion or control bindings. Assuming you can tackle that, the game then trys to pair you up with random players on the internet. Frustrating as that was, I did manage to find some multiplayer enjoyable, up until track 10 or so. For a platformer that demands a lot, the controls are quite sh**. You cannot be expected to complete some of the objectives with the controls being as they are. The movements don't always seem consistent, and, at times, enraging. When trying to slide down walls, it is discovered that the Rush Bros. are actually honey and stick to the walls. What a hoot.  The game's claim to fame, using your own music, changes only a few spikes on each level. It doesn't really take the song into account, just sparatically throws spikes every few beats. No matter what music you use however, the game's respawn sytem is sure to screw you over every time. Respawning you directly into a trap-repedatly.  The absolute WORST part of this game is the fact that it doesn't even work half the time. On 4 multiplayer sessions, the camera decides it doesn't need to follow me anymore. You're literally running the stage blind as the camera zooms and spins in an elegant mating ritual. Did I need to see that pool of acid or that small landing paltform? The game would say no.  All in all, rated 2/10. THAT'S A TWO OUT OF 10. The pros come nowhere near overcoming the cons of this game. It is a crime against humanity to sell this heap of trash at $10. I almost regret buying the humble bundle for this game. Wouldv'e quit after maybe 20 minutes if they didn't include the trading cards I needed for the Summer Adventure 2014. Smart move devs. These cards are likely the only reason anyone may still put time into this game.
9251	Feels unfinished and is generally frustrating to play.
9252	Rush Bros is not perfect but a pretty nice game. It has some cool soundtracks and lots of frustrating achievements.  Phew... atleast many of us got it for free.
9253	Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this. Not even if it's on sale. I wouldn't even buy this in a bundle. I guess it looks fun in the videos but that's not how it feels if you play. The controls are horrible. It feels like a cheap Jump'n'run without fine tuning. Just off. And if this isn't bad, the level-'design' is even worse. It's just not fun to play. If you're in need for a nice jump and run with great music, buy Super Electronic Joy. Better graphics, direct controls, great music, sarcasm and it's even cheaper than this piece of junk :D
9254	Terrible. Don't buy it! Even for 1 euro!!!
9255	There's nothing terribly fun about this game. It's a pretty run-of-the-mill platformer. The best thing about it can also be the worst: The levels are music-reactive. You want to use your own music? You sure can, but you better hope there isn't a lull in the song when you need something to jump on. Local co-op might be fun but I played single-player only. This has gone on sale for $1 before and been in bundles, but those are the only ways I can recommend getting this.
9256	Worse than RO2
9257	I recently read a review for this game calling it a 'precision platformer'. Dear god precision is the direct opposite of the word I would use to describe this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ slip'n slide.
9258	Eeeeh... I was excited for music aspects as a bonus to some sort of Super Meat Boy-esque platformer... and was less rewarded with a game that reminded me of I Wanna Be the Guy but less challenging. The game skips every time you select a new track, and the music is just a side note... I'm not sure why people are calling this polished or addictive :/ Super glad I only got it for $0.99 rather than the full price.
9259	Very basic 2D platformer with a timer added to justify the term 'rush'. Graphics and animations are MS Paint tier, the music is awful.
9260	I like the music... And that's it. The controls are very sloppy and there is a very noticeable delay in button press'. Fix the controls, and that dumb trail that is larger than the character and follows you.
9261	the trailer had me excited, i believed i would experience an intense sensation of speed provided both my the character movements and the musically effected levels; sadly the music doesn't interact with the level designs in a truly dynamic or interesting way, the controls felt loose and slidey(something that shouldn't be allowed in this type of game); and while attempting to find some enjoyment in this purchase, i played levels that were literally impossible to complete. The hype is not real, the music selection was the only part i liked, which i can easily enjoy through several free methods; If you're looking for a good game with a more intergral mixture of gameplay and music, I recomend Crypt of the Necrodancer. Don't waste your time or money with this one.
9262	Short Review: The game has literally nothing to do with the music. Otherwise a worse-than-average platformer.  Full Review: - Gameplay The game and level design is awful. It is a simple platformer with constantly flashing lights that do no part to make the game look nice and your friends don't here what music you are playing. If anything, the music is just what you play in the background. You don't jump, dodge or do anything that is related to the music, fully contrary to what it claims âDiscover gameplay with custom musicâ . There's nothing to customise at all.  - Controls The controls are also simple but really plain because of the poor execution. You find yourself trying hard to jump, run, dodge, not because it is difficult, but because the game mechanis are just off. You respawn next to the obstacle which continues to run even when you die, so you are essentially waiting for the right moment to jump -- and even then, it doesn't feel fun doing that. It is not tense at all. It is boring jumps and runs all the way.   - Verdict I am glad I got it for free. It was a waste of time to even install it.
9263	Neat little platformer game. Not really original or unique, but not overly challenging either. I think I enjoy it because it tends to find the sweet spot of being challenging yet forgiving. Of course, there are exceptions (I'm looking at you, level 42) but. Admittedly it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do since the music-based elements hardly tend to feel like it at all and mostly end up being random (many songs won't even have consistent behaviors on the environment, so...). And the game has a tendency to be glitchy as well. Also I should mention that the soundtrack is just alright. Electronic music isn't really my thing. There's a few songs I like anyways though. But normally I kept to only using those few songs. Also two of the achievements are broken and/or impossible. If that matters to you. Kind of miffed about it myself. And the devs have abandoned the game already so if that's a dealbreaker, then sure. Honestly it's kind of hard to defend this game all things considered, but that doesn't mean I can't still like it.  EDIT: In retrospect this is a pretty cruddy game isn't it. Just browsing through my old reviews like 'why is this a positive review' and so okay. Meh. I've played too many platformers to have any good will towards bad platformers nowadays.
9264	(Short ver.----Sucks as a  rhythm  ''Discover gameplay with custom music'' game. and the levels are about as special as CourseBot's Mario Maker levels)  Oh yeah, I remember this now. (serious review time)   I just received this game in a blind box style purchase from greenman gameing and immidiatly recognized it from a trade Team Fortress 2 server where one of the devs was bribing people to spam a link to the greenlight page to every relation they had.   I suppose i can understand that because it apprently it worked, but getting it now and actually seeing what they were trying so hard to sell is kinda sad, to be honest. To put the game into perspective quickly, think of a Super Meat Boy with much less going on in terms of.... well everything. Rush Bros has an initial theme, good music, and the ability to use your own music, but that's about it.  Even the music incorperation element seemed to be lacking quite a lot. The game is the same without the music, just less flashing. In fact, the small mechanics that use music makes no sense (ex, the movement of the spikes). The biggest irk I have with Rush Bros is that it even uses music. it would be just as good with a fixed soundtrack and little incorperation of music (like it is now pretty much.) The songs you put into the game will end premature and ruin flow.  The levels also felt very much like Coursebot Mario Maker levels (for those of you who don't know, 'Coursebot' is just the thing that dishes out premade and easy levels in the 10 mario challenge) because of their basic feeling, easy difficulty and leisurely pace. Rebuttle to this oppion, this game came out in 2013 and Mario Maker, 2015. Some ideas just where just out of XYLAs grasp.  
9265	A side-scrolling platformer that offers no motivation for the player to play it. It's got neat colors, level design and some decent mixes but other than those, that's it. It just doesn't push the player to rush an investment into the game. Even with everything it has, it's a surprisingly uninspired game.
9266	Date: 2/23/16 Review Number: 25  Game: Rush Bros From (Creator Publisher): XYLA Entertainment/Digital Drive Played On: Steambox/Controller/Keyboard/Nothin Steam Price as of Review: $9.99 Total Time played: 15 Minutes Review:  So, only two bits into our reviews here and I have already come up with a game that I couldn't finish. And I don't mean entirely, I mean I couldn't finish the thirty minute minimum review time for the game I have set for these reviews. Ostensibly, Rush Bros is supposed to be a sort of rhythm based platform racing game where two people run through a track bouncing off of walls and jumping over obstacles in a somewhat custom designed course with a backing track of music as accompaniment. Or at least, that was what it said on the tin, which is in some ways the making of a fairly decent time waster. But that really wasn't what I got. Instead I got into the game, only having to get back out of the game and figure out how to properly remap the controls (this being another one of those games that just doesn't like the Steam Controller) and then start another game round. Instead of timed platforming, I got mediocre sprites over graphics of somewhat pretty backdrops, jerkily moving about in a odd monochrome environment. I also got sloppy controls, regardless of what controller I inevitably used. I got music that sometimes fit the mood of the levels, but never really played well as a background track. And I also got a dead steam instance after the game crashed fifteen minutes in and killed steam in the process. To add insult to injury, after relaunching the game, the control scheme was completely useless, and no amount of controller remapping could fix it, so I had to simply walk away.  Now, I like being generous in these reviews. I know game developers take a lot of time and put a lot of their energy and often times souls into the things they create, so I don't like to disparage people beyond attempting honest critique. However, with this game, I just canât bring myself to be anything other than disappointed. I feel like the value for the cost on the storefront is terrible, the game itself is lacking in so many characteristics, regardless of the somewhat interesting premise, and the technical side of the game was in many cases non functional. All in all this is certainly not the sort of game I would be spending time with. Pass.  Gameâs Fate: Gone. Just gone. If I want to play rhythm games, I'll whip out stepmania, or beat my head against the wall in time to Another One Bites the Dust. Either way would be better. Buy/No Buy: Nope.
9267	They recommend gamepad for this - did not feel like it is easier. If you like challenge (i.e. you are masochist) you going to love this game. I must admit I am not platformers fan but this game was frustrating as hell, especially if you try to get achievement ( any achieviement).
9268	This free game was not worth a penny more than I paid for it. There are lots of great indie platformers out there, but I'm afraid this just isn't one of them.
9269	Couldn't really get into it... Didn't really try.
9270	This is my opinion and you have complete right to disagree and/or to think differently.  Broken controls - pushing a button for an action has about 40% chance to fail registering resulting in running into spykes, just sitting in a pit, falling down. Annoying music - levels are made for 30 sec - 2 minutes, songs are 3 minutes+, there is no music during the level load, there is no music during the start countdown, there is music just during the run, every time is a different song. Considering that you have time only to hear the starting chords of the song before the level is over and that next time you hear the start of a different song - it becomes increasingly annoying.  I would've seen playing this game at a party were quick action and short levels are perfect to keep the guests entertained without taking too much attention span away if only the controls were not broken and the music was more continuous (just keep playing the song through the countdown and level load so that there is a connected experience)  Anyhow, even with the controls and music intact, the amount of entertainment that this game would provide is maaaybe worth $5. But even for $2, considering that it does have bugs is a stretch and I would have to think about it.  P.S.: the video options are also broken - if you change more than 1 setting at a time, then there is a chance that some of your changes will not get applied. Navigating the menu after playing with my controller, somehow becomes impossible using the d-pad or the keyboard arrows, and after hovering over a menu item get the sound for a dozen or even more of selection change events. I wonder if there was a QA to check this game before they've released it to public?
9271	Got it for free from GMG + Playfire even pays you in GMG credits for unlocking achievements, but couldn't force myself to digest more than 5 first levels of this very uninventive and broken Super Meat Boy mimicry.   Everything is so random in this rainbow piece of puke, from unresponsive contols to the lack of design to plain boredom that seems to be your one and inevitable rush companion.   This game ruined my Saturday morning. Avoid. 1/10
9272	Really unresponsive controls (both on keyboard and Xbox controller), like not jumping at the moment you press the jump button..extremely irritating for a platformer. Annoying in many ways, you always die, can't even see why someone competitive and craving for difficult games would like it, everything here is pretty much lame except the music, but no matter how good the music, nothing would make me recommend this game.
9273	What an abysmal game. If not for the Playfire Rewards, i would not have touched it. even WITH the promise of free money for playing it, i could not manage more than about 15 minutes before deleting this tripe.  the graphics are hideous, the gameplay is lacking and the controls are rubbish. Avoid at all costs.
9274	This is among the worst games I've ever played. It's a racing platformer, but it's plagued by terrible design. First, it's multiplayer-only. It doesn't need to be, since it's just basically a race and there's zero player interaction, a time trial leaderboard where you could put up your best time would be fine. Because there's so few people playing, it can take a long time to find a match.   The biggest flaw in this game though, is that the person you're playing with can restart or quit the match at any time, and completely screw you over. You could be setting a world record run on a level, but if you're opponent is feeling evil, he could press restart and your effort would be in vain.  Please don't waste your money on this game. Get a game like Super Meat Boy or DustForce to scratch the same itch but in a way that's actually done well.
9275	Sluggish and unresponsive controls cripple what could have been a unique platformer.
9276	This game is a great example of why perfecting your controls is so important.
9277	It is not smooth and has not really got any fun to it :/
9278	this game sucks
9279	I was a little disappointed with this game. The music is pretty good, but I think the level design lacks a little something. It seems like the game is meant to be played with two people seeing as the 'Wait for Competition' option is checked by default for levels which was a little confusing. I am usually a big fan of platformers, but I don't much care for this one.
9280	This is the typical garbage pretentious and shovelware games that are voted on greenlight and end up on the store.  EDIT: Just noticed this and it made me laugh: 'System Requirements - Processor:Intel Quad Core @ 3.05 GHz / AMD A8 3.6 &amp; above' Is this for real? Is the game so bad that they recommend a quad-core cpu? Also, they put 'Infected Mushroom' music to shame with this piece of junk!
9281	At first the controls seemed very stiff. The levels are ok, most are doable. Make sure to turn off survival mode in the settings so the respawn isnt at the beginning of the map. However... Graphics are literally too flashy and the camera can get glitchy. Overall, would not play again
9282	Meh. Unless you're diehard fan of platformers, the game is slow and frustrating. I expected things to be more lively with this kind of music.
9283	This game is sooo difficult, the course are made in a way where it isn't your fault you died, its the game. Nearly all maps are studded with traps left and right. Making it impossible to predict an incoming death without playing the map again. The game is very very very very very difficult to speedrun, when most course require you to take time while being rushed with a spiked wall. Not to mention the respawns are just plain stupid when it requires you to restart all the way back. (this includes all unpredictable traps respawn).  The game tries to make a electronic theme super meat boy, but just fails at it. The music is awesome, and custom playlist is something im a sucker for, but everything about this game is just so unfinsihed or just plain impossible to play. Really, the only thing this game really has it's CO-OP mode.   And to top it all off, this game is priced a $10! I suggest waiting this sale for this game to be 2.99
9284	gets really obnoxious, fast. got a free key, still not worth it. Using Playfire prompted me to look at, i just couldnt do it. If you look at some of the reviews, most say the same thing, requires perfection, lacks on precision. When you have to start counting the seconds, or watching for visual cues to react, it becomes about rote memorization and i'm sorry, i dont play games to remember things. Just not fun, even with the zombies ( which is an even more desperate grab for players than handing out the key for free)
9285	Before this game came out, one of the devs anounced on a tf2 server that he was giving away free unusuals and to trade him for more info. I traded him just to see what it was about and he said that he has this game on greenlght called rush bros and that if I liked it on greenlight and got 100 or so others (idk the actual number) to like it and have proof (like a screen shot) that they liked it, then i would receive said unusual. i came to him with the proof (still prior to the release of the game) and asked him about the unusual hat he promised, he never replied to that message and later removed me. Please dont buy this mediocre, overpriced game from sour devs.
9286	Good ideas, but it isn't worth the price.
9287	The music is cool, I guess.
9288	Please don't buy this game. Terrible music game with flash game looking graphics. The only plus I can give is that it is multiplayer and you can use your own music, but that's pretty much it. These are one of the games that you can find in 'game' websites on Google. Not really worth it.
9289	The game is looks uncompleted, very poor control
9290	I have no idea what this is supposed to be. When it was in greenlight, I was excited, but only because I misunderstood. I thought it would be like Audiosurf and it makes custom levels with your music. Nope. Blocks will pop of faster if your music is fast! Such wow! Amazing! This is 21st century technology here! I might as well play a half-decent platformer and put on iTunes or go into Big Picture and do the Steam music feature to have a better time than this. There is also no story. I want to know the story between these 2 'D-J's-'! I got this with playfire and it wasn't even worth the price of free! Levels are very repetative. Jump. Jump. Die. Jump. (and the occasional) Slide. That's it! The achievments seem imposible too. HOW CAN YOU NOT DIE ON THE FIRST LEVEL IF YOU NEED TO GET TRAPPED IN A ROOM FULL OF SPIKES TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL???!! *UPDATE 6/14/14* There is a way to not die in the 1st level and it is extremly hard to get it. When I go on music longer than 3 minutes, my game freezes up for a few seconds and plays the song. It's not even worth that wait! You can only listen to about 1 minute of the song! Then when you go to the next level, it won't take you to the place where you left off, IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SONG BEFORE IT!!! I don't want to listen to their techno crap thing. I listen to metal. It claims everything will be fast paced if you play a fast paced song. I played War Ensemble by Slayer. It took forever to load. Everything seemed about as fast as a really old and simple song. I still do not recommend this game and probably never will unless they fix anything. If I play M.I.A by Avenged Sevenfold in the level selection, the Djs start humping their turntables.
9291	Worst game in my library.
9292	Meh like the music. the game is too simple for me. music 6/10 game 4/10- IMO
9293	A very poor game with limited appeal. So many other games outshine this one, so why bother? Also, graphics never make a game but this entire game feels like a flash game that you pay for.
9294	A fun platforming game that requires more than one player to play. It's not that popular at the moment. Would recommend only if you have a friend. Unfortunately, you cannot play this game single player.
9295	A retro game based on multiplayer? The music is terrible (but that could be just my taste) and the controls are way too laggy and imprecise. They raccomand to use a joypad, but what if I don't have one? Plus some 'puzzles' are just 'I hid a moving platform/button here and you have to die to notice it'. Not my kind. My advice is to watch a lot of videos about this game before buying it.
9296	For me, it was a laggy and lazy Super Meat Boy clone with the Multiplayer feature barely noticable. Seriously, the other player is more like a ghost than anything. How can something be a race if one player has to run all the way back to flip a switch so the second player can just go forward, the competitivity is cheap at that point. The music does make a difference but it will only mess up your running by bursting up dumb obstacles by it's own definition of a beat. It's a bad Multiplayer Super Meat Boy game that took the fun out of Super Meat Boy
9297	The game feels like a generic flash game. I wouldn't really mind that too much since some games made in flash is really great! But there's one thing which makes me NOT recommend this game! You finish the levels in such a fast pace that you only get to hear the half of a song and then it just ends.  If I play a rythm game, I wanna hear the whole song! Imagine playing Guitar Hero and the song just suddenly stops when you're rocking out and stuff.  That's pretty much all I can say about it. The sudden music stopping thing pretty much ruins everything for me.
9298	
9299	The game could of been much better. Allowing for custom music is an awesome feature which many games don't have but the gameplay is just bad. The platforming is simple but really dumb. Controls are really clunky and just don't work sometimes. The levels aren't that fun and just forgettable. Don't get this game, just avoid it. It does have a decent soundtrack.
9300	Not a big fan of this game, I figured it would be a fun platformer but its not. Its very repetetive and not that fun. The only good aspect about this game is its music, which is also preference :\.
9301	Really cool idea with a terrible execution. I love rhythm games and I grew up playing platformers. The game doesn't play as much to the beat but rather tries its best to simulate one. Some of the later levels are Super Meat Boy level difficult, but with all these terrible obstacles sort of matched to the rhythm it makes the game frustrating.   The game has 47 levels and the difficulty ramps up quite quickly. Eventually, spikes start to move so quickly that prediction is necessary to avoid death, but the game is extremely checkpoint heavy to its benefit. There are some spikes that move backwards, and at this point the game devolved into masocore (eg I wanna Be The Guy) levels of nonsense.   Early on the most painful levels are ones that make you repeat the stage repeatedly, unlocking the next door only to be forced to drop down to start the level over again to get the next key for the next door. The worst levels are those that are heavily layered and filled with traps so if you fall you can lose a lot of time. After that are the 'boss' levels, which get rid of the generous checkpointing you rely on. The thing I found to be most helpful was to find the song with the quietest beginning that wouldn't trigger most obstacles and spam LB to replay it over and over again. It took away from the musical aspect of the game, but the musical aspect is a suggestion at best.  The game doesn't react very well to your music and there are only a few obstacles that do: spikes, table saws, rising platforms, repulsor bumpers (think Super Meat Boy) and zombies. There are a handful of others that are static like buzz saws and spikes. The repulsors are the worst obstacle in this game because on any given song it seemed to be random when they would activate, which led to a lot of long falling and time lost.  The zombies are probably annoying too but I couldn't see them because there was a bug(?) where they stopped spawning after I restarted my game to fix another bug where the game wouldn't checkpoint me at all. I considered the former a beneficial bug so I didn't restart the game again.  I got this game for free and my favorite thing about it was being able to listen to a few good songs that I had forgotten about in my music library. Also, the rainbow level toward the end was pretty okay.
9302	It's an okay 2D platformer that looks nice, but the game's involvement with your music library is basically the equivalent of having iTunes open while playing. It doesn't feel like running through the levels would make much of a difference whether or not I was using the game's OST, my music folder, or no sound at all. I was expecting more out of it, but it might be OK to grab during a steep sale or something.
9303	This game was so bad that I wanted to refund it. But then I remember that I got it for free, so I asked Steam to refund my time wasted on this game.
9304	You are never going to get any of the achievements, and if you really like to win, dont plan on getting this game, you are going to lose, and mind kill your computer in the process  edit: just met the requirments for an achievement, and it didn't unlock screw this game
9305	I really wanted to like this game. That being said, it was not anything I had hoped for. Many of the reviews here have already adressed the problems I am experiencing as far as controls and promised features. Instead, I will give a different perspective.   I personally bought this game because of the multiplayer, but none of my friends will play this game. The game controls do not work well, they seem inconsistant or touchy. It also punishes you very hard very early on. This is very discouraging to most people, as they have no feel of progression right from the start. Most people probably will not have any friends who enjoy this type of punishment so early on. Essentially, the multiplayer funtion is fairly useless to most.  This game could have been a lot of fun, even if only for myself, but it requires some work. Don't bother buying this game until then.
9306	Man, haven't played a game this bad in a looong time!
9307	Dead â¥â¥â¥ game for dead â¥â¥â¥ dreams, I bought this game 4 years ago durring the boom of indie games amd 'Inovative gameplay' Our collective fragile minds ready to accept all the fecal indie games available to us. With that being said its not hard to realize how shortsighted these 'inovative gameplay' would become in the future. Games that would rely on online play and essemtially a large player base. Games such as Gunmonkeys,Monaco,etc. Thus this is what leads me to my review , this game is the result of pumping out a 'retro' indie game with a half-baked idea to the public. Anyone who folllowed the indie scene durring that time knows this game for being overhyped and rarely shown especially when Indie Statik still exited. THIS GAME IS SIMPLY AWFUL PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR PLAY IT THIS GAME IS SIMPLY A REMINDER OF THAT ERA IN WHICH WE BELIEVED ALL INDIE GAMES HAD TO BE EITHER GIMIMICKY OR RETRO TO BE GOOD 
9308	TL;DR: The game seems promising but is plagued by several issues: controller was not recognized immediately in gameplay (can be remedied, but come on), there doesn't seem to be much of an objective besides just finishing the map, and the promise that it's 'music reactive' isn't really there. Overall a pretty stale experience, not worth checking out.
9309	This game is okay. It's a standard fast-pased side-scroller.  My problem with this game is that nearly every achievement is almost impossible to acquire. I think maybe one or two of the achievements should be as hard to get as they are, but I can't imagine anyone putting in as much time as this game wants.
9310	When you have no music the game freezes. At this moment you can sit and wonder: 'Why did I buy this game...'
9311	 What I liked:      You can play your own music tracks   What You Need to Know:      Whole music based platforming is not that good     Don't know what else to say, other than get Dustforce instead    My Score:
9312	Iâve played a lot of Project Cars, but Iâve had enough and I doubt Iâll go back to it. Itâs a nice looking game, at 4K resolution and with the video settings maxed out runs very smoothly on my system. There is a wide selection of cars (if you buy the DLC) and plenty of tracks, but that all counts for nothing when so many other areas of this game are sorely lacking.   The opponent AI in Project Cars is absolutely dreadful; It appears to be almost pathologically incapable of not colliding with you. It has this apex or nothing mentality, which means if you actually try to race with it through a corner there is almost bound to be a collision. By way of comparison Iâve been playing Assetto Corsa again recently and the AI - while not perfect - is so much better, you can actually race closely with it through corners without the constant likelihood of being rammed off the track.   At any track with a tight first corner (Oschersleben, Nurburgring Sprint and GP for example) there is almost always a huge pile-up there on the first lap, where the race will sometimes grind to halt altogether, I think this is caused by the aforementioned apex fixation. Iâve also seen AI cars actually collide with the end of the pit-wall on the way out of the pit-lane and spin, although this appears to have been patched by simply making the AI cars able to ghost through anything (including your car) when they exit the pits. So much for realism.   The AI also cheats constantly. Itâs able to cut corners and chicanes and go outside of the track limits with impunity. Being able to set qualifying laps and gain race positions by doing things that you would be penalised for. I've seen some pathetic excuses on the Project Cars forum that the AI is just 'making mistakes', yeah right. Also in practice and most qualifying sessions you have to warm up your tyres on your out-lap, but the AI is just able to go at full racing speed straight out of the pits. Similarly, the AI is also able to traverse gravel traps and grass without losing any speed, where your car would quickly grind to a halt.    After the first two or three seasons the career mode becomes really dull. Apart from the one or two race series you unlock by completing career objectives, you have the same championships you had before at the same tracks in the same order with the same weather. Thereâs this cringe worthy âFan Chatâ feature in career mode which is basically a feed of repetitive comments with your driverâs name copied and pasted into them with a wince inducing hashtag at the end. Whenever a racing game tries to incorporate a faux âsocial mediaâ element (GRID 2 for example), it just looks a bit sad and desperate and this is no exception.    Flag rules are also poorly implemented, blue flags in particular are a joke. On a qualifying lap at Barcelona I pass a car as itâs coming out of the pits on the main straight, then on the way into the first corner Iâm shown a blue flag because that same car is behind me albeit some distance away. Just laughable, which pretty much sums this game up, a game I've uninstalled and consigned to the backwaters of my steam library.
9313	I had a very popular positive review up for this game until now. Over the past year my opinion has changed.  I play with a racing wheel and play a lot of racing games and sims (all Codemasters games, iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom,...).  I'll keep it short:   The good
9314	It's hard to quantify what's wrong with this game in exact, concise words. Yes, on paper, everything this game includes, especially in GOTY form, sounds like an absolutely excellent package, but it's a 'jack of all trades, master of none' situation, and even then, it's only decent at those trades at best.  Positives first. It is very visually striking, and that absurd insistence that so many racing games have nowadays of making the cars impossibly, constantly shiny is absent in actual gameplay. The track list is impressive, and the original / un-licensed courses are excitingly original or amusingly just ever-so-slightly off. The Azure Coast and California Highway point-to-point races are extremely gorgeous, with the latter's bridge giving me vibes of Daytona USA. Azure Circuit and Sakitto fill in for Monaco and Suzuka, and I'm still loving that the Japanese circuit is literally just named Circuit but with a Japanese accent. All the courses included just feel right (except for Laguna Seca somehow), and it's a pretty excellent globetrotting collection.  The car list, at least with DLC, is a bit scattered, but you'll generally find something exciting to enjoy even if you don't recognize the name right away. I found the Superkarts to be a welcome surprise that I heavily underestimated at first, the LMP vehicles impressively powerful and forcing me to change my racing line as I considered the automatic KERS usage, and the Caper Monterrey fit my need for classic American stock cars quite well (at least partially).  The career mode is a simple calendar-and-event format akin to Dirt to Daytona, and it works pretty well aside from the blatantly bugged/repetitive emails and fan praise you receive. My number one praise for it is something that racing games in general need to learn how to do: DLC courses and cars actually are included, with their own events unlocked on the calendar as you progress if you have them. They aren't just awkwardly shunted to a free play portion of the game. They're part of the core experience. That's a massive plus.  However, after a while, the career mode just isn't enjoyable. That's not so much a fault of repetitive events, or my unnecessary compulsion to play every single event in order when I could just come back to them later. The problem is the AI.  The AI is a  massive  failure.  So, racing in go-karts, yeah, I can see a little bit of bumping and slamming. It's go-karts! I'm being aggressive, too. Stock cars, yeah, they'll charge a bit hard in the turn, so of course the drivers would be thrown off. GT endurance racers smashing each other off the track? Well, that's a little silly!  Starting an F1 (renamed Formula A in-game) race and immediately getting plowed into by the driver behind me, who digs into my wheelwell and chucks me into a ditch before the entire rest of the field dogpiles them and brings the race to an immediate screeching halt with the screams of tires and smashing of car bodies, showering the track in debris and caking the road in crushed cars? Bad. Very bad. It ended up very, very consistently like this regardless of difficulty adjustment. It cannot (noticably) tell the difference between different vehicles in terms of racing lines and aggression.  Now, you might just be thinking, 'well, maybe you just suck at this'. Fair enough. I don't play sims often. I got stuck in rFactor immediately because I didn't think to shift the car into neutral to leave the pit lane. But I'm getting better at that. This? This is not a sim. It's not a simcade racer, either, not entirely. It's trying to be both, and again, it's aggressively mediocre in many regards because of that. It very much enjoys spinning the player and AI alike out, and recovery is nigh-impossible. A massive array of tuning options and an insistence on actual reasonable racing lines bodes well for it being a fine sim, but the actual physics and AI behavior just don't line up with that, reverting to cartoony slides and demolition derbies in short order.  And full disclosure? I'm particularly furious that this game was  supposed  to have an oval racing mode, hence the stock cars even being included, but they gave up on it, allegedly after issues with the AI being incapable of navigating the ovals in a satisfactory manner. The AI is incapable of navigating  anything , though. As such, the US Car Pack stands out as a purposeless shell, including IndyCar and NASCAR vehicles for tracks that never came to fruition, and that's after they already licensed, mapped, and rendered Indianapolis Motor Speedway! They just threw it out and said they'd try again in the sequel.  In any case, yes, there are brief moments of fun here, and simply ogling the cars is probably money's worth in itself. I don't entirely regret my purchase. But it's such a weak roster for each discipline it represents that this is simply a stopgap appetizer before you go and buy whatever game includes the disciplines you like most. It tries to be everything and, as such, stretches itself extremely thin, extremely quickly. It's a wide array of shallow kiddy pools rather than one immersive but limited dunk tank.  But hey, it's pretty, right?
9315	Beautiful, polished, great driving physics and a dynamic envrionment make this racing game very appealing at first glance. However after spending some time with this game I have been dissapointed with the immersion this game offers as there are many features missing that a racing simulator should have.   1. There is no flag system or safety car. This gripe may seem nit picky but it does take away from the simulator feel of a race day when there are no flags to warn drivers that there may be a hazard ahead. Flags and safety cars are a huge feature in modern racing, often changing the outcome of a race and entire strategies devoted to pitting around safety car deployment. This leads into the second gripe, there are no AI caused accidents for there to be a safety car or flag system in the first place.   2. AI too flawless. The AI has no character in this game, they drive around almost on rails only to deviate in the most extreme cases occasionally onto the grass but then make a full recovery and lose 1 second on their lap time due to a small mistake. They are aware of the player, but too often they will completely give way to the player as if repelled by magnets. The biggest problem with the dull AI is that there are no retirements no matter how long the race is. 100 Lap races will 100% of the time have a full field finish, no mechanical faults, no accidents, no spins, even with full damage turned on. The AI does not make a mistake that leads to any game changing events. This makes for a very dull, boring race experience.   3. The career mode only offers a single full season of driving (17 races in a season) in one mode, the F1 equivalent Formula A mode. If you want to drive touring cars or karts or any other league the season is made up of only 5 or so races. It is kind of like the progress of simcade racing games like GT and Forza, just without the upgrades and car modifying and street circuits.   4. Every car is as solid as a tank. The damage modelling in this game reminds me of an old Need for Speed where you were able to drive at 300kmh and crash into any solid object and just bounce off. Damage is a huge component of racing, often slight damage will lead to changing a racing strategy and adds a huge element of risk/reward to a race. Damage is what keeps a race on the edge, gives a race character. Drivers will avoid taking huge risks because damage is a deterrent, and damage affects performance. Not in this game though, damage for the most part does nothing. You can use other cars as a brake with little consequence. Crash into a wall head on at 200kmh, and you will suffer slight suspension problems and get a couple of cosmetic scratches and a bent hood. That kind of a crash in reality would end with a DNF and debris everywhere. Since there is no deterrent to crashing in this game, the only solid tactic for racing is an aggressive push all the other cars off the road style.   The surface of the game is really spectacular, it will easily draw you in and look amazing, but don't be fooled. This is not what I would expect from a racing simulation, it sits halfway between a Forza/Gran Tourismo and a racing sim, but does neither very well. It is not an arcade game where you can customise your cars and earn a sense of progression with unlocking newer nicer vehicles and new modifications. It is not a simulator where you can immerse yourself into the reality of a race day. Project Cars lacks any character or vision for what it is, and in attempting to appeal to a very broad audience it has alienated the fans of both arcade and simulator fans alike by providing neither.   If you just want a game where you have the opportunity to drive around very pretty circuits with traffic and time trials then this game might be sufficient. It feels great looks great and sounds great. But it really lacks in the gameplay department so if you want a game that simulates racing, then I recommend you look elsewhere.  
9316	I've put a lot of time into Project CARS, and frankly, I'm fed up. So I'm going to give a long and thorough review of it.  TL/DR Version: Broken promises, missing game features, and crippling bugs should keep you away. Ultimately, this entire things feels like a giant paid BETA for Project Cars 2. I.E. You are paying full retail for the privilege of beta testing for the sequal.    Pro's:
9317	update 2016: This is a glimpse of the game you are about to buy (i hope not)  www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPWogDgRnfI  You can find many more on youtube.  And this image below is the remarkable post by Ian Bell, head studio of Slighty Mad Studios (that he erased it because he was getting too much love for it):    http://i.imgur.com/J7wCj0X.png    update as of december 2015:
9318	Right now I can't recommend this game.   General
9319	I like the core game and enjoy it however, while the main selling point of this game is the graphics they are so poorly optomized for AMD rigs that I do not feel I can recommend this game to anyone running AMD hardware. I feel the after paying $50 for the game discovering it is so poorly made is a disapointment. If this game is 75% off or they fix the poor optomization then I would recomend buying it. Update: After having tried the game on windows 10 it works much better so if you have windows 10 then ignore the stuff about poor optimization.
9320	Have to say I'm pretty disappointed in this game, as it currently stands. I do not feel that it lives up to the hype.  First off, the graphics are hardly as great as all the review sites claim. In some ways, they are impressive. The lighting is the standout, once you get past the cliche stuff like post-processed lens flare. The car models are impressive too. Textures and landscape are passable. But, what kills the look of this game for me are two things: First, the terrible, terrible shadows. These look like what you'd expect from the 16-bit era. They are rendered in what looks like horribly low resolution and flicker like crazy. almost pixelating the track wherever they are cast. Even on 'ultra' setting. Just terrible. And SMAA antiliasing seems to make the shadows worse. Speaking of which -- then there's the aliasing. Sure, the game offers a whole bunch of anti-aliasing options. But none of them work very well. Even with MSAA 4x and SMAA at 'ultra', there are brutal jaggies everywhere. The only way I could reign this in was by cranking Nvidia DSR with smoothness filter at 50% and FXAA at 'high'. That would normally result in a blurry mess in most games, but this game is so over sharpened and aliased out of the box that you need to do this to get anything like a decent look. Overall, I don't get the big fuss over this game in the graphical department. It looks decent but nothing special in my opinion. I've run it maxed out in 1440p and on triple 1080p screens, downsampled from 4k, you name it... nothing has impressed me very much.   (By contrast: another recent racing game, Dirt Rally, currently in early access, looks to my eye WAY, WAY, better. That game has excellent anti-aliasing, excellent shadows and ambient occlusion, and at least as nice textures and models. No comparison, in my view.)  Speaking of triple screens, the game currently has no independent rendering, so you have to set a high FOV and keep your monitors in a straight line. That alone should be a strong signal this is not a very serious racing game, despite whatever the marketing fluf would claim.  Then there's the racing. The dealbreaker for me here is that the AI in this game is infuriating. If you play at the easier difficulty levels, it's a cakewalk to leave them in the dust. But as soon as you crank up the difficulty, not only do they get faster (which is good) but they get excessively aggressive -- so the game becomes a demolition derby. Earlier today I tried TWENTY TIMES to get through the first corner in an open wheeled race. I ended up rage quitting. The AI cars ram into you and each other like suicidal morons, so you can't get started without getting rammed and spun out, very likely suffering 'suspension damage' that renders your car undrivable. I tried a bunch of different race setups and the result is nearly always the same. Set the difficulty at 80% or higher, and most of the AI cars will be missing bodywork 10 seconds into the race, and the only way to avoid their mayhem is to hang back behind them all. This is so stupidly unrealistic and game-breaking, it'd be hilarious if I hadn't dropped a good chunk of cash on this.  So, overall, we have decent but way overhyped graphics and racing crippled by terrible AI. My recommendation is to pass over this game, at least for now. I bought into the hype train on this one, don't make the same mistake.  EDIT AS OF PATCH 2.0:   This latest patch seems to have achieved some improvement to AI aggression. I no longer experience as consistently infuriating a melee off the line and into the first corner with high difficulty levels. However, that isn't to say the AI cars won't still ram you from behind, sideswipe you while cornering, etc. They still seem to drive like they're blind, drunk and senile pretty frequently. And it's frustrating when this happens halfway through the race, when some AI driver comes out of the pits and decides to ram you. This may actually be even more annoying than the demolition derby off the starting line.   Also, the main AI avoidance mechanism now seems to be driving off into the grass and the gravel traps. Which is a bit comical because they seem to magically drive at full speed over these surfaces and rejoin the asphalt at race pace. I often look in my rearview and see AI cars driving at full clip all over the grass as they struggle to avoid each other. By contrast, you will slow to a crawl and struggle to control your car if you hit the gravel. I've also noticed the AI drivers cutting corners, while you will get a 'warning from the race director' if you do so. These warnings, by the way, seem overly sensitive with this new patch. This adds to the frustration when an AI car sideswipes you, forcing you to put a wheel on the grass, and the game announces you've 'cut the corner' and will be penalized.  I've also experienced some frustrating new bugs and crashes. A standout was when I had run a great qualifying lap and wanted to skip to the beginning of the race. I was treated instead to an infinite loading screen. I had to end task, lose my time, and start again. Checking the forums I saw numerous others are having the same problem.  I still have mixed feelings about the graphics. I guess if you have a high tolerance for aliasing and other temporal artifacts (I've noticed lately that the game also seems to have texture fighting issues, with distant objects flashing), and enjoy post-processed lighting effects, this will impress. But that is not my preference, and it is still my opinion that this game's graphics are overhyped.   Overall, there is some improvement evident with Patch 2.0, but not enough to edge this out of the thumbs-down zone for me. The frustration is still overwhelming the fun. The game still feels far from a polished product. Maybe someday this will be a great game, but it isn't yet.
9321	Don't buy this game if you're and AMD owner and PLEASE consider not buying this game at all because of the anti consumer practices involved in building this game around Nvidia Physx that CANNOT run well on AMD cards. This kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥ needs to be stopped.
9322	Update: The game is now playable with gamepad. Quite a few people were interested in this aspect so will put this update up top.  The rest of the game has improved but is still a mixed bag. To be blunt the early access DiRT Rally is a more consistent and polished product than the current version of pCARS.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well here we are finally project cars is erm finished? Complete? Er letâs just say its âreleasedâ! Considering where the build was years ago I had hoped, dreamed, and even reasonably expected more. Somehow I think by trying to do absolutely everything pCARS has it all but none of it is really 100% sadly.  Donât get me wrong pCARS is great. If I could, this review wouldnât be a thumbs up or down but a wavering in-between. There just really needs to be a critique of pCARS other than the overflowing WMD love fest currently on steam. Take with a grain of salt the reviews of those personally involved with the development of this game. We all stand to possibly gain financially from its success to boot. Although the details are very very murky. Perhaps my negative review will mean my financial reward is lost? Weâll see :) Would you trust the cast of a movie to honestly review a movie on release? Of course notâ¦ what about the crew? Well if they all have royalty options and are hardcore fans dedicated and have been working for free the past few years? Up to you. I see pCARS as the first racing sim to have a hardcore fan base with plenty of âfanboysâ preloaded before release!  If you have 20 minutes spare this video captures my point exactly:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eD7o_f7s0Y   PROS: -Variety Heaps of cars for all tastes! Open wheelers, road cars and everything else! Lots of tracks and configurations. What a variety of conditions. Want to run a 24 hour race around Bathurst with everything from thunderstorms to clear skyâs go for it! -Visuals Amazing screen shots. Youâve seen them! The car models are stunning. Great cockpits with all moving parts (via g-forces too) bells and whistles. -Large grids.  Depending on the track run 40 cars. (this has been unstable for me in the past) -Built by the community. Despite my problems with the rabid variety of fan boy any developer that listens and reacts is doing good in my book.  CONS: -Variety By giving you everything and the kitchen sink (thank god rallying was dropped!!) SMS have bitten off more than they could chew in my opinion. Few cars or tracks feel 100% polished at this stage. Pushing the limits of number of AI and conditions still results in occasional crashes for me. -Visuals They donât live up to the screen shots! At the beginning of development my PC was woefully under spec. I could tour around in some builds hot lapping by myself waiting for the day I got a beast and it would look like the screen shots. I got my i7 with SSD and 16gig of ram gtx 970 and I can get over 100FPS with a full field in the rain but it doesnât look at all like the screen shots out there. Some talented community members have worked magic with the photo mode and post processing on videos. -Starts in background. The game has never ever, on 2 different PCâs Iâve owned, started as the foreground window. It starts goes into the task bar and there I can click or alt-tab all I want, it stays until I kill the processâ¦ The only way I can play is from the quick launch right clicking steam. If itâs been a while since playing I have to start it then kill it and quick launch. This was raised and talked about forever on WMD, how on earth is it still not fixed? Donât have any trouble with any other game at all! -Terrible gamepad support. Yes I can hear them now why use a gamepad itâs a SIM etc. Short answer I have too. My back is stuffed. I have all the gear I want itâs no good if I canât use it. Anyway I have learnt to get around in other SIMS with my Xbox one PC controller. Itâs not easy but I get around in iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, Race Room Racing Experience and many other sims with the gamepad. Race Room Racing Experience in my experience setting the bar for how a sim should support gamepad.  I really canât understand it I used to enjoy NFS shift as an in-between serious racing game for some fun. It had terrible wheel support with massive dead zones and was only really playable with the gamepad. So now the same developers have gone and created a game that is completely unplayable with the gamepad but now works great with the wheel? Why why why? -AI The AI has improved a lot in the final build. But then it had too! In this final build the AI displays less of its psychotic death wish driving style, actually respecting the track boundaries and your car for the most. However it is not possible to run a race without finding corner tyres and witches hats strewn everywhere after the first few laps. Being on a qualifying lap then slamming into a corner tire thrown onto the racing line and losing your lap time because of contact brings the kind of joy known only previously by the gran turismo special mission races. Donât touch anything or you fail. AI rams youâ¦ oh joy! Why do all modern sims have such poor over aggressive AI? rFactor 2 is the only modern sim that will give you anything like the sort of behaviour you would see at a professional race weekend as opposed to the open multiplayer full of kids experience todays AI seems to replicate! -Physics WMD members get excited by the SETA tire model. It dynamically simulates aspects of the tire model that other sims use static graphs and data to simulate. In theory tires should heat up, cool down, wear out, flex and a whole lot of subtle things more realistically. In practice I donât think itâs finished yet. A tire model is a hell of a thing to develop. Clever people have been at it for decades building upon previous work done. Is this dynamic model a step toward the future. Yes. Does it right now give you the best, most consistently matching real life data model out there today. Nope. In a word the physics feel 'floaty'...   And this pretty much sums up pCARS right now. The potential is huge. Bigger than anything before. But there simply wasnât enough time to finish every part of the game to the level it deserves. I would have gladly had less cars, less track, less dynamic models to have GT cars with the weather all at a 100% finished level polished like all hell, than a bit of everything that doesnât quite feel right a lot of the time. I would say if your using a gamepad wait, if youâre not really into your racing sims wait. If you have a wheel and enjoy a wide variety of different racing sims that all have different pros and cons then no doubt this purchase is a no brainer! Just donât expect the holy grail of sims that some claim it to be and you wonât be disappointed.  Iâm hoping they finish this off it really could be brilliant. But having heard pCARS 2 already mentioned Iâm not sure this sim will ever get the polish it needs.
9323	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462761065   Pros:  - quantity of content - physics for most of the race cars - decent track modelling for being non-laserscanned  Cons:  - physics for most of the street cars - strange design decisions in regards to the AI aggressiveness and career skill - odd bugs - the WMD community  I've put enough hours into this to feel I've justified my purchase, but I leave the game feeling like I've accomplished little of what I had hoped to get out of it. Going into PCars, I was hoping for a light sim with drivable if not phenomenal physics and track modelling, tons of qualilty content, a solid career mode, and top-notch artificial intelligence.  The physics for most of the race cars actually managed to exceed my expectations. The Prototypes, GT Cars, and modern Open Wheelers in particular are generally fun to drive and behave more or less in the manner you would expect. Most of the street cars, on the other hand, would be unsellable if they handled as poorly as they do in this sim. There are also the odd gMotor-like physics issues with regards to how the cars interact with the track surface, as occasionally what should be minor undulations will actually cause tires to lose contact with the track entirely, as if the suspension isn't doing its job properly. Additionally, some cars have very little grip when the tires are outside of their optimal temperature range, where in reality you would expect slightly less grip but for the tires to otherwise maintain their usual slip characteristics.  The tracks are also surprisingly well modelled considering that, AFAIK, laser-scanning was not used to create them. Having driven many of these tracks in iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I was impressed with how close they are represented here. With that said, elevation and camber changes seem to have gotten the worst of it, but overall the tracks are functional and don't take me out of the experience.  The career mode is almost insultingly barebones. I am absolutely in love with the idea of basing it on a real motorsports career, where you can choose a starting level and work your way up and down the disciplines appropriately. What I'm not in love with is the hightly repetitive nature of the social media aspects, where the same handful of headlines, emails and fake twitter posts are repeated based on your performance in the most recent race.  What I'm also not in love with, in regards to the career, is how the AI difficulty is automatically scaled downwards based on which tier you are racing in. I understand that they're trying to simulate the level of talent increasing as you progress higher through your career, but the differences should be based on the density of talent rather than a change to the overall difficulty slider. This is something that I think Dirt Rally does well - the top times are always in the same ballpark, but the overall skill of the field tightens up as you move through your DR career. Whether you're racing in karts or the LMP series (which is, laughably, placed higher than F1 in the career tree), the top drivers should be similarly skilled. The difference should be that the LMP series would have more of those top drivers than the lower tiers.  Speaking of AI, the AI is super aggressive. I like that they attempt to defend and gain positions, but the 'red mist' that has apparently been implemented has got to go. It is routine to see cars, after being passed, immediately cut the next corner or run wide on the exit, even if doing so means driving directly into another car or a physical barrier. Addtionally, the lines they take at times are shockingly bad. Braking too late into corners and then getting on the throttle far too late, causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight. Cutting corners or exiting wide, again causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight. The AI in this game basically drives like first-time online racers, with no situational awareness and no understanding of the importance of early throttle application on corner exit.  I feel like, despite not recommending this title, there are quite a few positives to be had. However the poor career mode and AI really make the overall experience pointless, as there are far better sims out there for online play or hotlapping. As of this time I cannot recommend the title, but I do plan on revisiting it in the future when it has been patched further and more content has been released.
9324	Waste of money. Runs terribly on AMD cards. Dev intentionally optimized the game for Nvidia cards only, and never warned of this on the store page.
9325	I wanted to love pCars but the FFB is lazy, the physics are weird, the A.I are nutters, there's so many bugs and to top it off the studio head is a disrespectful tool that insults his customers if they have valid issues that they are reporting.
9326	If you own an AMD graphics card DO NOT buy this game. It is built for Nvidia cards and the devs have no intention of supporting AMD users. If you have an Nvidia card then go for it, it'll probably run well. I have a R9 280X and this game dips as low as 10 fps at times. People with R9 290 cards also can't run it well. Do not waste your hard earned money on this game or this developer.
9327	Let me see, lets address whether I will be censored with an opinion on this review? erm no, good  Lets get to it, the amount of poor support regarding this game is a joke, having major issues for people all over seems to be missed due to the amount of censoring done by Devs Known fact amongst STEAM users and also else where If this is how SMS wants to treat its customers, then by all means don't think the same user base will be buying pC2  Now to the game, lets just say I have played better on consoles fwiw Joypad support is non existant for user input here, sur eyou have a plethora of adjustments at hand, but why? none seem to give any smooth input making the game frustrating to say the least Well all can't just buy wheels, which it seems this game is designed for I have 4 myself, but no where to use this as I have a 55 inch TV I use for the PC, so no desk Having asked the forum reasons to why controller input has been over looked, a response of, 'we don't support 3rd party apps'  If this is the kind of support one is expected as a soruce of 'professionalism', well I am sure this transparency to the real intentions of the Devs is seen Quite simply, they don't care about our needs  I have pretty much played every car game out there, not all, but pretty much most of them, and this game by far even though it's eye candy plus, is lacking some serious support from SMS 1.5 million games sold? most on consoles, they use a Joypad as a predominant device, yet PC seems to be over looked, why?  The game has potential, which is met by the arrogance of the Devs and support staff, thinking thsi game is a Sim. It's far from, most things that go to make it a Sim is broke, too many issues  AI is seriously BIASED so it does as it pleases and is not confined to the rules of what you drive to Opponents go off track, over take you, you do the same, you get penalties and slow down, great  All I can say is, a good looking game does not necessarily make a good playing game  Edit, proof of how customers get treated   http://oi60.tinypic.com/20b1pv6.jpg   This post has since been removed  Update, looks like that pic has been removed so here it is again   http://postimg.org/image/stmxy7iih/   Edit 31/01/16  I am adding that my review has been hidden, for what ever reason, I don't know, but it just goes to show how the devs censor anything but a positive review  EDIT, I have to add this, this is a moderators msg to me to why I was banned, and since I have already spoken to a Global, it wasn't a STEAM mod, but SMS Leviathon who did this   http://s13.postimg.org/bydqbih87/p_CMr_Wii_JPG.jpg   Now since this is specifically a friend of mine I was speaking to, hence the sledging, I don't see how any of the reasons apply to why I was banned, particularly since I had already deleted the comment myself  This ISN'T about me being banned, this is about how SMS employees treat their customers, ergo my review  Unfortunate as it is, but I doubt many people 2nd time round will invest in pC2, given that we were promised a DX12 upgrade, looks like that's not coming either...
9328	Unfinished, even at patch 1.4. The amount of game breaking bugs, unfinished features, poor ai, crap multi player and even worse AI make this game nothing more than a graphical showcase. The developers have time to release paid DLC and work on features like advanced RAIN - fecking RAIN, rather than fix the broken game. STEER CLEAR if you want to enjoy racing - there are plenty to choose from on the PC.
9329	I have held competition licenses for many years now, and I can tell you that this is so far off from a sim that it is laughable. Most reviews of this game come from people playing a controller. In it's own right I understand that not everyone will have a high end racing wheel to use. However, any real sim should be tested and reviewed at minimum with a controller and a wheel.  First things first, I am not some crazy over the top fanboy. This game looks great. The interface is smooth, and has a very nice layout. The graphics put it in a league of its own. There are lots of little things that this game gets right that a lot of other racing games and sims alike seem to really muck up. This is one of the first games that I have played that did not immediately lock up the rear wheels when pulling the hand brake. On the subject of Brakes, this has a loose idea of something called Brake fade. The hotter the rotors get, the more distance the car will need to stop or slow down. The engine temp will rise and fall depending on ambient temperature, Driving style, clean air V.S. Drafting. It has a lot of small things done very well. It is one of the few where you can toggle the lights and see the effect on the environment. The different camera angles are spot on. There are true elements the devs wanted this game to be a sim.  I want to like Project CARS. I really do, but I can't. This is not a sim. It is a game. Had it been marketed more as a game I would have loved it. In fact in early development it was. It changed rather abruptly near launch however. It became the 'Ultimate Driver Journey' and 'For Racers by Racers.' None of the actual racers I know whether it is SCCA cone chasers or Rally America drivers had many things that we said put into this game. The end product actually turned out to be something some of us downright hated. The physics are buggy, sometimes you fall through the track, sometimes the car has more grip than it would on rails, other times it is like driving on ice. Collisions are far from sim level. You might be asking, ' Isn't the point of a sim not to crash?' Absolutely, however mistakes happen on the track. It is a reality of the sport that drivers have to accept every time tires touch the track. This game has nearly no consequences for mistakes large or small. Hit a rumble strip too hard, nothing will happen. Bump a player or AI. Mild scratches. Really hit them, body damage and mild alignment failure. It seems really upsetting that games or sims in this genre really seem to ignore player punishment. The odd thing of it all is that is what players want. We want the aggravated feeling of throwing away the whole race over a miscalculation leading us to rip an oil pan off and blow an engine; Or the feeling of unspeakable pride when we finally master a track.   I know that there are going to be bugs in a game like this. I am sure things like that lack of Force Feedback, or awkward dead-zones will eventually be fixed. There isn't a game out there that is trying to achieve this level of detail that wont have a few things to work out. I understand that, but there was so much potential that was just thrown away. It was like a sim that didn't know it wanted to be a sim. Driving feels disconnected and not very authentic.   Project CARS is a good game, but just that. If you are a hard core racing sim seeker I would go into this game with the idea that it is not a sim. It is a fun and somewhat challenging racing game, but it will not meet all of your needs as a hardcore driving sim fan. In total I will give Project CARS a 77/100. The beautiful graphics and amazing attention to detail make this game stand out, but I can not forgive the vague sense of driving or the important bits that Slightly Mad Studios Gave up on. With that I can not recommend this Sim as a sim. It gets an 'Eh maybe' as a game.
9330	Have an AMD card? Then you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! The devs are in bed with nvidia, and have screwed over player with non-nvidia cards. SMS has downgraded AMD performance.  (Also, force feedback seems to be also sub-par, or do my memories trick me in that regard?)  Exhibit a: all tracks are awash with nvidia ads. Either SMS have an idiotic sense of finances and were duped into including nvidia ads in their game for free, or they are lying through their teeth. As their successful financing of the game hints at good sense of money, I'm sorry to say the latter one is the more sensible of the two options. (Or they are rabid nvidia fanboys who plaster everything with nvidia logos. Which would be even worse.)  Exhibit b: while a couple hundred builds back, AMD cards were working fine, now surprisingly they are simply not utilized. GPU usage is far from 100%, with the same driver as before. This is from October of 2014, build 829:  http://i.imgur.com/867VGbX.png  And this is from now, build 1000+:  http://i.imgur.com/Fcm4FSO.png  The difference is that the first lets you go mostly ultra on a 290X, while with the second, you can't even use high settings for the same framerates.
9331	As a simracer I've been waiting for this game for a long time. When I plugged in my T500RS and did my first laps I was like: Wow, Need for Speed Underground is back? The force feedback gives you zero feel for the cars. It feels like playing Ship 'Simulator'. Don't get me wrong, this game will make a good 3rd person console gamepad title but srsly... not a sim.  I'm NÃ¼rburgring Touristenfahrer and drive the ring about 4 laps a month. There are sims which simulate driving the ring pretty good on an accurate layout but not this one. Everything just feels totally wrong.  Sadly I can't review the graphics because I'm only using an AMD R9 card and we all now that this game runs good only on nvidia cards.  I had high hopes on this game because of all those Fanboys (that will dislike this review of course as you can see on every negative review here) around hyping it so much.  Long story short.. You want a 3rd person console gamepad racer? Buy it. You want a Simulator? Don't buy it. 
9332	UPDATE 5/6/2016 I find it amazing that people somehow focus on only 1 of the 25 points I made in the review and assume I hate this game merely because it's not on Wii U. Moved original review UP for people who can't read.  Having over 100 hours in this game now. In many parts it feels good, but there are many things that are constantly annoying, and after I think 7 patches so far the problems are still there.  Pros I can think of:   Look better than most other sims, day/night transition and weather look good   A career mode which keeps you busy   A decent number of players online   Many cars are good to drive and makes more sense than most arcade titles   Problems I can think of:   Twtichy graphics. Flickering textures here and there no matter what settings I use. Reflections and special effects often look fake.   Despite most people's praise, the game looks bad in many aspects, such as night. It looks way worse than say the new NFS. Also you can try driving behind a Mustang at night with you head light turns on. The Mustang's rear will look really bad. Same with many other cars. In addition, Azure coast and California highway don't look quite good as those screenshots.   You need to turn track detail settings to high in order to see graffiti on Nordschleife, which means they don't regard graffiti as reference points but as decoration.   In-car camera way too dark. Feels very unrealistic. It looks like you have window tint on your windscreen.   Online lobby is usually a big mess. Much bigger than sims that more heavily depends on dedicated server. Everybody makes a lobby with car/track they like, and many don't make much sense such as 5 lap race with mandatory pitstop, Formula A cars having track day with slow road cars, etc. There are lots of wreckers too.   Many cars feel stiff, and their behavior sometimes doesn't make sense.   AI is bad, they either can't drive themselves, or like to ram players, or are too pacifist and don't give chanllenge, depending on car classes they use. AI is particularly bad in Karts.   They aren't affected by weather as much as players do, which is unfair and frustrating.   Rolling start is broken. It often guarantees the 2nd place player gets to 1st when green, and there are a lot more bugs related to rolling start, which havn't been resolved since launch.   Race start sequence is fixed. The timing from the last red to green is always the same.   Track-cut detection is broken. People can still gain lots of advantage cutting the track without getting any penalty.   Engine start is the most pathetic in all games that have this feature. Instant engine start with no sound at all.   FFB feels too much spring, and the community relies on JackSpade guy's hard work to make FFB work, which should be the devs' job in the first place.   Community events/Time trial leaderboards have problems. Record on Hockenheim GP is an SLS GT3 in less than 25 seconds. I bet it's faster than a jet fighter.   Calendar in the career mode is poorly thought out. 24h Le Mans seems always in mid December which doesn't make sense. You can have multiple events on the same day at opposite side of the planet and feels very unrealistic.   UI is made worse and worse. After the new update the option button and shutdown button on the top right corner are almost invisible. What were they thinking?   No proper triple monitor support (graphics are stretched to side screens and UI is not designed to work best with 3 monitors), and the telemetry HUD is unusable on triple monitor, while other features kind of work on triple screen. This means when they first design the game, they never even think about triple screen setup, which is ridiculous since it's aiming at the sim racing community.   There is no way to change any option at all when racing. You can't even adjust game's sound volume. To get a nice FOV or to find the best video settings, you have to go into and out of races back and forth constantly, and there is no automatic visual settings. There is also no way to check you button binding when you are in race.   Many problems with physics. Rain is unrealistic. Contact between cars is broken (cars that make contact with stick to each other).   As a Wii U owner, the developers' attitude towards the promised and then abandoned Wii U version and Nintendo supporters is ridiculous.   DLCs, especially the Japanese car DLC, feel like lazy work and cash grab.   It's a nice game but loaded with problems. I think a 'Postive' rating should best describe how it is.    You don't have to read the updates below at all. ============================================================== UPDATE 3/27/2016 Repsonse to that daddy do it right guy with a reply regarding the Wii U stuff. I assume this guy is a PCars fan, and I dislike his attitude towards my negative take on PCars Wii U release cancellation. 1. Far back in 2012 SMS has confirmed a Wii U release. The Wii U logo appeared on their website, along with Steam OS version announced and confirmed. They did get a lot of funding from Wii U owners and supporters from their crowd funding campaign. 2. Since the annoucement of PCars, SMS had been constantly asked about the Wii U's capability of handling such a racing sim as PCars, and SMS had been constantly saying PCars will come to Wii U. You can still access the presentation slides here:  http://www.wmdportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/WMD_Overview_160212.pdf  They talk about utilizing Wii U's unique controls quite a bit. 3. For people who don't own or like Wii U and believe I (along with many other Wii U owners) am 'gullible', check that slide and see on page 22 how many promised features and aspects are left out from the game or are made into paid DLCs to milk gamers. You can even find videos of Indianapolis track from early builds of the game, but the official release left this out for no good reason. 4. I'll list some quotes from SMS regarding the Wii U version of PCars, check what they said: Jan 7, 2014.  http://gamingbolt.com/project-cars-will-showcase-the-hidden-power-of-the-wii-u-slightly-mad-studios  Sep 5, 2014.  http://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-cars-wii-u-delay-theres-no-conspiracy-dev-/1100-6422143/  5. Even without a Wii U release, the PC version and console versions are full of bugs and issues. I personally will no longer support this developer. Me being gullible? No. It's this developer's attitude and expertise being far below my guess, and many others'.   UPDATE 2/6/2016 Reply to the 'if you don't want it just refund it' comment: To begin with I pre-ordered this game because I wanted to support them bring the first ever racing sim to WiiU (but then they dropped it which is disappointing), and back then there was no such thing as Steam refund.  Besides, current refund policy requires game time less than 2 hours, which in most cases will not do a fair review for racing sims. Most racing sims even need more than 2 hours to set up your controller and FOV correct. I have over 100 hours into PCars now, and I'm confident that my negative review on PCars much more fair and unbiased than other people's negative review, who only spend less than 2 hours in the game. Yes PCars for me should be more than 5/10, but due to the polarity of how Steam review works, if I'm asked 'Do you recommend PCars to people who wants a racing sim' my answer would probably be no, hence my negative review.  Also I just lost my about 80 hours career save when I change my hard drive. It seems that the save file is local and not cloud backed-up. Be careful when you reinstall the game.
9333	Im disappointed. Bought it during sale because it looked good and thought it would act like a really good car game but sadly there are too many down sides to warrant it being such a high price and released game.  Tires blow up after pit stopping which is mandatory but can be fixed by changing settigns which is a pest. AI cheats and takes pit stop on last lap meaning they get 22 seconds ahead of you and steal an unfair win. AI dont respect your car and they will not move from race line and this causes them to hit you and push you off. Penalties dont apply to AI but they do to you so if your pushed off by them they get away free but you penalised.  Overall its a good game but really needs bug fixing instead of bring out more fancy cars.
9334	After playing this game/sim in beta stages on a g25 and quite enjoying it, I thought it was an easy decision to buy the retail game.  Initially I was impressed by the visuals and dynamic weather and time. My wheel had died in the interim and I was playing on a 360 controller.  I got bored with the game after a few weeks and the controller was really ruining the experience for me. I left it for a month or so while I decided on a wheel purchase.  Fast forward a month or two, I had ordered a Fanatec CSW V2 as I didn't have the money for the Accuforce and wasn't aware of the OSW (which I would have definitely gone with had I known).  Fired up pcars in excitement. Turned a few laps. Felt rubbish. Worse than beta with g25. Tried changing settings. Still lacklustre. Tried the Jack Spade FFB tweaks, much better. Started an AI race offline. AI sideswipe me on first lap while passing on the straight. Try again. Same result. AI either has no spatial awareness or a death wish.  It may just be that the novelty of all the pretty shiny effects has worn off, but I feel as though this game has maybe gotten worse since release.   Version 3.0 FFS and the AI is borderline â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the control system and FFB seems to be continually skewing towards control pad users (why when it supposed to be a 'Sim' I'll never know).  Dissappointed in this game. It had so much potential. As much as people bag out AC for â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics, at least I can run a race in that without the AI ramming me like a prepubescent teen raging in gran turismo when they get passed.
9335	If you have an AMD card, stay away.  This game does not work well with AMD cards.  For now it's not recommended.   Edit:  This is my spec.  Windows 8.1 Intel i7 3770k quad core CPU (8 logical with HT), clocked at 4.2GHz. 16GB RAM AMD R9 295X2 (2x8GB) GPU SSD 256 GB Storage.  I've heard AMD are working on it together with the developer of the game, so hopefully it will be fixed soon. Also, not everyone with AMD cards seem to be having problems, looks like it could be the higher-end-cards, like 290 290x, 295x.  I'm using the 15.4 AMD driver. I also disabled one of the 290x's in my setup, still not working well. So, it's not only an SLI problem. Check the forums, and benchmarks, at least some AMD cards are not doing well with this game so far.  I tried disabling Hyper-threading and that actually helps, but it does not solve the performance issue.
9336	The disappointment of the last decade for me! project Cars was meant to be the ultimate simulation. The physics of rFactor2, the laserscanned Tracks of iRacing plus their great online community and partly realistic graphics. First apart from the graphics they reached none of their goals. They said real racing drivers helped them to develop the physics but i, as a guy who has driven a formula renault 2.0 car, can say that it is sh*t, so are the tracks the lack of details such as missing curbs or bumps that are actually implemented in iRacing is huge. Another point is the AI well if they actually survive the first turn and you have a nice little battle with them they will divebomb and ramm you of the track at the first possibility. Do not judge me wrong i love it if the AI races hard but they have to be fair like in f1 2015. so i decided to do time trial but then again i realised that the physics are sh*t, the cars have way too much grip and are way too forgiving. For example you can brake almost 50 mtr. later than in real life but you just lock up and understeer of the racing line if you turn in but you do not spin and still get a decent line to overtake. So i think this game is even worse than the good old shift 2 in my opinion because we are 7 years on now and the Handling has not improved in the slightest only the graphics are good
9337	This is my OWN EXPERIENCE with the game, good for you if the game is perfect to your standards.  One word to describe this game: Frustrating  Frustrating when you find out this game has a terrible progression system, specially because the same devs did Shift 2 that actually had a great progression system with credits and car tuning and customization. Frustrating when you are in the last lap and something goes wrong because of the game and its bugs. Frustrating that every bad thing that happens to you never feels that it was your fault, other 'simulators' transmit this feeling way better and makes you improve, PCARS just makes your Rage meter go up. Frustrating when you need to research how to make the Force Feedback Wheel feel good tweaking the very complicated and confusing settings in EVERY car because the default FFB is terrible and you can't feel what the car is doing. Frustrating when they broke promises of features and starts ANOTHER crowdfunding caimpaing for PCARS 2 just a few weeks after the PCARS 1 release riddle with bugs. Frustrating to feel that the physics don't improve with new updates. Frustrating when you feel that there is something wrong with how aerodynamics works in this game. And frustrating because there is a 'Game of the Year Edition' now, indication that they probably will drop further improvements to the game.  I put hours and hours into the game hoping for this game to get a proper polish but enough.  Bought into the hype, the hype let me down hard, you gotta give them credits, they know how to do marketing for this mediocre example of self-proclamed 'racing simulator' game which is not.  The only thing that could make this game good is the addition of a progress/customization system like in Shift 2 because besides the graphics, everything else it is just mediocre at best.
9338	Handling, physics and force feedback is not as good as Assetto Corsa. Game runs terrible on every AMD card. Framerate goes to â¥â¥â¥â¥ when a lot of smoke is generated, using AMD cards, because of the heavy Gamework title. It's fun, but its not the king of all racing sims.
9339	If they fix the ai... this game would be a lot of fun, but it is just too frustrating to race them. They have, for me, qualified 30 seconds faster than what should be possible with the car/track combination. Half the field (even ai) qualify with 1:30, while 10 or so cars are qualifying 1:02-1:01 at Outlon with the formula C car... Then when you try to race them it is just awful. They don't react to the terrain (such as gravel, which is like glue to you, the player, but the ai seem unaffected), they follow their terrible racing line whether you're trying to pass or not, they smash into you constantly, and they sometimes fly off the road at full speed into a chicane or hairpin (even on 100%). I'm not the fastest and 100% ai is pretty easy to beat on most car/track combinations. If the driving was amazing I might even look past it (I do for AC's ai woes) but the driving is pretty meh. Honestly, wait for a few patches and see where it's at. Stock Car Extreme is a far superior product, or even AC.
9340	Sad. They bring out a nice looking game that have alot of potential, but the game isn't finished and they already talking about project cars 2. And again dlc that cost money when the game is in my eyes half finished for the price we payed. Sorry to the developers for the thumbs down but its time the communty stand up to this.
9341	Unfortunatly I can't recomend this title to anyone even at a low price. At the moment the game has way to many bugs, patches have created more. Updates will eventually fix this game but how long this will take is anyones guess. Only fit to be called early access.  Multiplayer is almost unplayable with bugs like invisilbe cars to crash into. Penalties for jump starts when no jump start commited. No systems in place to reward or penalise drivers. Most of the time you are taken out by either a really bad driver or someone who just wants to crash and bash.  Project Cars forums is also very little help as developers and backers don't like critasism and seem to shout down bug reports and complaints (Disapointing)  Hopefully in the future this game will work as advertised. 
9342	Where to start with this game. Lets start with the maps. They are great! great detail and accurate to the minor details. The cars. Pretty damn good! They need to add some more packs soon so that there will be a more diverse car selection for you to choose from. The online. Pretty bad, need to sort out the de-sync issues ASAP and it's typicaly full of foreign kids screaming at you for cutting them up. Joining servers is a pain in the *** and sometimes leaving the pit lane in qualifying is a double pain in the ***. Now then, the physics... ABSOLUTE ****. If you love pushing through the pack of cars to get to second place and then just exposing a tiny tiny tiny amount of you wheel onto the grass and getting flung around and around, then this will be Â£30 well spent. The countless amount of times that i've battled to get 2nd and even 1st and then be thrown to last place because of shoddy physics which bug out when you tap grass is unbelievable... You get stuck to cars when they come into contact with you, you can randomly spin out on a straight and if you dont have a rig thats above good then you will experience some lovely low frames and mysterious slow motion effects when you frames drop.   All in all, unless you have a decent rig and a great tolerance to bugs and shoddy physics then i would wait untill they patch this game up with more than duct tape and a glue stick.
9343	The game sure is pretty - but for everything that you see in the menus, it's really just a fancy overlay on really basic races. No car customization, nothing to do in career mode except click to the next race, deep track list, but most (all?) not laser scanned which contributes to the lack of feel while driving.  I thought I would buy Assetto Corsa as a holdover to this game, but it wasn't worth the wait. Assetto Corsa doesn't pretend to be all of the things that PCars says it is... but at least it delivers on the racing simulation.
9344	For all the hype, you'll be let down. It's a good looking arcade game, not sim. Bugs me that this game is so lacking in content, yet they're already talking about a project cars 2. Well congrats slightly mad studios, you got 60 bucks from me once, you wont be getting it again.
9345	Even if you set steering deadzone to 0, the game enforces a deadzone and a minimum steering angle that suddenly appears, making precise small corrections impossible
9346	I want to like this game. I do like it, mostly. The proble is that the controls don't feel realistic at all. Not even close. Even after pouring a good chunk of time into changing every concievable aspect most cars come off feeling like you are driving either a heavy truck or like you're driving on ice. This game is totally unfinished and feels like a beta release. the graphics are 7/10. The driving physics are hit and miss but not even close for something claiming to be a sim, so 5/10. The AI is garbage and on rails. I'm not great, by any means, but I know smart AI drivers when I see them and this ain't it. I bought this thinking there might be some support for it but it turns out they are already looking to PCars 2. Ah well. I'd say it's worth $15, not the $30 I spent. Even on sale, this game feels like it's asking too much. I appreciate the attempt, but the excecution falls WAY short of what is now industry standard. I'm not new to driving sims or arcades titles and this is neither one.  Edit: Something else to mention is the disappointing lack of customization and small car roster. VERY small overall roster of vehicle brands given the deep field of vehicle brands in the racing community.
9347	Game looks great, graphics are top notch - however, the gameplay, AI is terrible. Worst of all, cars feel like they are driving on ice and you have to change the steering settings far too often. Its much harder to drive a car around a corner than it is in real life..and the excuse of 'its a fast race car' actually cannot justify the slippery steering and inconsistent tyre movements of the car handling in the game. Career mode is really boring, and online play is lacking, it takes too long to find a good room. No option of automatic race/join.
9348	Played for an hour and refunded it. Gonna stick with Assetto Corsa.
9349	Edit: One year later, online is still woefully underdeveloped and the AI is no better. Poor effort, SMS.  I've had a roller-coaster of a journey with this game, and it can be brilliant when it works. Right now, the terrible AI and MP issues are destroying the experience for me.   Wait a few weeks for SMS to iron issues out. It's not worth Â£40 in its current state.
9350	If I ever make a let-down list, this game will be close to the top of it. I followed it's progress in the few months leading up to release and thought 'Wow, this game looks amazing. AND it's a racing sim. Perfect!'  What I got (in my humble opinion) was neither amazing, nor a racing sim. Or perfect, for that matter.  I started my first career with the first tier of karts, which I quickly learned was a huge mistake. The physics and handling models applied to them were so atrocious that I wanted to vomit. Not from motion-sickness or anyting, but because they were so bad. Yes, 125cc karts are lightweight and hug the road, but the handling was just way too unresponsive and twitchy with an xbox360 controller.  After forcing myself to finish a season of the karts career, I decided to try one of the events in which I get to drive a proper road car. During qualifying, it started to rain heavily after about 2 laps and I had posted the 2nd fastest time while the track was still dry. After pitting and getting 'wet' tires put on my car, I noticed that the AI were consistently crushing my posted lap time even with racing slicks in a torrential downpour, sending me back to 13th place. Now, I'm no expert on tire physics, but I've seen enough F1 races to know you can't drive soft-compund racing slicks in the rain and expect to have the slightest bit of grip. I thought unfair AI advantages were something of old arcade racers like NFS and not new racing 'sims'? The handling was better with the cars but still not what i would call simulation-like.  I cannot comment on the supposedly beautiful graphics because I'm running 2+ year-old laptop hardware, (Intel i7 @ 2.4ghz, 3.2ghz with turbo and NV GTX 765m graphics) but I would get sudden drops in FPS from 60 to about 45 that would last a few seconds while running medium-ish settings.  The game does, however, have a large selection of tracks and a nice selection of cars from what i saw. A little more variety in some of the car classes would have been nice, though, like the open wheels.  I was excited to pick this up on sale, but now I'm excited to hear back about a refund.  UPDATE: Less than 2 days after requesting a refund, my request was approved even though I have well over 2 hours spent on the game.   If you like your racing 'sims' with a side of twitchy, unresponsive, and inconsistent handling with terrible AI, then by all means, go for it. But if I were you, I'd wait this game out and see if they patch some of the issues that I've seen.
9351	When this game will be finished?   I try really hard to like this game but...  UPDATING REVIEW 05/03/2016 More DLCs. Same Bugs. Poor Car setup system where you can't save more than one setup by car. Poor options system where you need back to main menu just to change minimal settings, you can't even setting controll map in a session. Medium physics even for a SimCade game. Disappointment.  Really not recommended game.     UPDATING REVIEW 30/11/2015  My god, more dlc and the game still broken! Unfinished. But wait, i see they are busy developing more dlcs and Project Cars 2 for more money.
9352	A pretty game that is absolutely unfinished. Glitch after glitch after glitch. I don't even know if the AI lap times are real anymore. Sometimes coming into the pits to tune your car during practice ends in AI cars having turned laps 16 seconds faster than you! Game is not finished. Stay away!
9353	While there is no doubt that Project CARS is a more than solid Car Simulator, in terms of Features that make up a game, I was missing some key components. Most noticeably, the career mode feels like a placeholder until you find the time to make something that is fun with meaningful progress. I guess they never found the time.
9354	In this simcade racing game you spend less time battling the AI and track and more time battling bugs. Wanna play a realistic career? Damage is bugged. Wanna do an endurance race? Every single car will blow it's tires and be parked in the dirt by lap 8. Wanna listen to your crew chief? He'll tell you it's raining heavy when it's clear as day. Wanna watch a replay with dynamic weather and time? Car lights and damage are bugged (and you can't watch the replay from the perspective of other cars). Like fancy particle effects? Bugged. Wanna race clean in a packed field? Sorry, you're a target and the other cars are missiles. Need to hear your tires to know exactly what's happening with your car? Tire volume is so low you can barely hear them.  This game actually does a LOT right. The on track car count is out of this world, the graphics are great, it's well optimized on Nvidia cards (I've heard nightmares about AMD cards though), it has more options and tweakability than any racing game I've played. But it gets so many things wrong I just can't recommend it right now.  It's worth noting that similar to the Elder Scrolls games I'm having a TON of fun with the game when I'm able to look past the glaring issues. But too many of the issues really ruin the experience for me.  [EDIT] I've been wanting to change this review to a thumbs up but since writing it two patches have come out and not only have none of my issues been fixed but I've discovered several repeatable bugs. One of which allows you to shift into first and drive off before the race has started leaving the pack in the dust. When such simple things like not being able to start driving before a race don't work the game is just not ready to be called 'released'.
9355	6.8/10  Pros: -Race cars that arent home made or modded intot he game! -Tracks that let you go vroom vroom -Its pretty as all can be  Cons: -The game has a mind of its own on whether it is going to work properly or not (in game) -Pits sometimes work in some ways. This has been 90% fixed with the lastest patches -Cut content and broken promises. The devs of this game made GTR2 and then split to form two seperate dev teams. One team when on to make Race07 and its dlc and kept it very very true to the format of GTR (it doesnt hold your hand, you have to do everything, drive out the garage, hit your speed limiter, drive a safe pace lap yourself, cautions both full and partial, and open for modding)   My honest review of the game is that it is a half baked remake of race07/gtr2. Half baked int he sense that they ditched the SIMULATION aspects for the... pretty graphics? You cant even cut down a tire in this game. My honest suggestion is that if you want a hardcore racing sim get the race07 game and all its dlc, it goes on sale often for super cheap. You will get liscenced race cars from all over teh world and tracks as well. And when you want more content just get some mods and be on your merry way in anything you could imagine (ALMS, BlanPain, Le Mans, Rally, ETC)  This review doesnt even begin to go into detail on the things that i have bared witness to on their forums... That is a fiasco showing that Mr. Ian Bell is by no means a man i want to give money to based on his mouth and way of cunducting business.   I however, have already paid 30$ for this and so i aim to get my moneys worth out of it and struggle through it hoping it gets better with age and time. I ONLY reccomend getting this game if it is on sale for 25$(USD) or less. It is a '40$ brand new' title that you see many mid grade developers doing these days. i sincerely hope this game grows on me a bit more though. It has potential in about 5 years when the game's files get torn apart and modded because boy howdy being this pretty.... well the mods that will come in time will be marvelous. Shame that the team didnt allow that from the get go, but they have DLC to sell and well, the way they 'voted' on whether it was to be allowed or not was reminisent of the old '3/5th compromise' as not all votes are equal over there.
9356	DONT BUY, soooo many bugs, i get random lag spikes. it changed my settings randomly so now i have acceleration lag and steering lag (it doesnt accelerate when i push the button immediatly, or does it steer correctly.  waste of 50â¬ for a game they allready are making a sequal for???
9357	 http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/367qav/mark_my_word_if_we_dont_stop_the_nvidia_gameworks/ 
9358	The A.I. is honestly some of the worst A.I. I've ever seen. All A.I. cheats in these racing games, they have to or you would crush them. The way this game is though, it is 1990's bad. Here is a list of the things the A.I. can and does do.  1. Ram you because they brake later.  2. Brake later because physics are not applied evenly.  3. When they do ram you, they are a brick and you are a bouncy ball (see evenly applied physics).  4. Go off the track and accelerate past you because the grass doesn't effect them at all.  5. Drive in the rain on slicks.  6. Drive faster than is allowed by the rolling start rules. You will literally start slower than they do, so they immediately pass you.  7. Take turns faster than you possibly can, they have the grip of the gods, see evenly applied physics.  Honestly this game's A.I. is so horrendously bad I think GT2's was better in the 90's. It's like they cut and pasted this right out of a need for speed game. Save your money, I wish I could get mine back. I would much rather be playing Gran Turismo even though its sound quality is awful. I wish so much that I could get my money back.
9359	Pros:   It is a racing game, And it runs relatively well on a razer blade while using an Xbox controller in a different state from your main computer.  Cons: It was sold as a genre redefining racing simulation using the community to help with creating all of our wildest dreams. Instead we get a half-baked buggy representation of racing (after 6 patches the Career karting will STILL occasionally not count the first lap you take), on top of poorly done physics, and in general just... It's gross.  Do yourself a favor and at least get rFactor 1. If not, rFactor 2, assetto corsa, even R3E would be better.   I'm partial to IRacing myself, but would still rather people buy any of those other games. (Also they have pretty cool devs.)
9360	Not finshed game yet.  Multiplayer with bad peer to peer games. Which leads to a lot of synchronizing issues. Not able to drive issue in a lot of cases. Wrong player list. Lap counter gets updated late in some cases etc.  Beside of all the multiplayer issues there are great graphics and a fine music. Cockpits look very great. Handling is ok, not very much a sim, its some kind of half sim, but could be fun at least if they fix the multiplayer and deliver the dedicated servers.  Only one setup is saveable per car and track which is ridiculous if you want to go online racing leagues in future. You cant save a qualy setup and a race setup for different lap races. But i think they will fix this in the future.  Tyre temp graphic is wrong in some cars.  Server browser is very bad. You cant order by anything. Filter is only for car class, not for exact cars. You cant see where the host is from. you cannot see the server settings in the server browser. How many laps for example, only short and long. No ping times etc. Very very bad.  So verdict:  I would not recommend this game at the moment if you look for a great racing experience in multiplayer. For me it is a dissapointment right now, but there is some hope it gets better with the upcoming patches. If refund would be possible, i would do it and maybe look again in some month. If you are more the singleplayer gamer, it is quite fun right now.
9361	Game is very buggy and unsupported. My game save stopped working after 10 hours of progress. All SMS cares about is money. The email addres on their homepage does not work. And I got banned from the forums for discussing issues.
9362	You can see up there that I have put 8.4 hours into Project Cars. What that doesn't tell you is that all this time (not to mention my 19 posts in the game forum) was spent tweaking parameters and tryng to make the game minimally functional. So far I have been unsuccessful. I have never - never! - joined a single race or even spent a few minutes of practice on the track.  Yes, it's a nice game, with beautiful graphics, and it has lots of potential. But, despite the hype, it is far from finished, the interface is quite clumsy and the force feedback issues make it unplayable. If you doubt me, visit the official forum. You will find literally hundreds of pages (one single thread about FFB issues has 141 pages and counting) with people trying to make sense of its obscure FFB parameters and discussing how to make the game work for them. The developers seem to be as bewildered as the users and are of little help, when not outright rude.   Project Cars has been launched some two months ago and is already patched to version 1.4, but most problems remain unsolved. Since I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe software products should be sold only when they are fairly functional, instead of being sent out on the world to have their problems sorted out by their buyers (granted, some people actually seem to enjoy that), I give Project Cars a 3/10 at best. I may review my opinion later on when these problems are fixed, but right now, if you want a racing sim that actually works, go for Assetto Corsa.  UPDATE: Now I have 13.7 hours into the game. This accounts for a whole afternoon spent trying to make FFB work. I still haven't driven a single lap.  UPDATE 2: Patch 2.0 is out, supposedly to fix FFB problems among other things. Now I have 14.4 hours in the game. The difference was the time I spent lauching PCars, finding my pilot floating 5 meters above the ground, verifying it was still unplayable with my wheel (in fact, it got worse) and closing it in frustration. I also have 34 posts in the forum without a single helpful or informative reply from the devs (contrarily to other users, who are trying very earnestly to help each other play the game). I asked Steam for a refund and I am waiting for their reply.
9363	AMD card owners stay away.
9364	I am very disappointed with the audio problems. They kill the joy. I won't be playing until it is fixed.
9365	Did I really just pay full price for this buggy alpha game? Bloody hell it's s promising and the racing is so good, but the oculus support is a joke, wheel support is a joke. I'm talking silly things like:   You spent 5 minutes selecting and calibrating your wheel. Save all of your settings, bu then when you leave and start the game over again, all settings are lost.. COME ON!  Oculus is supported, but in extended mode only, no oculus compatible menus, which means just a REALLLY awkward experience startig the race on my PC monitor and then dragging it over to the oculus display, then having to constantly recenter my oculus view (which woops, the key is now unbound becaus eit didnt save your settings!).  Also, once in a race, there is no way to access any graphics options, so when a certain option slows down your rig, or is buggy in the oculus, its a pain staking process of exiting the race, toggling 1 setting, starting a race, then exiting again, etc, etc.. COME ON!  for years in development, it's very disapointing that obvious stuff like this was missed or just not cared about.
9366	This game tries to capture the feeling of actual grand prix racing, but ultimately fails. My biggest issue with the game is the unrealistic physics. You get slides coming out of turns when you are clearly not under power, and you get AI that would rather plow right through you then actually make realistic decision. I would find it very hard to recommend this game to any racing or car enthusiast. Alas, my searce for a decent racing game continues...
9367	Initially it looks great. I can get a really good looking FOV in this game. The deeper you go, the more rough edges you run into. The menus and the way they work are a pain, often making things difficult to find, especially deeper options. I always load up this game for a few runs, but in the end something always turns me off and I head back to my other sim racers (Raceroom and Assetto Corsa), which are more focused and refined in their bases, and just offer what feels like a more realistic driving experience. Impressive at first and a good effort, but just too many rough edges to keep me around. Perhaps tries to do or be too much instead of focusing on one area.
9368	Pros:  -Sick Graphics -Nice feel to each car  Cons - AI are complete and utter â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They have NO awareness of where you are. You'll be driving down a straight, and they'll be alongside and cut you up, ending your race as you hit the gravel. I barely play any races vs AI due to this. They just ram you off the road. every. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing. time  I mainly just drive around random tracks without the competitors..otherwise the rage is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing real.  So, if you're willing to restart a race 20 times each (due to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ai), then feel free to get this game
9369	This game constantly loses its settings. Everytime I play I have to setup my controllers. It's extremely frustrating.
9370	This game has so many things going for it that it pains me to say don't touch it if you intend to invest amy more than a few hours of your gaming life. Every driving game with intentions of hooking you and keeping you coming back for more will allow you to create and save multiple car setups for each car at each track. For any serious driver, continous tuning of setups for various weather conditions and tyre strategies for example, are basic requirements. Every racing game form Crammonds F1GP1 back in the early 90's to present day allows you this joy. But not Project Cars! You have some of the best real time weather effects ever seen. You have more setup parameters than any racing game I have seen. BUT, you cannot create and save multiple setups for each car at each track. Its crazy I know but the developers did not include this basic feature that every other developer considers a must. Despite requests to fix this game killing omission none of the many patches to date have addressed this issue. In fact the developers have simply ignored it and refuse to even discuss it on their own forum? Don't buy it.
9371	User of Radeon GPU? Don't buy this game unless the producer will make game optimations and unless optimized driver support for AMD users will be guaranteed! I use Intel I7 with R9 280x with absolutely unacceptable drop of qualtiy. You can play not better than medium details. This kills a lot of the atmosphere the game could have in ultra details... / please read the www before you buy this game. I have read about this problems too late.
9372	Search for issues and bugs before buying. It may not launch until you start it without Steam. It may stop working and throw errors, requiring a new 22 GB download to install again. There's not much support offered, if any.  It can feel nice as a racing sim though, and if you have nothing else and miss GT or Forza, it can be an unforgiving - but approachable replacement as long as you're not attached to car customization or selection. What it lacks in outright car selection in the road and touring classes, it makes up for in range of car classes, more like the Pro Race Driver series.  If you like big tracks like the Nordschleife... you better have lots of time because you can't start practice/hot lap with warm tires. So that's a good 15-20 minutes just to do a fair run, assuming your car's in mint condition on lap 2.  I can't recommend it for its serious rough spots and issues, but it can be a fun and gorgeous game if it actually runs for you.
9373	Initially, when the game came out, game was unplayable on day one for me and many others, my situation was computer locking out (freezing) each time i started a race and drove my car for 30 seconds. After a few attempts at trying to solve the situation, i decided to give up and put this game on the wait-list and try again months later.  Today (18th August), i decided to try this game again. To my surprise many of the issues i had before are now gone thankfully. Yet, game is still unplayable with random issues occuring from time to time. Did a free lap session as usual to try out the game, figured i would test the game once more for potential issues. First time worked fine, i drove a racecar for a while but i didn't costumize my controls (can't do this ingame), so i quit the free lap session, which ended up in a forced game crash out of nowhere.  Now, after messing with the options and controls for a few minutes. I decide to give it a go again, to my surprise (once more), my game glitches out everytime i get in race now. Screen turns dark, i can see the pre-race menu, can't do anything from there. Sound still works, game seems frozen so i'm forced to shut down the application manually.  I would give it another try later but i really lost interest in this glitched up mess of a game, i had hopes that the game would run fine now, after a few months of its release, but nope.  In other words, don't buy this game yet, it's not worth it. You will likely run into alot of glitches and bugs, if you want to play it that badly, be prepared for anything. I see alot of people complaining in the forums about random issues, you could just end up being one of those people if you so happen to buy this game and give it a try.  Now it's time to unistall this game and add it to the pile of games that will never see the light of day again. It's a sad thing really.  PS: At the rate they are fixing the game, buy it in a decade or so, perhaps then it will be running smooth with little to no issues.
9374	great game in itself but too many issues like FFB settings not saving so have to manually set FFB settings every single time i start the game considering you have to do this for every single car and track anyway only to get into race to be slammed off the track on first corner by idiots who can't figure out what the middle pedal is for. also still no way to kick trolls lurking on the track waiting to take you out.  also with latest patch more issues have arrived like random black screen, getting stuck in pits when race is about to start, also megas issue with steering wheel going dead on entering races. possibility to be a truly great game but nagging issues kill the game for me, .... but never mind plenty more DLC to buy and more to come which i will pass on.  now they announce Project cars 2 ... so looks like they use the business model of making a core game with many bugs and promised content / features missing, the idiots will buy it, make millions in profits and not bother fixing what they released in the first place.  RIP Project cars ... i'm going back to iracing.
9375	 Nice attempt, but needs work  This game is extremely beautiful. It honestly is probably the best looking game I've ever played. If graphics alone made a game worth playing, this game would be brilliant.  Unfortunately, this is about all the game is good for in it's current state. Vehicles respond 'poorly' if I were to be kind. The game was unplayable when I first launched it because of a glitch in the FFB. I currently can not use FFB at all or the game is unplayable. Online has absolutely zero penalty for smashing into other cars nor is there a way to counteract it.   If you were to purchase this game for photo mode or to watch the opening cutscene over and over, this would be a worthwhile purchase, but in it's current state it is BETA at best.  UPDATE 5.0 Version: I've been playing since the 1.x version of the game and the controls are STILL incredibly terrible. They've seemingly made no attempts to make it translate more accurately. The FFB issues are STILL present, and you have to use 3rd party mods to make work correctly. Avoid this game like the plague.
9376	PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING.   As mentioned by another reviewer, there is an enforced deadzone which cannot be removed, even though deadzone settings are set to '0'. I'm not sure whether this affects all wheels, however, it has made this game virtually unplayable in the admittedly very brief 30 minutes I have spent on it. Sadly, even when I overlook this huge issue which makes delicate steering corrections impossible, the cars feel strangely disconnected from my steering inputs, making them behave unpredictably and sadly much like RC cars, rather than than high performance cars they are advertised to simulate. This could be a personal problem, however, having spent far too much time throughout my life on racing games I can honestly say, this is a problem unique to this game. I also own Assetto Corsa, which seems to be Project Cars' main competitor and the cars in that game feel weighted and react accordingly, whereas this game offers absolutely no 'feel' for the cars whatsoever. Extremely disappointed!
9377	DO NOT BUY THIS RIGHT NOW. I have it and can not play it at all. There is an Error with the game something to do with overclocked GPUs where like for me I can not race. I can play in the menu all, but when I try to race I can only race for like 5-10 seconds for the game crashes with an error, and this happen for me all the time on SP and MP.  you can check the forums to see if it has been fixed.   http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?21981-Unhandled-Exception-Trapped-Unable-to-Play/page50   PLZ note that it is not the same on ever ones PC some people can race like 4-5 laps be for having an error  ------------- so would I recommend this game ---------- AS OF RIGHT NOW -- NO IF IT WAS FIXED -- YES
9378	I can't recommend this game right now. Maybe after a few patches but not right now. This game is FULL of game breaking bugs. This game could have used another delay and that would have been the smart thing for Slightly Mad Studios to do instead of rushing out this incredibly buggy game. So let me point out just a few bugs that I have been experiencing lately in Project CARS.   Can't play single player because my laps don't register so I can be racing until the end of time. When I finish a race in first place, the game will sometimes register it as last place. While racing and being in first place, the game will switch my position from 1st to last or any other position making me lose the race.   Playing online is the reason why I bought this game. Big mistake. This game is almost impossible to play online without experiencing bugs. I don't even know where to start. Lobbies are endless pits and sometimes can't start the race. Sometimes I'll be adjusting settings in the lobby and it will start the race while I'm still adjusting settings for the race. Hud display vanishes while racing, can't tell which position I'm in unless I use the cockpit view. Cars hop around the track constantly. Lets say the race is 4 players, the game will make me start at the end of the starting grid even though we are only 4 racers...I can go on forever with these bugs but I have better things to do like play Assetto Corsa.
9379	I like the game itself, but it is unbelievably frustrating that it looses your save game randomly. I've played it yesterday, turned off my PC, today started it again, loaded up the game, and it welcomed me as a new player. Save game file gone. I am not interested as much in the multiplayer part of the game, so career mode is what in it for me. But I can not enjoy it, because (for the second time) the game decided that my profile has to go. I mean come on. I wouldn't recommend it if you like playing single player, because it isn't worth it in this state.
9380	I will not recommend this game yet. It is obviously an open beta version.   The goal was:   Make the best racing game ever!    That was a complete failure! Why?   They started with a simulation and ended up with an arcade game. It not far away from games like forza. Real SimRacers who are used to RaceRoomExperience, Assetto Corsa, iRacing or rFactor can just smile about the physics. The tyre physics are completely surreal. If you are going over the slip angle and the car starts drifting you can just catch it in a split second. No overheating at all. Just a small mistake! Dfuq  The menu is crap. It doesnt work.  - Some options you take at the very beginnin cant be found again. - HUD changes are not saved.  - Replays are found behind the profile. - You cant see what session is running if you are not on the server and even then its pretty hard to figure out - you cant undo some changes like the car classes without closing and reopening the server  The sound is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Sry but even if you are not comparing it to r3e which is the game with the best racing sounds on the market atm. Its just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. To quite, to noisy, the formula cars are broken.  Replay function is broken. If someone left the race before it was finished the one is not at the replay. The complete replay hud is not working. Why should it? No Telemetrydata at the replay, you can only see yourself, its not even possible to have a free cam.   The presetups for the cars which should be an all functional standard setup. Are crap. They are made for the console guys with their controller. I can accept that. But the setups are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. They broke a lot of rules you never ever do. So some cars are literally undriveable untill you made some better settings.  BUT to be fair. The graphics are overhelming.  
9381	I got into the game. changed the graphics options aaaaaaaaaand what do you know the game dosnt even start anymore. finnaly got the game to work and looks like absolute crap. The worst engine sounds i have ever heard in a racing 'sim' games from ps2 have better sounds and mechanics than this game. My front brakes were at 1200 degrees celsius and still looking nice and shiny not even the slightest bit red games from ps2 had this feature. The engine sounds are like a mosquito in a blender. When i originaly seen this game on its website probably a year ago i seen so much potential in this game but no they screwed it up
9382	Utterly woeful game. The game has its own force feedback, which is all wrong- which means that cars can be uncontrollable at times and you cannot save a car from spinning- if you get in a spin you will hit something. The AI are rubbish and inconsistent- either slow or really fast but both times they smash you off the track, karts don't drive at all like karts do in the real world, the damage model is too sensitive and there are still too many bugs and glitches to call this game a simulator. The recent update has only made this worse, and the control settings are still idiotic.  Overall even GRID Autosport drives better than this game, best off saving your money for something else. This game is a huge disappointment- it has potential, but it seems to have been made quite badly.
9383	Doesn't even get 10 minutes of my time. TrackIR was support so I used TrackIR which gave me flying abilities (Not supported). Disabled trackIR and carried on as usual. Auto Drive driving me out of the pit crashed me into the wall, twice. And to change to neautral you have to change to first gear then to neutral.  I would list the pros but after 8 minutes of gameplay I was too disgusted to continue...
9384	Project Cars is a very average sim racing game. Assetto Corsa is miles a head in physics. Project cars doesn't even support triple screens fully like Assetto Corsa and iRacing. This game is way over hyped and is a big disapointment.   Anyway after some adjustments the game seems to be alot better, but its still not as good as iRacing imo.
9385	After +100h into career mode, all Gold accolades except for two, only 7 invitational events to unlock, the 4 longest endurance made and lots and lots of seasons the game suddenly crashes and deletes my profile. The game doesn't have Steam Cloud Sync (this game was released in 2015, absurd that it doesn't have cloud security) so I lost everything because the game wanted so.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ it and â¥â¥â¥â¥ SMS, this is the second time I buy a game from them and I receive utterly garbage (Shift 2 was the first but I thought EA had part of the fault).  Don't expect from SMS anything related to post-launch support, they will release the game and move into begging money for another one while saying that features promised for this game will be in the sequel.   BTW AI is too agressive, don't get affected by weather, tire wear, penaltys, etc. Shortcuts work bad, they said that it got improved, but feels exactly the same as in Shift 2. Guest in multiplayer are desynced so they can lose a race even if they win for 1s of advantage. Car categories are too limited, most of them with only one car, the game doesn't even have a log of which color pattern you like in your car and you need to select it each time you choose it. It's actually kinda funny since if you are in a multiplayer lobby and want to get your car you have to go to the full car list because the filter put by the host only works for a random pick. Community challenges are way too DLC-attached. There's an achievement (I know is optional but it works as an example) that needs you to play 20 community events, guess what? Without DLC you can't even access 10 per year.   TL;DR Don't buy this if you want gameplay, it's only good for the graphics.
9386	I bought my FIRST EVER racing wheel for this game. And I do not regret the choice ONE BIT. This game gets me sweating, cursing and screaming bloody murder as I cross the finish line. A wonderful game. Got my very first DLC, and now 'Project: CARS 2' has been announced. This game was brilliant, but I will not support the developers greed, or poor decision making with publisher choice.  EDITED AFTER PATCH 6.0: It is currently my favorate racing game, they have fixed many issues (took quite some time, and MANY MANY things are still buggy or broken. Chat boxes pit options and in general PITS) and it is very exciting to play when you can find or host a good group of fellow racers. The developer gets the thumbs down here. I am sure many more PAID DLC packs are coming on the path to Project Cars 2, which will feature many Pcars 1 assets and promises. Just like This game uses many from the 'Need For Speed Shift' series. Take it or leave it. I wish I had left it, but it can be brillant when its not asking for money, now or later.  $85 full price with all DLC, and they are THIS close to releasing the new game. Which of course will require all new DLC as well.  Leave it I say.  EDITED AFTER FORUMS VISIT: I am astounded by the snarky, and out right disrespectful comments the devolpment team has for critics. I would like the lead developer to leave his 'This is us, not supporting Pcars1 people' patch comments on Steam. I'm sure the team won't. Here on STEAM they cannot ban or berate at will (Not currently, or ever was a member of the forums)  EDIT AFTER PATCH 7.0:  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! More bugs, no pit crews, we are seven months later here and they are trying to release another game while this is still very broken. Development team now telling users it is THEIR fault (Told not to run extended races, certain tires, wait for pit to work correctly, not to run timed races, avoid interior views during racing at sunrise or sunset...Wait WHAT?!) More disappointments.
9387	I have played over 20 racing simulation games over the years but no one was so frustratingly unplayable. It is supposed to be hard so it will be realistic but they went too far. I have played F1 games with no assists and eventually I managed to get used to the controls but with Project Cars I have just given up.
9388	Doesn't work with xbox controllers and what i hear any controller. example of one issue:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb2Xy8ykiac  The sensitivity settings are also completely ruined for controllers, many report the only solution is to buy a steering wheel, coincedentally game has alot advertising for thrustmuster, logitech etc(wheel manufacturers) on the spalsh screen. Some have even reported fiddling with the setting for hours to find one they like and then the settings being having completely different effects after a patch. 1/10 For a game i can't play with a controller it has nice graphics.  P.S. The mount panorama bathurst track sidelines and backgrounds are pretty incorrect.
9389	It's like if Goat Simulator was a racing sim. I cannot advise any stronger that people stay away from it, and don't even consider touching it with a barge pole.  - Cars can be launched into the sky for no clear reason - Half the car can begin to levitate, and driving becomes impossible until this ghostly influence stops - AI is a mess, exceeding track limits and causing wreckless collissions every single lap of every single race. Makes career mode pointless. - Setup menu is buggy. Some settings only take effect if you save the setup then quit and reload the session. - The pit menu only opens when you're in your pit box. You sit still with your pit crew doing nothing until you've finished selecting what you want in the menu - Reporting bugs, and asking for help on the official forums will get you banned... Yes. Seriously.  PCars is only good as a hotlap sim with these issues. The bugs will ruin your races if you enter anything longer than a short sprint, or if you join a league.  The developers have their heads buried in the sand about real problems. The head of SMS (Ian Bell) has had numerous public outbursts, outright insulting people who are genuinely experiencing game breaking bugs. It's a miracle even a handful of bugfixes came out of these people post release.  0/10 would not back again. It doesn't matter what kind of racing you're interested in or what your skill level is, this is NOT the right game for you.
9390	Got AMD card? Then Don't purchase, choppy backgrounds make this uplayable... I have a fairly decent card (HD7990), and need to have pretty much all on LOW settings to achieve a consistent 60fps, but still with stuttery background... Was under the impressiom this was being 'fixed' which is why I waited... WASTE OF MONEY!!
9391	2 successfull starts or infinite loads out of 10. The greatest patch-addition I ever experienced. *gone to donate on the 2-nd edition, hah* Personal fail of the century award.
9392	The user interface is horrifically bad. Loading times are atrocious or infinite. Itâs like trying to drive with bungee cords on the controls. First driving game where I have experienced elastic banding of my car in single player. WTF? Bizarre! To adjust a graphics , control or sound setting you have to leave the race and reload the main menu thus returning to the second point above. Unplayable. Very disappointed.  Do not buy. Whomever is behind this pile of festering faeces is just a pirate. More than Three million in funding and this is the result. I wonder what cars the devs are driving in the real world ?
9393	If ever there was a day and night difference between the overhyped scores of 'professional' reviewers on Metacritic, IGN etc and actual user experience then this is the embodiment of this all too common phenomenon.  This game should never have been released. I will only scratch the surface of this rotting, vulture-devoured carcass by mentioning the following bugs: - In multiplayer cars can't even exit the garage half the time, forcing you to exit and re-enter lobby.  - starting grids often start with a tornado like effect of random cars being dropped sideways on the starting grid almost as if delivered by a sky-dwelling demon. This often results in a penalty being given to the unexpecting exorcist act victim. - open wheelers drive like the chassis is made of limp carrot and the tyres are suspended on sea sponges. Formula A handling is most disastrous. - AI are to put it very kindly inconsistent. To put it bluntly they behave like a rebellious teenager experimenting with recreational drugs. The results are always unexpected. - Finishing positions are sometimes displayed in incorrect order. You might clearly finish 2nd but the results table puts you in top spot. I mean WTF? - I've lost count of the number of times the game has frozen or just shut down entirely. I could continue til the cows come home. The most conceited and enraging thing about all this - Slightly Mad Studios has the nerve to start crowdfunding for development of Project Cars 2. Send a strong message to SMS that their greed and incompetence is unacceptable. You can do that by not buying this game or better still buy it, try it and get your steam refund asap. In most other arenas of commerce this kind of behavior would be bordering on criminal. A defective product sold on the back of glamorous pre release hype is a clever, get-rich-quick scheme plotted by soul-less thieves. Now only absolute morons should contribute to round two of self-inflicted flogging.
9394	I grew up with Gran Turismo 1 and on, Forza etc, done some real racing in real life (Corvette C5 Z06 at Laguna Seca) and for me the main issue with this game is that, attempting to counter-steer out of an oversteer condition results in you over-correcting, no matter what, and then fighting it left and right and left and right until you spin out. Even completely getting out of the throttle wont prevent this. I've gone in and reduced Steering and Throttle Sensitivity all the way to zero and it still does it.   For me this is completely unacceptable. The handling in this game is down-right broken. I am using an XBox 360 controller on the PC.   I wish I learned this within the Steam refund policy time-frame.   This issue aside, the car roster is completely abysmal. The only car I drove for the few hours or so of owning this game was a McClaren P1.   The game also looks nowhere as good as it does in the trailers. This with everything maxed out. It looks very bland.   I can't recommend this game at all.   
9395	Ive not had the best past with project cars and im not sure why.   Firstly is that i have a problem getting it to run, im not sure when but it decided it no longer wished to run on either my laptop or my desktop pc's, both are very high spec which is a shame, it will get to first splash screen and then give up on trying and crash to desktop.   Afterthat is the actual game and I am basing this on back when i had the ability to play it in the early summer period.   First is the interface, its not great but its serviceable, it works but it could do with a bit of polish.  Next is the car selection, i think i like the selection, its not massively extensive but there is nice variation and each class is fleshed out rather nicely. I dont like the fantasy skins though and id prefer it if there was some sort of option to allow the skins to be 4k, maybe a texture pack that one could download but that doesnt seem possible which is a shame. The dlc car content is also nice but i think that the packs are too small and i would have prefered if there were more dlcs that were the size of the japanese pack and judging by the community it seems like they would prefer it to happen as well.  Track selection is outstanding, there is a massive number of tracks its truely fantastic but most of them are not laser scanned and i can feel it at times, like something is just missing, maybe ive gotten a little too used to laserscanning, maybe its a placebo im not sure.   Next is the driving, people can go on and on about the physics as to whether they are realistic or not, are they challenging, does assetto corsa have better physics, its a battleground a lot of the time with that debate. Anyways in my opinion the road cars feel way off, they are horrid, i cant even touch them because they just put me off a ton. But race cars are what matter most anyways, they do feel a lot better than the road cars but i still get a faint feeling that the grip just isnt right, maybe that is to do with the feedback that i get or the times where the cars show behaviour which doesnt seem right, its a bit like the uncanny effect that we have to faces where the closer we get the more we notice slight problems, same with this, even without getting extremely technical i find that it just doesnt feel right at times.   Graphics: Personally speaking i have an unpopular opinion and that is that pcars doesnt look nice at all in its vanilla presets but thats because i try to search for the immersion factor of reality and the chromey effect that vanilla pcars has is very bad at this thankfully there are mods that can fix this and with those applied the game looks outstanding, the tracks have a great level of detail, the cars for the most part look great bar a few things.   Sounds: No, they are just bad, as i said earlier i search for immersion factor. Project cars fails massively here because it does it wrong, they focus on trying to make a car sound good instead of sounding like how it should of which they have failed with a very large majority of cars here. There are common sounds that are copied, they took the sounds and set a preamp of something crazy like +5db and its a crazy distorted mess. I understand that some people like this sort of sound but I personally cannot stand it. I think this is the poorest part of the game.   Racing features: They do rather well here, there are a few oddities with the pits where you cant control it and being inside an ai instead of waiting but for the most part the racing ruleset and features are close to class leading and why people say that it had a lot of polish.   Online: I didnt race too much online so i cant comment much here.   Career/AI: I liked the concept, some people questioned the reasoning behind it but racers will know, the euphoria from earning it is what matters, you dont need some carrot dangled in front of you to race sadly this immersion is lost a bit because the AI simply isnt face, i can best them with the default setup easily and im a rather average paced sim racer   In the end though ive encountered too many issues with the game such as getting my wheel to register, dialing in ffb being harder then it needed to be granted guides helped a ton with this, AI being problematic in open wheelers and modding something as simple as a skin should be a bit easier to do. Also the minor problem of it not running on either of my rather powerful systems is a shame and I will not recommend something that doesnt work.
9396	The more I play it, the less I like it. The dynamics are way overdone beyond simulation. Without a wheel, don't bother. Without perfected throttle and steering control, theres absolutely no skid pad or room for mistakes or fun beyond simulated driving in this game. Looks great, sounds great, all the options are amazing, lot's of neat positives in this game and all the cool race trakcs as well. Decent game all around, just dosen''t have the fun handling.
9397	Theres a good game here, if you can see it through all the bugs.  I got the game a month or two after release. I bought it to play multiplayer in private matches with my brothers. So that is the only area I have really given any time to.  Unfortuantly even at the time of writing this review, half a year later, the multiplayer is still riddled with game breaking bugs. Silly ones like it always ignoring your qualifying position and falling through the floor. There were plenty more.  Its a shame, as I know I would really like the game if it wasn't for the bugs, but the frequency of the bugs are too great. In the last gaming session I had prior to writing this, not one race went by with out some oddity or other happening. Some were quite bad, others were amusing. but all in all it ruined our experience.  They have been releasing patches at an OK rate, but still its massively bugged. Single player maybe fine, I don't play it.
9398	The worst GT racer I've ever had the displeasure of playing... Very bad AI to a point that it feels like i'm playing with 10 yr olds on-line who are hell bent on me not finishing the first lap! Weather is a complete joke suns out 2 corners later it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it down and by the end of the lap it's like blackburn on one of it's more common rainy days then by the end of the next lap the sun's out it's bone dry I've got my shorts out along with the factor 50!! Pit crew can't tell the difference between classes 'keep pushing and you'll have them on the next straight!' Sorry I'm in a GT4 car and the next car is a GT3!?! WTF!! I think I'm good but serously as my car been fitted with something I don't know about?! Good points are that I can turn it off and play something else..
9399	TLDR: Project Bugs - 'The Devs know about the problems, but it will surely be solved in PCars2'  My review is based on over 540 hours of multiplayer gameplay. The more you play this game the more bugs you will encounter.   First off the cars sounds different online compared to offline, the 'whine' sound from the gearbox or whatever is not present in multiplayer until the 2nd game in the same lobby and it's a well known bug. This makes some cars sound quite different and in some cases quite dull and boring online.   Then comes the steering ratio bug, when I first load into a session and go out of the pits, the steering ratio will always be 900 degrees no matter what car, and requires and Alt-Tab to overcome this(may be my ancient wheel is to blame). Not forgetting to mention changing your steering ratio in setup requires a session rejoin to take effect.   Ok then I'm ready to go on with qualifying, or at least try to. You see everyime someone joins the session you get a split second delay (I get about 0.5 sec of screen freeze, some people get up to 3 sec). Imagine driving in Monaco and you get that freeze? into the wall you go, freeze while you're under heavy braking? you WILL overshoot the corner, freeze while turn in? wide you go, freeze while on the straight? you're fine. It's a lottery while trying to do qualifying. Gone are the outlap-hotlap-inlap style, you HAVE to put like 5 laps fuel and go round until you HOPEFULLY get a clean lap.  On to the race. Theres a bug where cars spawn on each other, if a car happen to spawn on top of you and lands on you, you WILL get a drive through penalty because your car moved. If anyone decides to jump the start and hit you = drive through penalty for you. If you manage to survive the race start then great. Since my location gives me about 250 ping I'm always delayed at the start and lose places but I don't think this is the game fault, I can't upgrade distance to server. Also I can jump start like 0.5 sec to 1 sec without penalty, or maybe it's because of my ping, or another bug.  On to the racing. Cars will STICK to one another on side contact. Once 2 cars touch, they lose all steering capability and will just slide straight off the track or until they come apart. Penalty system is literally useless. There is NO PENALTY FOR RAMMING. Imagine T1 at Monza, someone hits you and you're forced through the chicane at T2, the rammer just continues on because he's still on track, you on the other hand are considered to have 'CUT THE CORNER' and get a 10 SECOND penalty where you can't accelerate. There is another abuse where you can cut chicanes without penalty and gain massive time in a race. Track limits is also another problem, on some corners 1 wheel on the grass is considered cutting the track but on some other corners you can go all 4 wheels off and hit the wall and yet it is not considered cutting the track, with this technique you can actually gain time on some tracks by 'wallriding' or you can run wide on some corners and gain time(eg. Degner 1 &amp; 2 at Suzuka).  Onto car setup. Some settings are just not realistic. On some class like GT3, running 0 camber is still the best. And then there is the abuse of running 0 radiators &amp; brake ducts. The telemetry for tyre temps is inaccurate for the inside, center and outside of the tyre. Using full negative camber can result in higher outside tyre temps. Also the left front bump stop seem to be the only one that can hit 'red' and not the other 3 bump stop corners. 'Live' telemetry is not that useful because you have to drive and see telemetry at the same time which is hard. You can download apps for telemetry recording but the problem is suspension is not part of the numbers which you can see, and suspension setup is critical for a race car. You can only have 1 setup per car/track combo, so if you want to have multiple setups you have to manually record and enter it. There is a 'summary screen' in setup where you can screenshot but it doesn't include all the settings you can do on the car so it's kind of pointless.  Chat was broken a few patches back and never fixed. You cannot chat in the online lobby, you have to drive out of the pits, park somewhere and chat. Vote kick function doesn't work, only the host can kick. There is a bug where it auto kicks people randomly in the session.  Replays are completely broken and never fixed since game launch. Cars parked on the grid, missing cars etc. Saved a replay where you just had an exciting race? or a collision? Go to check it out and see yourself racing against nothing, crash with nothing. Completely useless feature.  If you like hot lapping and top the leaderboards you have to abuse the 0 radiators &amp; brake ducts to get the 'perfect' lap. Also since there's not gearbox protection you can downshift like a mad man 6th gear to 2nd gear in a second to maximise engine braking without penalty, and you can off tyre wear so your tyres don't degrade throughout the lap.  Having spend some time in the official forum you read about all the problems people have with the game, promised features which will never be in the game, and also all the bugs which will never be fixed. Forum threads questioning the developers on these topics often end in arguments and the thread closed. Some 'top people' will defend the game with their life even though there are so many problem with the game itself. It's like they're blinded by something and don't want to see the issues. I even saw an insta-ban on someone for insulting the game. It seems the common answer to every problem with the game is 'It's a well known bug', 'The Devs are aware of this', and the most popular is 'It will be solved in Project Cars 2'  Resources spend for fixing the game is less than resources for new DLCs. Makes sense because it is a business after all but if your product is of such low quality then you will lose more people compared to people buying the DLCs.  Other stuff you will encounter include: Hitting invisible wall/car while leading Driver floating without car Driver floating in mid air(Imola chicane) Hitting a landmine(literally car flies &amp; flip) - too bad for you FFB bug where it feels like you have a flat but you don't - requires game restart Total lost of steering wheel functions - requires game restart Screen freeze but sound still works - requires game restart Opponent car stuck at 45 degree angle, creating smokescreen for everyone behind Qualifying 1st only to discover someone beat you with a time of 00:00:0000 Cars spawn on other cars/upside down on the grid, or in pitlane during race start  'But hey maybe all this will be solved in PCars 2 eh?'  Overall I give this game a 5/10 and that's being generous. Only because of the fun racing I have with the friends I met racing online. If you plan to buy this game for serious racing then don't, this is a 'Sim-Cade'. Only buy if there's a massive discount. There are better sims on steam which are cheaper, have better physics, and less bugs.  edit* typo
9400	No Linux / SteamOS support from Slightly Mad Studios is a real shame. It was advertised everywhere and as time goes by, official site faq and forum has been purged from everything related to Linux version. No project Cars 2 for me.
9401	Still one of the worst racegames to play with a controller. I've played Grand Prix Legends, rFactor and Assetto Corsa with a controller and all of those game handle it a thousand time better than Project Cars. (which released on consoles!) There is something wrong with the response curve of the joysticks in this game, which make every tiny movement in the center of the joystick too aggresive, but big movements to the outside of the joystick too slow.   This is the only racegame I've ever played that has this problem and there is just no way to fix this.
9402	This review will be strange to some. And dont be fooled by my 'hours' on record. It's more. This is just what I accumulated with this install.  Project Cars is in mnay ways the driving / racing sim everyone wanted. Easy to pick up and hard to master. But...SMS is not delivering what they promised.  There were too many day 1 bugs...as if no-one quality checked it. Then there are the many bugs that persists to this day...with most updates seemingly happily focused on ramming more DLC down our throats.  One of the most annoying is how cars can just magically disappear from replay saves. And dont get me started on the actual replay system. It is truly horrendous. And for a long time all of these things could be overlooked simply because the actual racing is so damn awesome. But no more...not with it becoming clearer by the day that the developer is more concerned with pumping out DLC and planning a big UPDATE in the form of PC2 than they are with fixing a product people paid large amounts of money for. It has this unethical flavor that just makes everything in my mouth bitter as hell.
9403	BUT WAIT.... this is the main motto of this game. I am a big motor head when it come to cars and racers. and when i saw this i said yes its finnaly here. But wait. Looks nice, the cars look very pollished and neat. in car looks to be real, idk dont own many of these cars. but it looks good enough for me, but wait the aspec in the car is lacking of any redefinment so your stuck with that postion. the drive is great all the phyics, but wait most cars feel like boxes with no real suspension in them at all, over steer and under steer has never been so big. cant tune it out and that if you know what to tune, no real guide for anything, carrear mode is cool all those division and all open but wait not all the divisions are open and the seasons seem formless race here race their then do it again. by the way you cant select the car you want you get the sponsor's car and the sponsors mean NOTHING not bonus or even diffrent voices in car. I love this Game but wait. it dissapoints but offer so much hope.
9404	not sim racing but bugs racing
9405	If you want a good sim, try Assetto Corsa or even RaceRoom Racing. Heck, even rFactor2. Project CARS is really good looking, and may work for arcade players who want a console-y feel for their game, but the force feedback is horrible, the cars feel floaty and the AI is so aggressive I can rarely finish a race without they ramming into me.  tl;dr: not a bad game, but a bad sim.
9406	Hello all,  In terms of content Project CARS is really nothing to complain about , plenty of tracks, plenty of cars. The weather system is something I would want to see in Assetto Corsa but I know that won't happen I guess. In terms of the sense of speed , that is lacking, it is a bit of a bummer. The feeling of cars or tracks is a bit of the downside of this game. For example I drove the P1 around Spa, the bumps, the curbs were not there in the meaning of I couldn't feel them through the wheel (G27). A little bit inward the curbs you got these little bumps which I could feel. Then we get to the car, the P1 there was no connection to the road, I should've felt something but the only thing I felt was the rear stepping out on various occassions , 1st to 3rd gear in a straight but also in 5th gear through a high speed corner, I mean come on guys you delayed the game soo many times already and yet this happens? 3rd or 2nd gear exiting a corner I can imagine the back stepping out but , 5th gear on quarter to half throttle going more than 160km/h (100mph) is a bit absurd. Yet on some occassions the cars felt good and some occassions the cars felt like boats. My fears before release became clear : Oh dear, Here we go with a yet another simcade game trying to be a simulator, but failing at trying to be one. I heard many players having the same opinion as me, yet I heard players who like it. And these kinds of people I like to categorise in : sim-racers and arcade-racers. I expected Project CARS to have similair car-physics as Assetto Corsa but what I felt was less than that. For arcade-racers to find a new challenge this is a game for you, for sim-racers like me it's a dissappointment.  Graphics wise, the cars are sublime , nothing wrong with that, weather-effects the same thing. Tracks could've had some  more love in the end.  Despite this I nor hate or love the game. Every game has it's flaws , but this games has the flaws where I didn't want it to have them. 5/10 - It was promising but a let down after all the hype around it.  --------------------------------- New Section : Third day of playing  This is what I noticed over the third day of playing Project CARS.  First of all lets start with the animations, I use with my G27 the H-pattern on the cars that have it, Nothing wrong with that? Well the animations of shifting seems first fine from neutral to first all is well, from first to etc. you see the animation going for neutral then being cut off and restarted for the animation to the selected gear which is annoying after a while and for me noticeable at the third day of looking through what is wrong. What is more wrong, is the rain effects on the front and side windows of the car, because if you want to implement rain you need also take notice of the windspeed and the speed of the car, because the flowing air makes the rain drops move in certain directions, as for the rain drops in pCARS they are static pretty much at whatever given speed.  Next part about the rain drops involve the windscreen wipers, after the windscreen wipers cleaned an area and they go back in an up right position you see for half a second in light rain or a thunderstorm / heavy rain, that a certain is dry. Rather more than that is the water particles from the wheels as they go through the car model ( only seen in third person camera behind the car ).   Further more some cars like the, BMW 1M or RUF RGT-8 do have incorrect engine sounds. So are more cars like that. There a few cars which I find driveable are the Renault Clio Cup car, the Aston Martin Vantage V12 GT3, the Ford Focus RS, the RUF RGT-8 despite the lack of a good engine sound.   Trackwise, I drove a few laps around Sakito GP not sure if I said it right (Suzuka, a real track located in Japan) missed some corners, I don't know if this is done on purpose or not, there can be a reason which I or we don't know.   Despite this I can find some fun in the game.  Now for the online gameplay, it's well done with the lobby's and interfaces. But, the following was a HUGE let down for me, probably for others as well, after a while my steering wheel was no longer recognized and i had to force quit the game and restart the game, one of my friends had to restart his computer to get his wheel working again. After that we could play a nice round on Watkins Glen Short.   The score of my rating stays the same, I won't lower it because it is already given.
9407	This game feels unfinished. Too many bugs such as , stuck in loading screen, textures, and sometimes the brake assist will bring you to a complete stop before you even enter a corner.   Pros: +great lighting +decent graphics +good music Cons: -bugs bugs BUGS -Horrible car sounds. My Honda sounds better than the Gumpert Apollo in this game. -Terrible AI  Do not buy this game. It is not worth the time or money.
9408	Project Cars is, when all is said and done, a very middle of the road racing game. The physics are okay, the graphics are okay, the sound is on the poor side and the single player experience, despite first impressions, amounts to a very bare bones structure.  Physics - Touted as stunningly realistic with 'best in class tyre model', feel very muted. Even with all assists off it still feels as though all cars have some amount of traction and stability control enabled, the behavior of cars at low speed is weird and in most cars it's impossible to do a burnout as you can in any other simulator.  Visually comma it's mostly just an okay looking game, in certain weather conditions and times of day it can look very impressive but it is not the photo realistic tour de force that it has been made out to be in promotional shots and various shill articles from around the internet. Sound, which in the lead up to release was touted as being one of the game's killer features is actually on the poor side. Engines sound clipped and distorted, which can be a cool effect, but in Project Cars sounds tinny and lacking oomph. Cockpit rattles, backfires and tyre squeal are serviceable but nothing exceptional.  The AI in single-player is slow, even on the hardest difficulty, any competent racer will find that they don't put up much of a fight. They also have difficulty keeping off each other and it's not uncommon to find them all dog piled on top of each other on corners they find a bit tricky.  The games true killer feature is the dynamic weather. Setting the weather to random is great fun and really adds something to the game that the other sims don't have. It's also during rain that the game engine really looks its best with terrific looking pools of water forming on the track and atmospheric lighting, it really makes for an immersive experience.  Most troubling is the games current state in terms of stability and features. The game is supposed to have fully animated pit crews, but as of patch 2.0 this is still not in the game and who knows if it's actually going to be added. You also don't need to look very hard to find the plethora of bugs still present in the game, with cars absorbing into each other, flying into the air and falling through the track. The collision physics are also very odd. Touching another car seems to mute your steering, often causing both cars to just carry on off the track, sort of glued to each other. These issues combined with the announcement of Project Cars 2 along with it's funding campaign leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Project Cars is not a bad game, but it feels unfinished and even with the polish it needs, I am not confident it could match the single player experience offered by games like Stock Car Extreme and RaceRoom. If you are someone who enjoys weather effects and cares more about immersion rather than the racing, Project Cars will have something to offer. Otherwise, don't bother.

9410	Some games will give you thousands of hours game play satisfaction, action and fun for a fraction of the price of this. At Â£39.99 for the initial Game + Â£40.09 for DLCs bringing the grand total to Â£80.08 for a f**king average game I think its safe to say that this game for me is way over priced and certainly not worth the money I paid.   I've done more hours on old rfactor and SIMBIN titles for a fraction of the price, with more fun and community content than this game can ever give me and thats whilst already owning this game.   Its a good game, but its definately not worth the Â£80.08 (Euro 102.84 / $115.88) that you will have to pay for the full game including DLCs.
9411	[50 hours in game] Ugh 'Project Cars' will be known as the biggest racing game flop in history. EVEN with the limited edition pack you barely get any cars without buying DLC and their mostly European! I mean sure there are plenty of Fords but how can you flat out ignore the other great manufactures out there? I'm really surprised project cars has not learned from GT6 that players actually like driving cars from their favorite manufacturer? Also a real killer is the fact that there is ZERO customization for the cars, you cant even change the paint color which seems essential. When they say 'we listened to what the players wanted' they really do not mean that, I cant see a single player actually wanting only 30 (I know i may be off a bit) cars to chose from. The only pro I have with Project cars is the graphics, which can STILL be horrible it does not matter what monitor or GPU you have, textures will still be tearing everywhere and if your CPU is not top of the line it will still be imposible to play agianst any AI. Just get GT6 guys or GT7 if their making it (I do realize its a console game but seriously, its better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this is coming from a strongly PC oriented player).

9413	All style, no substance. It looks nice. Itâs clear this was the focus of the developers as every 2nd race takes place at dusk for no other reason than to show off the graphics at the expense of the gameplay.  The AI is HORRIBLE. The worst AI I have ever seen. They spend more time off the track than on, and have no clue what to do when your car is near them, they either drive straight into you, or clean off the track to avoid you.  The handling is mixed, between âokayâ and âterribleâ. Iâm a sim racer using a wheel. My first race was in a hot hatch that kept losing the back end somehow every time I lifted off the throttle. I spent ages recalibrating, trying driving aids, but couldnât solve it. That level of simulation would embarrass Sega Rally. Occasionally you find a car that handles okay and you see what this game could have been.  The racing is flawed. You can massively cut corners and chicanes, overtaking dozens of cars. The annoying team radio guy tells you the stewards will âpull you offâ if it happens again. I havenât been disqualified, penalised, or pulled off by any stewards while playing this game.
9414	This game is more of a dissapointment, than a bad game. The lack of content really bugs me.  I will say the game is solid graphics are good. The sound however is terrible, and always glitchty, and that really robs the immerision. The fake social media like menu is another thing that shouldnt be there at all.  To keep this short if you enjoy playing from time to time doing hot laps everyonce in a while than this game is for you.  But if you are looking for a hardcore sim racing experince i would look elese where like Asseotto Corsa.   Even though that game has issues, its in game content and moding comunity is huge and immersive compared to project cars I dont hate this game and i wish there was a mixed button, but i wouldnt recomened it to everyone.
9415	I didnt like it. It feels quite boring, that's why I would not recommed Ä±f you are looking for more 'fun'
9416	Choose the correct answer. Today while playing Project Cars (after patch 2.0): a) My vehicle was permanently stuck in the garage in an online qualifying session b) At the start of the race I was penalised with a pit stop even before moving off the starting grid c) Pcars crashed 3 times within half an hour while loading an online race d) I finished an online race in 1st place yet I was placed in 2nd on the results table e) In career mode AI set at above 90 difficulty constantly ruined my race with suicidal driving f) all of the above Yes the correct answer is indeed F yourself SMS
9417	With how the developers of this game seemingly moved on to Project CARS 2 so shortly after this was released (they were crowdsourcing for PCars 2 barely a week after PCars 1 first launched), I feel like that I paid full price to do their beta testing the whole time I played this game. The game remained fairly buggy after numerous patches, and during my time with the game, any criticism on the PCars forums was commonly met with hostility from the game's supporters and occassionally a banhammer.  While I like the variety of cars and tracks that Project CARS 1 has to offer, the toxicity of the community and its developers don't give me much hope for PCars 2 whenever that comes to fruition.
9418	It's a fun game, but way too many bugs and issues to recommend this game at the moment.
9419	asking for a refund on this game why? - horrible sound, i dont know if it is a bug or something but i tried in various tracks with different cars and the sound of everything else besides the engine is a joke (i never had similar problems in other games). -Yes the game is beautiful, but it has serious problems with frame rates, especially in keeping them, i run the game at high-med settings with frame rates between 30-60fps, it doesn't sound bad, right? well when the game works well yes it is awesome, but i suffer of frame drops and skipped frames all the time, this shows how bad performance is with AMD cards -restarting the game to apply visual settings, this one kills me, we are in 2015! this is not acceptable... With all this performance problems i didnt get much time to drive, but for what i felt this game is not bad at that aspect. Like many people say the game does not look finished, i found 2 bugs in the little time i played and there is not many tracks to choose from and neither are cars (yes you can buy dlcs but at this price the base game is kinda empty)
9420	At the moment, Project CARS isn't an absolute failure, but I feel my money could have been more well spent. Short review, TLDR form:   EDIT: Changed some words and opinions after re-playing with sufficient sleep. &lt;3  Pros: -Amazing car graphics -Finally, a nice-ish damage model -Variable weather -Oh the list of cars is fantastic.   Cons: -Physics are varied - overall they need improvement, but some cars more so than others (looking at you, Lykan). -Tracks are not as detailed as some of the game's peers (esp. Nordschelife). -Very little sensitivity and feedback - I don't feel like I'm in control.  -Sounds are bad. Definitely needs improvement. At times it's muffled, at times it hurts, and some cars sound off (a C9 should not sound like it revs to 9000...).  I suggest SMS and WMD put a hold on the weekly car release thing that they have planned and focus more on fixing the physics and the sounds first. It would make this game more fun than a wrestling match with my Zonda Cinque whose rear wheels have read too much Orwell and want to break free of my control.
9421	If you are just starting out and are running nvidia graphics it may be worth your money and time. - pro: track and car selection  - contra: bad amd optimization   Everyone else: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE   If you want a hardcore racing sim, choose something else. - pro: engine stalling, shifting requires clutch (better than AC) - contra: grip and slide snapback too forgiving If you want to play online against unknown people choose something else - pro: ingame server browser - contra: wreckers, quitters   Not to mention the stupidity behind ex-SlighlyMadStudios, their lead devs and their attitude towards users  Also the crowdfunding marketing â¥â¥â¥â¥ which biased the early reviews, and made people believe this was any good.
9422	There's probably an awesome game behind the bugs, but in like 4 hours i've spent with this game, 2h have been looking up solutions for bugs and redownloading/verifying, 1,5h tweaking settings and only half hour of actually driving. I'm sure it's going to get better but it still gets my downvote. I advise buying only when on sale (i bought it 66% off) and arming yourself with patience for the first few plays.
9423	I can play Assetto Corsa, because I drive a car. But I have found you must learn to play Project cars, because it's not quite right.  I suppose I must ask....Did they play Assetto Corsa?  Good: Graphics are very good, but you will need a mean machine to max out the settings. Lots of racing options although AI is a bit crap Looks like online is the place to be.  Bad: The feel of the cars out of the box is just poor, especially compared to AC.  Force Feedback needs lots of reading and patching to try to fix this and it's 'better' but still not at AC level.  I will continue to tweak the game and maybe, I can then recommend it as a Sim.   
9424	I bought this game when I read the recommendations of this game. Graphic is simply the best I ever saw in racing games, but... Handling of cars is really, really terrible. Overstearing in almost every corner, validating times is some almost impossible think, if you run through the corner and due to really overstearing thing in this game, you just a little miss the outside way of the corner and time is not validated, omg why???? (not talking about inside of the corner, thats understandable when you shorten the corner that the time is not validated).   This game is really not worth the money, it is pain to focus all the time and even when you focus, cars behave like nothing real. I have really bad car in my real life, but I can run through any corner in real life at higher speed than in this game and comparing the stearing at low speed has nothing to do with real simulation.   I like realism, but not unreal realism, this game could be more fun with arcade stearing exept of trying to make something real.
9425	Looks completely Horrible on the Vive and buggy as hell. Very low resolution, jaggies all over and terrible frame rate. Everytime you have to tweek a setting - the game requires a reboot. And then more often than not, wont start in VR mode with restarting the system.  I played with every setting, and could never make much impact on its looks. Its certinaly the fugiest game I have yet tried on the Vive.  Classic case of something being retofitted and not really being fit for purpose. Avoid, unless you are a diehard fan.
9426	Sadly Project CARS does not live up to its own hype and expectations created when the game was first relaesed.  There are still many unfixed issues which the devs and community said would get fixed but didn't. It all looks like a bit of a cash grab from the developers now, they claimed that starting work on pCARS 2 would not affect the continued support of pCARS 1 but that is simply not the case, many 'features' (I would call them requirements) like triple screen support were supposed to be implimented and are all of a sudden going to be in pCARS 2 instead (except this info was only 'shared' on a post within the forum, same as a lot of the ommissions and back tracking the devs have done since release), all while they still churn out monthly paid DLC. The patches are getting smaller and smaller with less fixes which proves they are no longer working on the core of the game, which is still a mess in places.  I'm glad I never put money into pCARS 2 as I can see the devs playing the same cash grab scam as the first, promised the world, released it broken, patched it to a beta state, don't mention all the stuff that they are not going to impliment, let time go on so that people who invested good money into it don't feel so sore about it then slowly leak the fact that your not going to deliver what was advertised, nice strategy.  This game has some good points about it, there is a big if bland career mode, and the driving model is nice but the lack of ability to save more than 1 set up for a car (seriously this was achievable back in days of the Amiga, it's 2016 FFS), dodgy collision physics, odd wet weather tyre behavour (especially the AI, this has been 'fixed' apparently yet still exists in certain circumstances), no real multi-class racing (hey look we have prototype 1 and 2 and GT3, but were not going to let you race them together because clearly our game engine can't cope with it) which ruins the career progression for me in this regard, very inconsistent AI meaning you never run at the front with the same guys race to race (this is again shocking, Amiga racers had this, c'mon), no custom championships (yes another staple of most early 90's racing games seems impossible in 2016 for SMS) along with a plethora of small niggly little bugs and issues that culminate to make the experience one of frustration rather than fun.  My advise, wait to see what pCARS 2 produces, do not buy it on release, read the forums (don't for heaven sake post there, especially with anything less than wishing to suck the balls of the developer or you will probably get banned) and see if they are capable of producing a sim that lives up to even half the hype they surround it in.
9427	Slightly better Shift 2, nothing more.
9428	way to complicated than it needs to be. Fuel consumption, ware and tare on tires, no thanks. folks online way too rude. it just wasent fun for me.
9429	This games engine is just bad, plain and simple. If you plan on using a controller, do not buy this. If you have a wheel setup, bare in mind that this game has overly complicated settings to the point of being annoying as you have to adjust steering ratio for every car. Correcting oversteer is near impossible, and wheel spin will randomly shoot you sideways with no feedback prior.
9430	I get you have to heat tires up... I get you have to warm the brakes... But when the handling tries to be ARCADE-SIM! THAT IS WHERE I DRAW THE LINE! I couldn't adapt to the handling...
9431	this game is unhandeled and i can't play this game!
9432	I reviewed this title when it first launched with pretend VR support. Lets fast forward all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that happened inbetween with the constant glitches, bugs and horrible dev responses. Lets look at Official Oculus Rift launch day.   This was ment to be an Oculus rift launch title. Well, it is. However, they've completely forgotten about their original backers and earlier adpoters by forcing them to buy the entire game again ($91aud) or buying all of the DLC ($65aud) to get a key to the Oculus version of pCars. The only other options are to stay on 0.8sdk. What kind of options are these? This type of greed is not acceptable to backers or early adopters or anyone for that matter.   What about VIVE launch you say? Well that launches early April. With SMS not even making an attempt to respond to this very question countless times, I think it's safe to say VIVE support will be screwed or non existent come launch day. From what I've read, I could only imagine Oculus trying to run 1.3 through STEAM VR to be a horrible experience and resource hungry.  Now add these issues ontop of the 12 months worth of issues (some of which are still not fixed) and you then ask yourself, will you support SMS with pCars 2? Or any other title? No chance will they ever get a cent off of me. Never. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing. Again.
9433	A game that was carefully marketed, but which did not live up to the projected expectations. I stick with Assetto Corsa.  * Poor graphics * Limited cars * Limited tuning
9434	PROJECT CARS  Nice graphics, Stunning sounds and... that's about it really, in my opinion. This game is not a bad sim/arcade-ish racing game that have a decent amount of cars and race tracks also the modding scene is only as far as a custom livery but still pretty cool.   I play this game casually just to enjoy the sounds of the engines and dem graphics, but if you're looking for a proper sim racing game get Assetto Corsa or rFactor/2 if you want to go a step further with your sim racing experience get iRacing.
9435	AMD FX 8350 32gb 64bit win 10 OCZ SSD  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Thrustmaster TX wheel  Looks awesome with a huge unplayable BUT...  Running this game with everything in graphics hardware set to LOW and including dropping the resolution to 1920 x 1200 i still get severe graphics lag ending up with me crashing out on corners because of this. Unplayable for me so going to stick to other racing titles until theres a fix  I have no issues like this in any other games i own  UPDATE: went back to try this again and with my pc rig havving had no hardware changes something has changed for the better... it plays a lot better so some patch must have sorted a few issues? i can manage about 5-10 cars before i get the micro stutter effect happening so i keep under that and i dropped my graphics to mid which is still way better than any other racers graphic content :)  All in all im well happy now and after my next pc upgrade ill get to try it at ultra settings. Lovving the create server options!!!
9436	I honestly can't recommend this for ATI owners... The problems that existed at launch still linger, with the game suffering severe framerate issues even with rather conservative settings applied.   If I ignore all that, there's something that could be fun hidden beneath - though it requires players to be patient and invested in authenticity over the more immediate action of competitors like Forza. In the end I've come away feeling like this whole 'needing to practice and qualify before a race' thing just isn't for me, and it seems a shame that the game doesn't offer a slightly more streamlined approach to the career mode for players who just want to experience the main events. You can manually skip to the main races, but it hamstrings you, putting you at the back of the grid each time. In the end I just got bored.  Perhaps my view has been skewed by the frustration I've felt spending hours fiddling with graphics settings and drivers, and maybe the smoother experience on offer for nvidia players will genuinely lead to more fun, engaging play sessions. Alas, the experience I've had has not been worth the investment (in money   or  time). I only hope Slightly Mad stop blaming AMD for their QA problems and do a better job next time.
9437	Would be a great game without the crashes and bugs needs patching and shouldnt of been released yet
9438	I really wish I could recommend this game. There are some moments where it's the best racing game on the market....then you run into one of the lengthy list of bugs/UI quirks/questionable design decisions that plague this game.  Their forums are a toxic environment as well. You list the bugs/issues and you either get your posts deleted, comments from backers saying that these issues aren't bugs/dont effect anyone else, or you just get flat out banned without reason.  Oh and don't expect the issues to be patched out as they've announced they're already working on the sequel which even though they sold over a million copies of pCars 1, is going to be crowdfunded yet again.
9439	ENGLISH;  I hyped this game like I never did others I waited this game so long that sometimes I forgot that it will come out one day.  I expected a realistic drive. I got a simcade one.  I expected a developer who won't spam DLCs from day 1. We already have 8 DLCs after 6 months. They are already surpassed the price of main game combined.  I'd recommend this game but I won't.  Why?  I HATE DLC SPAMS.  TÃRKÃE;  Oyunu yÄ±llarca bekledik bekledik durduk. Hatta kimi zaman oyunun Ã§Ä±kacaÄÄ±nÄ± / yapÄ±m aÅamasÄ±nda olduÄunu bile unuttuk. Bu oyunu Ã§ok destekledim gerek forumlarda gerek arkadaÅ Ã§evremde. PC platformu iÃ§in bÃ¶yle bir oyunun , FORZA ve GT ile yarÄ±ÅmasÄ± iÃ§in gerekli olduÄunu dÃ¼ÅÃ¼nÃ¼yordum. Oyun genel olarak NFS : Shift 3 diyebiliriz. Az daha dayanabilir bir fizik motoru ve oynanÄ±Å sunuyor.  Normal Åartlarda oyunu tavsiye ederdim. ÃÃ¼nkÃ¼ Åu anda Assetto Corsa'dan baÅka rakibi yok. Ancak tavsiye etmememin sebebi kesinlikle indirilebilir iÃ§eriklerin Ã§ok hÄ±zlÄ± ve fazlaca Ã§Ä±kmasÄ±. 6 ay gibi bir sÃ¼reÃ§ geÃ§mesine raÄmen 8 tane paket geldi. Bu paketler tabiki gÃ¼zel ancak bu kadar yÄ±ldÄ±r geliÅtirilmiÅ bir oyunun iÃ§inde bazÄ± ekollerin ve ikon arabalarÄ±n olmamasÄ± bence Ã§ok komik bir durum. Ä°Åte tam bu noktada bence oyun yapÄ±mcÄ±sÄ±nÄ±n daha sonra indirilebilir iÃ§erik olarak satmayÄ± gÃ¶ze almasÄ± yatÄ±yor. Zaten 2015 MayÄ±s ayÄ±nda Ã§Ä±kan bir oyunu 2015 Haziran ayÄ±nda %40-50 indirime Ã§ekiyorsun ondan sonra insanlarÄ± tahrik etmek iÃ§in ayda birden fazla indirilebilir iÃ§erik Ã§Ä±kartÄ±yorsun. Åu anda 8 paketin toplam fiyatÄ± Ã§ok rahat bir Åekilde oyun fiyatÄ±na yetiÅiyor. Yani bir oyun parasÄ±da ekstradan sahip olmak istediÄiniz 3-5 arabaya veriyorsunuz.  Oyunu tavsiye etmeme sebebim budur. Yoksa oyunla ilgili ne grafiksel bir sÄ±kÄ±ntÄ± , ne optimizasyonsal bir problem veyahut ne de motorsal bir sÄ±kÄ±ntÄ± yaÅamadÄ±m.  Ä°ndirimdeyse alÄ±n ancak onun dÄ±ÅÄ±nda sakÄ±na tam fiyattan satÄ±n almayÄ±n. Benim gibi araÃ§lardan hoÅlanan biriyseniz alamadÄ±ÄÄ±nÄ±z her paket , her araÃ§ size kÃ¶tÃ¼ hissiyatlar yaÅatacaktÄ±r.
9440	I want to recommend this game because some of the cars feel amazing, the tracks are beautiful, and occasionally you get an amazing online race.   The content, however, is lacking. Career mode(single player) is entirely inconsequential with no unlocks, money, or achievement. This makes it go stale quickly(for a gran turismo fan like myself).   Where it goes worse is the online races(which are arguably the main reason to get this game). In Pacific Standard Time there are about 15 - 50 players online at a time spread across multiple lobbies. Finding a good race takes a lot of time investment, only for a bunch of turn one wrecks by dive bombers and rammers. It's rare that a race actually goes cleanly and well(though so satisfying when it does). It's the low player count that hinders it the most.  *This being said... I do enjoy how most of the cars feel(especially the Mclaren mp4-12c GT3 car) and have had some EPIC races, but the experience is very inconsistent
9441	The value of the game and the price tag are like Sun and Moon. The engine sounds all sound the same for respective engine sizes, and cars are *nearly* uncustomizable save for preset appearances. The menus and structure of the game are very shoddy, every time I load the game I have to re-set my control presets, as it is nearly impossible to play without some form of controller. It seems to me that they put way too much effort into making it look graphically realistic, and they accomplished that, but other areas of the game are simply not up to par at all. I still play it just to rip around California highway 1, and there is a decent selection of cars, but alot of them are underwhelming, and beg the question 'Why is this car even in the game?'. I would not recommend this game to anyone as there are other games that do the same job better at lower prices, but it is a little bit fun at least.
9442	I provide an in-depth review of âªâProject Carsâ¬   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5484yaJtQ8 
9443	I am pretty dissapointed I remember playing the beta on someones computer and the physics were incredible, the driving was fun. This final version the driving is stiff and hard to handle. The physics are stiff, its like the cars are marbles and just bounce off everyone like an arcade sega game. I am not sure what changed this so much but not very happy at all.
9444	Lags a lot especially in multiplayer and 3rd person cam and in a racing game that shouldnt happen. Defenettly regret wasting my money on this.
9445	No support fort he T80.
9446	I was so excited for this game but I am disappointed by Steam and Project Cars. Experienced the game crashing after completing events and a multitude of bugs and issues. The career mode is buggy. I signed to a kart racing team but I end up racing Porches and forced only to race certain events? Even starting a career involved me leaving the game and tracking down a message board to find the steps to even begin the career mode.   Multiplayer is full of children to just want to drag race each other or crash me out. The servers are almost all empty except for the children messing around. I was promised a real racing game and ended up with a buggy game I dont want to play. I tried for a refund but since I was passed the 2 hour limit (way too short to find bugs and issues with multiplayer, come the f@#ck on). I understand it was my job to know the limits of the refund policy.   So.. Im stuck with a game I dont want to play and a lesson learned from Steam (vote with your dollars and choose a better platform). It will be a very long time before I come back to buy another game from this publisher and steam.
9447	Bought this game while it was on sale for $30 to try it out and ended up refunding it.  This game has the potential to be a great game but there are so many areas that need improvement. For starters, everything you hear about the AI being terrible is true. They drive as if you car is not there. Overtake someone going into a corner? Be prepared to get launched into space at corner exit by an AI. In addition, the crash physics are ridiculous. One little tap and off you go flying into the barrier. Lastly, there are graphical glitches that make the cockpit cam of some cars almost unusable.   The car selection is also lacking considering the wide variety offered by other racing games on the market. At the end of the day, Project Cars has a lot of potential but unless the game becomes polished and the AI fixed, it simply isn't worth the money.
9448	This game sucks. It won't work with my Logitech Rumblepad - tried for 3 hours to get it working and it crashse cars on any difficult corner. Steam won't refund my cost!! â¥â¥â¥â¥ you ashhholes I won't buy another Steam product again.
9449	While the graphics are superb, the vehicle content and track selection is rather limited.  There are no Japanese cars available but 3 or so in separate paid content. Suzuka circuit doesn't exist because the rights weren't obtained, so it's instead a made up circuit called Sakkito.  This game isn't worth the full price I paid, but perhaps it is worth the $19.99 you can get it on discount for. Heck I just bought it last week so definitely not feeling I got my money's worth.
9450	If you are a former forza motorsport player and want to buy this game cus its a simulator and blablabla, just don't do it.
9451	Cars do not react the way you expect them with controller or keyboard (donât know about wheel, I havenât got one) once you start turning it wonât stop unless you turn the other way, and then it sometimes does not do it so you never know how to handle the car during a corner. Also if you hit some dirt with can drag your car all the way into it with extreme force, even if you use full steering locking in the other dircetion. And finally if you hit a bump at high speed you seem to go flying even though aerodynamics (especially with the high end cars) should hold you to the ground. Other than that I think they have got something going here just needs these things sort especially the dirt problem then I would recommend this to others.
9452	Even after Patch 5.0 it is unfinished.  Carreer mode is dull. The AI is extremely bad - even after 5 patches they just ram people off. And once you are in front they cant keep a good speed even at maximum difficulty.   Game looks good. But that is not a reason to give it a positive review.  The tires still heat unnormally because they are not simulated. They do an overhaul now, but when you promise realistic tires then you better not only come up with that in patch 6.0.
9453	do you like CARS? Do you like CAR games where you drive CARS with other CAR drivers and do CAR racing wth them, in CARS? Well maybe you should try Project CARS then.
9454	Graphics excelent  Gameplay yawn  Content what ?
9455	Up to patch 3.0 now. 3.0. Still drops frames / hangs for 2s. Well done.
9456	I regret buying this so much :( The game crashes every 20 Minutes without any error message, eventhough my pc meets the requirements. The graphics, the tracks,the cars and the sound is nice, but the career sucks, no motivation at all. The menu is way to overloaded in my opinion. I tried to play it online, but for me it was unplayable, sometimes you just crashed into other cars, which werent even visible just a second ago...bugs everywhere. I won't recommend this game.
9457	Promised a lot, delivered just a bit, including tons of bugs. Features from the beta moved to the next game (Project Cars 2) wich was announced right when this one was released is a no-go. I was looking forward to historic tracks but most of them got cancelled and moved to the next game. Same for a custom championship editor and oval tracks.
9458	I can't recommend this anymore, it just became far too frustrating to enjoy thoroughly. You'll basically spend most of your time resetting events because the AI drivers are more skilled at demolition derbys.  I really wanted this game to get better. More variations in classes and performance tuning would be key. Knowing that's not likely to happen just scraps all reason to continue playing as the progression is pointless. Why bother when you get the same thrills from a non-career race such as practice or quick race?  The game does have its high points in sound and visual presentation, the enjoyment is just a little dry.
9459	I feel like i have been ripped off with this game it worked ok at first but now it has not been working for weeks it just keeps saying every time you try to load it unhandled exception. code oxc06d007f at ox89051f28 thread build smsari.20160512.1235.bldaooo. and i have looked at the forums and thereis lots of post about this. but no fix.
9460	Bought this game, played 1 race, went to change track, game crashed, steam wouldn't launch, restarted, hard drive now doesn't work. Would not recommend.
9461	Guided, tested, and approved by a passionate community of WMD members and real-life drivers who are paid to say good things, Project CARS represents the next-generation of racing simulation as the ultimate combination of WMD fan boys and developer arrogance/rudeness.  Discover an unrivaled immersion fuelled by above average graphics and simcade handling that allows you to truly not feel the road. Create a driver which is your name pulled off steam, pick from a huge variety of motorsports in a simplistic career mode and write your own tale in empty or crash-fest online multiplayer.  Featuring the largest track roster of any recent racing game giving quantity over quality with a scripted time of day &amp; weather system, buggy tuning &amp; pit stop functionality with terrible UI, and no support for 3 screens or current version of Oculus Rift, Project CARS trails the competition in their dust. 
9462	5 hours in and the game has crashed over 10 times now.. is that how games are released in 2015?
9463	Unless you belong to a group of elitist pc racers good luck finding a race. Most races are password protected and the ones that are not have like three poeple in them. Not to mention there is NO PROGRESSION in this game at all. It was really really boring for me to see all cars unlocked from the start. Everyone literally races the same car every single time. Look the game w as released a few months ago and is already 40% off. Whats that tell ya lmfao.
9464	dont even think to buy PROJECT BUGS because after 1 hour to playing online you got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ !. they dont want to update this game anymore they think about project cars 2. this game is full of bugs here is some examples on pc : 1. game freeze for 0.5 sec every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time when someone join/disconnect to/from server. 2. you cant join some servers because join button dont work on some servers. 3. another bug when your wheel dont even work so you need to restart game and then its work. and lot of other bugs . its only good to play offline !!!!! â¥â¥â¥â¥ my english.
9465	Look this game is awesome and i mostly only play online. But honestly the online is that laggy and so many glitches and my the game keeps crshing every time online nearly. Its making it near impossible for me to play Project Cars anymore. Please Slightly mad studios! Can you please fix all the bugs in the game
9466	It's been four months since release, and nearly a half decade since development began and this game is still not in an entirely playable state. Pit glitches make endurance racing impossible, career glitches prevent advancement despite dominating the respective class, broken AI laptimes, bizarre physics glitches, and most egregious of all my T300RS is less playable with each update. The only decent thing about this game is the graphics engine which is very well optimized for nVidia cards. I've struggled to derive any enjoyment from this glorified beta and SMS's priorities and conduct instill zero confidence. I regret spending $50 on this at release, and wouldn't recommend it at any price over $15.
9467	This game claims to be a sim, yet the Ai are nothing but rammers, they will ram into to stay on the racing line and if they crash into will keep you pinned onto a wall just because they think its the racing line.   This game is only fun if you are doing time trails or get ahead and stay ahead.
9468	!!!ITS NOW 29,99 AND STILL THE SAME â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!  Finally we have - Cheater's . Thnx guys -.- .   and its not a sim look at the times on every track u have a 1minute or more faster lap then the world fastest records ,and im not a great driver but NÃ¼rburg in 5min58seconds hmmm . and bugs yes many .   G27 users have issues and get banned for complening . WOW  cant recommend it to the sim racers . cant recommend it at all money hungry company that made 100times more money then they investet and still put out a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ buggy wanabie sim. with every month new dlc's :) Thnx guys .    sry for my english its horrible :)
9469	Cool graphics, shame the rest of the game sucks and is riddled with bugs that they cant be arsed to fix but instead bring out more DLC.  My ferrari thrust master wheel wont calibrate with this game yet the same model which has vibration  works...why?  Ive been in the forums asking why they cant fix this and nothing, Nearly 2016 and for a driving game this is lazy as my wheel works with all my other driving games.   Like i said nice graphics but in no way is this a simulation, even stock car extreme is better then this and thats a small brazilian company. Not the worst game in the world but seriously guys come on, its not as good as people make out.  6/10
9470	DO NOT BUY !!!  BUG NOT FIX SINCE GAME LUNCH . Accelaration dosent work when trying to play online.( race starts and you just cant do nothing .. you just stay there) Game creaters made there money and they just dont care anymore ( nothing is behing updated ) this game would be great be the creaters just dont care .. sad to see such a waste .
9471	Good racing game. Graphics are good. Pity about the AI in the game. AI seem to be a bit blind and race very 'aggressively ' and tend to shunt you out the way. Bit dumb. Is it worth the price at this moment? No. Its not for the hard core race gamer. It is however good for a laugh and some fun. I was hoping for a bit more technical and indepth play. Unfortunately not. AI spoil the game, and the lack of any 'modification' leaves the game a bit empty. You just race, thats all. Maybe best to wait for price to drop.
9472	This game is broken, deeply broken and I do not think it will be fixed. There are issues from menu bugs all the way to physics bugs that make this almost unplayable. Issues like rain tires being faster on a dry track than dry tires, or issues where the setup menu offers a certain compound of tire and then the pitstop menu simply has, 'Hard, Medium and Soft.' There are also some very odd psychic behaviors especially with the cars over bumps. Some of the cars are undriveable, look up the McLaren F1. Unfortunately it took me several hours of gameplay, frustration and then googling to realize that it wasnât me, it wasnât the learning curve, simply the game is bad. The studio has said itâs reached, âthe end of developmentâ with this title, but they clearly never begun. Itâs embarrassing, itâs worse than a Beta version and itâs pathetic itâs being allowed for sales.  Bottom Line: I was very excited about this game, totally sold on the hype and I feel ripped off. Thankfully I bought it on sale, but don't make the same mistake I did, stay away! Unfortunately, by the time I realized just how horrible this game was, I was well past the number of play hours allowed by Steam and was refused a refund. I still want my money back!
9473	THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER...  As a player of forza 2 3 and 4 and also Gran Turismo 1 2 3 and 4 I can tell you that this is the  WORST  out of any racing game I have ever played. Bought this off of â¥â¥â¥ for $30 and even at that price i feel scammed.    PROS  - Well... um... There's lots of tracks and cars i guess.   CONS  - Physics are terrible, clip the curb of an apex and the next thing you know your kissing a wall. The grass spins you out way to much. Driving a stock Renault Clio turns into driving a Formula drift car over ice covered in butter.  - Graphics are WAY to beefy. People are saying this game sucks because its optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards, I have a NVIDIA graphics card, and a decent computer, but running this game on all of the lowest settings is a challenge.  - The GUI and menus DO NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTROLLERS. I'm using an Xbox controller but in most menus you have to use the keyboard or mouse to use, which is a hastle for me because i like to sit far away when playing racing games.  - All of the cars are too clutchy, a little flick of the joystick sends you into a 180, and there's no way to fix the sensitivity.  - Tapping the brakes DOESN'T WORK, you either give it the beans our come to a complete stop. If you tap the brakes you get an EASY spinout which will cost you the race.  - Penalties. Get bumped off the track in qualifying because of one or all of the control issues in this game? Good news! Your next 2 lap times dont count! took me 15 minutes to quallify 4th to last.   - Go Karts. Are they really necessary? The brakes are so sensitive that even a little bit of braking stops t he kart immediately. Plus they unreallistically rev really slowly after stopping, so every time you use the brakes, you're looking at a good half second off your time.  I haven't even gotten to use the multiplayer because this game is si bad in single player. Too bad you can't get your money back.  
9474	Its a good game, if only the devs were not â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ cunt â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
9475	It's not a bad game, it runs superbly well on my machine. 4th gen i7 @4.2ghz, 16gb RAM and a GTX970. The AI is irriating, stupid and unrealistic. Online works well if you have some friends that drive properly, most lobbys have at least 2 fools who think it's fun to play dodgems.   Graphically the game is lovely, love the fact you can have 40+ multiclass cars on the track. The sounds of the cars is not bad at all, engine notes are captured very well but tyre noises aren't that realistic at least from experience of being in the drivers seat. The single player career mode is a nice idea but annoying you can't skip the races you aren't interested in unless you start higher up the ladder but then you miss out of some of he earlier fun ones.  I love driving/racing games but somehow I just can't get into this one, and I can't really explain why.
9476	Hmm. What a mixed bag this is.   As far as physics go: this is not the best simulation. It's ok, sort of a Forza style representation. Slip angles are extremely forgiving. Slides are quite eaily recoverable. Understeer is more prominent than oversteer, though both are fairly minimal.  Force feedback with a wheel: lacking. Even if you spend hours and hours tuning and tweaking the force feedback (which you WILL), you won't get as immersive an experience as rFactor 2, iRacing or Assetto Corsa. It feels numb, lacking in representative feel relating to what you see on screen, and sterilized. There's also an extremely heavy centering spring that you'll have to spend lots of time tweaking to get where you want, but it still won't be great. This is my biggest dissapointment with the game.  Graphics: These are pleasing, but they aren't as amazing as they're made out to be. On par or slightly ahead of Assetto Corsa is my best description. There's tons out there on the graphics in this game. Tone you hype back a notch or two and that'll get you a relatively good expectation level for the reality of them.  Audio: Nothing particularly stands out. It's sufficient.  Gameplay: The career mode is underwhelming. I enjoy that its all about the racing, but I find it lacking depth via no differences between the teams you sign for and an obfuscated progression between series. IE: There's no real clear goals to achieve in order to attract a team from a particular series you want to progress to. There's some big and obvious flaws there I'm extremely surprised the developers didn't seem to notice. The one thing they get right is track and car selection. It's very diverse and populated. Easily PCars' best attribute.  Other: The UI is annoying. It's pretty but when it comes to using it, there are many places of frustration. For example, only being able to change FFB settings in the main menu options. So you have this thing that takes a ton of initial setup work (yes, even after the updates), and the only way to change the (many many, too many really) settings is through the main menu. Yet, the only way you can test those changes is in game. So the end result is the user spends hours and hours tweaking in the main menu, booting up a session, quitting the session to get to the main menu, changing things in main menu, booting up a session, etc, etc. It's one of the dumbest things in the game without a doubt. Choosing a car skin is similarly annoying as well.  Overall, the game is a struggle. That's the best way to describe it. It has a, on the surface, career type I want. However it doesn't excecute it well. The physics are *ok* but not very good and definitely not up to par wih its competition. The force feedback is a quagmire of disappointment. The visuals are nice but not nearly as pretty as advertised or hyped up to be. And there are a myriad of annoyances throughout the experience from UI design to choosing a car skin. The one and major saving grace for this game is its extensive car and track list. I won't go over the PCars 2 drama and what that may or may not entail. Nor will I go over the development drama of this game. However, as an owner of this game, I really hope Slightly Mad Studios keeps working on this title. It still has potential, but at this point is more of a Beta release than anything.
9477	they just a gruup of guys that took your money to make a game you dont see ppl who make call of duty takeing up money befor the release a game thats why they kep pushing it back and back .....now if you guys want to give me your money i can make a game to that is crap i got a i74790k ..32gigs ram two titans x sli ,,msi z97-g45 gameing bord and the game still look like crap
9478	Project of a cars game. Force feedback sucks really bad. Full of small bugs and bad design choices that should only be fixed in project cars 2. The AI turns into you, drives on grass and rain like on dry track. Real damage is crashing at 300km/h against a wall and having a minor suspension damage that can be fixed in 5 seconds in the pit.  no car control in the pits and you can drive throu cars that are going to the pit. Boring career and can't even setup a multi class race.
9479	Honestly doesn't feel finished...
9480	If your buying this JUST for VR, then DON'T!  JUST DONT!  Graphics are horrible, lighting is weird, frame rate dies, even on a 1070 and theres weird graphical flashing and stuff along the edge of objects.  So, game may be decent overall, but it's not well developed for VR. 
9481	You give us a game @ Â£40 quid then expect us to pay for downloadable content after your stupid remark about releasing project cars 2 WTF
9482	Fun game when it work. I have only been able to play online. I tried to play Career, but still nothing. Get stuck at the loading screen for the first race of career mode. And looks like plenty of other people are experiencing the same issue. I am running at 5760x1080 with 3 way sli 680s. Not sure if that has anything to do with it but ill leave that there.
9483	Graphically buggy and stutters. Analog controller is nearly impossible to play with. Can't adjust the controller settings while in game, so you have guess at an adjustment, load a race, try it, cancel race, go back into options, try again. Would consider tryign again some day when I have a nice wheel, but the graphical issues need to be resolved.
9484	The game needs more content i dont see why they dont have more of the popular well known car makes such as Ferarri, Lamborgini, Bugatti and Koenigsegg also the loading screens sometimes bug out so you have to restart the game however the game is ok overall hopefully they add the well known brands in the future... Also for some reason it dosent allow you to change cars when in an online game you have to exit to the menu just to change cars... I dont see why you cant its stupid!
9485	The game called Project Cars is the worst racing game I ever played. I'm a professional Kart driver and I started at my Carrer as a Kart driver. It's not like in real life! The force feedback and other things are not like in real life i guess you will definatly belive me. Don't buy this game!
9486	R.I.P. Project Cars 2
9487	This game just isn't very good. The money I put into this should have gone towards Dirt Rally or Assetto Corsa, so that's why I have so many hours. The AI ignores you, the Campaign is boring, and it really isn't a sim. The developer is a real jerk, too. They are now releasing a second game without finishing the first. It's sad, it had so much potential.
9488	When I first got the game I was quite excited. You see, I bought into the hype. Mistake number one. Mistake number two was spending money on this.  One minute it is Ok, the next it is horrendous. One car sticks to the road like it's glued on, and the next, a pure race car is like driving on some kind of super slick polymer. Almost all cars feel utterly disconected from the track. Random sounds thrown in to simulate what, I don't really know. Gave it a go and tried playing career, but when you have rain tires on in the rain and the slightest input of any kind and your car is off the track or into the wall or going backwards. All the while the AI is driving around as if it were on slicks in dry conditions.  Had one point where in the dry I actually had the fastest lap time until the last three seconds of practice when BOOM, an AI driver beat me by a mere twenty six seconds putting me at number two.  What a joke these guys played on the consumer. Next go around they will not get my money. I will give it to Polyphony Digital. Grand Turismo may be a little numb on occasion, and they may still have AI issues next time around, but at least it is not one big, unfinished, riddled with bugs, lie to the consumer. The saddest part about games like this is that the people that make them are utterly shameless about putting out trash.

9490	well i have to say this game has quite good graphics but the problem is that the car choices is too few,have you ever seen a racing game with no lambo and ferrari? and also the damage system is so unrealistic the glasses can be scratched but it cant be broken . There is alot of bugs , i crashed ,the following car crashed into my car , it said i hit opponent and disqualified me.....
9491	Stupid game that feels like it was rushed to the market, considering getting a refund but sadly steam's refund system is such that I wont be able to buy assetto corsa to replace this â¥â¥â¥â¥ because funds take 7 days to clear.
9492	Good luck surviving the green light chaos. Oh and also good luck overtaking the AI on tight spot. :)  [TL:DR]  Update After Patch 2.5: I've changed the review to not recommended. I do really know this game has an astounding graphics, vast choice of cars. But what makes me change my mind is the support from the developer, the community, and the bugs that's still not fixed up till now. The pCars Head Developer is not even trying his best to help the people that has issue with the game (see the top review for the proof about his attitude towards his customer). Well, no comment about his attitude anyway, as long as he's still working on it.  The issues I'm dealing right now is that when I start the game, the SMS's logo pops up and it stays the same for a long time. When I try to click, the game crashes, and Steam says that I'm still in the game. So I have to restart my PC again. I have reported the issue but that Ian Bell doesn't want to help me. Instead he makes fun of me, tho' I have delivered it with the most polite way I have done. Take a look at this  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?32776-Project-CARS-All-Platforms-Patch-2-0-Release-notes-OUT-NOW-on-PC-PS4-and-XB1&amp;p=1025173#post1025173   Conclusion: Not even worth a penny if you want the best service from a developer. Go get Assetto Corsa. Or get it when it's on 75% sale and up
9493	What's to say about Project Cars? I honestly can't put my finger on it. It claims to be a sim but it sure doesn't feel like that to me. Driving physics feel 'wrong' after playing Assetto Corsa for well over 200 hours with a G25 and TH8R shifter. The cars I've driven so far feel clunky, even when the settings are set to realism. There is no sense of speed when you go over the track at 250 km/h and still feel as if you're going 100 km/h.   The list of cars is also a bit disappointing. There is, however, a huge list of tracks, featuring some of my favorite like Spa, Nordschleife and BRNO.   Project Cars isn't a bad game but the physics and the way the cars handle still make it feel rather arcade than a sim. Do I recommend this game? I'd say no, not if you want a full bred race simulator.
9494	I mean... This game has everything. Yet I don't like it. I bought this, Corsa, and Dirt Rally at the same time. I've tried my best to get into Project Cars and on paper I should love it but I hate the way the game feels. It has A LOT, but masters nothing. Lots of cars, lots of graphic effects, lots of settings, lots of tracks but none of it feels right. Maybe it's good with VR?  I love Corsa, Dirt Rally, Forza 3, even F1 2016 (so far). They are all very specific games, but this game tries to do it all and it never feels rememberable or intense.
9495	pCars fits into a weird section of the sim-racing market. It's beautiful graphics and nicely designed cars &amp; tracks puts it well above many of the racing games currently, yet its sounds and physics trim it down to a 'simcade' type of game.  The content is widely spread with lots of cars to choose from &amp; appropiate AI cars to race with making the races less generic. Whilst I have not yet completed the career mode, it does seem like quite a grind (from Karting to LMP1) which is probably something I will not persue, but at least there is enough content to make someone who enjoys the game to get the most out of it.   The AI itself are rather tricky, I found myself constantly switching the AI percentage to try and make it fit how I wanted it for each track (which is far from ideal) yet still couldnt find the sweetspot that i get from RF2 every single time I head out onto the track.  My best advice would be pick it up if Graphics are a bit 'thing' for you on sale, but if you like a hardcore sim title- this isnt for you. Similar to F1 2016 in that respect, perfect for a quick drive every now and then, not something I could delve my time into unfortunately.
9496	The game itself is quite OK with a convincing driving experience. The developer, however, is an absolute no-go. They have announce a SteamOS/Linux version of the game and then silently cancelled it. Do not make the mistake to support them. There are other alternatives of honest developers (who have either actually released versions for other platforms or never announced such versions).
9497	waste of money,,,,same as grid autosport but with worse graphics,,,
9498	Pros: Graphics Easy to drive  Cons: Car settings are pretty messed up. I had to tune every car one by one to drive properly.  Car sounds are very horrible.   I guess it's due to putting many cars into one game. The most car settings are the same. The worst thing is that steering ratio is not simulated properly.  As a race simulator, I don't recommend this game, but if you like an arcade race game, it would be a good choice. I don't like this game personally
9499	Bought this game thinking it would be great for the Vive, I had played Elite Dangerous a lot and know how fun an immersive cockpit style game can be in VR, So naturally i just assumed it would be really fun to get the same experiance from a racing/car style game. All of the positive reviews had me going.  So lets get just dive into the point real quickly, I will look passed the fact that the game its self is very bland, Most Simulation games can be, And the fact that the AI is pretty well dumb?  But if you are buying this for VR be prepared to get some pretty intense lag from time to time.   My Specs are.  EVGA GTX 980 Classified Edition 6700k i7 processor 4.0ghz 32gb Corsair Dominator Platinum Ram 512gb SSD Liquid Cooling EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 PSU  You get the idea, I have a pretty heafty pc that should be more than capable of running this game let alone VR, Yet i still get Vive frame rate loss on a lot of the maps unless i go into 3rd person mode which sorta defeats the purpose of the vive. I am not the only person having this issue i have talked to a few people claiming they had the same problem.  Until they get the frame lag issue sorted out for VR i would not buy this unless you are just playing it on a regular monitor.

9501	When it's been out of early access this long and it still doesn't show the lap times correctly...  This is like a reskinned Shift2 Unleashed, maybe with a few different cars or routes, but the driving feel to me is the same. Forget the marketing on physics in PCars, you'll still hit invisible walls and obstacles on the track that will stop your car dead.  You can race your friends in this, yes the matchmaking is easy with steamworks integration, but forget about being competitive. Why? Because the lap times don't show up properly at the end of each race. But don't worry, the devs made a GOTY version so you can have all the DLC and forget about game breaking bugs like proper lap time recording in a crowdfunded racing game. /s
9502	Force feedback is garbage.
9503	This is not a finished game.  Gameplay is good, but there are too many bugs. Not long ago there was a bug that every time you went to a pit stop, you'd get flat tires when you got back on the track, now when I triy to enter a pit stop, the car doesn't stop, it just continues rolling into the pit stop, and crashing it's way back out while I'm in the pit stop menu.
9504	Wasted potential and broken promises. Guess what... SMS...will make PC2 so you could loose all your money again!
9505	Unfortunately for me, this game is a huge disappointment and a waste of money. Unfinished. It looks like done on his knee. Hopeless menu. Compared to its main rival Asseto Corsa falls at least slightly. Honestly I prefer to play in the old Shift 2 than in it. :(
9506	I'd normally write a longer review than this, but I just can't be bothered. I'll simply say that the game just isn't all that good and the biggest let down is the AI... It's fine for multiplayer, in fact it's very good for racing against friends, but if you want a good racing game with an in-depth and accurate career mode, challenging AI and accurate race weekend simulation, look elsewhere.
9507	Oversteer in a FWD car.. Nope, try again Slightly Mad Studios.   Track and Car Selection are fantastic, but driving model doesn't make sense. The game is hard, not because its difficult, but because the car handling is completely wrong, Assetto, Iracing, hell even Grand Theft Auto's racing is better than this. (lol) Why would they add the Radbull if there's no car control? Snap oversteer is real. Oh well.
9508	I was hyped for this game for so long before it was released but now I am very disappointed. First of all, it's not about cars, it's about motorsports. It's not a game like Gran Turismo, Forza or even Real Racing. Interface is very unintuitive, AI is bad and there is no real goal if you don't set it by yourself. Graphics and audio are superior but if you want just to see nice cars, better go out.
9509	Graphics are far from what was promised (driveclub is in a totally different galaxy for example) and the game is totally bland/boring (except maybe if you like real - boring - tracks seen on...well every racing games since 20 years...)
9510	I have played this game for many hours and I really want to say that it's a game that i would recommend to my friends, but, with the way they treat people in the forums and how no real improvements or promises have been fulfilled, I cannot with a clear conscience. I have lower end equipment, true, but it is above minimum specs required for the game and I have less than 60 FPS with all settings to low. And if it rains....forget it. Some tracks are better than others and if the frameraate was consistent even being less than 60 i would be happy. It simply is not very optimized for most if not any computer. So with all the beautiful graphics and they really are, if you cant play it at a consistent FPS it is not worth the money. And as I have said before the way the studio head belittles his customers and the banning of any one who dare point out a legitimate bug is banned and ostracized i would not recommend supporting this studio in this game or any other that has the SMS and WMD logo.  EDIT: I have recently majorly upgraded my equipment, 16GB DDR4 2133MhZ RAM: Zotac GTX970 Graphics Card; icore 5 6500 3.2Ghz 3.6 Turbo Processor; Its a beast now, and I still wouldnt recommend this title becuse of the poor treatment of customers and players who are still upset from the empty promises that have not been fulfilled and the poor A.I. and many other problems that still plague this title. I will admit, it is beautiful and really could be a must have tiutle, but , its not at this juncture and dont think it will ever be. I think they have pretty much given up on any more 'fixing' of the game and the fanboys will say they still have a large team dedicated to this title. But the truth is they have a team dedicated to cranking out DLC not fixing the game.
9511	After quite a few hours in game I have to recommend not to buy this game.  There are numerous glaring errors in game that even after two weeks after release have not been patched.  Straight up bugs:     2 out of 3 times Setups are not saved (e.g. changing the gear ratios before the race will sometimes not be reflected in game)    Many of the default setups are plain broken (e.g. in career mode the BMW M1 Procar has the same gear ratios for 2nd and 3rd gear on some tracks)    Game sometimes crashes/hangs during pit stops    AI will crash during pit stops blocking everything making other drivers unable to use the pits    On some tracks some of the curbs are not existent but only textures. Driving on them will not make a difference to normal road (e.g. Donnington, Spa and others)    No collision detection during pit stops, leading to other cars driving through you when rejoining or entering the pits   Some of the HUD Elements bug out (e.g. the 'predictive' timer)   Missing things I consider important for a game marketed as 'the next-generation of racing simulation':    Handling is rather simplistic. Weight transfers are barely present, the car feels lifeless (although I have to say that there are quality differences between cars...still none of them feels good. All assists off btw.)    ForceFeedback is not up to par with other sims like Game Stock Car Extreme etc. Even after spending almost two afternoons tweaking there is just no really good feeling.    Not possible to share setups with friends    Could not find a way to have multiple setups per track (only 1 for each training, qualifying, race)      Things that are just not good:     The AI is atrocious. Divebombing like crazy, ramming like the best of them...sometimes it feels like racing on a public multiplayer server   The AI only seems to be aware of the player after being about half way alongside while overtaking. Driving alongside an AI car overlapping only about a third car length is a sure way to be rammed of the track.   On some tracks the AI seems not to be subject to the same physics calculations as the player. Clearly visible when following behind closely and watching turning behavior of the AI. Also when driving in rain or watching AI racing through sand/gravel without being affected. Also AI seems unaffected by cold tires...    Some of the tracks are just not very well modeled. Some of the corners of Spa are just wrong...the Nordschleife (a track I know from RL) is of laughable quality (Hatzenbach, Miss-Hit-Miss, Mutkurve just to name a few corners are really not well modeled)...in Barcelona the corner radii are off...    Pit stops are plain broken....tried to finish a 2 hour race multiple times to only be unable to pit because multiple AIs are stuck perpendicular to the pit straight accelerating into the divider.   The replay system is so limited it borders broken. Watching a second replay while driving will bug the replay controls out.   This game could be really good. I could overlook the very limited tire model and physics or the lackluster FFB, but all the bugs added to that make this a huge disappointment. And I have given it more than enough time to show its qualities.
9512	So I've not played that much (14h as you can see). I've focused on the 'career' mode. It's not a real career mode, more like 'drive those races and you can change the mode after you finished the season' and by mode I mean you can change between GT4 and Formula C and stuff. You kind of work your way up but you can also start in Formula A (the highest one) if you want.  So I like it for the fact that you get different race weekends with the whole practice and qualifying stuff which is based on the real regularitions (i guess).  But there are plenty of races you are 'forced' to drive wether you want to or not. So I'm in GT4 atm. and am forced to drive a Lotus cup. If you drive those compared to the GT4 it's like you put on a Speedhack and turned off the traction. If you accelerate to much you will turn around. You cannot even start straight if you've got full acceleration. Thats kind of annoying.  All those Karts and Formula cars I've tested seem so freaking unrealistic. I've been karting in real life and in this game it's just like a speedhack version of that. You cannot control anything. Well I can't.  Eitherway in career mode I've started with the Renault Clio (since Karts were not an option for me). Those feel like your steering a battleship. You're so slow and heavy.  After that I've been driving some GT5 car i forgot. That was better but felt pretty heavy, too.  The Aston Martin Vantage (GT4) is really fun to drive though. Atleast I like it. But it doesn't seem to be realistic in any way. You're like driving on rails compared to the Formula Cars. And that's what makes me wonder. Isn't it the other way round?  All in all I might not be the best informed racer on earth and I've not tested all the cars in this game but I can say it is partly fun but there are better games focusing on one part of what this game tries to combine.
9513	Not worth waiting 3-4 years for. The biggest let down in this game is actually audio. Granted, very few racing sims get this right, with the notable exception of Simbin - the sound experience in this game is downright unpleasant. Its supposed to make you want to turn UP the volume, not down - as is currently the case.  I suppose the game will look nice on an NVIDIA card - but I will never know. My HD7970 struggled to keep this at 60fps - but only after spending an hour tuning settings; At which point it looked no nicer than a stanard Xbox 360 game.   Dont believe the hype.   PS: Oh, and the menu UI is laughable.
9514	The game was fun when i first purchased it some months back. I recently started playing again and a patch or something must have been released because my xbox controller no longer works. If the controller is picked up by the game weird things happen during a race like the gears shifting one direction constantly making the game unplayable.  Maybe other people might be luckier then I and get the controller work. otherwise be warned that unless you like racing with a keyboard or have a steering wheel setup, you wont be able to play the game.
9515	Alt-F4 is disabled. On a game like this, the ability to quickly close it when the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI drives you to want to smash the monitor is essential, and in this case nonexistant. I don't get why games disable alt-F4. I know that if I alt-F4 the game won't have a chance to save, but I don't care / I don't want it to, hence I'm trying to alt-F4 out.  On to the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI then. Weather doesn't apply to them. Cold tyres don't apply to them. Blue flags don't apply to them. Cut track penalties don't apply to them. Your position on the god damn track doesn't apply to them and they attempt to drive straight through you EVERY TIME. Sure, you can get around this by setting the difficulty to 0 and lapping the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them, but I want a challenge! I don't want to just tap them lightly and watch them drive off the track to give way - that's not a battle for 1st place! Neither do I want to have them completely ignore me and wind up taking us both out as I go for a pass and they decide to suicide themselves into me. No driver would do that!  Unlike others, I haven't encountered any blatant bugs yet. In fact gameplay wise the I think driving is very good. They have the game down, they just need to stop releasing quick cash grabbing car DLC packs and fix the damn AI.
9516	SORRY but should be renamed PROJECT CRAP :-(
9517	Don't buy this game. Current one underdelivers and new one is coming out, with Rally and Hillclimb. I refuse to support greedy devs who can't release a finished product. Buy Grid Rally if you want Rally racing, and not just tracks.
9518	I HAVENT SAW ANY GAME BEFORE BUGGED LIKE THIS ONE,THIS ISNT NORMAL..PLEASE GUYS DONT BUY THIS GAME!
9519	Terrible Framerates on AMD Video Cards. 
9520	Too much bugs Too much innacurate track Too much wannabe sim Too much fuss with setting that don't work Too much of waste time Too much unplayable  At least the car model look accurate with good graphic &amp; weather.... That's about it.
9521	Cool graphics, awful gameplay.   Edit: People online seem to be 'subhumans'. Be careful.
9522	I was very excited to get my hands on this and when a sale hit, i got it. I didn't really know what to expect...and i was let down.  The game feels unfinished. The sound is far from perfect and buggy, the physics are odd, especially for collisions. Visuals are pretty nice, that's a plus.  Setting up a controller is a chore, if it works at all. No profiles for that, if you happen to touch something have fun doing everything again. Settings are buggy in general.  There is a nice list of cars and tracks availabe, that's also pretty cool, but the sheer mass of content does not increase its quality. I'm sorry, but i would not recommend this game. If you're looking for a proper racing sim get Assetto Corsa or iRacing or rFactor2 or whatever, but not this. If you like to play around in a more arcade style game, go ahead, at a discounted price it sure can be worth it. I'm not going to talk about my feelings when i look at the list of DLC...
9523	this game is the poster child for pirating games before you buy them or why steam should offer refunds for games. This game is junk. mainly because It's not really a game. It is more of a simulator. I was looking for something to replace asphalt 8 and this looked like a good game, but after I actually got to play it was hyper realistic crap. the cars seem to have a 2 mile turn radius. I go to turn and it barely turns then slams into the wall. Such a waste of money
9524	hello  first of all before i say this, id like to say ive played this since its release, and almost every day ive played it on a number of tracks, both online and offline, so please dont lecture me, but this in why anyone thinking of buying this game, should turn around and run away...  i can understand that on release a game is not going to be perfect, lord knows rome 2 wasnt, and i can same the same for most games, however there is a line that has to be drawn, and the issues with Pcars..is that it should not have been released in the first place.   Let me explain - the cars and tracks are fine, thats not the issue, they feel fine, the speeds are realistic, even the weather and detail..is amazing, but...the one thing its needs to do most...its fails at miserably - driver input ....how many times do i have to enter a race, and have the car accelerate without my input, how many times do i have to be mid corner...and have the wheel go full lock to the right? how many times do i line up on the grid, and get a drive through penalty?? why do i enter the pits to change to wets, and come back out still with dry tyres on??!!! ... why was this game released...with those bugs in existence, those are game breaking bugs. the enthusiasts that trust the developers and look forward to 'real' feedback, have been betrayed and stamped on, and still after updates, the issue, the most important thing that makes racing fun, has not been fixed....ive just raced at le man for 2 hours...only for the car to snap randomly..due to the steering going.  now i know what your going to stay - 'your steering is wrong, its your fault not the games' but...i am not the only one ive spoken to that has this issues. and my wheel is perfectly fine in iRacing..GTR2..and others, so that..is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  And just to give you the full truth...PCars 2 has been announced...and most the features, like driver swaps, safety cars, dynamic systems, have all been taken out of Pcars and put into Pcars 2!! so not only have i bought a game, where i dont get what i invested in, but the biggest part that annoys me...is that the developers..dont, give a dam   ive never read news, or seen anything that has had a positive impact on the way PCars feels, and the way it drives...and for a person that is a creator of a racing league, someone who love motorsport and racing ...i feel let down and dissapointed that people could turn their backs on the very people that made their company flourish....  I wont be playing until they fix this game, but its not like they will care, as they already have my money to invest in their next broken mess to be released in 10 years or so.   Ill stick with iRacing, a company that actually offers you a service, and delivers whats on the tin...  OverTheLine
9525	It is second to none when it comes to racing graphics. The AI can be quite competitive and is mostly great aside from when you're following two AI cars and dive on the inside or outside about to make a move and one will cut over to block (which is great) except that they always slow down drastically as well. For me this has happened frequently.  Also, when racing the go-karts there is no sense of immersion.  My biggest complaint is that you are only allowed one car setup per track. Even racing sims from over a decade ago can handle this. I'd recommend Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2; however the graphics in rFactor 2 are no better than the original rFactor.
9526	worked fine at launch but after 1st update all went wrong no FFB on the wheel (g27) ive played about with allsorts spent many hours tryin to sort it but once you sort 1 thing out somthing else wont work then .
9527	junk.  pit crew always choose wrong tyres headlights need new bulbs and need to point forward  cant adjust key bindings while in game playing with gamepad lacks feel and steering to quick on gamepad even at 0% voice on new events cant be skipped seat to far forwards no headlamps in mirrors 2/10 avoid
9528	Having played this game for close to 30hrs, I feel I have enough of a grasp of it's content to write a review. For reference, I come from a Gran Turismo background so a lot of my feedback will be based on that as a 'simulator' with the use of a wheel/pedal setup (My current setup is a Thrustmaster T500RS, TH8a Shifter &amp; T3PA PRO Pedals).  GRAPHICS - 8/10 This is easily the strong point for PCARS. I am fortunate to have a very good PC so play with mostly Ultra setting with some at high getting roughly 70-100fps. The detail within the cars is excellent with the environment and tracks being even better, a really good looking game. However I must note that even at the point of this review, there are still graphical glitches seen in open cockpit cars when it is/isn't raining.  INTERFACE/UI - 7/10 In one word I would say....simple. Everything is easy to find and straightforward. That being said, the 'career' segment is so basic and shallow it seems like an afterthought. WTF is that calendar system all about? Could the Devs not think of something more interesting/complex than a calendar?  Also pointless emails/'tweets' are pointless. WHY? I won 15ish races on the bounce and I still got emails from people saying '...this could be part of a streak'....??? Really? You think? Why do I care what Betty whatshername wrote about me on twitter clone-hashtag thingy? I don't!  PHYSICS - 6/10 This is where I start to see a downturn in PCARS. The physics attached to the cars are very good and definately worth the title of simulation, however the score I have given reflects the lack of positive impact changing the settings of any vehicle has on it's handling. I have tweaked the settings to try and improve charachteristics of the vehicle (Escort Mk1) but to no notable avail. It seems as though every car is set-up to be pretty darn competitive out-of-the-box to the point where there is no real reason to change anything, even though any positive changes seem unoticeable. Why have such an indepth choice of tweaks and settings to your car when it isn't really needed?? Also to note, crash physics between cars is below average at best (It feels more like you are playing bumper cars!).  AI - 5/10 Boring. Just plain boring. They are okay for casual racers that just need someone to race against in offline mode, but for people looking for a challenge just go and face real humans (....or try another game?). Apart from staying pretty rigid to the raceline, they do not seem to offer much of a challenge when trying to compete for podium places. I feel this is a problem area that almost the entire race genre has, probably owing to the challenge of coding such an AI. So in that regard PCARS is no different than most racer sims, which in of itself is dissapointing considering PCARS is meant to be the challenger to the race-sim crown.  FEATURES/DEPTH - 5/10 ...and quite frankly I feel I am being generous. You never *OWN* any of the cars within the game, you are purely a contract driver. As a concept this is fine, but it will naturally lead to a lack of depth in gameplay owing to the fact that you are simply a faceless dude that turns up around the world in a blink, races then jets back home (This is the main problem with PCARS). This is unlike in Gran Turismo/Forza Motorsport ect where you earn the money and put blood, sweat and tears into owning a piece of machinery. Then, carefully taking your underpowered Golf Gti and turning it into a FWD beast, you face the challenges with something that is YOURS. You earned it, raced it, improved it then won in it. The concept is rewarding and makes for improved length of gameplay and a vast array of features.  PCARS has none of that. You're a faceless grunt, deal with it.  CONCLUSION - 6/10 When I first learnt of PCARS I was HYPED. The idea was brilliant with a community focussed race-sim that delivered a Daddy of all racers that I could spend vast amounts of hours being a nerd while drooling over cars I will probably never own. However, I feel disappointment. It's very pretty yes, but it's so...so shallow. The 'Career' is pathetically boring at best alongside the AI that seem to be drafted from the deaf-dumb-polite society.  Disappointed.
9529	The game was very good for if you want to just race on race tracks and not have an open world to drive in, but it needs more cars that you can use on the road.  And there is no open world so you can run from the cops or anything. So the price is way too high since you race on certain maps and such without being able to have a open world.  The only great thing about this game is if you want to drive on race tracks realisticly(rain, dark, or shiny) then this is the game, but its only realistic if you have these special steering wheels and special brake and/or gas pedals.
9530	the cars in this game are to hard to control (even with all the setings set on there easy seting)
9531	the cars in this game are to hard to control (even with all the setings set on there easy seting)
9532	Having to pay 32â¬ for the upgrade to the GOTY Edition when I can get the GOTY itself for 35â¬ new, is a slap in the face of all the people who bought Project Cars on release and an absolute insolence. Definitely no Project Cars 2 for me.
9533	Tried it few months ago and performance in VR was terrible. Gave me motion sickness as well. I don't know if the devs have fixed it or not but I'm not willing to try again as Assetto Corsa is a way better alternative in terms of physics, performance, graphics and VR.
9534	A half arsed attempt at a racing sim,while project cars does something's right and offers a more robust front end and track and car line up than other pc racers it however fails in the most important departments when trying to be a driving game simulator or even an enjoyable arcade or casual driving game.  I hate the sound in this game,there are not enough options to balance the sound effects in the game,the slider doesn't work as intended and with most sounds down to 50% and car engine sound at 100% I can stil hear far too much road sound and other car sounds,on top of that there is an annoying tire sound heard when cornering the car at any degree that i also can't stand,it's as if the tires on your car are wrapped in sand paper and there is no variation in this sound what so ever from car to car or gegree of turning point,very generic sounding and it wont go away.The engine sounds themself i also dislike and this contradicts general thoughts that the sound quality of the cars is very good,i trialed 6 cars from the kart and fomula series to stock and road and they all sounded very furmilar,each had very similar gear ratio sets ups and all were very quick in gear changes,i couldn't get to hear a turbo kicking in as you throttle up second or third gear to the over rev point with any meaningful sense of speed,all the cars did were go up quick and over rev with no real improvement in speed,there were no backfires or engine haults,the engines all sounded a bit winy to me with no depth.  Controls while using a 360 controller were dreadful,very twitchy controls that sometimes seemed to lose control and traction on the road for no apparent reason,i found this strange and to be the case on only certain parts of a track too and feels more like a bug,i wonder if the wheel is also like this ?  I could never recommend this game,i am a little let down by it in all regards,graphics are nothing that new,sound quality is lacking mostly in deph,controls feel like a rehash of a game called need for speed shift unleashed with a similar feeling of twitchy floatyness and middle wobble,no sense of speed vs sound design.  A shame and i am glad i waited before buying and refunding.   I come from racing games like forza on console and race 07 on pc,race 07 is a far far superior game in almost every way to this pile of garbage,i highly recommend it ! and if you want the newer and possibly the best sim racer on pc i would recommend racingroom experience here on steam,the base game is free for all to play.
9535	its not opening
9536	Whenever I run the game it afterwards sets my Windows Sound scheme from No Sounds to Default. It is totally unacceptable to me that a game changes my system settings.   Also you can not set the race distance freely when using timed races. There are only fixed times forced upon you. So you can not run a lot of real life race distances. How hard can it be to make the time a freely selecatble minute setting?  When you use the AI co-driver and the weather changes he comes in to change tyres. So someone had half a brain. However you then have to be there and select the tyres the AI wants. Of course it does not tell you which tyres it wants. So if you give it tyres it does not like it comes straight in on the next lap again. Also it would do this on the final lap. So I take that back. Whoever programmed that has to be brainless because otherwise he would let the AI take the tyres it wants and then send it off again.   Also the track limit system is complete rubbish. The AI itself frequently violates it. AI cars pass you going completely off track and get no penalty. And also your AI co-driver misses the track limits frequently and then gets you disqualified.   Another problem is that the game just crashes after long races. I did two 12 hour races with it. Each time the game did not come back after the results screen and therefore the data was not added to my driver profile.   As much as I like a lot of the other things the game does I can absolutely not recommend it unless these most basic, glaring and unexcusable major bugs are fixed. It seems like nothing is tested or thought through at all with this game.
9537	Unable to remap my controls on my G27. SMS support is non existant. unable to play the game, they took over 3 weeks to get back to me, rendering me unable to get a refund  however, reports of major issues with the game, and they are working on Pcars2 before they have fixed many game breaking issues should show people that they are in it for $$$ and as long as they get $$$ they don't care about their customers.  Asseto Corsa is a much much better game!
9538	Its a good simulation game but its too expensive than its worth.. Here is my Review ..  Positive : -Immersive graphics -Focus on racing -Variety of tracks, cars and disciplines -Some Strong AI  Negative : -Controls require configuration -Bugs and glitches continue to appear -Bad carreer system -Very few car brands and also models.   I dont recommend this game .. Dont buy it .. its too expensive You will be disappointed..... Its not worth for that money.    
9539	The game is really overrated.Particle system is the ugliest i've ever seen in a new video game. Also i found the handling of the cars very odd. On top of all that the game is very boring: same old tracks from games like grid or need for speed. I'm just tired of the same locations like nurburgring and so on. Game lacks originality. I've payed 50% off but i am still feeling ripped off.
9540	This game feels like it is still in BETA and has too many bugs plus it is taking weeks/months for patches to be releases to fix these bugs.   Don't waste you money.
9541	This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.  I was excited about this game. I love forza, dirt, and grid. I thought it was going to a combination of the best of all 3. It was, but it also wasn't.   The graphics are good. The amount of detail on the cars rival, if not surpass, forza. However the track and the environment suffer.   The AI in the game is okay. They follow their race line and thats that. The will not move. They will not try to take the outside to pass you they will try to go through you in order to pass.  The game play is great. Each car handles in its own way. You feel the difference between the BMW M1, the Zonda, and the go karts you start out with. It is wonderful and I give full credit to the developers who made it. It is a job well done.  My biggest problem is the shear lack of cars. No ferraris. No lambos. No Bugatti. No koenigsegg. No Volkswagon Golf. No Chevy Corvettes. Litterrally 3/4 of the cars you find in Forza alone are not in this game. They have very few normal cars for you and your friends to drunkely race. Few super/hyper cars that you can only dream of owning and want to top out. It is by far the biggest dissappointment. The cars that are availabe are race cars with few road cars availbe.   This game is supposed to make you feel like you are a young race car driver. It does and it does it well. I now realize this after I played the game for a bit. I also realize what I liked about forza and grid and dirt are not good for a game that wants to be as real world as possible when it come to making you feel like a acutal race car driver.   Grid, Forza, and Dirt are racing games. They look good, they feel good, they are focused on making the driving experience entertaining and fun. This game focuses on accurarcy above all else.   Again for the people who only read the first and last senteces of a review: This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.
9542	Bought the game but if you want any new cars you must buy them. Huge waste of money! Yay another dlc rip off!
9543	Absolutly f*cking unplayable with every car spinning out all the time with ALL assists on and with the most stable tuning possible. Poor physics, dont listen to anyone who says this game is realistic. The graphics are good, but i had to use sweetfx to make the game look as it should in 2015.
9544	If you like Forza, you will hate this game. The driving is fine, but there's no cars. Forza has hundreds of cars from all makes and models.
9545	Well im dissapointed , it feels unfinished , short of content and im reluctant to stump up for extra content , handling is rubbish as soon as your car looses traction you cannot ride it out you will crash stuck in to the barrier and have to reverse out , crash detection is woefull , slightest clip and your in a lurid spin , some tracks have blind dips and as soon as you hit that your car goes light and you most likely again crash . AI is weak the lead car just sits behind you and the rest fade away , yep or you crashed and worked your way to second there is a big gap to first . the slow cars are decent to drive with more mechanical feel but supercars on fall apart at the first corner with the crash detection and the knife edge handling . i am using a 360 xbox controller , its working better in win 10 but pre update in win 7 i had no hope at all , no support for 360 controler unless it has been patched now i dont know . out of 10 i rate this unfinished game 4 . but if it were finished it has promise .
9546	AI are rediculous, first lap first corner crash kid everywhere. There's no way you could properly start a race outside pole. If you turn up the difficulty, the crash-kid-issue is just getting worse and worse.  Definitely a waste of money.  Oh, and the Nurburgring Norschliefe sucks. Nowhere near the real stuff in Germany. (I've drove there for quite a dozen laps these few years)
9547	Another game that didnt live up to the hype. Very frequent crashes, visuals looks aweful, laggy gameplay and lock ups. And now they announce Project cars 2. Seriously, they have not even sorted this one out yet. REFUND APPLIED FOR. I will NEVER buy another product off this very bad software developer. RIPP-OFF !!!!!!
9548	I don't get it, I've driven quite some fast cars very fast and they never felt so prone to loose control like in this game. I always start feeling disconnected with a game, when I e.g. choose a BMW M3 and the game has it performing like some average street car, except it isn't able to do 20Â° corners at 50 mph without troubles. So if i can't trust the sim with cars I've driven myself how should I trust it with the others... Maybe getting a 300â¬ steering wheel would be better than using a controller, but at this point I'm just to afraid my experience wouldn't be different if I would buy one.. Also great is the 'going into a corner at 20, hitting the grass with one tire, better spin completly' experience
9549	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game only cause the makers are all talk!! buy our game heaps of DLC and more to come... NO DLC AND THEY ANNOUNCE PART 2 INSTEAD!!
9550	If you like force feedback, DO NOT BUY out of the box the force feedback will rip the wheel straight from your hands. There is little in regards to help setting it up properly Each car has its own settings you will have to tweak to make it drive right ! 
9551	Riduculously unrealistic for a game that touts itself as a racing simulator. Garbage controls. Making driving artificially difficult doesnt make for a simulator. I shouldnt be losing traction at 30mph on a straightaway, yet in project cars that's what happens.   Refunded promptly.
9552	Should be renamed to Project Bugs. The game is not finished. It plays as it is still in beta stage.  The AI is the worst I have ever seen in a racing game, they will crash into you any chance they get. 
9553	I really tried to like this game and put many hours into it but I just can't stand playing it anymore.  There are so many problems with this game. AI divebombing you when they pit. AI driving on grass as if it was fully rubbered in asphalt, AI constantly smashing into the back of you when you brake. Screwed up tire model where I can drive with wet tires for a whole race on a dry track without them melting (tire wear was enabled in options). AI not yielding when you go to lap them, resulting in more crashes.  This game should have been in development much longer. PBugs is an appropriate title.
9554	Not fun at all. 1/10  Playing the game on triple screen and Logitech G25. Force feedback just sucks, game has no fun or realistic feeling. Feels more like GTA than a racing sim. Graphics are odd. Game is not built with triple screen in mind, unlike Asseto Corsa. Vehicle and track selection is the only good thing I can say about the game. Probably can somehow be fixed with setting change but the menus are horrific, Takes too much time to understand what each setting mean. Spent more time in the settings section than in racing and still no good outcome.  Can't believe I've waited for this and spent more than 5$ on this.  Good bye and welcome back, Asseto Corsa.
9555	Don't Waste your money on this giant pile of dog crap. Every single time i try to play this game theres a new issue that i have to spend a half hour figuring out how to fix. The game isn't fun enough to make up for the headaches and frustration of trying to get it to run. take your money and go buy a good racing game like Dirt Rally or use it to buy into Iracing
9556	Very dissapointing, specially comparing it to Assetto Corsa.  A living proof that quantity does not beat quality. Unfinished, buggy, no soul, no feeling, terrible physics, poor performance. Pathetic DK2 support. Pathetic. They should remove the Oculus logo from the start screen, really.  Awesome graphics, that deserves recognition. The Halo Master Chief Collection of the racing genre.
9557	PROS  + Quite pretty for the most part, apart from a couple of issues mentioned later. + Fairly good selection of first-person cameras. + Menus are crisp and well laid-out. + The logo is quite nice (seriously, I'm struggling quite badly for positives here).   CONS  - AI incapable of racing, but will barge you off the track at any and every opportunity, and never seems to actually lose control even when it should. - Laughs in the face of actual realistic physics. - AI seems to be completely unaffected by rain, not needing to change tyres, remaining fully in control and continuing to post the same lap times as it would in the dry. - Car will veer off the track or spin out for no apparent reason. - Constant (scripted?) engine blowouts - I've even had a few occur on the first corner of the first lap! - Basically zero customisation options: you can't even choose your helmet, and the game will blatantly ignore your choice of number. - Noticeable screen-tearing, even with V-sync on and a 4GB GTX770. - Bland and lifeless crowds at race venues. - Career mode is marketed as sandbox but is in fact linear and lifeless, and doesn't even really let you know what's going on. - Limited selection of vehicles. - Limited and very poor selection of venues. - Go-Karts are awful. Just awful. - No real sense of immersion or of progression. - Extremely poor and limited selection of 3rd person cameras.   Basically, DON'T BUY THIS UTTER CRAP! Spend your money on something else. Anything else. This is the worst racing game I've played in a long time...
9558	Not a genuine sim - I'm not terribly convinced by Assetto Corsa either but it's worlds better than this, so if you're raised on GPL &amp; similar, don't bother. Looks pretty, though.  Noticed they announced a crowd-funded sequel already, so I'm asking for a refund &amp; getting out.
9559	Calling paying customers 'Idiots', banning customer from the forums for legitimate concerns, editing forum posts to look like praise when they originally were complaints, paying off other driving sim sites to buy their fake support, asking for money for PCars2, when the first game is barely a month out of release, and then stating 'we don't actually NEED your money'....Broken AI, which entierly ignores your presence on the track, but will race against other AI drivers, numerous bugs, including invisible walls, patches that introduce G27 FF clipping, very basic career mode, dripfeeding DLC....  All reasons to not buy this game, or support the next one.
9560	Wonderful Graphics, wonderful physics, but the game simply isnt finished. The deleveloper is still releasing patches, but some of the majors issues arent being fixed, and they are already crowd funding its sequal. The car setup system is so poor, Grand Prix Legends of 1998 vintage is far superiour. The developer doesnt like criticism either.
9561	Bug, bug, bug and more bug. Bugs take me terrible experience, totally stop me enjoy this game.
9562	I tried this game coming from Assetto Corsa, I saw it on sale and pounced. I found this game very hand-holdy, and unnecessarily complicated like HAVING to click the small 'sign' button for contracts. On top of that the controls feel really squishy. I get 83fps but it is the most unstable 83fps ever.   Maybe it's just because I'm coming from Assetto Corsa, but I can't recommend it.
9563	I have 170 hours logged in the game, but about 50 of them are using the internet trying to figure out how to get the thing running stable, and 100 trying to work out how the force feedback works. It is the worst implementation of force feedback I have ever seen in any game ever. There are so many settings, and no matter what I do, I feel like I'm driving a boat that somehow suffers from snap oversteer.  Of the 20 hours I have actually played, the AI drive like pastor maldonado on a sugar high, and the career mode is about as rewarding as watching paint dry, only to decide you dont like the colour.  However credit to the art and sound team, the game looks and sounds really good  2/10 Quite possibly the worst but prettiest racing sim I've ever played.
9564	Let me first start off by stating the positive attributes of the game, and then I will elaborate as to why you the consumer should not waste your time/money on purchasing this travesty of a 'racing simulator'. There is only a few qualities of this game that I can say are positive: 1. Graphics/IQ(don't trust the requirements posted on steam, you will need a high end system in order to achieve ultra IQ at 1080p+/60 fps), the graphics are phenomenal. 2. Track selection: the tracks in this game offer a wide variety of locations. Now for the negative stuff 1. Lack of content, and progression system, the career mode is an absolute joke and lacks vision as well as direction. This game is more inclined to simply be a venue for test driving F1/Super Cars because that's pretty much all you will get out of it. 2. Little to no in game sound tracks, while engine noise is nice the ambient background chime of music seen in almost all racing games is a must. 3. Control's, this one takes the cake and should be the primary reason for not buying this game. If you are using a typical Xbox 360 or similar controller you will be in for quite a shock, as almost every car is virtually uncontrollable or handles like a boat no matter the difficulty settings. It would appear the developers could give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the majority of players whom aren't using a wheel with this game. After all is said and done, I have played many racing simulators, and others like them, but this game still cannot stand up to the likes of Gran Turismo, Project Gotham Racing, or Forza. Dare I say it but DriveClub, actually does a better job than this game, finally if you are interested in the new Need for Speed Shift 3 buy it, otherwise avoid it.  Note on System requirements: I am running an extremely high end system when compared to the system requirements listed on steam, and still drop below 60 FPS when running at 1080p on ultra.

9565	This game has a lot of hype, but it is extremely boring. It's only worthwhile playing with other people.  The amount of vehicles, currently available, is not that good. Most groups/classes, only have 1-3 vehicles to choose from. (unless you like Formula/open wheel) They also promise 'Each month, Project CARS players will also receive a free car. We started with a bang in May with the $3.4m hero car from the movie Furious 7 - the Lykan Hypersport - and players can expect delivery of the next very soon...' Seeing as it's now July, we're still waiting on the 2nd &amp; 3rd free car...  (Edit 10-16-15: 4th free car has been added. We're a few months after release now, &amp; unless you're buying up all the DLC, there aren't many choices for cars. If you own all of the DLC, the car choices are much better now.)   The amount of tracks, currently available, is average. One would expect a lot more tracks than what they have now. Most tracks, currently available, are variations of each other. They boast a whopping 110 courses, when in actual fact, there are only 30 actual tracks, which they call locations, with most having 4+ different layout variations.  http://www.projectcarsgame.com/locations.html   The graphics are above average (I have no issues with an AMD setup, FX6350, R9 280X, with 16GB RAM). Nothing like what you see in the media releases though.  The realism is, well, there is none. This is an arcade racing game allowing tuning of many parts of the vehicle. Yes, each change will alter what the vehicle does, but, the 'simulation' side of things is an illusion. There are too many unrealistic features for some of these cars that, no matter what you alter in settings, it will never feel like you're actually driving it.  The career mode is a waste of time, literally a waste of time. There's no reason to even do the career mode. No story. You don't unlock anything. You don't get special licenses to do special races. The AI is not that good. If anything, the career mode is for people without an internet connection (I.E. PS4 players). I think that's the only reason it's there.  The online mode only searches games within your Steam Download Region, which can only be changed manually.  (This has now been fixed. Well done WMD.)   Controls are not controller friendly, no sensitivity options for throttle, brake or steering. It's either 0% or 100%, nothing in between.  (Steering is now a bit more forgiving with a joystick/controller. Throttle/brake, are still 0% or 100%.)   This game is NOT worth the money they're asking. Even half price is still too much! 60-70% off and you've got yourself a game that is worth buying &amp; playing. Perhaps once they start adding more vehicles, needs about 10x more, it MIGHT be worth buying at its current price.  This is an Early Access game at best!  Edit 7-19-15: I will say that with the past couple updates, they have managed to fix a few bugs &amp; create a better experience when playing. Although, it was at the expense of new bugs &amp; new penalties that may alter your gaming experience. Also, still waiting on these new cars that were promised. And for those that didn't know, WMD have already started working on Project Cars 2. Granted, release is still years away, BUT, please make this game better first!
9566	Really wish I passed on this one. Worst is every time I finish a race it kicks me back into Windows, and I have to reboot the computer before it will let me play again. I got 30 other games on Steam and Origin and they all work FINE. My computer is TIP TOP and my net connection is blazing. Can I get a patch please? As for the game the graphics are beautiful, even on my 750ti FTW. The races are is all over the place. Why am I in a Porche racing F-1 cars? Why does the Ford Focus handle better than the Porche? Why are the side events so much more fun than the career mode? Man this game should not have been released yet. So much promise.
9567	CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH and im not talking about crashing the car.  Game crashes every couple of races devs dont seem to be bothered one bit tried the official forums too.  I know I have more than enough for the specs recommended for the game  CPU- i5 3570k GPU- MSI GTX 970 RAM-16GB OS-Windows 8.  removed my wheel software if it had something to do with that its a poorly optimised game for crashing on its own
9568	First of HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is beautiful, and as long as you just stand still and watch the pretty cars it is all good. But as soon as you begin your first race you will realize that there is something completly wrong with this game. i play with an xbox controller and sometimes the game ignores my inputs and refuses to make a turn so you have to put your stick back to the center and try to get repeat the input this is not a hardware problem i have tested this bug with 3 different controller one of them being a PS controller and they all encounter the same bug. Also sometimes the game will armwrestle the controls from you and force you to make a turn when you want to go steaight for some time. and then there is time... when i am playing the singel player time will begin to slow as i enter the begining of a turn and this effect has no duration bar or anything it is just like bam 50% time speed and bam back to normal, they could atleast give it a more fluid transition. I thought i would give racing another chance even though it have never really been my favorite genre of gaming.  i sincerely hope they will fix some of these bug, so the game becomes playable at some point
9569	This is more of an arcade than it was marketed as or intended to be. The physics are very unrealistic and I'm not entirely sure what lead this to happen. The tire grip is extremely over-asserted, and the oversteer feels as though it has been exaggerated to compensate. This is especially noticeable with the road cars, which are genuinely unplayable if you're looking for a sim. Absolutely not worth the selling price.  PROS: -Many supported wheels -Optimized 360 controller settings, which is more fitting for this game -Oculus support  CONS: -Extremely inaccurate physics, especially noticeable with road cars -Extremely small and disappointing car selection, especially road cars -Poor track selection. Only 2 or 3 of the essentials, not nearly enough to justify the price -Menu UI is overwhelmingly cluttered and counter-intuitive. I have never had this complaint before -No integrated mod support -Exaggerated arcade car sounds
9570	This game is, without a doubt, the biggest dissappointment there has been in the driving simulator genre over the past decade. And that's saying a lot, considering Gran Turismo 5 was released in that timespan.   The game lacks basic interface functionality; you can't change the horrible futuristic speedometer you get in racing cars, and you can't even have a rear view mirror in certain camera positions. The menus are irritating and unnecessarily fiddly (and barely functional if you're using a controller), the user interface is cluttered up with pointless â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ such as artificially generated twitter posts, and you have to restart the whole bloody game if you want to alter the graphics options, and sit through approximately 9 hours worth of opening splash screens each time. Hell, you can't even adjust volume levels while in the pause menu, you have to exit back to the main menu; and how exactly are you expected to know where to set the volume levels when you're not driving?  The driving mechanics and car selection certainly don't make up for this either. While Project Cars does seem to offer a dazzling selection of manufacturers and models at a glance, on closer inspection it is apparent that ~70% of the cars available are lazily designed, ugly, soulless race-cars which, quite honestly, all drive identically.  The biggest let-down with Project Cars, however, is the appalling career mode. Instead of sticking to the classic formula of the old Gran Turismo and Forza titles, this game adopts the insipid 'racing contract' system of the famously lifeless Codemasters racing games. Earning credits, finally getting your hands on that gorgeous Jaguar and at last having the power at your fingertips to win greater titles has always been part of the fun of racing simulators; this game throws it away completely. On starting a career, the game railroads you into a tediously narrow selection of cars, then forces you to keep using one for an entire season. What's more, you're stuck with the utterly bland LM racecars right from the start, so there's also no feeling of progress whatsoever in this supposed 'career' mode. The calendar design is intrusive, and sometimes kicks you into round 4 of a race without choice, skipping the qualifying and practice rounds; I can only speak for myself here but being forced to race on a track I've never seen, in a car I don't like, starting in 20th place isn't exactly fun.  Don't be fooled by this game; it may look appealing on first glance, but believe me, you're looking for something else.

9572	 Disappointment . This game was terribly overhyped. In an attempt to do everything, the only thing they have gotten correct are the graphics (for nvidia). The rest of the game feels like it is a beta release. The fanboy steam community jerk off going on over this game must consist of console gamers. No one should be using the word 'sim' to describe this.  Oh yes it looks phenomenal if you have an nvidia card, but anyone who thinks these cars handle correctly and that the force feedback feels realistic obviously hasn't driven real cars before, or real sims for that matter. Cars don't spin just because you let off of the throttle before you even turn the wheel. The rubber band AI drive like teenagers who just got their license and can get away with antics like cutting corners bouncing their way through the grass. Damage is a joke other than cosmetic, you can plow head first into a wall and back up and continue like nothing happened. You can even shift  without  the clutch all through the RPM range without consequence on stick shift vehicles.The sounds are even a little off, and some (tire squeal for instance) are just straight up unrealistic. I mean judging by sound alone you can't tell if your brakes are squealing or your tires have locked up.   If you love games like Gran Turismo and Forza, you are new to PC racing with a FF wheel (and blissfully ignorant), or you just want a racing game that looks great on your new monitor then this is for you. But if you want a simulation, know how driving a car should feel, have a triple screen setup, oculus rift, or an AMD card -  STAY AWAY . Buy Assetto Corsa instead and save some cash. Or if graphics don't matter as much as physics/feel to you then iRacing is even better than this.
9573	Got a refund, did not like the weird semi-arcade feel, tracks not great. I'm sticking to Asseto Corsa, iRacing and few others.
9574	I am not allowed to say most of the words that come to mind about this game. 'Project' is the key word. Unfinished 'Project' lacking the ability to get a refund for a hammered out piece of crap that looks like something EA would unleash upon gamers. CRASH! Surprise! Surprise? No surprise. Its my understanding that if you have an NVIDIA card this game play s fine. If you have AMD it WILL CRASH! Not it might. It WILL. Ive paid half for 3x the content. I had a longer rant but not worth my time.
9575	I feel robbed!!  Honesty this is not a simulation game at all. it's so arcade like it's not funny, cars just float along with no feeling of being connected to the road minus a few tiny vibrations when you hit an apex.  The frame rate is patheticly unplayable on and AMD components   I want a refund.
9576	Serious problems with the force feedback in this game. I have spent many hours trying to fine tune this mess. Got somewhere I thought was in my wheel house and ran Laguna Seca to mixed results. Moved on to Watkins and Its all wrong. I play R3, game stock car, iRacing and assetto Corsa. I do not have these issues at all with these games. This has been a wheel setup nightmare! Its beautiful no doubt but it has to be at least capapble on the track and Im having serious Issues. I wan to recommend this game but I am having serious buyers remorse
9577	I spent $170 odd bucks buying this and all the DLC's coz I loved it on PS4. But they haven't optomised the gameplay and physics properly for PC so it just drives spastically. Slightest turn of the steering and you jack knife. And no its not me, as I said, I owned it on PS4 and it drove competely differently. I did really well. It operates like a completely different game on PC.
9578	Well, not that good... It had a great potential to be an amazing game, but apparently the developers wasted the chance
9579	I want my money back. If you give a sh*t about ralism, go for AC. This game is just one big nice looking bug.
9580	I loved forza as a kid, But this, even from the start i knew my money had sliped out of my â¥â¥â¥ and in to lazy development that cant see the reality about race sims. They can be great but man, what a let down, kinda like your dog dies but the dog is money.
9581	poor proformance on VIVE with AMD card. Seems like all cards have some difficulty running the game steady without reprojection kicking in. Even then it was unplayable for me. I'd personally wait for a better VR Racing Sim but if you don't want to wait, don't mind reprojection, and own a NVIDIA GPU you might enjoy this one.
9582	Wonderful graphics. Nice Lighting. Beautifully made cars. But all that glitters is not gold:  There are three things that let this otherwise brilliant sim down, and they do so in a way that begins as an irritation and ends with utter frustration.   1. There is evidence that the developers have applied an unnecessary and very counter-productive control freakery over the complete lack of user-adjustments in very key areas. While there are endless user preferences for graphics there are almost NONE regarding sound. I find it extraordinary that a sim of this beauty does not allow me to adjust relative sounds, AT ALL. Balance between ai, crowd, engine, user car, tyre noise, skid noise HAS to be user-oriented. It is no good to say 'we know what is best' because everyone's sound systems are different and everyone's hearing is different.  For me the ai sounds and crowd sounds become excruciatingly annoying. Without actually being there, the visceral aid of tyre scrub and squeel is absolutely vital, however good the force feedback is. Yet SMS have, despite thousands of requests to provide proper sound sliders, ignored these requests. Since those requests were made, well over a year ago, they have issued multiple patches and several addon packs, but they have not listened to an overwhelmingly popular request for sound balance sliders. This simple function cannot possibly be hard to implement.  Without these sliders the whole sim for me is ruined. You might think that sound balance is not important, but it is a vital part of what makes a racing sim playable.  2. Some cars have decent physics, but the majority of them default to understeer. An example is the otherwise excellent Lotus 25 in the classic pack DLC. They have ruined this car by making it almost impossible to get rid of the inherent understeer. While the L25 is commendably stable in a straight line it is just too easy to drive around bends, even if you set ridiculously loose rear suspension. BTW the power diff is the wrong way round compared to the description, and that brings me conveniently on to the next big issue:  3. The user interface and total lack of proper explanations and help are staggeringly inept. The interface is designed like a trendy blog with large on-screen squares and fancy graphics, but none of them give any proper info. You spend an inordinate amount of time clicking back and forth between these glitzy menu items to no avail. The whole interface is counter-intuitive and laborious. Let's give an example of user setups, car setups and control setups. None of these functions have a clear way of saving preferences. One makes adjustments and hopes they stick, but they often do not. There is no menu that says 'save your user file HERE'. There is just a save button, but WHERE is this function saved TO? And how does one recall or load these preferences?  The user driver naming, career mode and creation and saving is preposterously confusing and poorly done. I created then deleted several times a new driver / user name but in the pit menu my name is NOT linked to my chosen name but my Steam nickname. Why? I create a career name but it does not appear in the drop down list of drivers, so what is the point of choosing a career name? If I have misunderstood this then I acknowledge it, but why do I have to run through hoops to understand it, or rather not understand it?  Now we come to saving car setups. This is as confusing as it is possibly to be. In 'My garage' there is an option to choose a car and a livery. You can make a car setup here which is odd because you are not on a race track when you do so. How counter-intuitive is that!   But if you first go to a quick race and try to save a setup there, in the very place where setups are relevant, you can't, or at least not reliably. There is a save button but it doesn't load later unless you FIRST make a car setup before you actually go to the race/pit menu. You have to go back to the My Garage menu, save a setup there, then edit and save it within the pit menu later. Again I might have misunderstood and there could be ways around it, but I do not see how.  Moreover, the setup saving is badly explained and further confusing. There is an option to save to 'ALL' or to the track you are currently at. But if you try to save to 'ALL' there appears to be no evidence that it is saved. There is no drop down list of your saves. I find this incredible. It appears that you cannot pick or experiment with several different setups from a pre-saved list. There IS no list! As far as I can see, you can only save one setup per car per track. rFactor, GTL, and even GPL from sixteen years ago had his function!  MANUAL ======  I see a link to a 'digital manual' and go there. It is NOT a manual! It is a brief explanation of some of the functions, but there is no detail. For example there is no in depth explanation of the many parameters in Force Feedback and nor is there any detailed explanation of any other function. They are broad headings with a terse paragraph or two but no clear guide to every function. How can a developer spend years making a potentially great product and then not bother to write a decent manual? If you buy for example a flight sim addon, there are typically several user help documents, many of them running to hundreds of pages with summaries, details and every single function explained.  Conclusion: This could be a wonderful sim. It would be so if the key areas are addressed, and they are a very poor user interface whose slick graphics hide an essentially confusing and clunky user experience, questionable physics which seem to me to be somewhat dumbed down for the sake of games consoles/arcade users and xbox-type controllers, and a complete lack of user control of essential sound balance options.
9583	I hate serious reviews; all I do is write goofy reviews. But I just rage quit this game again, so serious I'll be: This game is horrible. More succinctly: it's horrible for people that dont take it super seriously.  I grew up on racing games; the more realistic, the better. Drove manual, turned off all assists, and never had issues. I do amateur motorsports for fun in real life and in general play around with the physics of cars to learn. The more, the better.  Then this game came along.   I presumed there'd be a learning curve, but otherwise I know I'd at least enjoy it based on what I've seen and read. So I bought it, installed it, and have spent however many HOURS fighting with it. Tweaking controller settings and tweaking controller settings AND TWEAKING CONTROLLER SETTINGS. There are people that can play this game with no issues, but for whatever reason it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing impossible to make it where it's comfortable and FUN to play. I KNOW how cars behave; I understand the tiny nuances that can alter/affect vehicle handling. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing GET physics. But despite knowing that, this crazy-â¥â¥â¥ simulation never feels right. The biggest issue is that cars are twitchy and lose grip out of nowhere with no indication or warning. For whatever reason, that kind of feedback is not put into the controller. So I can't count how many times I've completed turns as smoothly as possible and I STILL end up seeing the inside wall from sudden, magical oversteer when exiting a turn.  There are plenty of other horrible things about this game like a magical AI that have perfect lines, jacked up power, and adhesive ultra-soft tires when you crank the difficulty. The sound is janky with all noises except your engine being loud as â¥â¥â¥â¥. I have all sounds except my engine turned down to 60% and I STILL hear some AI car 100 feet behind me more than I hear my own engine. Overall vehicle choice is incredibly imbalanced and lacking in variety, DLC car packs are usually random crap with no real value. The cursor never goes away despite the fact that I'm using a controller, so I always have to reach out and move the cursor off the screen. Controller settings are CONSTANTLY being reset. Random lock ups and crashes abound. Plus whenever you're in the zone and concentrating on finding an opening to pass, that IDIOT pit chief starts yapping and it makes me lose it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. No way to turn him off, either. I know how to strategize my own movements, I don't need pre-recorded garbage chirping in when I need distraction the least.  Just so many tiny things that add up to the THE most disappointing game purchase I think I've ever made. I was ready to adore this game and all that ever happens is I try to play and I end up screaming so much my throat hurts and rage quit 10 minutes later. To me it's an ultra simulation that requires a wheel and insane amounts of tinkering to be able to enjoy. There's no fun 'out of the box', and it's for that reason I can't recommend this game. Not to casual gamers like myself that would rather play a game than tinker with it to no avail.
9584	I have enjoyed this game a lot, much of it VR with wheel and pedals (at a friends place), which is just AWESOME. Have also played with keyboard and most recently joystick. All are well implemented and does not take many hours to get accustomed to.  Still dunno what the carreer is about.  Pros: - graphics - amount of realism - track accuracy - not completely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI  Cons: - So obviously nvidia biased, it should have added 'made for nvidia' in the title (luckily, I happen to own an nvidia card) - AI is not super - after many hours of play, I still dont know what the carrer is about - Tried online play a few times, but gave it up caus of trolls (destruction derby)  I want to like and reccomend the game, but the bad practice of degrading performance of a chip manufacturer (amd) to make the other (nvidia) look better, because you where handed some $ is morally wrong in my eyes. Wont buy the next one if that trend continues.
9585	Would love to play the game, but the VR is eternally bugged and that's the only reason I bought it. All models bug out and I've been troubleshooting for hours. It may be a good game on its own, but if you're looking for VR then look elsewhere.
9586	As much as I loved the graphics and UI, the driving experience was so glitchy that it made the game unplayable. The car would randomly jerk to one direction when my wheel had not been moved. The wheel would also be very twitchy and twitch to one side and then back to the center very quickly. About every third shift I would make (with the paddle shifters) would not be registered in game. It is worth noting that this wheel worked perfectly fine in every other racing game I tried with it including DiRT 3 and DiRT Rally. Very disapointed.
9587	So, Project Cars. This is my first steam review ever so pardon me if it's not that helpful  I bought this game in the Steam sale, and let me tell ya, it's fun. When you start.  The game feels... weird. When you start out, with the go-karts, the game is great. Superkarts was great fun for me and i was getting progessively better as I learned what everything does and learned how to tune, what to tune and why.  At this point I was having a lot of fun with the game, but as the game progressed, as tracks got more complex, you could start to see the cracks show up with bumps in the road that literally sent the car flying, AI cutting corners like it's nothing (and not getting punished by it), crashing into you when you're CLEARLY not doing anything wrong (following a racing line, and doing everything perfect), etc.  When I left karting, I left this game. I played a couple of seasons of Karts, and won the second one when I already knew the tracks and was used to the car. I moved forward, only to see that the cracks that were simply annoying in Karting were gigantic and horrible in other disciplines. From being unable to heat up your wheels, to the AI straight up ramming you, to the AI not being affected by tyre wear or weather conditions, to tracks being bumpy where they're not supposed to, and oh so many more issues.  I'll admit, I had my fun with the game. Karting was extremely fun and challenging and I was playing in the hardest difficulty and winning but not by too much. But then the cracks start to show and things start to get weird and you just get frustrated with the game and stop playing it.  If you can get this game for less than 20 of your currency (dollars, euros, pounds), it is worth some 20h of playtime and you can judge yourself if that's worth it for you or not. But for the full price, the game is not worth it as you will not put enough hours into it to make it 'cheap' so to say. Unless you wanna be a kart racer for the rest of your life.
9588	Tried to connect to 8 online games, everytime I got disconnected. Feels like the developers no longer care about this game. Save your money on something else.
9589	I refunded my money after 1.4hour of struggling to get my wheel settings right.  The game is nothing like Gran turismo and the tire pressure is very fake a long with the suspension system.  Very plenty race courses and very detailed graphics. Just gameplay is not really there when it comes to racing imo.   And yes... I compare every racing game to Gran turismo 5/6
9590	Crap. It's not ported to PC. If you don't have an Xbox controller, don't waste your time. Even when I went to reset the buttons, it only showed an xbox controller and no keyboard. WTF? How am I supposed to remap the controls. GARBAGE.
9591	So much potentiall! But im giving it a no because of the absolutely dumb ai which hinders you from keeping a pace in endurence races and the fact that i probably have spent more time in the menues trying to smoth out the quite frankly bad handeling for the cars...im not sure what it is. And it looks like slightly mad studios isnt planing on fixing anything.
9592	Well, here we go with my initial impressions and I'm not going to sugar coat it.   The good: Awesome selection of cars and tracks + an extensive career mode. The visuals and sound is also brilliant. Very nice damage model.  The less than good: The physics doesnt feel right for something that is supposed to be more sim orientated that an arcade game. Dont get me wrong, this is no need for speed but somehow it feels like its not entirely there. I have more fear of corners in GRID than in Project cars. It just takes so much to unsettle a car but when that happens you have no idea that you are on the edge until you loose it and correcting the car is impossible as it feels like you are skidding on ice. Getting the force feedback on my wheel (G27) dialed in properly was an absolute nightmare and still it is severely lacking.  The lack of proper feedback through the wheel is terrible and it robs you of so much. This is probably my single biggest issue as it makes it very difficult to figure out how close you are taking the car to the edge.  In Assetto Corsa I can feel so much more via the wheel and that title really lets you know what is happening with the car. I am hoping that I will be able to work around this when I have Simvibe set up...but ultimately some fixingfrom the developer would be required.   Performance wise, this is definitely a title that can bring your rig to its knees. I run an i72600K (4.4Ghz), 16GB RAM and a GTX980 SLI setup and had to fiddle to get it to feel smooth (even at a framerate of above 100fps there seems to be lag with all settings on max). Dropping the motion blur as well as the AA settings, fixed this quite nicely and the game is definitely not much worse off eye candy wise.   My verdict at this point is that there is still a lot of work to be done and some refinement is needed. If you are looking for the best looking racing 'sim' around, this is it.  To those of you who are used to Assetto Corsa, note that this will probably not draw you away from your AC fix, even when Kunos does an update and breaks stuff. Project Cars is beautiful but does not rival AC for feel or realism.    Update (2015/06/30): After spendig quite some time with this, I can honestly say that this game is sh*t. It looks great but the physics and AI suck. Cars dont get unsettled when you try to do so but the handling goes for a ball of cr@p FOR NO APPARENT REASON!!! AI is dumb as SH!T as well. especially in wet races. So if you fancy a demolition derby game, this will knock your socks off. Unless they fix the issues properly regarding the FFB and physics I will most likely end up not playing it anymore... Simvibe helps with adding some feedback but you can only do so much with a flawed physics engine, dumbass AI and poor FFB.  THIS IS RUBBISH...GIVE IT A PASS. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!  As of Patch 9.0:  The game has improved somewhat although the issues with FFB, AI and physics still persist. SMS seem to be fixing some things with every patch but glaring omissions like triple screen support has been dropped altogether with focus being more on DLC. Said DLC for the most part is not bad but it would be nice if the core issues with the game were fixed in full.  Unfortunately the physics and handling of the cars still feels somewhat suspect.  Fps also seems to be inconsistent. When i fire it up, it may run at 52fps or double that. Seems like the luck of the draw.  I keep hoping that PCars will become what it said on the box... Sadly 9 patches down it still does not exactly cut it and with PCars2 on its way, i wonder if there will be another 9 patches deployed to fix things before no 2 is all the rage and this one is left by the wayside.  Needless to say I will most likely not support SMS in their new endeavors.  PCars is no longer a flaming ball of crap...but a smoldering ball of crap is not a much better experience in the end. It still stinks, just not as bad.
9593	bloody brilliant.   nuff said.   was my original review.  Living with this game for a little while now the well documented bugs that they have just ignored spoils it. yes it is a great game when it works but you really have to keep your fingers crossed that it does.   its all ok though they have started on project cars 2 now.  I think they should polish this turd for a little longer before making the next.  Also this is gammer funded, so we pay them to make the game then buy it off them, and we fell for it hook line and sinker.
9594	Great Simcade (more arcade than sim), it's like a combination of Forza and NFS Shift. They fixed the input lag from the previous NFS Shift games. The cars feel quite good, though the physics aren't that accurate in my opinion. Cars sound decent, they covered alot of rare tracks ( e.g Hockenheim Ring or Oschersleben). I'm racing with my g27 (great rig btw) and the FFB isn't that good compared to Asseto Corsa. Just like I said, it's more of a Simcade than a Sim... But the overall package is quite entertaining. Experienced some performance issues maxed out @  Gigabyte R9 280x  I7 4790  Y R U â¥â¥â¥â¥ERS RATING DIS SO BAD? IMA N0Sc0PezZ2 U 5 ever it aint easy bra   This game is nothing compared to asseto corsa. SMS sells this as a 'simulation' which is quite hilarious.
9595	Really hard to recommend... runs badly, some tracks don't load (infinite loading bug) it's not what i was hoping to find in 'the ultimate car simulator'  I tried it but things like not being able to look around properly were so annoying. Everything needs to be adjusted before you can start having a fun experience. 
9596	I've played a heap of racing games over the last 29 years and this one has really annoyed me. Riddled with weird bugs that like to jump out at you at random times and a draving feel that feels terrible. Each car feels exactly the same in that they all handle like you're on ice. It's such a strange driving experience and it's very annoying. I've played the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off Gran Turismo 1,2,3,4,5 etc and the Forza games and each car feels slightly different be it heavy, tail happy, understeering, fast on the acceleration or a mix of a few and so on. However, unfortunatly, the vehicles here all feel like you're playing Car Curling. Y'know the one, a long path of ice and you throw a heavy weight down it? This is what this game feels like. Point the car forward, accelerate and hope the wind or some other force of nature just happens to move you from side to side. Very unpredictable driving and a serious let down.
9597	whoever designed this game, hvaen't thought thru keyboard control when its raining. its impossible to drive when its raining with keyboard control. i was winning the race with 20s and rain started and i was spinning in place before i gave up.
9598	The game renders so badly on the HTC vive I feel like I want my money back.
9599	Project CARs is a realistic real-world racing simulation intended to bring together the most diehard racing fans from accross the world. Project CARS was released in Mid 2015 after a delay in production and has been releasing patches to improve the game ever since. After playing this game through many months of development, I have found the graphics are very appealing to the eye and certainly draw in race enthusiasts to the pleasing graphics of the game. Unfortunately, the asthetics and logic behind the game, especially the artificial intellegence are not quite up to par. After many patches were released in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the artificial intellegence, there was little changed, subsequently resulting in many deficcient release patches. This game is very useable with an easy to manage interface, and an in-depth career mode that will take you from zero to hero. The graphics and user interface of Project CARS are very unique in its class like no other, but is balanced out by an in-efficient artificial intellegence system within the game. The physics engine is for the most part very realistic with a few minor bumps in the road that can surely be fixed in the future. Other bugs include usability issues with the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. Often times during a race, the will will simply disconnect and you must reboot the game in order to continue gameplay.   Positives Qualities:  -Pleasing Graphics -Easy To manage User Interface -On Par Physics Engine  Negative Qualities:  -Below Par Asthetics -Unreliable Artificial Intellegence - Bug And Compatibility Issues Exist Within the Game  While the graphics and user interface are easy to manage, the main focal point of the game which includes the artificial intellegence and gameplay are not always relaible and are twitchy eight times out of ten. This makes the game discouraging for the user playing it and will surely have many players leaving in no time. I do think Project CARS has potential for the future, but Slightly Mad Studios needs to get Slightly More Mad in order to win over the ratings with this one.  Rating: 7/10
9600	If you have a AMD gpu do not buy this game, trust me you will thank me in the long run!
9601	pro: This game is hilarious to play  con: the steering sucks and it still needs work. it is not worth 50 dollars.
9602	In my hype for a forza game, I bought this instead cause I was told it's the closest thing to forza there is... â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t!  There are no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cars! How the hell are you gonna make a game called project cars with no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cars?!? They should have called it project racing...  I'm sure it's a great racing game, but the lack of being able to use and customize any car I want really make it 'just another racing sim' and nothing special at all...
9603	This game is meant to be a race-sim. As such, it offers a multitude of changes in the setup of a car.  BUT the setups get not saved due to a bug.  Therefore, you can play with the setup all you want. If you're lucky the game will save it, if you aren't all your work was in vain. This bug has been known to the devs since day one, but it has not been solved.  It's my bad luck I didn't know about this issue, or I would not have bought the game or would have returned it in time.  If you are a race-sim fan: DO NOT BUY
9604	first this game was awesome( the AI has always been sh/t) but then the developers became hungry for money everything has a price, quite a high price. i now also have assetto corsa: better AI and the dlc's are way cheaper. sorry project cars but im going to play assetto corsa now
9605	Why this game dont have clutch wear/damage? - No clutch. - Handling.  + Graphic. + Car choice. + Brake heat effect.
9606	force feed back weak u can do 100mph plus over bumps in the road an feel nothing lets it down for me
9607	I purchased Project CARS looking for something fun and potentially deep to play in VR (HTC Vive). I found the VR interface to be pretty awful, to the point where the game was unplayable. After I write this review I'm going to attempt to get my money back.  The VR menus of the game are huge and up really close to your face, requiring you to move your head around to see the options. The driving gameplay is seated, with a headless driver model that steers the car, which I found really weird and immesion-breaking. I'd rather not have a body at all than a body I'm not physically attached to and does not mirror my actions.  Because the body of the driver and the car don't move at all inside the play space, they need to be centered on your head and adjusted before the driving starts. The first time I booted up the game, I was holding the headset in my hands, clicking through the installer. The game world centered on the headset while I was holding it, down low and pointed at a 60 degree angle away from my couch. I spent my first 10 minutes with the game with my head clipped half through the car I was supposed to be driving, searching (and searching and searching) for a way to fix this in the menus. There was no recenter option. I eventually found a settings page that let me pick when I wanted recentering to occur: at game start or at race start. Race start was off by default. There was no interactive 'recenter now' option, which was incredibly frustrating, nor any controls to manually adjust the centering.   I restarted the game holding my head as perfectly still as I could in a comfortable position until the main menu came up. The centered position was better than before, (I was in the car at least!), but not perfect, and the game provides no way to fix it. There were a few manual adjustments for seat position in the car but that was it.   This unacceptable in a $30 title. It would be unacceptable in version 0.1 of a fan-made VR conversion patch.  The driving, once it started, was a little too simulationy for my tastes, even on novice. The cockpit view was super crowded and provided a poor view of the road. It was impossible to see where I was supposed to be going. All this made me feel motion sick after a short time. I couldn't help but feel like the experience I was having: discomfort, nausea, and calustrophobia was just a little too much authenticity for me.  I do not reccomend this game for casual driving fans who are looking for something in VR. I'm sure if I bought the game for hardcore simulation and was playing on a screen with a wheel, maybe I'd feel differently. For people who are not in my position, I defer to the other reviews.
9608	The amount of force feedback settings is just puzzling and cars feel very s*** on stock settings.  And you have to set the ffb for every car individually? Why? Please fix this.  
9609	The amount of force feedback settings is just puzzling and cars feel very s*** on stock settings.  And you have to set the ffb for every car individually? Why? Please fix this.  
9610	Im sure this is a great game, but after a whole night of trying to get my controls to work, and my TrackIR to work, no luck. I would not have refunded this game, had I were able to get it to work with Xbox controller and TrackIR. The game sounds great, the reviews are pleasing enough... My review is personal and based on forum search and myself trying to get the contgroller and TrackIR to work. I think in a game that is supposed to be immersive, the design has to be as such, where the gamer would interact with it and not have to even think about controls. This game, at start (where I have been up until I refunded it), crushes the life out of wanting to play this game. 3/10 because the game is impossible to get started. I have many other games to play, which had allowed my to stave off the frustration of losing a whole night, trying to get this game to work. Im sure the Devs are awesome... But, this game killed my buzz.
9611	Honestly. This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks, wasn't made for a controller at all. CAN NOT reach settings when in a race. There is SO much that is locked and I can't change. It's an overal bad game.
9612	okay let me get this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. at least 30% of the pcars community CAN'T handle criticism, including the staff. Want to get banned on pcars forum? Don't post sexual content that would take too long, just post criticism about their game and watch as you get bashed and get a ban hammer to the face.   10/10 would make pcars staff rage again
9613	There are tons of cars and tracks to drive which can be very fun. Unfortunately there are still several bugs that have gone unfixed. An unnecessary amount of FFB settings means that you'll spend several our tweaking them in order to make your wheel feel the way it should by default. Right now the only thing moderately enjoyable is hot lapping because the AI is inconsistent at best. The game has potential to be really good, but it unpolished and at this point still needs work.
9614	Really disapointed.. Lack of triple screen support. I want to love this game but Im back playing AC and rf2 
9615	My first impressions of Pcars were good. Stunning visuals along with excellent cars sounds and vehicle handling realism. I race with a Logitech g27 wheel. The wheel support and custimization in game is very good. In game the vehicle handles as Id expect it to in real life which fora simulator game is a big deal. It Did not take me many hours though to realize that Pcars has many faults which in my opinion outweight the pros, he biggest of these being the career mode, car selection and instability. The career was dreadfully uncreative with no excitement beside actually driving a car which brings me to the next point; the lack of cars. This isnt all bad due to the fact it takes time to learn how to drive each car properly. Most of my game time was spent driving the RUF Yellowbird. I would have appreciated a few more road cars and more American and Japanese cars. The name itself is misleading since the game has well under 100 cars which are mostly European race cars. The stability of the game has also caused me grief even in the 10 hours of gameplay. Frequent crashes and fps drops make it difficlut to play. I cannot reccomend the game to people who seek a racing experience like i did. It is designed more for those who love Hot Lap simulators with not much else
9616	Wasted 24 hours trying to find decent settings for the xbox one controller and steering wheel. Shouldnt have to. Replays are no good, the cars stutter backwards and forwards. The annoying thing is I bet theres a decent game to be had if they bothered to give proper controller settings. Uninstalled.
9617	A real shame, good game, fine mix of arcade and sim racer, but it is totally ruined by an AI worse than the AI in GT6 and the rain... It is always raining, and the rain is really local so it only affects your car and only the part of the track you are driving on at any given moment.  This just makes it impossible to enjoy, and yes I do know that it rains, but I refuse to belive that Laguna Seca (in California, you know the place that is running out of water) has rain every weekend. But like i said, this is actually a good game, so it is a real shame that such minor problems ruins a potentially great game.  Positive: Easy to get started, lots of different types of cars, tracks from around the world Negative: The rain, the rain and the bad AI 
9618	game sucks, I have been waiting for it since announced what two years ago, and since I bought it, it has been nothing but a dissapointment, buggy as hell, hard to assign controllers, the updates cause more problems then they are worth, the game is pretty, but it sucks....
9619	Let's make it simple and clean.  Pro -Graphics -many tracks  Con -few cars -handling  Con+ -runs very bad on AMD GPU's (R9 280X in that case)
9620	Buggy and laggy. Online racing shocks and lags as hell.
9621	A lot of potential, but at the end it is a poor game. The sound is the worst thing in this game, its so bad that i wonder how that ever release it with this, or their sound editor defenetly has ears problem.  Graphics are good. Gameplay is somehow clunky and this game really needs alot of pollishing.  Not for hardcore car fans.
9622	Fun game till your save file gets corrupted and you never wish to play it again. Thanks nvidia for the awful drivers, and thanks MAD for not implementing steam backups.
9623	Graphics Impress, shame about the handling and feel.   In short, it beats Assetto Corsa in the eye candy dept, but for everything else, including realistic physics, Assetto Corsa is still King.
9624	Fun game till your save file gets corrupted and you never wish to play it again. Thanks nvidia for the awful drivers, and thanks MAD for not implementing steam backups.
9625	It may have been my computer, but this game runs terribly. Opimization is incredibly horrid and there is a good 1 sec lag on controls. The only outstanding part of this game is karts and open-wheel collisions.
9626	Graphics are decent, the amount of cars avaliable is good. I love the driving physics and the weather effects. Theres plently of leagues to choose from. I straight out love this game...... except for THE GOD DAMN AI!!! WTF?   I am sorry, I really tried to like this game. But after beeing bumped out of the same turn on the same track restarting my Formula C session 25 times and the AI rear bumped me on a wet track EVERY GOD DAMN TIME, then its more frustrating then fun! I can see them, but I cant avoid them. They are way to unpredictable. I try desperatly to slow down and do this 90 degree right turn, and every single time no mather what someone bumps my damn rear.  If I try to drive passively I spin out trying to avoid the crazy damn AI, I`ve tried everything, the only thing that worked was lowering the difficulty so much that the AI became braindead. Thats no fun. I won with 1 and a half lap...... is there no middle ground?  I`m even racing passively, I let them pass me if I cant loose them. I keep my distance as much as possible in turns and only drive past them on straights. I drive flawlessly, still I cant avoid the AI. Its as if they are targeting me sometimes.   Is programing an AI in a racing game really that hard? If I turn up the AI difficulty at all they keep bumpind and crashing into me. I know that the AI is suposed to be 'aggresive' at times, but god damn! Having an AI slamming your side or rear so hard that you crash and have to break the race? WTF? THIS IS NOT REALISTIC! ITS FRUSTRATING!  I mean, accidents happen sure thats realistic. But not when it happens several times in every single race.... I have to drive like a old grandma with an expired license and broken glasses just to avoid beeing rammed of the track.    But its not only on this track no, almost every single track I`ve raced on against AI. The AI suddenly and for NO reason just ignores my presence completely. Slamming into me hard, as if it didnt register that I was there. WTF?  Sadly I played this game too much and cant get a refund.... or I would....  Fix your damn AI before calling it a 'sim driver' please. Its not a sim when I feel like everyone else on the track want to kill me. Thats not realistic, thats lazy design. I`ve seen better AI in 15 year old racing games on PS1.
9627	this game is abosoulutely a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ you cant honestly tell me this game is even close to simulation the cars handle like absolute garbage. The controls are absolutley horendous! Get better!
9628	This game looks and sounds really good. And that's all it does. If I could return this game, i wouldn't hesitate a single second!  It is absolutely unplayable with a controller and the performance it takes off of your cpu &amp; gpu is far beyond every reasonable argument. It's like an unoptimized beta with fps drops, graphic bugs and immense lags! Moreover the community consists of the biggest â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s I've ever seen in a Racing Simulator. It feels like 90% of them crash on purpose. Last but not least: The Tuning Setup is a big joke. E.g. you can choose between 3 different premade gear ratio setups on a GT3 car. You could manipulate every gear as you like but this will end in two overlapping gears with the same ratio.  If you really like racing simulators, I can only recommend playing GranTourismo or AssettoCorsa and leave this graphicblender behind.  P.S.: I play many games e.g. Star Citizen, BF4 etc. with no problems, so it can't be my rig being poor.
9629	A lot of potential, but at the end it is a poor game. The sound is the worst thing in this game, its so bad that i wonder how that ever release it with this, or their sound editor defenetly has ears problem.  Graphics are good. Gameplay is somehow clunky and this game really needs alot of pollishing.  Not for hardcore car fans.
9630	This game seriously sucks. It lacks content and feels unfinished. There`s close to nothing to do ingame, and it`s not even fun to drive. I`ll have to refer to kacperflak`s review of this game, because it issues most of the flaws with this game.   The developers are constantly fixing bugs, that should have already been fixed even before the game was released, and still the game has huge flaws in graphics, sounds, settings and much more. I do sincerly not recommend you to buy this game.
9631	0/10 - Because review scores are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  This game had potential but quickly turned into a Cash-grab for SMS and became a joke of an E Sports contender, with all of the community events in 2016 focusing soley on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t E Sports market.  Most cars and tracks are old models from other SMS games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for it. Some car classes are broken by the DLC cars, throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing F1 cars, the 72D will never keep up with the 78.   AI selection is absent too, so doing a mixed field GT race will have ALL THE CARS with GT in their title in the field, ever wanted to race against a GT40 while doing the Bathurst 12 Hour in a GT4 Mustang while still having the GT3 cars to overtake you? TOO BAD!  There also seems to be a load of bugs still, during online races I would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels, one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid, placing another car under me.  The FFB took me a year to get to a level where I could enjoy driving it, being a confusing mess and I only sorted it when I stopped using FFB setups that would be considered 'Normal' in my other wheel-based games.  AI is great in this game, aside from a few bugs that have the AI pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining (which ruined a perfect enduro race I staged) but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles, most of the rest can kerb-hop and battle for position sometimes, if the game doesn't go and supercharge them like it is prone to do.  You can have some fun with this game, offline it is a decent simcade mode.  As I have said before with other racing sims, wait until the second game and even then, give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess, which could have cornered the Gran Turismo for PC market that some of us have been waiting for since GT turned to crap.
9632	Stupid junky controls. I can't even change them.

9634	Stupid junky controls. I can't even change them.
9635	Worst racing game of the modern era. All of its competition completely blows it out of the water. Playing this the graphics reminded me of Gran Turismo 4 for the PS 2. But thats about the only thing it had in common with that fantastic classic; There are an amazingly lackluster amount of cars in the game. Seriously, theres about 3 road cars in the game, and 1 or 2 cars for each class that all feel the same as the other cars in the class. There are a lot of tracks in the game but I imagine its pretty easy to add a lot of maps if they have less detail and less graphical fidelity than Forza 3.  Controls with a controller are absolutely atrocious and if you plan on using a controller DO NOT GET THIS GAME PERIOD. I cannot even put into words how terrible it is with a controller, as many people on the internet forums have complained about.   Bottom Line: THERE IS NO REASON TO GET THIS GAME WHEN FORZA 6 AND GRAN TURISMO EXIST. This game is worse than the competition in every single way, most importantly content. I actually find it amazing that a PC game managed to have worse graphics than console exlusives.  Seriously, I think this game has less cars than that Ferrarri exclusive racing game.  1/10 worst racing game I've ever played. The only reason it gets as high as 1 is because it has a great options menu.   Oh ya, and some idiot decided to make the default post race button 'restart' instead of 'continue', so you have to scroll up before you press A or you'll be restarting your race. Seriously how stupid do you have to be as a dev to make restart default.
9636	I had kept tabs and followed this game since it was first announced and I'm really disappointed that the game has so many bugs its implayable. I can barely play the game! I crash so often I can't finish a race so I have to restart again... and again. Its stupid. Don't get this game right now until you know the bugs and glitches are fixed. Despite the amazing gameplay that I can manage to squeeze out before the game crashes... its not really worth it right now. FIX THE GAME PLEASE.
9637	Enjoyable for the most part but feels incomplete and full of bugs. Menus and interface are confusing and seem to forget settings often. Difficulty is not balanced at all through different events and classes making it impossible to get the right challenge. Graphics are great in places, underwhelming elsewhere. The anti-aliasing seems incredibly inefficient and performance through the most demanding sections is poor. Maintaining 1080p60 is difficult even with top-tier hardware. I'd struggle to recommend the game in its current state, at full price at least.
9638	Way too many bugs, going back to Assetto Corsa.... how do I get my money back?
9639	A buggy mess and there doesn't seem to be any patches to fix most of the bugs since launch day.  The AI is complete garbage and is guaranteed to crash in to you at least once during any given race.
9640	Not quite what I was expecting. The game looks great, but the gameplay is just not that great. The menu interface also leaves a negative impact, especially the text in the Career menu.
9641	this game SUCKS because ''realistic AI'' is just not braking while you go wheel-to-wheel with them so a corner they just crash into you..
9642	It's not very realistic to be honest, you barely turn left or right and the rear end is so loose that it feels like I'm playing an arcade game instead of a racing simulator. The Gran Turismo series and even Forza have a better physics engine which is kind of sad considering this is on the pc... This racing 'sim' does have an epic soundtrack also the graphics are really amazing to be honest but the game overall feels like an arcade.
9643	I still dont understand this game, I tried changing the settings to make more sense to me, but I still never understood how to play the game. I spent about half an hour trying to understand, but I never did. I got this game at the winter sale last year for $20 and I think it's the worst $20 I've ever spent.
9644	Don't bother unless you have a proper steering wheel. Unplayable with a controller. Also has a weird Glitch where the game changes your DESKTOP BACKROUND to something random.. Easily fixed by saving the theme but WTF?
9645	cant believe this is featured.  games broken for so many ppl.  not worth it, plz god save your money/time/non-gray hair.
9646	The game has about 30 cars. Some cars hit the pit wall while leaving the garage in auto drive. A few tracks aren't true to the real tracks. Nurburg has banners for Porsche. AI races as if you weren't event on the track.   Uninstall/10
9647	I was excited to see Project Cars come onto the scene especially with the open 'Free Practice' and open cars to pick. I've always loved Car driving sims and archade. In 1987 Test Drive came out (By Accolade) I used to start up on a IBC PC DOS machine. After a couple of releases from Accolade Sony came out with the Grand Turismo Series. I also injoyed the early Rally (Colin McRae) series. Great Car sims! Project cars is a great car simulator with really good graphics. Unfortunately it drops frames and the screen goes blank when I play with AI drivers. I have a Radeon HD 6870, i7-2600 Quad core processor and 16 GB of the best memory around. Don't get this game if you have a Radeon graphics card as it won't run. I have to go to task manager and cancel the game. To bad because I really like the way the game is set up. Until Slightly Mad Studios fixes this problem I can't recommend this game.
9648	Very dissapointing with too few cars, a stupid amount of bugs and broken online. Don't waste your money on this game, if you want a decent racing game get Shift 2 or get LFS/RFactor/Assetto Corsa/iRacing. Those are much better than this.  Stop downvoting this, it's true, try some of the other, much cheaper and better racing games out there and you will find a proper experience.
9649	My worst investment of 2012, SMS has promised us so much more. And I expected a decent multiplayer experience. The game is still unfinished and never will be, because the biggest part of the SMS team will be busy with pCars 2. I wouldn't recommend anyone to invest in pCars 2, just wait until it's released. Uninstalled...
9650	1 month after its offical release, the devs announced Project Cars 2....the first one still suffers from bugs and other problems. Don't support this type of underhanded business. There are better racing sim developers out there who are more deserving of your money
9651	Good graphics, but way too many bugs &amp; glitchiness  I prefer Assetto Corsa over this anyday.
9652	I've had enough now, the amount of crippling bugs you run into on a race by race basis is just too much. 6 more months of work are probably needed before it becomes a rather good racing game, it's not there yet.  Alas that's not going to happen, SMS focus has moved to PCARS2
9653	Do not bother with this game. The developers sent out a sub-par product and instead of fixing what could be a great racing sim, they announce Project Cars 2. They are more worried about getting money out of pockets than producing a playable game.   The Good: The cars are beautiful and the noises are great. Having sunlight light blind you as you enter the corner, not being able to see the exit, is an amazing experience.  The Bad: The cold tires are a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to warm up. You are completely worthless until they get warm and the AI just come screaming past. Can not touch the curbs, no matter the size, without spinning. Getting turned in on by an AI leaves me with 2 options. Take damage and ruin my race or get out of his way, spin and ruin my race. And the AI will turn in on you.  The Ugly: The AI. The AI are overly aggressive and drive like drunken 12 year olds. They brake way too early or way too late. I can not begin to count the times I have been punted off track by the AI behind just being plain stupid. The AI get in each others way and cause pile ups. The AI can drive through asphalt, grass, tarmac, gravel, and sand all at the same speed. They do not lift off, just keep going with out a care in the world and rejoin into the side of whomever just happens to be there.
9654	Not yet ready. The entire game is more like a beta. Many parts are not finished or buggy - some cars have broken physics while others are great, on some tracks the ai is downright broken, sound cuts out and session has to be restarted to get it back, HUD display costs 10fps ...  This has the potention to be great but atm it stinks of an early release. Take a look a few months down the line if things have been wipped into shape via patches.  Edit: After a few more days of driving I would not rate it either tumbs up nor down. The GT-races are really fun an intense. Other cars like to old classic F1 cars seem too much to handle properly for the ai resulting in chaotic races that are less fun.   As it stands I would say 80-90% of the content is great and the rest need some patches. It sill remains an early release but it can be whipped into shape.
9655	As it stands, I can`t recommend this game; I`m only glad I bought it from Amazon rather than Steam, as it was Â£15 cheaper. You can have all the pretty graphics, single player and multplayer modes and options you like, but if the basics are broken - namely the FFB and handling, you won`t be playing for long.  The default FFB settings for my wheel (T300) are so feeble that they might as well not be there, and no amount of adjusting the ridiculous number of settings improves this. And yes, I downloaded the `tweaks` files from the forum. Also, despite the description of the game as a simulation, the cars handle more like they do in Grid, rather than Assetto Corsa or RaceRoom; that is, they stick to the road come rain or shine. Until the handling and FFB are patched to make the game more playable with less effort, I recommend passing on PCars and, for less money - and if you can put up with outdated graphics and mostly South American tracks - Stock Car Extreme.
9656	to anyone considering buying this game because they played forza. please reconsider first, this is not forza.  the landscape and tracks are beautiful and the cars just the same.   but the control mechanics are sup par to the point where some vehicles are uncontrollable.   the steering overly sensitive where a slight turn can put you in the wall. the cooled tires are over exaggerated just the same.   counter steering is nearly impossible as it just sling shots you to the other side of the wall. the braking mechanics are a little slow where I feel a mclaren has the brake calipers of a 60's caddilac.   assists do not really help the mechanics in the game.   the driving lines when slowing down or brake are inaccurate where i mostl likely end up in the wall or in the field.   the AI's, are either really slow or make perfect lines to the point where it looks like they are riding on rails.  i had such great hopes for this game as i was looking for something to substitute forza and my xbox being in the military and unable to bring them with me.   i recently hope they might put out a patch for the game. I sure hope they do because i do see potential. but until then i dont feel i will continue to play this game!!
9657	Some of the cars handle unrealistically and it requires a lot of tweeking to get the FFB to feel 'right' with a wheel.  The A.I. is terrible.  The graphics are rather pleasant although tyre smoke looks ghastly.  The best part of this game? Supercarts on Nordschleife.  Spend your money on a better racing sim such as Assetto Corsa.
9658	this game is not finished. about 30% of promised features are missing. bugs, which are there since day one (and before in alpha and beta stages of testing) and dont let you even start the game properly still exist, dispite we being told 'we're working on it'. and instead of fixing them so we can play, they concentrate on fixing graphic settings and other unimportant things. this game is still a beta version  FIX THE GAME FIRST, THEN OPTIMIZE IT.  AND FIX THIS GAME FIRST BEFORE YOU GO AROUND ASKING FOR MORE CROWDFUNDED MONEY FOR PCARS2. PCARS1 ISNT EVEN FINISHED.  dont the develepors have any shame left? this is just unacceptable..!!
9659	I have a hard time recommending this game at this point. Every single update that comes out may fix some issues, but breaks just as much. This game is not fit for public release at this point, even after multiple official patches. This latest patch refused to let me calibrate my wheel properly even after 3 consecutive tries. It's apparent that nobody quality tests these new releases on any platform. Car setups used to be OK, but even after fixing my wheel on the 4th attempt, they still feel like garbage. Any wheels off the track now result in penalties that slow your car down in the middle of the race making it dangerous for yourself and anybody around you. This is not racing. At this point, the game is a joke.  However, the biggest joke of all may be the limitless level of unprofessionalism displayed by Ian Bell, head of the studio on their official forums. His conduct is enough to make anybody sick to the stomach. Silence the criticism, act like an immature child and employ moderators who somehow manage to act even worse. Say anything negative about the product and find yourself banned or accused of being part of some conspiracy. Full disclosure, I have never registered or posted on the forums myself. I heard of this through words of mouth and then proceeded to spend hours going through their major threads until I just couldn't stand any more. I would certainly encourage anybody who doubts these claims to go to the official website yourself, or look up some great YouTube videos including screenshots of all of this. This is one person who will not pay another dime for any add-ons or sequels thanks almost entirely to the conduct of their leadership.  Beware when purchasing this game. Even if the bugs are eventually ironed out (and that will not be any time in the near future), you are supporting a studio who couldn't care less about what you think.
9660	A complete buggy mess. This game was released about a full year too early.
9661	A complete buggy mess. This game was released about a full year too early.
9662	This game looks beautiful and seems to have a lot of potential but feels very unfinished and unrefined. My biggest problem with this game is the drive-ability with game pads. I'm not a serious racing sim player and I use game pads to play games. I love console racing games like Forza and GranTurismo and I've been playing these games for years and I'm pretty good at it. So as a console racing game fan whose most comfortable with game pads, I found ProjectCars to be almost impossible to play competitively without crashing on every other corner. I spent many many hours adjusting the controller setup and even tried out many setups posted by other people on the forum but it was still very much unplayable. I have given up trying to play this game until the game developers can fix the controls so a casual player like me can actually enjoy playing this game.
9663	Grapchis are 10/10. Game is broken arcade with racing sim features. 
9664	Worse Game Ever. Out of all the reviews you will red most complain about the graphics. Graphics are very good in my opinion. The really bad point which no one seems to mention is the FFB. You cannot tell what the car is doing, The 14hours I have played this game is fiddling about the the settings for FFB, watching numerous You Tube videos and reading through forums to find some half acceptable FFB feeling to no avail. Stay Away from this game! You have been warned!
9665	Game is incredibly buggy and the bugs from Day 1(of this five year ordeal) still haven't been resolved. Devs are now working on a sequel as soon as the first one put some cash in their pockets and don't seem to be fixing the important bugs that break this game.  Yes, I have hours put in to this game, but I still wouldn't recommend people give their money to this type of developer. Had I known the game was this much of an unfinished mess I would have never bought it.
9666	Meh game. Disappoiting in nearly every way. It lacks the production value of other racers and feels pretty bare bones. There are better racing games out there.
9667	I will try to be as fair with my review as is fair selling this 'game' for 50â¬.  Pros   vehicle variety   graphics may be considered good   Cons   horrible physics - To all who think this is simulator, I can assure you it is not. You can change the actual car grip by mashing throttle and brake inside corner and the car won't slide at any speed, try going smoothly and you are off the track. Some kerbs (those that are on the outer side of a corner) will throw you outside the track, so does grass which is apparently made from glue. Some kerbs however are not a problem for the car and you can cut low speed corners in full speed without punishment. Crests don't work at all. Collisions do not work at all. You go side by side and if you touch you are stuck the the other car until you hit the barrier. On the other hand you can bump into cars in corners without punishment and that looks really funny.   horrible AI - they will keep crashing you on the inside in corners   horrible UI - you can not edit controls from race (only in main menu)   If I find something positive about this game I will update this review. But now it is UNFINISHED and overpriced product. I am pulling my hair out now for buying it, should have waited for F1 2015.
9668	not finished at all.... only really any good on nvidia and even then it still looks bad. the simplicity of a racer is gone, and its no sim, far too easy.... play AC and 'feel' the difference. the FFb is broken completely and i just dont trust the latency of the controls - something is wrong at the core. I cant beleive that 80,000 gamers helped develop this title, alls i can say is that they were Nvidia contributers and not AMD. But that argument aside its still a poor title. Im so sorry that a paid 39.99 for this, it kinda reminds me of Shift in many ways seems as buggy and just plain sticky. I like the fluidity of racers and visuals and/or waving crowds are not part of the equation, it seems that glitz overcame the glory. The benchmark for me is Gran Turismo - it felt right and looked pretty good (and was always well above the usual 30 fps even way way back) Polyphony always understood the need to get the game moving right before adding or not adding things that will get in the way of the drive. Yes you can turn things down but it doesnt add more detail /definition to the handling of the car, the saved resources are not then spent on the physics they are just omitted, the game still plays far too arcady. i dunno really it may be good for you but i much prefer AC, take a car around a track there and im sweating after, and spend time watvhing every bump and sway on a replay.   UPDATE - on finally getting it on win 10 with new 15.7.1 driver all seems well FPS wise, but it still looks really bad, it tears even with VSYNC (which i just dont get?) it all still looks jaggy, even in 2k with VSR - how is that possible. Then there are the crashes.... system crashes, same error (cant remember it) I turned down the 290x and still same issues.... ill keep with it though cos it cost me 39.99 but i wish i hadnt have bought it... FFb seems better now though, on a plus point - but its still far from finished, and i hear they are already making PC2, the money merry go round never stops it seems.... and i read somewhere this is Playstations most popular racing title? really??... i will be buying the PS4 only for Gran Turismo when released, we all need a new benchmark, i mean AC is good but i reckon GT will leave us all speechless....
9669	Project CARS funded this game back in days. DEVs told us this game will be something extra... not only graphics but handling too... They had alot of time to finish game. Repair Multiplayer lobby and all other parts of game. But all important things are still broken.   + Graphic   - FFB broken  - Online lobby is pain in â¥â¥â¥ - Game crash  
9670	  The graphics look amazing, the car models are very well made and the track list (and models) are amazing. Now the bad They announced a sequel before the game was fully released (I didn't have the game then but was hyped for this one) (Game was also in alpha or beta stage) F1 cars are buggy (Clip into eachother and you both spaz out or only one person spazes out) The AI is also bad (Smashes into you too frequently) When using a controller (I use a Xbox 360 controller) the controls just don't work well out of the box and you have to tweak them a lot.  Basically I'm saying buy Assetto Corsa (yes the AI is also bad)

9672	Narrow Range of Cars Diverse Tracks Frustrating AI Drifting feels unrealistic Settings are awkward and some don't save  Overall game does not feel refined, as if it's still in beta - maybe I just expected too much
9673	Offline: Bots intentionally crash into you  Online: Players intentionally crash into you
9674	Huge improvement over Shift, but the is no limit to these cars. It's literally impossible to over drive the car.
9675	(Edited after coming back from my initial anger)  I haven't played much at all but I am already very disappointed... The physics are a complete nonsense. I expected something arcade-ish like Shift2 without the 'on-off' behavior, but it's actually neither realistic nor fun. The same car will understeer like hell on a curve, won't understeer at all in the rest of the track, high-end racing cars grip like a 60's Chevrolet... Tracks feel narrow and simplified.  I noticed that passed a certain threshold, you simply have no control whatsoever when high-speed skidding during the first second, then get back in control when it's too late. I didn't identify the exact circumstances yet, The kerbs behave like ice blocks with some cars.   (Edit) - Now I realize that when you break a bit hard, the cars goes straight, even when the wheels aren't locked.... your controls have zero effect until you stop breaking. I must say I didn't use any assistance, so I guess you need to turn on the ABS to have a more realistic brake system. Whatever. The physics are just ridiculous, I wonder who can still think that a winged racing car will slip everywhere as soon as you move the wheel a bit quickly, even on a tiny amplitude and at high speed. (/Edit)  I expected much better graphic-wise. The graphics have clearly been optimized to look good during replays, or at spectacular times (dawn, rain). However, during normal plain-day racing, they are not that great.  The AI is worse than in Assetto Corsa, although very random in quality. The noise engines, claimed to be a huge step forward in some forums are not as realistic as in Assetto Corsa... The sound is not as good as in any other modern sim. There are scripted pops and noises when you leave the stands, while the engine at constant revv... The sound is flat and lacks seriously of complexity. I wonder how it could souns so good in the Youtube video comparisons between P. Cars and other games.  I expected it to be a good arcade-ish game to complete Asseto Corsa, but in the end, I do think it's not even as good as NFS Shift... less arcade and yet much, much less fun to drive (Ok if you choose the 4x4 of course, high-power 2WD cars were way too wonky in NFS).  Saw an article about all the hype being somewhat crafted. Actually, it does make sense: ten of thousands invested quite a lot in the game and are promoting it, flooding the forums, trying to get a bit of cash by multiplying videos on Youtube. Many of the comments are just hilarious when you realize how the game really is. However, the 'positive' wave is so overwhelming that it probably influences the judgement of many. I am looking forward for finding the first honest review on Youtube, by somebody who isn't afraid to be seen as a troll.  A bad game? No. Just every other car game I tried is more enjoyable. This one simply has no specific quality in any domain. And more importantly, the incredible hype has no justification whatsoever. If you want something more funky than Assetto Corsa, better go for the old classics, from the first Flatout to the olds NFS, GRID etc, even GTR2 (not arcade I know, but the races, especially over 24h, are still without equal; and it's not a such hard game). They are much more fun. This one feels dull, it's only vain noisy agitation. Even Test Drive Ferrari, despite its huge flaws, was more fun. I guess I'll wait for a career mode improvement in Assetto Corsa.  Uninstalling ASAP, as it takes a lot of my SSD. At least I can get this back, unlike my 50 Euros, due to my pre-purchase.
9676	After playing this so-called racing sim, I'm pretty disappointed from what I've experienced so far. If you are expecting this game to be great out of the box, you'll find it frustrating. If you have all the time in the world and are some racing geek who likes to spend all day tweaking rather than driving, then this game is for you being provided with many options. Especially with all the delays, I expected some finished product rather than relying on the user to achieve what should have been. Force feedback is awful without any tweaks and some RACING cars will feel like a boat! It reminded of me driving an early 80's cadillac. I'm no expert and have absolutely no experience behind these cars but do understand that it shouldn't feel like driving a floating boat!  I guess I don't have to mention about the awful AI but will remind you that it will ruin your game play most of the time, especially if you're not at pole position. No wonder this game have an achievement that rewards you to finish first after a crash in the first corner...lol.  If the developer decides to fix all this and provide us user with at least the base minimum at default, it would have been great as it does have the potential.
9677	I thought it was realistic, but slowly realised that the physics are a bit glitchy. I then went on to play assetto corsa again. Then I realised that I have waisted money and time on this game and should of been playing an actual sim.
9678	This game has so much potential to be great but with bad optimisation for AMD cards and the amount of issues the game still has after months of multiple delays I just can't recommend it just now.
9679	The game is....meh, First off the graphics are fantastic, Weather effects are awesome to and the car detail is absolutly insane. The AI in the game is pretty silly really and makes no sense. To me the gameplay is not great, random sliding and braking dosen't really do what it is supposed to. Overall I give the game a 5/10 which isn't good enough for a Â£40 game. Not worth the money to me.
9680	This game was sold on lies. It is NOT a simulator it is an Arcade Racer, and not a good one at that. Project Cars has one of the worst Physics systems in a car game I have ever played. I have seen some people compare it to Forza in terms of style but Forza is my favorate Racing game and this one is nowhere near as good of a simulator. The game just feels so flat and the cars compleatly unresponsive. It feels as though the devs just said, 'make it look as good as possable!' and then some lowley programer said 'but what about the oter sutff?' and they said back, 'meh...' Project cars looks amazing but the rest of the game is bad. Apart form the thigns I have allread memtioned, the sound desine is horrible. I have never hered worse engine noise in a game. I literaly sounds like it was phoned in.
9681	Overall - Comes no where near as good as Assetto Corsa.  Pros -   Nice weather effects  Easier to setup your own online race with friends than Assetto Corsa   Cons -   Its a sim wanna-be! Assetto Corsa does handling, sounds and driving feel way better.  Even the AI cannot stop the car in the wet or dry at the end of a lap causing it to crash and invalidate your lap time even after you run a perfect lap!!  No headlight reflection on the over the top shiny cars in the wet even when you are inches from the car in front.
9682	claims to have feel.. first game ever in racing i have felt literrally nothing,
9683	Pretty much unplayable on a top AMD card - wasted money, don't buy if you own an AMD GPU.  Not to mention a plethora of other bugs, such as facing backwards on a starting grid, AI not being affected by tyre wear and fuel, broken pit stops, getting stuck in pits during online qualification sessions and way more.
9684	Let me start out by saying that I never write negative reviews about anything, at least until now. Alright, so I've been waiting for this game for some time now. I've always enjoyed racing games, and I was excited that the PC was getting a big sim release. I started the game up and as soon as I started playing I ran into my first issue:   1. The game runs poorly on AMD cards (and some NVidia users have also complained). I understand one manufacturer having the advantage over the other in a specific game, but a 290x being outperformed by a 760? That's a bit insane. My setup is an i7 2700k @4.4Ghz and an R9 295x2 with a 2560x1440 monitor, and I had to turn the settings down to roughly medium/high just to get playable framerates (45+, it's not very stable).   Alright, so I managed. I was having some fun doing the online time trial, and I was excited to start my career the next day. So I got up, started the career in the Clio Cup, and something just felt off:  2. H-pattern shifting DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. I figured this wouldn't be an issue, but apparently you're locked into using the exact transmission type that the car has. Yeah that's great and all, but what if I ENJOY using H-pattern? I personally hate flappy-paddle, and I can deal with sequential, but my Logitech G27 doesn't have a sequential option...  So those two reasons might not throw everyone off, but for me it's enough to say that I should have waited until there's a fix or at least an explanation for these issues. Is it a fun game? Sure, if you can deal with the flaws. However, the game currently feels unfinished, so I'd wait until the issues are fixed or wait for a price drop. I REALLY hope everything gets fixed though :/ . So maybe soon I'll change this review to a positive one!
9685	Possibly the single greatest example of bait and switch I've ever witnessed.
9686	Project sucks, physics are terrible just like FFB not worth your time. Fancy graphics dont make the game. Got bored in 20 min of gameplay lol back to Assetto Corsa 300Hrs + and still loads of fun. BTW that 1.2 hrs that it says i played 1 hr of it was messing with the FFB settings.
9687	I am Logitech G27 owner with some mods. After I got used to Assetto Corsa (after about 100+ hours), I couldn't get used to Project CARS physics. Mostly because of almost dead force feedback. Yeah, the SIMULATOR which doesn't have proper force feedback! It feels like you are driving on a totally flat road (except moments when you driving on track border or somewhere on grass/sand and wheel starts heavily knocking and except Nordschleife, where your car feels like jumping on the road) which sometimes feels too slippery on some surfaces. You have to be extremely alerted in order to catch the feel when your wheel is lighter/heavier and where it goes. In rain you have nearly no information, your car just go sideways if you are not really cautious. No other information is provided unlike Assetto Corsa where any bumps, camber, dips are felt and you can react on them accordingly.  Sometimes car setups are ridiculous and I don't understand people, who set Default Setups rule in multiplayer. F.e. setup on Renault Clio Cup with front and rear wheels toe-in set to 0.9 degrees. Seriously? Very stiff rear suspension on Toyota GT86 which makes her oversteery. Wat?  Graphics is sweet, however, night on some tracks looks awful. But I love rainy days, it looks pretty nice.  However, there are many other things that Assetto Corsa lacks as a proper simulator, f.e. night &amp; day transition, weather conditions, engine/oil/brakes temperatures (brakes temperatures were implemented with last patch to some cars in Assetto Corsa) and soft-body physics for cars, but even in Project CARS these things doesn't make any real sense. I never experienced my brakes overheating (on any car they get stronger when warmed up, but on typical sport cars it is kinda weird, they aren't supposed to handle such temperatures), never experienced engine blow driving with around 115 degrees on engine and 122 degrees on oil in endurance races.  So, If you are looking for a DRIVING SIMULATOR with a proper steering wheel, you'd better be looking for something else. I don't recommend this as a driving simulator but it is up to you to pick your poison.  UPD: Just in case if anyone will have a question why the hell I am still launching PCars and play sometimes if I do not recommend it. PCars has a little bit more content, better graphics and features that I like, but still it doesn't mean that I changed my mind about driving simulation. We're buying games to have fun and make use of it, aren't we?  And yeah, after last launch I had remembered one more thing - bad network code. People with bad connection or little bit of lags might ruin your race even if they didn't want to do this. Opponent's car can teleport right into you and launch you in the sky, chasing opponent can lag and punch you on braking point and happily continue to race pretending that nothing happened (which actually DID NOT happen to him and he just watches you running into a wall for no reason or because of 'small' tap in your rear). Since the AI isn't really good and I prefer to play with people this is a really frustrating thing for me. And there are a lot of bugs connected with network code like missing cars on replays, wrong colors, non-functional wheel after joining session, desync, black screen after load and etc.
9688	I'm going to fly in the face of opinion here and say PC is a disapointment. The content and graphics are nothing short of spectacular.   However, a driving game sinks or floats based on its physics engine and this really lets PC down. It is simply way too arcade-biased and suffers from myriad flaws that ultimately spoil the experience. A case in point is that the F1 cars are more benign in handling tems than the likes of the R500 and the Atom.   The sound is also very bad for some reason and sounds like it's been presented at very very low bit-rates.  If you love arcade racers, then jump in with confidence, but if you're looking for a sim, I'd look at Dirt Rally instead. It's a real shame because PC is the best looking driving game every produced and has raised the bar for other developers. If only they could have done the same with the physics model for the handling.
9689	12-18 fps in low-medium graphic settings, while Asetto Corsa runs 80fps in high? Sorry guys, this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥, i cant enjoy. Optimalize it, and i will try again.
9690	Edit: Patch 7.0 has completely broken the force feedback on my DFGT making it impossible to race competitively. Constant sawing motion going around any corner. Weird thing is that it seems to work fine offline. Devs, please fix your game!   The game looks great, sounds great, handles..... on a controller it handles terribly still but it's better.   But the main flaw with this game is playing online. It's purely unacceptable the way cars bounce around the track due to poor servers. I can't recommend this game anymore. It's beautiful, there is no doubt about that but the online experience is so flawed. Having contacted the company and having no response is also very unprofessional. This is unfortunately an unfinished game and it looks like it will remain that way
9691	I bought this game to play it with my Oculus Rift DK2. I'm running this on a Corei5 4460 (4x3.2Ghz) and a Radeon 290X. Unfortunately I don't get the required 75fps for smooth VR gameplay even though I put all the graphics options to low. I'm running the most current Oculus Runtime and have up-to-date drivers. I blame this on the deep integration of Nvidia Gameworks in the title. Would not recommend th game and if I could get my money back I would.
9692	Dissapointing. The game is difficult, and realistic, but not right. Payed $60 for the Special Edition, week or two later, BUY THESE DLC's!!! â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. I am so sick of these money grabs. The game is okay, but for some reason, could never truly enjoy it. Between crashes, bugs, and extremely over-complicated setup, you'd need to spend 10 hours configuring your driver settings so you don't spin out every five seconds. I even used a racing wheel and could not even get close to what it feels like to drive a real performance car.  The game looks great, but in reality, it's just a gag for money. Oh and Project cars 2 is coming... because this game is perfect?
9693	A perfect case of a waste of money.  Played this game at a friend's house, we were both huge forza fans before we switched to PC, game was fun so I picked it up on sale. Since my first race it has had a bug that will make it lag a few seconds, then go in fast forward to catch back up. Makes it completely unplayable. I really wanted it to work so I began searching for a fix. Tried everything I could find, even going into my bios and changing CPU settings that may have been causing it. Which they shouldn't anyway, since all of my 100+ other games worked completely fine with the cpu just the way it was. While in my trying to fix it (starting the game up, trying to do a race, still didn't fix it, try something else, still didn't fix it, etc.) I went over my two hours and am now stuck with it. Judging by how the forum posts of people having the same problem were from 7+ months ago, I'm sure it will never be fixed.  I really wanted to like the game, and when it works is so fun, almost better than my beloved forza days. However when the game goes into warp speed and sends me through a turn into a wall it outweighs the good. Another shining example of why early access is garbage. Why would they fix the game or make it work for everyone? They've already made their fortune.
9694	I spend more time messing about with the steering wheel settings than I do with the game to review this properly. Will update the review once I actually get to play the game for a little bit.
9695	I purchased this game for the linux version, which has been officially cancelled. the game is probably fine, but developers broken promises are not.
9696	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage. Spinouts going 10kmh, â¥â¥â¥â¥ chat ***'s out everything, amazing phyiscs.... Audi still broken on the Nurb, 7th gear still can't full accel or you will slip out... but he guys theres new content for you to spend some more money on, sorry haven't fixed â¥â¥â¥â¥ yet, too busy milking me mother.
9697	Worst game physics ever , with any car even with traction control on you have uncontrollable wheel spin and the rumble strips are undrivable as they launch you of the track and same thing with touching a bit of the grass it just sucks you on to the grass seemed a lot worst with the karts and formulas all of this playing with an xbox controller that works fine with the f1 games i have . ive tried setting up the controller like in the forums helped a bit but i just think they've got it totally wrong with this game compared to real life racing
9698	UNPLAYABLE!  After waiting two days to download this game (I live in the countryside) I click 'Play', wait for all the initial start up messages to do what they do, and finally reach the first 'game' screen but then, I suddenly get an 'Unhandled Exception' ERROR and cannot proceed any further.   This is just unacceptable, (I understand this problem may be unique to my machine but I feel I should warn people just incase.)  If this problem becomes resolved, I will change my review.
9699	This game/sim does so much correctly, but the flaws are very â¥â¥â¥â¥ing present. What you see here is a great game, plagued by the strangest design choices. When you are spinning out of control over and over in a 1 million dollar car, because you hit the throttle just a bit too furiously....that's not added realism; it's just utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. This takes its toll when you are in lap 7 out of 7 and you see your first place quickly descend to a proper 23rd spot on the leaderboards ---&gt; there goes 15 min of intense racing. Again, this game is gorgeous. The few cars it contains feel real, until you start actually driving it. I'm not new to the racing sim genre, but yet again this is a game that manages to heavily overdo it on the 'realism' factor, making it far from it. All the factors in this game from starting out in go-karts to changing weather during races. Make this quite looker, but a good handful of cars are close to undriveable at a realistic level.  My pagani should do more than okay at 100km in a weak right turn, the actual result however is you spinning out and the competition is gone. Legit raging over a game very rarely occurs to me (a few times in my dark souls playthrough). This game manages to make it into a habit. I can't tell if I like this game or not, it does keep bringing me back in because of a lack of better racing games on pc. With Forza Horizon 3 on the way I'm very positive; but I'll probably never touch this game again :S   Conclusion: It has a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of charm to it, but you'll run into so many excruciatingly frustrating moments.  (side note: really not that many cars to play around with, I understand licensing can be tough for an upcoming studio; my point still stands however)
9700	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9701	Graphics are nice. Driving is fun. Everything else is crap. Menus are horrendous.   Controller setup is awful: you cannot choose which USB device is your controller, so you have to physically unplug all other peripherals to get your steering wheel to work..  Online racing is crap: Crashboxes are much bigger than the cars. The menu for an online session is severely lacking, and you cannot change course, cars or anything else while a session is started, forcing you to restart it over and over if playing with a friend and wanting to race another course or with another class of cars.  The options menu is not available in the game, so doing controller and graphics tweaks is an incredibly tedious process where you have to make an adjustment, start a race (with the included loading times), test, leave race (with loading times) open menu, tweak more... repeat ad nauseum.  If the core gameplay wasn't as good as it is, this would easily be one of the worst games I've played. Yet, with all its shortcomings, I can not recommend it until the dev get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together.
9702	I'm the saddest that I have to give a negative feedback to this game, because it could be by far the best racing game available.  In short: This game is unfinished and in its current shape, doesn't worth the price they ask for it, and will be soon replaced by Project CARS 2 anyway.  The physics are great. The graphics are beyond anything I've saw before, Each car has its own unique characteristics. Each track is different, ther are a lot of them, you can try anything from karting dromes to coastal roads of France. The car pool is not the biggest, but definitely impressif from go-karts to roadcars, super sportcars, Formula cars and LMP-1 racecars.  Why is Project CARS is still a bad game? Because it is unfinished. It has some bugs, that could be excused for a freshly released game, but it jsut cries out loud that there were areas which were completely dropped during the development. What am I talking about?  1)OPTIMALIZATION The game is basically unplayable unless you have an nVidia card. Any ATI GPU and you're done for. I'm lucky, but many others are not.  2) CUSTOMIZATION There are a fixed amount of possible liveries, but they have no connection with teams or anything. Basically you can run any livery you want. Meanwhile you can not choose or edit your own helmet or driver suit. The game will choose one for you for every race. So even during a championship you will most likely drive in different helmets and suits, even though they may not even match your car's livery.  3) CAREER It cries out how much they wanted to put into this one. For instance, when you start your career, you have to pick your nationality and favorite number. That's great but they are never ever used in the future. You'll never hear your national anthem, you'll never see your flag. And as I already said, you choose from a pool of preset car liveries which have fixed numbers on them so unless you find a livery with your favorite number on it, you will never race with the number you have picked. The whole career is flat and pointless anyway. Basically you win races to be invited to other races where you have to win again to get some more invitations. End of story. It is shallow, uninspired and has no point whatsoever. There are a whole set of drivers and teams for any level of your career form karts to LMP-1, but all the drivers and all the teams have the exact same abilities. There is no better or worse driver or team. Heck, they don't even have their own livery, they just randomly pick one form the livery pool. So basically there is no point in switching teams in the same championship, because there are no 'better teams' who could help your career more.  5) NO AMERICAN RACING The game totally lacks American-style racing. There is not a single oval track, not to mention championships. There are only tow signs that they were planning to add them as well. The first is that there is a NASCAR-type car you can drive, although I didn't find any race during the career they would be used. And there is a 'Coming soon' section of the career mode where presumably the oval races should have been...  4) AI Oh, my gosh, where should I start? This is by far the worst and the most unacceptable part of the game. The AI is not affected by tyre wear, tyre temperature, brake temperature, track temperature, mechanical failures, rain, trackside objects (kerbs, grass, sand, gravel) basically anything that would make your life harder. It's the worst during long races when you must concentrate on saving your engine, brakes and tyres while the AI can push as hard as it wishes. In the rain the AI loses maybe half a second per lap. Heck, sometimes AI is even faster in the rain than it is on dry! Did I mention that AI cars are almost like concrete blocks? They have no problem ramming into you and you'll fly off the track into the wall, but should you touch them.... you fly off into the wall. Oh and in every single-make championship AI strength is totally randomized, so basically anything except the LMP and GT series is a mess, you can easily win the championship without actually winning a single race.  6) THERE IS NO SUPPORT Sine the release of the game, the developers are basically disappeared and they barely help those who have issues with the game. Even worse, they are already talking about Project CARS 2. Previously, they said that the game is a platform they intend to constantly expand and develop, so if you buy the game, it will be a long-time investment. Staff members already said on the official forum that the game will get a mere 2 years support and in 2017 Project CARS 2 would be released.  So do not pay for this game. It is unfinished, and not the game we have expected it to be. Its technical support will be suspended soon anyway, so my suggestion is to play whatever simulator you already have and wait for Project CARS 2, which hopefully will make us forget this game..
9703	It's sad to say, but ProjectCARS stays way behind the expectations which WMD raised during the years of development. A racing simulation to me is above all about the grade of immersion it delivers. There are many positive or even extraordinary features like the graphical representation, the number and quality of tracks, the amount of available cars, the time and weather effects, animated spectators ... you name it! But all these features are oblivious, if you don't get the feeling to really drive a race car. The fact, that to this day it is not possible to properly use a Fanatec Porsche GT3 v2 wheel, is not the reason for my negative review; I suppose, the issue will be resolved sooner or later. It seemed to be of more importance to support PS4 and X-Box. What really bothers me is, that the game's FFB quality is outright unacceptable! The myriad of weird undocumented ffb-settings are agonizing, the grip levels are strange at best, not being able to save individual car setups is a sad joke! I am very disappointed, that SMS diverged from their initial path at a very late stage of development and drifted towards some kind of good looking arcade race game. And that's what ProjectCARS finally turned out to be: a pretty good looking arcade title for your living room console ... and that's not for me!
9704	1) This game isn't very optimized. A lot of screen tearing at 50 to 60 fps?! why I don't get that in any other games.   2) Online not working. All lobbies are empty. Just a ghost town.   3) Game menu is terrible. Cant find most important things, headache to get used to.   People say Asseto corsa is better, might be better optimized and was half price too. But promotion ended. This game is a mistake.   _I have an NVIDIA card btw. not even poorly optimized AMD card._  I willing to Trade this game!! just so you know.
9705	Beautiful game with great playability, but a serious and ridiculous show stopper of a bug causes it to insta-shutdown on my PC. The head of the game development studio is extremely rude and argumentative with people reporting bugs, leading to the impression (the correct impression) that he doesn't give a crap about customers.   Painful customer service in a complex and unfinished game. Pretty kickstarteresque.
9706	Project Cars could have become a real nice racing sim. Instead it went the way of pure action driving like the Need For Speed series.  Damage? - not existing, crash at 200 into a wall and then just ricochet back into the track, allows for awesome advantages in lap times; Tire-physics? Claimed to be there but at such a bugged (yes, I write this after release!) level that you wonder what happens. Sometimes you even wont need to drive to heaten up your tires (and thats magical when the tires are getting warmer than the surrounding while standing still);  If you dare to drive a street car with show oil-temperature (like the m235i) you wonder how f****ing high you can get the RPMs and still have the temperature sub optimum - in reality the m235i is quite fast at its optimim level as all the electronics and cooling systems are programmed to reach that as fast as possible and then hold it. I wont even come to the 'handling' of it. I've driven the m235i in real - on and off track - and I have no clue what the programmers though when they did its physical model. Its not realistic, more a sarcastic approach to mime a random car behaviour.   If you want brainless action where u can bump into walls and easily push opponents of the track -get this game. If you want a racing sim, move on and leave the store page asap.  For me the game was a complete waste in money as its neither realistic tracks nor realistic cars - just a mere unfinished product where your automatically driven out of the pit area (yes right - you *cant* drive yoursel, a magic hand will do that) and miss nearly all real rules a race would have.  From a 'functions' perspective this game is even inferiour to the 97's 3dfx Formula 1 - at that time real physics was not easy possible, but at least they implementec the basic racing rules like pit stops, starts (standing + flying where you are in full control of the car prior to green!); 
9707	Single player is unplayable thanks to the terrible AI and completely stupid contact physics. A slight bump flips your car. Not fun, not realistic, not worth my money.
9708	Not a lot of cars.
9709	As of patch 1.4, still unplayable on AMD gfx. will not play again until Windows 10 is out.  in 20 hours of game time, I've had the unhandled exception access_violation crash to desktop 241 times. no official fix on it, just time consuming 'fixes' that never changed anything
9710	The AI are too aggressive, they do not try to race, they try to kill you. I get pushed off the track by AI and I get a penalty for cutting a corner? and when I lose 6 places? Thats just stupid.
9711	the game aint starting anymore please give me back my money
9712	There could be a lot to love about this game, for somebody else. I find it infuriating.
9713	average looking car game, but there is no feeling of speed. I find myself spending more time tuning the car than actually driving. Over hyped.
9714	Using a controller? Want to crash into dirt and walls every 3 seconds? Buy this game, it's for you!
9715	game is getting better and it starts to make fun  ai is stil â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ specialy in first coner they tend to pile up and online playinfg is fun until them f**king cheaters com online  also tracks are stil not acurate,  speedsensetivety aint there,  setups are stil messed up,  exiting the pits is messed up if youll even just look at youre acceleration pedal it wil spin and the rest wil trash you starts in wetlaps are massed up in the same way   and now all the cars including the dlc cars are in 1 big list id prefear if they would be devided per class or leageu  wich brings me to the next thing; if you check the vehicles specification it wil say bhp max speed etc in most if not all cars you wil never make that speed and then there is the tirepresure in many ocassions youre tires wont seem to heat up even if you put more or less air in them to have more friction for more heat also it would be prefeared if it said what the optimum tirepresure wou be for the tires or if that would be the default setting and you could work from there.  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ advanced setups and all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cheater spoil all the fun online so i dont advice this game uless youve got a couple of nice friends to play with
9716	I began sim racing in 1996 at 31 and you would think that after all of these years that game makers would start taking notice of what the long term gamers are doing and what hardware and equipement they are running, but still to this day only 3 of the game makers (Racing Games) cut the mustard. The rest will need to make huge inprovements in order to escape the realm of kiddies game makers. I run both rFactor 1 and 2 and also Assetto Corsa, I don't like iRacing but that is more of a personal issue rather than about the game itself. These games are the only racing games to date that cater for hardline sim racers, they cater in everyway for every sim setup whether VR, Multi Screen, single screen, cockpit etc. All the rest are merely glorified console versions which cater for single screen and occasionally VR. They will never be regarded as true simulations because they do not cater for the 10% of us that build or buy multi screen cockpits for ourselves. Today I purchased and installed Project cars and all associated packs. I immediately liked the clarity of the image, very good indeed. But was put off straight away by a very poor and primitave User Interface. I am in a homemade cockpit with 3 x 27' monitors running 5760x1080 resolution, these monitors are in a fixed position with a roof over them for a better sense of imertion. The left bezel of the left monitor and right bezel of the right monitor reach back at 45 degrees from the centre monitor to just behind my ears giving me a realistic drivers seat view. Project cars supports as many monitors as you like but they must be run side by side in a straight widescreen line with no more than a couple of degrees of angle, so basically it is stretching 2400 x 1080 res over my 3 monitors with some horrible stretching and incorrect angles going on to the left and right monitors. This basically makes the game unplayable to anyone used to multiview. So before buying this game take in to account that it is not directed at the hardline gaming community it is a childrens game for laptops or single screens, in short it is nothing but a 1990's arcade game with pretty pictures. The cars have a very arcade feel to them even with all driving aids turned off. So, don't waste your money if it's games like rFactor, Assetto Corsa or iRacing that get your rocks off because this is nothing more than Grid with a different user interface although just as bad of an interface. Now I must attempt yet another refund from Steam for yet another childrens game. If it supported multiview I could get used to it for nights when I am tired and want an easy drive, but in its current state it is useless
9717	Now I Race in real life and I have to say that every racing game is still hard for me but this game takes that to a new level I only played for about 1 and a half hours and i can tell you if you don't understand the heel pressure, Break pressure, and esc. even a little leave this game alone. This is definitely a hardcore racing game if you want to drift they may has well made the car tell you 'are you crazy drifting in a car!'. But there is some good parts unless hardcore is good for you THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING but with good graphics comes issues like RUBBER BANDING, and tremendous lag!!!! My computer doesn't have a bad a graphics card its actually pretty good its a nividia 700 series and i run the game on all medium so to me this is unacceptable. 5/10
9718	Remember this game is really not a sim. It's a cross between a sim and a arcade game. It's like something between a real simulator like Assetto Corsa and a arcade game like Drive Club. Most tracks are not laser scanned and the FFB (Force Feedback) will not be as good as Assetto Corsa.  It is still a very enjoyable game. Developer will have to really do something to fabricate some artistic licensed FFB on those tracks without FFB to really make the game kick for those who are simulator fans and owns a set of steering wheels.  I must say I bought this game for the weather effect which Assetto Corsa do not have. I am loving the weather engine ... every moment of it. So if you are looking for pure simulator as advertised ... don't be fooled it's not, and may never be.  AMD cards owner currently seems to have issue with frame rate issue during AI matches, especially ones with too many cars involved. The frame rate drop is so drastic it's not worth AMD card owner to get the game until it's resolved. I am using a single nvidia GTX970 Asus with not much issues.  The user interface could have been better design. It seems the beta ones looks better than the released version. Current one is difficult to use especially selecting the car's skin can be tricky business. Others including tuning setup of vehicle has no graphical representations , eg graphs or charts ... all numbers. Given the time they spend on development and a few major shifts in release date , it's quite dissappointing.  The focus quite alot on the career side of things. However you cant buy or buy parts to upgrade your cars, or keep a garage of cars which are made and tuned by you. You could however saves tuning setups on the stock models to load them up later. Which is very limiting for the arcadie side of the game.  The multiplayer side of things is strange as well. The server searches for games in your region as defined by steam. So america players will see servers in america, and uk players only the uk ones. So for region with little players you have to literally change your region on steam setting to get into a region with populated servers to play in.  So ... here's my take on Project CARS.  If you really wanna experience a good sims I would say Assetto Corsa still does it better, it just doesn't rain in AC's world.
9719	This is a hard one.   Project Cars is possibly the greatest Racing Sim I've ever played. Graphically amazing. Completely unforgiving physics that makes you feel like a pro when you get it right. But...  The online play is HORRIBLE!!! I'm putting it down to poor servers, as the lag is ridiculous! Also, there needs to be some kind of player racking system to create game filters, as some drivers just ram others off the road and receive no punishment for it, when others take racing seriously. Which is what this game is, a serious sim for serious racers.  SMS, sort this game out and I'll recommend it happily!
9720	This game would be amazing if it were actually finished yet. Too many bugs to mention - some game breaking, some are minor but extremely annoying. The AI is an abomination. At higher difficulties the opponents are extremely agressive. Above 85% it's practically a bloodbath. Below that you can zoom by the entire pack at the start of the race and finish with a 10 second gap to 2nd. Very disappointing.  Hopefully Ian Bell can get it together and actually finish this game because I think it would be fun to play if it were properly done.
9721	Don't waste you $$$...
9722	I cannot recommend this game, be it for VR or not. If you've played racing simulators like NFS Shift 2, or Forza, then you'll be in for a disappointing shock with Project Cars.   The graphics are sub par despite what the pretty screenshots look like, and yes, I have a powerful enough PC to run this smoothly at its highest settings. But I can live with that. The deal breaker for me is the driving mechanics. It's as if the game has very poor or limited driving physics simulation as the cars do not react the way a real car would when turning, especially at sharp corners, it's noticeable and completely breaks the immersion.  So unfortunately I cannot recommend the game.
9723	Truly brilliant if you never mod it. Try to change anything and it breaks. The developers are not helpful, and the website is far from the best. The gameplay is good, but looks a little slow even when your doing 60 at 299fps. Far from fully satisfied. Good basis, but their already moving to pCars 2. This one isn't even finished.
9724	Wow, game came out a month ago and pit stops still don't work. I also love they are looking for money for the next version. I'm getting a refund.
9725	Is it a good racing game? Yes.  Does it feature a good selection of cars and tracks? Yes, kind of limited but good none the less.  Is it realistic? Kind of, but there are better and more realistic racing sims.  Would I recommend it? NO.   It may be a fun game to play, but I can not support Slightly Mad Studios' crowd-funded creation, the reason being that they already have another crowd-funded creation in the production process. They've released an unfinished product that still needs a lot of work to be a strong contender in the genre of racing sims, but they see more profits in releasing their next â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ unfinished product.   If you're looking for a good racing sim, you're better off buying Assetto Corsa, rfactor, Game Stock Car or basically any other game in the genre.   If you're after a 'serious' kind of half-sim this would be a good game, but I still can't recommend it. Do not only yourself a favour, do the entire community of racing sim players a favour by not buying, and supporting, studios like these. 
9726	Project Cars is a solid racing simulator, although it loses its 'new car smell' relatively quickly. I had been waiting for this game for a long time, and now that I've played it, I can't say it was 100% worth the anticipation. What throws me off early on in the game is the ridiculous amount of time they force you to race go-karts for before you can start racing real vehicles. I spent a solid 5 hours working through two full seasons of go-kart races before I was able to move up to an actual car. Also, I prefer having to earn and save money to go and buy the car I want like in Gran Turismo or Forza, but with Project Cars there is no money system, and your rewards for winning races comes in the form of racing team contract offers which net you a new car to race with. Don't expect any visual customizing either, aside from preset paint schemes.  Its a good game with a good selection of tracks and cars, but it lacks the refinement and small details that other racing games have gotten right in the past (the surprisingly low resolution images of each vehicle when you are picking out the car you want to race with in Free Mode and the non-controllable, PAINFULLY slow panning camera when you want to look at the actual vehicles come to mind).  You will most likely enjoy the game if you are into racing games, but don't expect to get the same 200-300 hours out of it like you did with Gran Turismo back in the day.  Update: Game crashes every 10 min or less. For some reason I was able to play the first 6 hours with only one or two crashes, but now I can't make it through a single race without it freezing up. I probably won't be buying Project Cars 2, and its offensive that you would start developing a new game before the first one is completely stable. One more customer lost.
9727	I honestly feel like I was robbed. This game has the worst handling I've ever encountered. the cars grip and suspension physics are just trash. The only bright side about it are the accurate sounds, which occasionally are broken. Don't buy this game if you're looking for a Forza or Grand Turismo equivelant.
9728	I'll admit, this is a 50/50 decision for me, I wouldn't say it is a game you should avoid like the plague, but I could never fully recommend someone to buy this game.   The positives: The track selection in this game is very good! I think it covers a great variety of countries and locations. I also think there is a good enough car selection (If anything, a few more would be great).  The main plus point of this game is the graphics. This is a stunning game and they have got the track detail bang on. I have been to Oulton Park and I can safely say they have got it spot on. The cars are incredibly detailed and look wonderful.  The negatives: This game is buggy as hell! The amount of times I have had to restart the game because the top left of the screen has gone black is stupid. The menus have stopped working for me a number of times and the force feedback settings for my wheel have compeltely broken (With an alaming knocking feeling coming through the wheel a number of times). The online gameplay is horrible! I've played a number of hours against friends and I've disconnected (On a solid internet connection), had the game crash and had settings been randomly changed.  There is a complete lack of a working penalty system. Sure the game will punish you for cutting corners and track extending (Within reason), but if you t-bone someone online at the first corner, the chances of you getting disqualified are random, sometimes you will, sometimes you won't.   My final issue with the game is the physics. I play this game with a force feedback steering wheel, but it just doesn't feel realistic, which makes the driving stupidly frustrating.  OVERALL VERDICT This game just doesn't feel finished. The fact they have released a game of the year edition adds salt to the wound, as this is by no means a great game. Parts of the game don't work and driving in this game is not enjoyable at all. However, it looks great, there are some good tracks and has a decent career mode.   I wouldn't recommend this game to a casual gamer but only to someone who is a die hard racing game fan like myself.
9729	This game is not the simulation it aspires or gives claim to be. The way it simulates wheel friction and wheel load is just very off, appallingly off. Common driving techniques such as countersteering, weight shifting or drifting is not possible in this game.  I am an old time drving enthusiast and game physics coder and from what I can gather testing various things this game do not simulate slip angle of tyres. It's completly disregarding asymptotic friction and just apply wheel torque in the direction of travel of the wheel.   As a result you can do infinity donuts in this game just holding down the accelerator after initiating a spin. That is something that just doesn't happen in real life, nor anything that happens in other racing games claiming the 'simulation' label.
9730	This game had so much potential, but sadly falls very short of the mark. Firsty there is the frankly comedic collision physics in which a slight rub turns into wheels leaving the floor and a potential roll. Secondly the absolutely ridiculous AI, who will ram you off track during qualifying, meaning you will receive a very harsh penalty for leaving the track, sometimes invalidating your current and next lap. To sum it up, every race is a clusterf*ck and if the ridiculous AI do not ruin your race, the comedic collision physics will. I paid Â£22 for this, and am annoyed, if I had paid full price I would be livid.
9731	Really disappointed in this purchase. Simply put the game is just incomplete, both in content and QA testing. To sum up my experience below, it's a 6/10 game. Outside of graphics, there isn't one thing it does great, or even better than other options out there. I would say casual race fans looking for a 'sim-light' experience should pick it up on sale, but the game breaking bugs make me hesitant to do even that. Look for one of the many better, cheaper games available for sale.   Visually it's quite nice, and although it doesn't quite compare to the previews, it still looks better than pretty much any racing game out there. However there are several graphical glitches that still need to be worked out. Most that I've experienced have been cosmetic, but one seems to cause the framerate to speed up after breaking . It messes with the physics and throws your car off the track. It's hard to describe: the framerate is still smooth, but it's like your car suddenly has a jet strapped to it for a few seconds. I have a pretty beefy rig and didn't have this problem when I first started playing, so I don't know what's causing it. It only happens in the rain so I'm unable to race in what is supposed to be one of this game's big selling points: its dynamic weather (which otherwise looks great and the ability to set multiple weather conditions during a single session is awesome).   Additionally, there are a plethora of other bugs relating to the gameplay itself, but are far too numerous to list here. You can even find an acknowledgment of several specific bugs from the developers themselves, though even those are a fraction of the whole.   The user interface is horrible, and I can't think of anything positive to say about it other than at least the text is crisp and clean. I thought Codemasters had horrible menus, but I had no idea. Everything is counter intuitive and buried in pages upon pages, to the point where changing your vehicle's livery is an adventure.   If you're planning on using a controller with this game just forget about it. I have no idea how anybody could control it with a standard Xbox controller or Dualshock. Using my Logitech G27 wheel has been fine, but the force feedback leaves a lot to be desired. I swear I spent more time reading through pages and pages of forum posts and guides on how to fix the FFB model in this game, rather than playing the game itself. There are a lot of customization options, but most are beyond your average user. When I bought this game I didn't think I was enrolling in a course on the finer points of FFB tuning/modeling, but that's what I was forced to sit through. Even then it wasn't enough. Many have just downloaded mods to improve the FFB. Bottom line is that it doesn't work well out of the box after calibration.   The driving model itself is ok (think an improved version of Need for Speed Shift), and depends on the car. This isn't close to the sim its been advertised as, but that doesn't mean it's poor or that you can't enjoy yourself. Most of my time was spent with open wheel racers, and I felt that the lower class formula cars were really fun and felt good. I tried to work my way through career mode but unfortunately the karting is atrocious. If you set the camera to follow behind, you can actually see them unnaturally gliding over the surface of the track, like some kind of buggy hovercraft.   The reason I finally shelved this game was because of the hyper aggressive AI. Now I don't think ANY single player racing game has nailed the AI, but at least they didn't ruin the races. Anything under 80% was too slow, and anything above was like racing your friend in Gran Turismo back in the day. They just slam into you constantly through corners, totally ruining any chance of a race. After I got into the grove with the Formula Rookie cars, I started a new career from that level and was finally having fun. However I soon got to Sonoma and the AI made turn 1 impossible. Every single time I took the turn an AI car slammed into me, throwing me off the track. I restarted the race no less than 18 times. It happened again, and again, and again. The last time I just sat on the track spun out sideways, blocking another AI driver to see what would happen. After about 30 seconds of just sitting there, he decided to ram into me and physically push me out of the way. DIdn't even try to go around. That was it for me with Project Cars until the developer does some serious work.   There are other issues with the accuracy of feedback from the community (I bought this game in part because of content supposedly on its way, but turns out it was just backers with a financial interest meaning that 'they have faith the developer will add the features), the developers willingness to listen to feedback, their intent to fix issues, and the typical DLC/funding nonsense (we were supposed to get a free car each month... so far only paid DLC packs and an announcement of the sequel's funding campaign(, but this review has gone on long enough and you can find all of that with a simnple Google search.
9732	This game at first looks great. However, looks can be deceiving. Project Cars seems to be riddled with bugs. The game regularly crashes. I would definitely not recommend you buy this game right now
9733	Handling physics are an absoulte garbage for a game released in 2015 .  Al still hasn't ben fixed. Developer is a huge crybaby deleting negative comments about this game and banning users from forums. They promised new cars every month - HUGE LIARS! Can't complain about graphics. They're amazing.  5.5/10. Sentence - Tag Simulatoin should be changed to Arcade
9734	The gameplay for project cars is fantastic, the cars feel great, good sounds, decent graphics. While all of this is good, when I went to play online there were only 2 games found and only one of which actually had more than 1 player in it. If you hope to play online, forget it, there's hardly anyone playing and its only a week old.  As for single player, it just seems like they threw it together last second. You can start from pretty much anywhere you want, with unexciting results for finishing races. There are no rewards, nothing.   Dissapointing  Pros - Graphics (sometimes, only really impressive if raining) - Gameplay - Sound  Con  - Just about everything else
9735	The game was buggy as hell, the sound broke constantly and the car selection was extremely limited.  I had the left steering bug and it ruined the game.
9736	I wish I could recommend this game but my big problem is the shifting. I am using a wheel and stick shift sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt and I cant figure out why. Why not build in some presets for some more wheels with shifting units. For me the game is unplayable without making the shifting automatic or using a controller and thats no way to play a driving game.
9737	Negative review untill they fix the dam' xbox360 controller stability
9738	VERY POOR OCULUS DK2 SUPPORT  sorry but if it says it supports it then it should work I understand it the oculus requires being a bit creative at times to get it to work but with not menu support and not being able to get the game to show correctly at all on the headset it wasn't even worth the Â£23.99 sale price   as for the game its self I thin you need a full steering wheal setup as the Xbox control is very bad even after playing around with the settings the cars are just out of control and im a big GT and AC fan  the upside is my money was refunded but not to my bank account so thanks for nothing steam you really do have my money so much for a refund policy!  
9739	This is a very good game and has a great career mode. I love the features of the pit engineers and how the games is so vastly customisable. The physics are ok however with some improvements they can become as good as the physics of assetto corsa. The biggest problem for me is the ai or the computer drivers. They remind me completely of the original drivers in assetto corsa but with updates that game was mastered. The ai have no sense of the other drivers and are happy to smash into you and dont give way to let you overtake. They then crash into you you flip end up in 16th and are either out of the race or your car is in such bad condition you have no chance of catching up. In my opinion i dont want to have a rewind feature like forza does however if the ai are going to stay as they are you find yourself having to restart the race and then the same happens. I have spent up to 45 minutes trying to complete a race without being crashed into and forced to restart if i want to have any chance of winning the race. This game was hugely anticipated but it doesnt meet the excitement that it betrayed. To me Project Cars is in beta and feels like a very much incomplete game. With a few fairly major improvements the game can be fantastic and better than its rivals of Forza and Assetto Corsa. I would recommend buying this game even though their is a few major problems I think the developers will improve these features if they want to stand of chance of becoming worth the hefty Â£40 price tag. The reason I have given a Thumbs down simply relates to the price. Â£40 for a game that in my opinion is worth Â£25 maximum. Many may not agree but after playing for around 10 hours i seem to find myself aimlessly starting a race getting crashed into then pressing restart, on a constant loop.
9740	The game is still in beta as far as I'm concerned. Don't bother complaining on the official forum either; criticism of any kind will not be tolerated (as per the official instructions of Ian Bell, head of SMS) and if you do you will get banned from the site (just as I've been).   Here's a very small preview of he known bugs (patch 1.4)   - when I leave the pits and I tell my crew to not refuel or change my tyres they still fill my tank up and give me tyres that overheat from the first corner (yes there is a bug within a bug, we're through the looking glass people).   - In replays debris from previous sessions are shown and opponents' cars change into different models.  - In sector 3 of road America the split times of the cars is broken and will show you timings that are minutes out.  - There is also an invisible wall that will very rarely and randomly appear on the start finish straight of road America. Hitting this wall at racing speeds is all but guaranteed to end your race. (Has not happened to me directly but I have been in a session where my friend's car suddenly stopped and said he had hit an invisible wall)  - A.I cars do now actually pit in wet conditions, but they often do it too early while it is just beginning to drizzle and when it does turn into a full on storm they won't pit again to change from intermediates to rain tyres.   - A.I drivers occasionally fail to do mandatory pit stops in races or leave it until the last lap (doing so reduces the time lost in the pits)  - FFB will occasionally run into issues ranging from minor (lack of feedback in the wheel) to game braking (wheel will forcefully turn itself to full lock, even when cars are in perfect condition) requiring me to turn off and on my wheel, or in rarer occasions I will have to restart the PC (does not happen with Assetto Corsa)  - When joining a MP session that has already started and is in practice/qualifying mode you can occasionally be stuck in your pits unable to go to track. You can also join a lobby and be stuck there unable to join the session.  I'm sure there are more that I have forgotten about (that have happened to me or that I've witnessed in game) but I've made my point. Not all of these are game breaking but all of them are capable of ruining a race/session.   I also haven't even begun to talk about the non-bug related issues.   When it works though (which is 30% of the time) it's probably the best racing game money can buy.
9741	When maxed out the game is beautiful. But at that point you just stare at it, don't race, don't even move your car. I paid fill price and quite honestly have no idea why. I have 980's and i can't max this game out, and even when i do moving in a race whether maxed out or playing optimal nvidia settings i still either way lag out, get choppy and its just a painful experience. About to drop the setting even further but at this point i scratch my head if the console version is this buggy. Just like all of BANDAI Namco games you get all the BS of buggyness. I thought this would be the end all of racing games for me but i just might pickup a xbox one and buy forza because at least that game is beautiful and plays beautiful. And at this point its a game i feel i need 4 980 TI's and still couldn't run it smooth.
9742	WARNING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME: Career mode is absolutly terrible as you will no doubt rage quit due to the ai that will literally crash you off the track.  Realism - basically an arcade racer, dont think about even coming close to certain curbs as you will just spin out even if you only put your front wheels on the curb the rear will spin around, secondly the ai manage to go over the curbs like their nothing, i follow the ai for hours figureing out how they did it. However if you carry the same amount speed they do, you will spin out, making it impossible to overtake on certain areas. This game cannot compare to the likes of rfacter and iracing, with realism. However this is one of the few semi realistic games that offer a career mode which is a plus, also the graphics are quiet good compared to other racing games otherwise its a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ compared to what is already out there.
9743	I instantly regretted buy it the second I both it, I got a feeling itâs going to be â¥â¥â¥â¥. Well what is it? Itâs NOT a SIM, but I knew that before but hype train will say it is. Itâs a simcade just like GRID was It is also an evolution of NFS:Shift and with that come âgreat AIâ.  MENU/HUD â If you like Windows 8 you will love it if you are like me you will hate it, buttons in menu are so bit the biggest I think is 856x570px. Itâs ridiculesâ¦ In fact they are so big they have to split menu in to 2 screensâ¦ Hud is good enough you have limited option for positioning and look and you can save itâ¦ but game will never remember that in fact you will have to change the hud every time you pick a new race. Itâs like the game is saying âyou like that setting do you huh? Well â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Iâm going back to defaultâ.  CARS/ TRACKS â for the budget they have lineup of cars is disappointing, very disappointing (get ready for a ton of DLCâ¦). No lesser scan track, itâs not a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of them but itâs ok choice, but Itâs nothing special.  AI â Ehâ¦ well itâs better than NFS:Shift they will not crash to your â¥â¥â¥ before the corner a least, but if you collide with them itâs the end AI and you will be glue together for the end of time unless something magical happen and you will be free. So basically when itâs working itâs good but when itâs not its the worst AI ever.  GRAPHIC â is great itâs not like the videos and scenes before release but that was expectedâ¦ AMD user will have â¥â¥â¥â¥ time in races where FPS will drop massively, and they will rise when you will be driving alone. Devs will say oh because AMD wasnât interesting in helping usâ¦ REALLY?! Sure letâs just slap NVIDIA logo everywhere because they didnât pay us or anythingâ¦  GAMEPLAY â Some cars handle better than others but overall itâs meh as I remember correctly GRID is better. WEATHER EFFECTS! Why oh why devs donât make them Iâm looking at you Kunosâ¦ Rain looksâ¦ I donât like it does not look realistic and itâs definitely not realistic to drive in it.  So overall itâs ok nothing special but sometimes you can smell that NFS:SHIFT stench and itâs not nice. I will never recommend an ok game for THAT price!  Sorry for my engl... nah â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.
9744	I wanted to love Project Cars but the physics are nothing special, AI is really weird and it doesn't run well even on a 780 Ti. (at reasonable settings @1080p) plus.. It's not fun. It's just not fun. In the words of Jeremy Clarkson: 'Itâs a bit too clinical' This is more like an engineer's game. Sure, it's EXTREMELY pretty and all but.. it's just not fun.  Plus they cut a lot of features and there are tons of bugs left.  Oh and, no Honda S2000. I MEAN, COME ON.
9745	I have about 112 games in my library. Also have a Vive. This is the first game I have ever refunded. The graphics, as others have said, are great. I just got really frustrated. Felt like driving on glass, endless spinouts. Maybe I'm just not a good driver but the constant crashing and system freezes didn't lend themselves to gaining experience. No other games freeze or lock my PC like this. It was cool trying on the Vive and is quite an experience. I may come back to this if it gets some patching and stability and a lot of work on vehicle and driving physics. As it is though it just isn't worth it to me. Im going to go buy DOOM for theater mode.
9746	This game is still in early access !  Tons of bugs ! Good graphics ! Tons of bugs ! Good sounds ! Tons of bugs ! Bad career mod ! Tons of bugs !   If you get a wheel : move on !!!  The game is unplayable at its current state (1.4) cause the FFB is buggy and glitchy since I have reset my settings and tried to calibrate my wheel again.  The devs don't even care about it.   See the devs politic : Instead of fixing the FFB which the majority thinks it sucks, they're expecting us, to tweak the FFB with third party files. There is a 'sticky' on their forum about it when it should be directly in the game.  I have a lot of games and this is my very first review because i'm mad that I haven't been able to play the game properly since 10 days.    Much love to Asseto Corsa and iRacing, games that are taken care of....
9747	It doesn't quite work as a product.  It lets you navigate the menus with one xbox controller, but only drive with another. For me it crashes in the second corner of the second track in career mode. Consistently.   Ammendment: I recently upgraded to an intel based system (was running an 8core amd before), and it no longer crashes. Maybe they patched it, or maybe it just doesn't like AMD.   However I still don't like the game as a whole. There are still things in the main menu listed as 'comming soon' despite it supposedly being a finished product, and the gameplay's rather restricted from my point of view.  The first commentary I heard in the game began when I was halfway thru the kart series - I didn't even think they had comments until then.   Having played some 30 minutes in the 'kart1' kart, I find the game monotonous and uninspiring. There's no urge to finish the season or do anything. Doesn't feel like a finished product.  I'm going to uninstall the game now.
9748	I bought this game with hope of great 'new gen' career mode and a lot of beautiful cars. Career is just like a nightmare, I started with karts and now I have to slowly progress throughout every season with hope of getting contract for F1 or GT... UI is confusing, number of cars available in this game made me laugh... controller settings are not explained, hard to set up for Xbox controller.  Game is extremely boring, you dont feel the car like in other games, engine sounds very similar in same category cars, low number of players playing online   You may like this game however I prefer worst graphic with Gran Turismo 6 on my PS3.
9749	Over a year since release date and it's still impossible to race solo with AI or with people online unless you join a league. So many countless problems that don't get looked at.
9750	I have hundreds of hours on Sim Racers but I do not get to enjoy this game. Icannot recommend this game based on my humble opinion. This game falls into a gray area between Sim Racing games and Arcade-Casual driving games. My recommendation: For casual racing, nice graphics and physics go for Assetto Corsa. For hardcore SimRacing, go for iRacing.
9751	Such a shame really. When I heard about this game, I though brill a game to beat Assetto Corsa. OH how wrong I am. The AI on this game is terrible, they will just ram you constantly and spin you off the track. The game will lag the moment you add AI, and I'm running a 4790K and SLI GTX980 yet I still can't get solid frames in a race.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. Infact, Ridge Racer back on PSone is better than this game.  Okay, the graphics are beaitufl I won't lie. The cars are really detailed, as are the tracks. But... It's just shocking. They've had ample oppertunity to optimise the game... But no they're now focusing on releasing Project Cars 2, which I'm sure will be just as bad.
9752	'Thrustmaster supported' does not actually mean their products work. Are there any blogs with useful information? No. Are there any informative procedures? No. Are threads full of people who stick to the topic and provide clear info? No. Great graphics but integration is not reliable.
9753	Disappointing in so many ways.  Force feedback was added late and it is still not properly done, you need to spend a lot of time tuning and configuring to get something decent out of it.  Tire model? There are two levels of grip: plastic and not-plastic - both lack the flex or rubber tires. Not really the way rubber tires work according to different temperatures, does not handle properly things like flatspotting and heat cycles so it is not as 'lively' or believable to drive with.  Car simulations are overly generic and simplistic: not enough of vehicle-specific characteristics in the handling. There are values to change but they don't behave like you would expect.  Visuals in promotions and trailers are nice though.  As a game it might be decent but as a simulator it is not enough to satisfy experienced drivers. Accomplishments leave a fake feeling.  There are better choices available. Even previous title (Shift 2 Unleashed) from the same developers is better than this..
9754	UPDATE: Uninstalled on Hdd and reinstalled on my ssd, game runs so much better. review may change if I get consistantly better preformance.. Still caution though, especially if you don't have an ssd.   When the game runs it is a very pretty very fun racing sim. It feels very immersive, and really makes you feel like a racecar driver. The only things missing is maybe some more cars, and it'd be nice if you could buy and customize cars to race with. All cars are unlocked from the start, and the only customization seems to be real complex technical stuff like tire pressure and such, but no big deal the game is really fun... When it launches.   The reason for the negative review, is that about 90% of the time I launch the game, it shows the first logo, then goes black when trying to play the opening cinamatic. I have to ctrl alt delete out and open task manager, and then reclick the game window, ussually around 3 times if it is going to run at all, after that i end up ending the task. It has NEVER ONCE launched on its own with no troubleshooting. And once I get it running, if i alt tab out to change music or something, it is black screen again.. :/  When it does launch and work, I get from 60-90 fps at very high- ultra settings besides FXAA. So it isn't that i can't run it.. Can't get a refund as i didn't play this game until around a month after I bought it, so it didn't meet steams refund requirements. This is the first steam game I've had that legit doesn't work. :/   Buyer beware I guess..  My Rig: i5 4570 k @ 3.7 GHZ, gtx780ti, 16 gigs ram, game on WD 1tb hard drive.   If you have any fixes comment below.   Thank you.
9755	A bit underwhelming so far. My main point of criticism is the car handling which is pretty much hit and miss. For example the Radical SR8-RX is nearly undrivable without driving aids and even then tends to spin out in slow turns at the slightest push on the throttle. Also most of the options and settings are poorly explained, if at all. The 'digital manual' is a joke and not helping at all when you want to know what some hard to comprehend menu settings are all about. Also I am not sure if the career mode will hold my interest for long with no incentive other then achievements. But this is more of sandbox racer and with that I am fine as long as the racing is thrilling. AI is very convincing already and can only get better with future updates. As for now, I can't really recommend a purchase and adivse to wait a few weeks until most of the problems have been fixed.
9756	Dont waste your money get assetto its a far better simm this is just an arcade game too much time wasted trying to make it feel like a simm but you never will
9757	As someone who does real-life track racing, I can tell you the physics model is stupidly unrealistic. If you go into any corner as fast as you do in real-life, or even maybe just 30mph (in any in-game car) the tyres will suddenly, completely and unrecoverably break loose and you'll just slide straight into the outside barrier no matter what you do. If driving was really that hard in real life no one would ever even complete a lap without an accident.
9758	Found a 16 page PDF on how to set up your FFb so it feels somewhat real,,,, 16 pages of tweaks just to feel some feedback in a racing game...... errr no thanks, I will go back to GTR2 and actually feel when the back end is sliding out
9759	If you want a game thats expensive and then makes you pay an extra 50 quid for the good content, buy this. I only play it because there's nothing else in my steam library, it's a pretty shallow game aswell and it's very generic. Good graphics but the delivery of the product is dreadful. Get Forza for windows not this 3/10 overall.
9760	Absolutely useless. I have Logitech G920 wheel and the pedals are the wrong way around i.e PCars thinks the brake is the accelerator and the cluch is the brake. Then in race the FFB takes over and rips the wheel out of my hand as if the game was trying to steer the car. What a usless piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9761	I really regret buying this game. Very dissapointed. Extremely limited choice in cars. The game feels like an alpha test.

9763	This game is clearly unfinished ! Dont get me wrong its a very pretty game but there is a lot of little things that will bug the hell out of you, such as the unhandled exception crash which effects the majority of people ! The handling feels as if you are driving on ice, online is poorly thought out and the a.i in single player are all over the place. I feel this game was rushed for release. NOW for my major concern - i posted in the forums stating that i felt the game was clearly unfinised and isnt quite ready for release, it was deleted in a few hours !!! thats CENSORSHIP.........
9764	This game is pretty, no doubt about it. But when you compare it to its peers as an actual driving simulator, or even a comprehensive motorsport game it comes up way short.  Some glaring issues include: -No way to comprehensively track lap times. You will have no holistic way to see how fast you did a hot lap on a given track with Car A versus Car B. You can only see your fastest lap in a given car on a given track by entering a new game.   -No way to tell if ABS, stability control, or Traction control are on in game. This is pretty infuriating when the weather switches to rain.  -Weather physics are just wacky. Torrential downpour? Please reduce speed by 5mph and proceed as normal. Post rain wet track? Better bring your iceskates! Consistency is just not there.  - Again, lol physics  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdQBpWoXpU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22s&amp;noredirect=1   - Force feedback setup is nightmarish.

9766	Stunning game... As in probably the best yet against Grid / Asetto.. Physics are great &amp; I think once the bugs are sorted it could be really good.  At the moment Its unplayable to me.. Every time I pit in the car seems to sink into aspalt - sparks fly like I have 4 flats... I also have HUD indicators that randomly disappear.......This game has been out long enough now for this kind of flaw to be ironed out &amp; looking at the forums its not a new complaint... It really is still a project &amp; shouldnt have been released
9767	Right now, I cannot recommend this game, the core aspect of it is very cool and fun, racing in just about everything from karts to Formula 1 (or Formula A in this) , however the AI is awful, on 100% AI difficulty it feels like they are first time drivers too scared to hit the gas pedal, they also do no respect your racing lines and will turn into you causing crashes, I have to play with damage off because of this, cause there nothing like going into a turn with that lapped car swerving right into your side causing you to fly up into the air and ending your race. Save your money, Get F1 2015, or wait until this mess is fixed.  On the note of AMD cards not running well, this is not a problem for me, however I've seen lots of people who have AMD cards saying it runs poorly. Be warned on this.
9768	'the bugs make it better!' no thanks. was not pleased with this 'simulator' not enough customizeation and i dont like how the options are set up. no settings menu, and doesn't really explain everything all to well.

9770	terrible! too much lag!

9772	I was really looking forward to this game. I wanted something i could pick up and play whenever and even hop online. Sadly this game doesnt deliver in a lot of areas. The AI in career mode is quite terrible, you will be forced to restart many races from them crashing just after the start of the race. And if you do get a clean start, be ready for them to not care about the race line and take you out. This isnt even the worst part. The online is remarkably bad, mainly trying to find games. That should be the easy part, but with the severe lack of normal filters you would expect, its a nightmare. Half the time you just stop playing because its such a hassle. Ive played this game for months hoping it would get better. I was hoping to stay away from subscription based games, but i think im going to need to go back. This game just dissapoints me everytime i come back to it.
9773	Ill Keep it short, waste of money  4/10  Good variaty of tracks Not enough Cars NO CARRER MODE.....
9774	I want to like this game, but it falls short to other racing sims and simcades. The roster is strong, the driving is great, and the tracks are represented well from their real life counterparts. Physics are top notch giving each vehicle its own unique quirks and driving styles, but the short list of available vehicles and limited customization leave a lot to be desired.   While earlier games (shift 2 and shift) from the devs had bugs of their own, they were easily fixable through editing files. Although the game also suffered from a small roster, cars could be upgraded, tweaked, modded, and personalized by the player. Not possessing the same complex physics however like Project CARS shift 2 and 1 were both delivered an enjoyable racing experience that was more varied than the rigid and strict environment Project CARS offers.   There's also the penalty system that was created by Stalin himself. Touch the grass? INVALIDATED. Go wide and slow down? INVALIDATED. Hit a wall or car? INVALIDATED. Personally itâs comical to read in patch notes how penalty implementation is constantly being tweaked and updated to be 'fair' under the guidance of the community. There's nothing fair about it when 6 inches off the track on the backend of Nurburgring instantly invalidates your current time as well as the time for the next lap because going wide in a turn was such an advantage. The community must be full of simracing Hitlers never even spending a second on an actual track that want to make sim driving harder than real life for 'muh realism.'   With Forza 6, Horizon 1 and 2, Grid, and Shift offering a better simcade experience with customization, and Iracing, Simbin, RaceRoom, and RFactor offering a better simulator, it's hard to explain what Project Cars is striving to be. Unlike niche games like DiRT Rally that offer an entirely different motorsport discipline, Project Cars is competing with other platforms that simply do it better with more to offer. Even Assetto Corsa, which is in a similar state as Project CARS, at least gives the ability for consumers to add their own cars, tracks, and other mods to the game.   Project CARS needs a defining quality that sets it apart from the rest of the available sims and simcades while delivering a less restrictive playstyle. Pretty graphics and physics can only go so far if the content and game mechanics are lackluster.
9775	The game is seriously good but It hasn't worked past the second day I bought it. I dont understand how a game can go this long without fixing the worst of its crashes, better yet even the most minor ones. Project cars will have you on the edge of your seat tightly gripping your controller rminding yourself just how much you spent on your gaming pc so you don't smash it to pieces because the bloody thing just doesn't work. I want my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
9776	This game has potential, and is a ton of fun IF you can get it to work, but it's full of bugs and weird hardware issues. If you're not willing to swim through a litany of bugs and issues, I cannot recommened this game.
9777	This game sucks please don't buy it, I know I have a lot of hours in it but trust me - it sucks jut don't do fall for the trap like I did.
9778	I have played this game from its early alpha versions in 2012 right through to the current release. It tries to be everything to everyone and rather than focussing on doing a few things well , it does all things average. Patched with layers upon layers of bandaids , the wounds continue to bleed and infection has set in. This game is terminally ill and will never recover. The developers deny this , and don't take kindly to their customers pointing out that their baby is on its death bed.  If you want a good driving sim , avoid Project Cars at all cost.
9779	As of writing this review I have 207.6 hrs. I have purchased every single DLC for this game. Even as late as 1 day of writing this negative review.  I really want to support the devs on the absolutely beautiful game but jesus, where to begin?  I just simply cannot reccomend this game. There are too many issues to list here.  Head over to the official PCars forum and look at the massive thread sizes of technical issues:  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/forumdisplay.php?121-PC-Technical-Help-amp-Support   Do you have the time to read through 100s of pages of users trying to group-think their way into solutions for game issues that devs are completely unable to fix?
9780	Ill Keep it short, waste of money  4/10  Good variaty of tracks Not enough Cars NO CARRER MODE.....

9782	I have an AMD R9 290+ , and i cant play even on 'Middle'-Graphicsettings , this is just a Nightmare. Ive waited for this game so long &amp; and this is all u have?! Shame on you!  It's not SMS fault? It's not AMD? I don't freaking care.. just fix it , now!  ANYBODY WHO HAS AN AMD GPU , DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!
9783	absoulty sucked.. says its still running on my pc ( and its not ) now i cant delete this damn game or do anything with it
9784	Good game, however theres one thing that annoys the hell out of me and thats the cut track penalty you get even when your knocked off the track by the AI or other players... its a problem thats been there for awhile from my research on the issue so I don't expect it to be sorted anytime soon or ever..... but if you can look past that then its a great game.
9785	Plays great, but comparing to Forza it lacks in content extremaly.. don't make PC2... why?? give us content here, your game is capable of 12k resolution.. no new game needed
9786	Loaded with bugs. Almost unplayable.
9787	im not saying this is a bad game, i just dont like it and i honestly would not tell my firedns they should buy it.  the game is stable runs like a champ maxed out even though my card is throttling at my middle power state, and its quite a pice of eye candy. but the lack of a free roam and lack of destruction makes it just another boring sim racer. also things like tire pressure being in somthing called BAR instead of PSI and using MM instead of IN made me not able to understand the tuning of the cars. its a shame this game dose not play more like hoe NSF undercover did becase other than a low fun level its an amazing game, and to some poeple this game is probboly perfect but it aint for me. somthing else that bugged me was lack of amarican cars and lack of car variaty.  not only that, i can fine tune all this small stuff that would be super difficult to do in real life... but i cant do things like motor swaps and body kits and diffrent transmissions. i payed 10$ for the game and after an hour i was not haveing fun and it did not look like the fun was coming. i wish this game would get an overhall becase from the core its amazing.
9788	- No progression - Can't own any cars - Very little personalization - Horrible controller controls  If you enjoy doing nothing but racing then this is the game for you.  If you actually want some content then unfortunately you're going to have to buy a PS3 or Xbox One to play Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport/Horizon. Once again PC gaming will still go on with boring racing games.
9789	you got an AMD card? dont buy it. simple as that
9790	After spending too many hours on Assetto Corsa trying to shave milliseconds of my laptime just because it was fun I came here expecting I'd get somewhat of the same experience in a game that offers quite a bit more variety. I was hugely disappointed. Mostly because the lack of fun and challenge compared to driving in the actual simulation game mentioned above.  And what comes to variety? The cars feel too generic. Jumping from everyday roadcar into a full blown monster is more meh than anything else (again, comparing to Assetto Corsa, where the â¥â¥â¥-clenching is real). The career does not offer much in terms of achieving anything, as it gives you the opportunity to go race in any league/serie you want from the very beginning. Then you just grind onwards and it's meh.  So, if you're a fan of awesome simulator games, move on. And if you're looking for awesome arcade game, move on.  .meh/10
9791	Unfortunately unable to value the full potential of the game, due to bugs. Therefore cannot recommend game for everyone as I do not consider this game as stable enough. Pros:  - Music - Career - Lots of tracks/cars Cons: - Very CPU intensive (I had i3 3225, it was bad). More than Assetto Corsa or Grand Theft Auto 5 :-/ Why? - Buggy: slow motion bug, almost cannot play. I upgraded to i5 3570K and GTX 970 OC result not improved much, having 60+FPS I do expect same bug. No feeling of smoothness.  Medium graphic settings on my previous GTX 650 Ti does not looked so incredible, Assetto Corsa looked better. I upgraded to GTX 970 OC graphics look good, but slowmotion bug still appears from time to time. They should have made Early Access before final release as Kunos did.
9792	Great to see the are one Project Cars 2 already , and great to see all the freaking bugs still in Project Cars 1 Great Job guys , Excellent buggy game let's make another .
9793	+ The game has Great graphics. + Track selection is really good  - If you are playing using a wheel you will have to spend time tuning setup for each car individualy. Out of the box configuration gives NO feeling aside from suspension load. Menu structure makes this process miserable, confusing and as a result long.    
9794	I hate the handling!!!!!
9795	Im using r9 290 and the Framerates are horrible...i hope there's a fix to this problem
9796	Sorry, but I really cannot bring myself to enjoy the game... It's already boring with 10 hours of gameplay, and I'm even going to argue, the road car selection is horrid, It needs to be more extensive. The pros I guess, first person in the rain looks absolutely stunning but the third person driving physics are disgusting, It's all wonky and arcade.   I feel like the devs could do some drastic changes, before they ask for DLCs. I love the concept but, honestly 5 years of production is quite hard to believe, and the graphics aren't exactly matching the previews I was obssesed with...  If theres no drastic changes soon, I would do anything for a refund, I'll update my review later, but at the moment, this game is on the edge, lots of steering wheel players complaining about handling and movement although I use a controller and on most cars it feels great.  Pros: -Decent graphics -Sound on some cars is alright -Racing custimization is really deep -If you like rFactor, you'll like this -Fabulous rain driving experience -AI is better than most games -Decent smooth 60 FPS on GTX 970 Superclocked Maxed out  Cons: -Career mode is so bland -Car selection sucks (Sorry but it's true, theres barely ANY Japanese cars) -Some cars handle like its in Alpha development  -Future DLCs that will spam the users -Road cars are really squishy with horrible braking. -Theres not really any skid sounds -Really overhyped damage, the damage SUCKS! -Pit crew? You mean the guy standing there with a sign?  Sorry, I can't recomend this $69 game to anyone who loves sim racing like I do, I'm just providing constructive criticism, I hope all changes and Project Cars truly overcomes it's barriers and becomes one of the best racing games out on the market.   
9797	Ambitious, but clearly unfinished.  Pros: It looks pretty Decent selection of cars Nice selection of tracks It looks pretty  Cons: There's a plethora of glitches (I've experienced some of these  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gafhAP3UEC8  ) The physics are aweful for you, but excellent for the AI (typical of Slightly Mad titles) Doesn't run well once you get a few other cars on the screen (practice sessions and time trials are fine though) Doesn't run well on either of my rigs (and neither are slouches)    Bottom line: Go back to school Slightly Mad, clearly you didn't graduate...
9798	i've played for 60 minutes so far.... no wait i've been at a loading screen for 60 minutes because everytime it loads the race everything works but the graphics just freeze after i adjust my seat. great game ...
9799	waited so long for this game and wanted to like it so much, but i just don't. I love driving games, but this just isn't what was promised...very disappointed in almost every aspect of the game.wish i didn't waste the money.
9800	Game is a broken heap of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9801	Says it wants to be a simulator but falls short. Force feedback on a wheel is nowhere near as good as ac and the physics leave something to be desired. On the upside a very pretty game with nice features.
9802	Can i give this back?
9803	Honestly I have had fun in the game, but I can't recommend it :(   The physics is really not what I like! After playing Iracing, Assetto corsa or even Forza, this game doesn't compare to them in my eyes.
9804	There is a lot to like about this game. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it unless and until they actually finish the game. For me, Steam's new refund policy came at the perfect time, as PCars was the first game I bought after it was announced, and is the first game I've wanted to refund.  I'm not going to list the bugs I encountered, as that would take too long, and other reviews do enough there. I'll just say that I finally initiated the refund process after the AI put me into the wall during a rolling start.
9805	Game runs terribly on Radeon Cards (R9 290 here), crashes randomly, multiplayer is laggy like hell and the worst thing: It always uses another livery than the one i selected for the Aston GT3, this pisses me off!
9806	UPDATE! I've been told that it is possible to map a button to the 'reset view' option. But it is not located in the VR menu as I expected. Rather it is in the controls menu somewhere. I haven't tested this myself, but thought I would update my review.  -------------- Bought this game for VR, and even though it is the best racing sim I've tried in VR, it is just too rough on the edges for me to recommend. 'Gaze to select' can't be disabled, and if you edit the xml files to disable it yourself, you can sometimes end up not being able to exit a race because the reticle is needed to make the controller selection reach the 'continue' selection.  Graphics are pretty disappointing in the game overall. Cars look stunning, but the tracks are low-poly and with smudged textures. Plenty of z-mapping problems going on in many places aswell. The scenic routes are basically a nice road with some rough estimation of the terrain beside it. Several rocks sortof just lie halfway into the ground with the edge being really visible due to how they are placed one after the other. Just looks rough overall.  Car handling seems a bit weird to me. Car starts sliding really easily, but perhaps I am too used to arcade handling, so I'll let that be a neutral point.  Overall Project CARS, as a VR game, disappoints me for the roughness of it all.
9807	The thing that I would like to start off with is that I havent played this game that much. This was my first real racing sim that I bought. I was very hyped and I really thought that I would love it. Now I didn't, because I was too overhyped and I do not like the game. I don't like it, because I was overhyped, the sounds of the cars sounded like they were recorded with a cellphone. I personally do not recommend it, but if you're a hardcore racing fan, and the game is for sale, go for it.
9808	No Ferrari, no Lamborghini, no Porsche. Solid game but not much of a car sim without those big names.
9809	The game looks good and the weather is nice, it's a long way off a sim though and nowhere near worth the price tag. Avoid.
9810	First up, I was an early backer of the game but pulled out (and used the money to buy Game Stock Car).  First impressions were not good - I watched one video on you tube and the cars seemed a bit 'floaty' - as if they had no mass and were tip-toeing around the track. Plus, being old fashioned I bought the physical copy of the game - and noted that a game-pad is recommended - no mention of a wheel anywhere on the box.  First couple of races not good - again found the cars a bit floaty, although turning up the shadow detail has helped this. Now played for 3 hours, and while racing is ok there are some issues which ruin the immersion for me: 1. Qualifying - like Codemasters games, it ends qualifying as soon as time runs out - you cannot complete the lap you are on.  2. When leaving the pits the exit lights are always at red. 3. When entering pits you drive straight through any a.i. cars in your way  The game has been in development for years but it just doesn't feel like it.  Bottom line is I will probably persevere for a bit, but a definite disappointment.
9811	I just want to keep this short and simple.  This games graphics aren't as amazing as they're proclaimed to be, nor is the gameplay itself all that amazing as it was hyped to be.  I do not recommend this game.
9812	This is a pretty good racing game. It may even be one of the greatest sim's available to console players. However, I think it's a pretty bad PC sim. I play iracing, rfactor2, GSCE, and assetto corsa. In my opinion, all of them feel better to drive and have more realistic physics. PCars has good variety of tracks and cars but none of them feel particularly great.   Just my opinion, but I strongly suggest you look at GSCE or AC unless you really want a structured (yet bland) career mode.
9813	I have to say it is NOT only AMD users that have issues with this game, been waiting for them to update it so I can play it. I am running a 3.2 GHZ i5 with 8GB RAM and NVidia 760 GB you would imagine I should be able to run it fairly easily, like most of the games I own which have very little issues. Alas no, the game just sits using 100% CPU constantly and no game should be able to do that in my opinion.  Personally I think there is some bad coding here somewhere as the game looks fantastic, but just doesn't perform, there is absolutely no reason why it should sit using that much CPU power and I would personnally recommend most people should avoid this game until it is fixed with some updates and starts working properly.  All my other games I can not only run maxed out and reasonably FPS, but I can also STREAM or RECORD for YouTube at the same time, this game won't even run with no background tasks....  10/10 for effort, but 2/10 for quality. :-(
9814	Developer has focused on quantity rather than quality - a lot of nice features like dynamic weather, day-night cycle, great rain effects and (compared to other sims like iracing or AC) a large amount of cars. However, i cannot recommend it to those who are looking for a real racing simulator. AI is way to dumb and agressive. FFB offers thousands of different paramter combinations to adjust but it still lacks an authentic feeling (at least with my T500). Despite all that the lead developer seems to be quit arrogant and rough in the way he deals with his customers (e.g. banning people from the forum who criticize the product [in a constructive manner]). Go for AC if you are looking for a solid simulator with a great ffb and relativly smart AI (after the 1.2 update). Join Iracing when seeking for the ultimate MP experience.
9815	This game has good looks. However, it's nothing more than Need for Speed: Shift 3 in disguise.  It's another buggy mess. Buy it during a steam sale.
9816	This game is absolutely horrid i would recomend this to my worst enemy im going to actively persue my money back
9817	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME! DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING FRUSTRATED EVERY TIME YOU PLAY A GAME! Don't alt+tab while it's loading, well the game alt+tabs by itself on start. What happens when you alt+tab when loading? You can't use your wheel! HORRIBLE server filters! I can't even organize the servers by ping or player count when I actually get the game working. Empty servers so I guess I'll just go back to Live for Speed! Not to mention this game is made by a company who went into the Need for Speed series. Why are you even trying to make a 'simulator'? The graphics don't even make up for all the bugs and crappy physics!
9818	This game has good looks. However, it's nothing more than Need for Speed: Shift 3 in disguise.  It's another buggy mess. Buy it during a steam sale.
9819	A bumper car race with very bad physics - not fun - go slow or restart till you are fed up then quit the game and move on. I am never going to be Lewis Hamilton - just want to have some fun and you can't do that when driving a paper air plane in the shape of a car (with my Logitech G27). Guess its back for Forza.
9820	This game still has a problem with loosing your savegame after some kinds of crashes. The problem is known for a long time but the developers don't do anything against it. It would be simple to implement automatic backup and restoring ift necessary at the game startup if they can't find a better way. But they don't even acknowledge it as a bug as they seem to think that it's normal to loose all progress after a game crash. If you plan to play the game, always backup your savegame located at '\Steam\userdata\[id]\234630\local\project cars\profiles\default.sav'.
9821	THE OIL SLICK DRIVING SIMULATOR.  Trying to drive a car in this game is unpredictable. It's like driving on super soft dragster tires and then suddenly having a set of cheap bald-to-the cords set of tires and the road being covered in PTFE and motor oil. I spent around 4.8 hours of playtime attempting to make it more playable to no avail. Setting everything to the EXTREME side of low sensitivity and such helped slightly but its like, again, driving on plastic toy car tires. I know how to drive and am no amateur with racing. This isn't realistic at all. Pertaining to the AI or what little I did play with AI, it seems fine.. I drove with rain on the track and its not much different from dry conditions. Graphically its nice, sounds are good (except for tunnel sounds, its a bit harsh), wearther effects are nice as well. Selection of cars are decent, but to get more requires DLC and there isn't many everyday road cars.
9822	What a crap load of software ! Worst 50 euros i ever spent . Its not much better than RFactor which is totally free but the best thing is the slowmotion bug it pulls on many people out there. And yes .. i did set the â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FORCE feedback to zero. Which shows how incomplete this game again is .. The force feedback is still buggy at launch in a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing RACE GAME !! But the worst thing is the slow motion launch bug .. It slows u down while u drive ..and then out of nowhere it launches you over the track as if you were playing â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mario kart . BIG L O L ! Most of the time u end up crashing into the sideline. And thats in SINGLEPLAYER !! i â¥â¥â¥â¥ you NOT ! In SINGLEPLAYER U HAVE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RUBBERBANDING and a feeling of LAG !! Can u â¥â¥â¥â¥ing believe that ? LAG in singleplayer mode !! Good job Bandai Namco you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing TOYMAKERS ! go back to make hello kitty puppets you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing greedy MOFOS! I WANT MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MONEY BACK ! Unplayable in this stage if you dont have one of the featured Steering wheels and a super computer
9823	If you like graphics and nice menus buy this game.   If you like racing (with or without AI) buy assetto corsa instead.
9824	Do not get this game if you have a controller!!! I'm someone who enjoys racing games on all platforms, I play on system ranging from a Assetto Corsa with a Thrustmaster t500 + Oculus down to Xbox sims Like Forza, I also go-kart, a lot... This is the SINGLE MOST FRUSTRATING racing game i've ever tried to play with a controller. In these games I want to be able to put my car to the limit, drive in horrific conditions and still feel like the car is reacting the way I want. The problem I have is not with the physics but with the input! Games such as Forza and GT have a sort of AI controller assist which helps with things like oversteer and tiny corrections; this is because its impossible to be as accurate when using a controller over a wheel. This system helps keep the car stable. Project cars however seems to just have a bunch of rubber bands round the steering and a driver that turns the wheel like he's on crack cocaine. Meaning, you oversteer in a Ginetta Junior and you either countersteer into an unrecoverable tank slapper or (with other settings) sit with the gas off in full slide waiting for the idiot steering angle to get just a little bit bigger (which it never does). The end result is: the controls destroy the fun, race after race as you spin into the grass, you just get to pick whether you prefer the inside or the outside of the track.  You guys were so close to making this awesome! I cannot imagine how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ people will be if they got this for xbox or ps4. I guess i need to get a seriously good wheel and test that... Jeez, this is a Â£500 game...
9825	personally i think this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
9826	hated it, asked for refund
9827	Simply put, don't buy it.  It folds to desktop everytime it starts, bad optimization of the graphic engine, digital sounds very similar from car to car, steering wheel lock not configurable, tons and tons of aliasing, erratic AI, arcade physics, etc. I want a refund.
9828	Just don't buy it. I beg of you. Looks great and it is great... for the first hour then you realise how much bugs there are, how you only have a few cars, of which you all have at the start of the game, so there's no challenge and you get board, multi is crap, just dont buy it
9829	Makes me feel like my license should be revoked.    But is very pretty.
9830	65 bucks? THAT'S ROBBERY Now, you may be get skeptical by looking at my hours and say that it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. If you're not, I ask that you read. ESPECIALLY if you're a newb like me I really wanted to enjoy playing this game but to simply put it, these are the reasons why I cannot &gt; Some cars really over steer beyond control. Just makes playing the game really frustrating  This seems to secretly imply that one should go and get the steering wheel controller because you'll probably have a much more easier life doing so. &gt; The so called PhysX collision detection system gives of a little smell of what I would call â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. when I started turning left, the game suddenly lagged a little and went to bang the wall which was what would have happened if I didn't turn left. Sure, sue me. It doesn't sound very convincing coming from a noob. Why not let's just say that the learning curve is crazy high and there are just some flaws that I can't deal with. Also, there aren't exactly a lot of cars. If you're expecting lamborghini, I'll tell you straight that at the moment there's not a single one of them 3/10
9831	The worst game I have ever played.  Ai is crap  Ai always hit my car and knock it out the race just by a scrape
9832	unhandled exception after going to settings and cannot play anymore
9833	Faulty AI, horrible menu design, and an obvious lack of AMD support! A game to be avoided.   A very hyped title, with a long development time, the game suffers from a lack of fun. The multiplayer can be fun from time to time, but there is usually somewhere there who feels ramming you is the best way to take the first corner of the race.  The single player is incredibly bland in which you just play event after event wondering what you are doing with your life. No career progression (or clear career progression - I never stuck it out long enough to find out). The AI are either too good or too stupid, and sometime stop, or just drive anywhere for no real reason.  You can't polish a turd, adn boy has this game tried with its fancy graphics. Undeneath its shiny interior is budget title racer that wouldnt look out of place back in 2004
9834	This is the WORST sim car I've ever play, and I have many of them!!!!! (and many steering wheels)  I spected a Lot of this game and I'm very   Cons: Very complex to undersand the software, not the gameplay Small list of cars, and no exotics like lambo or ferrari You cant completely tune your car, and AFTER A LOT OF TIME OF WORKING ON IT YOU REALIZE THE CHANGES WERE NOT SAVED (VERY FRUSTRAITING) Small list of tracks Imposible to show the HUD in the cockpit camera You don't have a pilot profile to choose helmet or accesories  The graphics are good but not so good as spected for the Nvidia Graphics  I HARD RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY IT, IS A COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEY!!!  WHY IS SO HARD TO FIND A GOOD SIM CAR ON PC?
9835	the AI â¥â¥â¥â¥
9836	Properly disappointed. Thought I had found my answer to Forza on PC, the physics feel like rocket league's moon grav modifier, the car choice is absolutely laughable, could not find settings for my wheel or joypad that made the game pheasibly playable before my refund time limit ran out, AI is on rails and it doesn't matter what you do it will feel like your trying to navigate a white van down a one way street whilst the AI is playing go karts on an airfield. Rubbish game no matter WHAT you do to tweak it. Just glad I wasted money on this whilst it was in the sale and hope my refund gets accepted.
9837	The game is great fun the problem is that there is just not much going on with mulitplayer. Only 3 -4 multiplayer groups opperating at a time. Im not sure why?
9838	This is a story of my thoughts about this game given my exposure of the near entire development of this game.  I was on board with this game ever since the game was available for alpha testing. I purchased the full copy option that was available since I loved the idea of aiding in creating what could be, and was proposed at the time, the greatest new generation racing sim. Every month I would play the newest build, pleased to see the development happen before my eyes. In the early days the game seemed to be going in the right direction with likeable content, menues being refined, ect.   And then it seemed something changed. Almost as if someone made the decicion, 'We no longer want to make the most realistic racing sim. We want to make a racing game that poses itself as a racing sim for everyone to enjoy, even console gamers.' From then on it seemed that everything that was done was to make it enjoyable for EVERYONE, even the casual racer. This path pogressed and the game was released.   I was appaled at the release of the game. It still had issues from before the game was delayed. This turned me off completely. I left the game in the back of my head and as time went on I've seen that the developers did indeed make multiple patches through time and months after the release i decided to give it another go. I played it again and am even more let down than I was before. These developers have a horrible trend of fixing issues and in doing so introducing new ones. It's been like this since the begining.  This game could have lived up to the name that the developers originally had for it but it didn't because they changed what the game was ment to be halfway through its development. That is why i feel the game suffers as many issues as it does, because they had to make changes to things that should have never been changed at all.  I'd like to mention that about 65 of my 70+ hours in the game were from before the game was offically released. not to mention the uncounted hours from before the game even made it onto Steam. 
9839	After being really excited to purchase this game I went through the long installation process only to find that the game will not work due to an 'Unhandled Exception Trapping' error. If you, like me, are not technically minded this is an absolute nightmare as when looking up solutions on Google there's loads of suggestions which include changing these elaborate settings, to which I have no clue how to access. The solutions that I could work on didn't even work, so a week after I bought the game I still haven't played a single second of it. I don't know why Slightly Mad Studios made a game which works in this way, I miss the days when you could simply put your game disc into your machine and it would play instantly, without any of this installation or compatibility kerfuffle. I don't want to have to spend loads of money on a new laptop just so I can play the game, and it really is a poor performance from Slightly Mad Studios if they have made a game which is only good for the newest of computers, not for people with slightly older computers who can't afford to upgrade.
9840	Let me start by saying that I was SO excited for this game. After playing for just a few minutes, the main thing I noticed was the sound design. It is so terrible that it completely ruins the game for me. To be fair, being a sound engineer and musician probably makes me a little more critical than the next person, but this is truly awful sound design. The engines don't sound right at all. They clearly sound like several samples being used that use pitch bending between said samples. If done right, it can sound great, but this is just not up to par in terms of professional sound quality. Every racing game or car centric game I've played that uses FMOD tends to sound this way, so to be fair that's probably a factor. Every game that I've played that utilized wWise middleware sounds so much cleaner. If you have Dirt Rally or even just Dirt 3, listen to the revs in that compared to this. Night and day. Also in terms of sound, certain sfx like hitting a guardrail on highway one sound way too loud, and then stay at the same volume until you slow to practically a halt. You could even still be moving, grinding against the guardrail and the sound would be gone. If you accelerate along the guardrail again, the sound is still stopped, which tells me that it's more an issue with implementation.   The visuals are great, and I can run at almost max settings with my GTX 770, but the lighting doesn't really do it for me. The physics are just okay, but the car is WAY too stable in a straight line.   All in all, this game feels unfinished. The sound design is its most obvious flaw, and I think to really make a top notch product, they need to step it up in that area.
9841	A wonderful racing game completely ruined by the AI. They're way too aggressive, and you'll be taken out if you have the inside line.
9842	Absolute worst piece of bugged garbage I've spent 50$ on.
9843	Game needs AMD driver fix, then ill fix my review  Able to play capped at 40fps. Playable. Needs a fixin.  I have CPU 8350 4.0ghz GPU R9 290x OC II by ASUS  Help a brother out! I'm going Slightly Mad here!
9844	Game Crashes more than an AI opponent on 0 Difficulty setting
9845	It says 'Nvidia GT600 series' as the recommended specs so I just 'accidentally' bought Nvidia GT 610 and it still run on utterly low FPS below 15.  This game claimed to be able to run on low-end graphics. Okay, but horrible optimization when dealing it with lower resolution and no fullscreen option for lower resolution.  In other words...urrgh...
9846	Cool but there are much better racing games. Also vr works well but for the general game side its too espensive for such a bad enemy AI.
9847	THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I am not. I am not hardcore enough for this game! I thought by purchasing this game, that I would finally be graduating from Gran Tur Forza into the true sims like the F1 series. I was SO wrong. There is no upgrade or money system. I can't take a base Honda Fit, and slowly upgrade it into a track beast (Bad example, I know the Fit would never be a track beast, but a boy can dream.) The THOUGHT of qualifying gives me a panic attack because of my inability to have a 'clean' lap. The weather effects are BEAUTIFUL; but whenever it so much as sprinkles, I might as well quit because I WILL spin out. I know the process of practice, qualify, race comes from the real world; but I lose interest half-way through qualifying.   To sum up, I will make a comparison. This game is Rocksmith, and Forza/Gran Turismo is RockBand. Rocksmith is trying to teach you to be a real musician, like Project CARS is trying to make you a better driver. Rockband just wants you to have fun playing on plastic instruments. At the end of the day, I'll keep my plastic guitar.
9848	Maybe, just maybe. Before next DLC they should try to fix the bugs that have been there from release. This is just BIG maybe.
9849	Best demolition derby simulator on steam.
9850	controlls do not work and everything is wrong
9851	I wish there was a refund policy for BS Games that have no Demo
9852	Yes the amount of content in this game is massive; unfortunately the experience is marred by Funny Physics and blindly formulaic AI. 
9853	Project Cars huh.  Well I think it needs alot of work. Starting a online race is utterly rediculas. No voice chat. The replay UI stinks to hell and a hand basket. This sim looks to me like it was rushed out the damn door. I would personally would be embarassed if I was a dev on this project to release it the way it is.   It does drive well and the cars and graphics are good. But seriously you all need to work on in it. Worth the price of admission? Definitly not.
9854	love/hate  What I love:  -The amount of setup work, reminds me of the old papyrus racing games and Iracing. - The weather effects - The vanilla Track list.  What I Hate: -THe DLC, they add road cars and more variants of the same manufacturers without adding new ones - Manufacturer list, especially in the GT and LMP list, for:  *LMP1, No Toyota, CLM, Rebellion, or Porsche, only audi  *LMP2 No morgan, ligier, strakka, lola or HPD  *GTE: Non existant with the outdated M3 GT in GT3 somehow  *GT3: No ferrari, chevorlet, porsche (RUF as a stand in), ford, lamborghini, nissan, viper, maserati, jaguar, ascari, in fact there is more manufacturers missing than there is represented.    Stop adding more useless cars and use the DLC sales to build more licenses.
9855	Totally wrong driving physics - example, when going around a corner in a powerful rear wheel drive car you should comdfortably be able to knock the back end out into a drift. This game simply doesn't let you. Somebody okeyed this at the top and thought that was a great idea. They need sacking from the game industry FOREVER. Oh so do the games 'testers'.
9856	So im a online racer, i like racing a human, if you like online racing this is not the game for you. If you are a solo racer, Time Trial, campaine, this is for you. pretty game, good controls, good sound, horrid online racing.
9857	I really wanted to like this game. It looks stunning and has wide choice of cars and tracks. But force feedback is too simplified in my opinion. For me this removes most of the fun from driving in this game.  And the fact that you have to actually press brake pedal to reverse? This game definitely isn't a simulator.
9858	Although there is a ton of content, the AI is broken, the pits stop are broken, and the damage have been almost tone down to nothing. Yes the driving is great, the speed is fantastic, but the AI cut corners all the time, is too aggressive and has trouble seeing other cars. The choice of tires is not working on the automatic settings. In the pit stop refueling doesn't always work either (which is a very big problem). The AI seems to also have an advantage in the rain, or at least get the good tires compare to ours. The Kart part is annoying because the camera doesn't stop jerking around.  Since the AI is so stupid and aggressive, the damage must have been tone down to almost nothing. So all you have to do is to bump the cars out of the way. This is an arcade game in this current state. The simulation is there but is half finished. For all the shiny and amazing graphics, once you take the wheel against the AI, you will find it's a big let down. I have driven many racing game since 1995, this one look so promising yet it failed where it should be shining.   Update: since the patches the AI isn't cheating that much, but to compensate the AI is much harder within certain tracks. It's like they put an extra level of control for the AI, while you are %*&amp;%?9 with your own car. You still can push the AI off track, but now they will do the same. Since there is no damage on so many cars, it just makes the game an arcade bump ride. Maybe the developpers wanted a simulation but they ended up with a completed different product in the end. The lack of damage just makes the AI and the players reckless with very little consequences on their actions.
9859	Bought the game ... and DLC .... ' I regret so much to have done that ' This game is so darn complicated to set up ....  I have a a Trustmaster T300 RS wheel with separate pedal ..... ' tired of buying game that does demand so much set up or just will not work..... ' possible to get money back from DLC ' ??????/  Now on PS4 I play Gran Torismo 6 and wow what a ride ...even in 3D .... love it .
9860	as usual trying to contact product support is near impossible and you have to rely on forums to help you. i still can't play the game and am awaiting a response on the forums
9861	Assetto Corsa is better.   End Of.  And more to the point; SMS say that professional drivers helped them with this game.  By the state of the A.I i would assume it's Pastor 'Crashtor' Maldonado.
9862	Some may disagree, but that's ok, but I think this game, mechanics wise, is better than Assetto Corsa. Clutch play and mechanics are superior to AC. In this game if you stall, there is no stepping on the gas, then having the car auto start WHILE IN GEAR WITHOUT clutch held in. In this game if you stall, you must either go into neutral, or stay in gear but hold in the clutch, and if you stall again, which you will if you do not how to drive stick properly, you gotta do it all over again. I also likle the feel of the cars and handling better than AC, handling (AC to me, just feels too buffered, then again one could argue my wheel settings are bad) BUT this game has glitches, AND you cannot have more than one control setup saved at a time like in AC. So if you want to have xbox controller settings and tweaks saved along with your long worked for wheel settings, only one can be saved. This game has bugs, and yet the developers are talking about Project Cars 2??? I love the physics and handling in this game, but because of the lack of quality, and control saving features, I cannot recommend this game.
9863	GTX 965M With I7 4720 4th Gen 12gig Ram and still cant get a steady 50-60 fps with all graphics set to low.
9864	Maybe it's because I grew up playing the original Gran Turismo that I'm so critical of all racing games today, as nothing will compare to the greatest racing sim of all time. I would recommend this game ONLY if the price drops.   Pros  -Stunning graphics, A+++ This is what sold me on it. -Challenging gameplay and plenty of room to adjust difficulty based on your skill level. Just one mistake could easily send you to the back of the pack.  -Nice 'free race' allows you to skip to any track and set weather conditions with any car from the start. This really helped aid me in getting a feel for the controls.   Cons  -Unrewarding single player mode, win after win I'm in my 3rd season and still racing with the same car. Soon found myself aching to get the season over with. -Not a great variety of 'regular' everyday cars, mostly f1 cars. Biggest complaint overall with the game is there are not enough Japanese cars, NO Hondas, NO Subarus, NO Nissans, and the only American make is Ford. FORD!!! Would it really have been so hard to include just one Chevy? Selection is limited, the only car I was really stoked about was the Lancer EVO.  -Radio voice throughout race is okay at first but fastly becomes repetitive and annoying. -No option to customize the visual appearance of your car, only change the color IF you aren't driving a vehicle that's sponsored by your racing team. No need to upgrade parts as all cars are track ready. -Other drivers speed and handling are not as affected when run off the track and often times their aggression has knocked me off the track and caused unfair penalties.  -NO 2 playerr split screen :( I work at night and the multiplayer servers are pretty limited at 3am.  Neutral  -Tuning vehicles can be tedious and aggravating when all you wanna do is drive and there is a learning curve to this but there's an option to turn on driving and brake assists  -Could be a negative but there is no music. Perhaps appropriate for a sim game but if you wanna hear tunes you'll have to run a background program.
9865	Hey Project cars... why dont you fix the controller issues.... fix that â¥â¥â¥â¥ instead of selling more crap dlc for a broke game... Project Cars DID NOT FIX CONTROLLER ISSUE.. THERE UPDATE SAYS THEY DID BUT THEY DID NOT STILL HAVING PROBLEMS FIX THIS GAME ITS MESSED UP YOU SELL â¥â¥â¥â¥ PRODUCT AS NEW... ITS BROKEN AND SUCKS THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME.... IF YOU REALLT DONT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS ENOUGH TO FIX A BROKE GAME THANKS AGAIN FROM THE GAME WORLD You still have not fixed controller issue.....
9866	This game is bad for drifting with g27. The Fy force is not well made, even if i'ts tuned down to minimum, i still get clipping. Only on this game. every other games work great. If you like grip racing, feel free to buy. If not, better spend your money and time on Assetto Corsa
9867	I am using logitech driving force g29 and I am shocked that in this 'driving simulation' every car has 900 degrees steering wheel rotating angle. It is ok when driving ordinary cars but if I go race with formula car and have to spin my wheel like mad man it is not okey. Sure I can change the angle always when I change to different car but that is too awkward to me. In DIRT RALLY wheel rotating angles changed automatically for each car. I cant understand why not in this game.
9868	I would recommend this game to people who are already experienced with Racing Games. At first look, it made my eyes go crazy, i had no idea what i was doing. Then the controls were all crazy. It looked fun, but I just couldn't handle it.
9869	Still seems to have issues with AMD video cards. I'm running two RX 480s in CrossFire and the stuttering is crazy bad! The game is playable, and when it doesn't stutter it looks really good! However until AMD and these developers actually have a sit down to fix things I cannot recommend this to anyone with an AMD graphics card.
9870	Big fat disappointment. Developers gave up on the game soon after it was released announcing a PROJECT CARS 2.   Never will buy another game from these devs again. No variety. Decent AI. Great sound.
9871	This is a massive dissapointment to say the least. To start, the controls on this game are so twitchy that it is simply unplayable. The game just leaves me entirely frustrated. The steering is the biggest issue. Not only is it disgustingly twitchy, it feels so numb. Drifting is simply impossible. If your tires break loose there is no way you can correct it and you will inevitably crash. I play and am quite good at Forza, and this game should take notes. It is a complete miss. I do not recoment this game at all. Waste of money. For a game that was designed by car guys for car guys, this was a complete failure. This a car guy saying that this is one of the worst racing games I have ever played. To call it a sim is quite false. The audio is also aggresively mediocre. The engine sounds are extremely poor. The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics.
9872	Why is it that everytime there is an update all the calibration settings are lost, I really am getting sick of having to do this.... and unless I rebot, my steering unit and pedals are not even recognised..... starting to think this is not a game I would recommend 
9873	This game has amazing graphics , but it was not even close too being fun as grand trismo or NFS and the price is for the quality of the graphics not the game itself maybe the game would get a better review if it had an actual story and was about a fourth too a third of its price
9874	CONS: realism, bugs, settings, support.  Poor quality in overall. Sorry guys.  PROS: Graphics are really nice.   If u want a good rally game i recomended 'DiRT RALLY'.
9875	cars dont all handle realistic and numerous updates have changed the charactistics of a few cars from being fairly easy to drive on the limit to being impossible to drive, has a slightly arcady feel to the handling and most settings dont really change the character of the car like it does in real life or haven forbide it, like the gran turismo series. the fact the gt series from a console is more sim than this game has been shows how unpolished this game is. this game showed so much promise that i pre ordered from day dot and ive stayed around hoping it would be improved but the fact the devs went straight onto making the next game instead of fixing the imperfections on this game that couldve made this the Ultimate simulation racing game, instead they release some over priced dlc and nerf the handling for a lot of cars. they had the formula right for the cars included and tracks but let down by the poor handling mechanic
9876	I have an issue with the sounds. It seems have a weird cutting effect, when the engine rpm tops out or if I switch gears the engine sound cuts out for a micro second. It also seems to happen when I crash, it really takes me out of the immersion.   This seems to be a great game otherwise, but I just cant bring myself to play it the way it is now.
9877	This game has so much potential but the BIG problems is the lack of support for graphics drivers. My GTX 560ti worked great with this game until i upgraded to a GTX 760 and 770. This issue needs to be fixed ASAP.
9878	CONS: realism, bugs, settings, support.  Poor quality in overall. Sorry guys.  PROS: Graphics are really nice.   If u want a good rally game i recomended 'DiRT RALLY'.
9879	When I first downloaded the game it was great, good graphics, amzing track list, decent car list. It looked great, that was until I played. If you decide you want it USE A CONTROLLER OR WHEEL. If you are like me and don't have the stuff to do that, I'd suggest not downloading the game. When using the keyboard controls, turning is awful. If you have a controller you are all set and it should be fine. If not, I WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT.
9880	These devs are scammers, they promissed a Linux port, gathered all the money from the hype and them didn't deliver.
9881	i bouht this game. When i Started it I was dissapointed. Becouse this game has to many bugs its hard to drive, Its imposible to drive a gokart. Im happy i got this game refunded. Dont buy this game if you wanna play a racing game not worth.  
9882	Epic game but very bad localization. Cut-offs, wrong translations (gpu settings are translated as achievements to my language - Polish). you have to restart to apply settings.... Its not a beta guys fix it! Good game but not ready when it comes to quality.
9883	Biggest issue with this game is the lack of accuracy in driving. Tire traction with the asphalt is poor compared to Forza and Grand Turismo. Also, the faster the car, the more horribly uncontrollable the acceleration out of a turn. For some reason, when applying minor throttle out of a turn, rpm's are unrealistically increased to the point where the horrible traction physics send the car into a power slide.   Car physics in game do NOT compare to their real world counterpart. I think thats why they don't have a lot of lower tier/common cars in this game.
9884	Ian Bell is a â¥â¥â¥â¥
9885	If you enjoy online racing where everyone just rams into you at every corner. Buy this game, because the AI do it as well.
9886	  Very poor performance
9887	I just bought the game at a discounted price. But it appears that it doesn't support my VIVE. Please advise how I can play the game on my VIVE. Thanks.
9888	well i would like to say i'm enjoying this so far but after an hour of driving go karts i've given up, lets hope playing against friends in multi player is more fun. one go kart race as a practice would have been fine but enough is enough i'll not be continuing with carrer mode as its bored the pants off me already, what a shame i was looking forward to it
9889	The physics vary from car to car more than they should in real life. The career mode is ruined because everything is unlocked from the start. There is no incentive to even play it. The multiplayer is full of people who don't want to race, but ram you. Developer support has been poor.
9890	Bugs, bugs everywhere
9891	This is a racing game that I reccomend you pass.   Especially considering the options in this category.  There is very little that this game does well that would warrant it over others out there. Such as Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2, Automobilista, Dirt Rally, Race Room, etc.   It is a âgood lookingâ game, and certainly has a lot of eye candy. It is very much a style over substance. It carries a vast selection of both cars, and tracks, but they fall short simulating the difference. They have no depth.   In other titles, the simulation aspect of each car is immediately noticeable. You feel each car and how it behaves in your hands on different tracks and surfaces. This simply feels numb in most scenarios.  other titles provide better racing, better A.I, better physics, more desirable car selections, and a much, much improved force feedback.   Unless you have exhausted all other options out there, and this is on sale at a cheap (very cheap) price I recommend you save your hard earned money and check-out any of the titles mentioned above.   Do NOT fall for the hype. 6/10
9892	Project Cars is a fun game. I use my steam contoller as a steering wheel. With refinement, and the recently added rumble functionality, my driving has gotten much better.  Why do I not recommend the game, then?   1 - Tuning setting for cars. This is my biggest issue with this game. The user cannot create and name save files of various tunes for cars. There is the option to create a base tune that is saved to all tracks. Then there is the option to save one tune per car/track combo. That's it. Wanna tune your car for a hot day, and have another tune for the rain? You have to document your setting how you see fit, and manually enter them... each time. Tuning is a very significant aspect of racing. Whether or not a driver is comfortable in his/her car can make all the difference. Sadly, as I understand it, there are no plans to add this ability to the game.  2 - Must restart a practice session, to modify the vehicle tune. This cannot be done on track. You cannot even pull into the pits, to make modifications. Pulling into the pits in a practice session only engages a buggy pit stop.  3 - No vehicle modifications. It would be nice to be able to, at least, make adjustments to wheel width. While there are a wide variety of tunning options, changing parts can make a difference in automotive performance.  4 - AI. The AI appears to be completely oblivious to the player, at times. This, when combined with the inability to organize one's settings how they see fit, killed the career mode for me.  I have not attempted online racing. As such, I am unable to comment on the many bugs reported.  I did want to enjoy this game. Unfortunately, I do not see myself playing it much. Mostly because a racing simulator makes it unnecessarily difficult to tune a car for specific races/conditions.
9893	Look guys.... Why? Just why? when I want to play Forza 6 I just hit play and race.... when I want to play Project Cars I hit play and half and hour trying to set Xbox controler sensitivity!!!! Because it's idiotic, I doubt that developer even tryed to set it...
9894	Terrible physics, full of bugs, only like 60 cars, full of DLCs, ridiculosly stupid AI, no way to turn off the â¥â¥â¥â¥in pit assist, dead servers. DONT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥
9895	The â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ thing changes my Windows 10 theme to default after each time I play it.  The AI does not give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you are on the track, they will drive through you, and shove you out of the way because they can. They will not make any effort to overtake you in a clean way.  Outside of that, the game is great. i'd recommend it, but the fact that it defaults my windows theme has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off enough to not recomend the game.
9896	this game and more dont work with steam..
9897	Bugs. Bugs for days. Changes desktp wallpaper somehow. Freezes mid race. Freezes in menu. Stops responding randomly. See all the reviews, it's always the same thing. Cool game, too many bugs.
9898	I have spent hundreds of hours with Assetto Corsa, then I bought PC just to enjoy the graphic, the changing weather, the races at night time. Unfortunately the feedback from the car while you drive it, is so dull that I am hardly opening it again. It also has bugs and other issues, yes, but what bugs me is that I don't feel proper car's reactions. If you are used to Assetto Corsa and like it, I would suggest to not buy PC.
9899	I've put many hours into this game....and I wanted to like it-- in fact, I really did after awhile. Don't get me wrong, there's things I do enjoy about PCars. The fact that they carry more WEC/LeMans/Endurance stuff and there are plenty of liveries available for the vehicles. The track are okay, as lots of the main ones to be considered a serious racing game are available. However, I believe that there isn't enough content in terms of marques and tracks as well as features. Then there's the question of physics....oh dear.....the physics. They aren't bad-- they aren't good, either. They're just.....weird. I race IRL, enough to know that they are just odd. Not quite a simulator, not quite a arcade, but not a hybrid of the two, though. The developer support is nearly absent, and they do put out content from time to time; just to keep the mob at bay sufficiently enough.  Take case in point: I'm racing in the Audi eTron Quattro R18, at LeMans. I'm on Lap 24 of Godknowswhat doing an endurance race. I'm convincingly in first out of A Whole Lotta Cars (cue Zeppelin), with P2 a whole 22 seconds behind. So far it's been a clean race (a true rarity), and I decide to not push it anymore, to which I try to maintain pace and conserve. I come out of the Porsche Curves, and the following section pretty clean. Then approaching the start with NO ONE IN SIGHT, NO DEBRIS, NO CARS, NOTHING, when suddenly out of nowhere my car shatters, flips, spins, and crashes in to a wall....on a straight....as if I just hit an IED or I crashed into a brick wall or something. My car is in total disrepair and I have to will my car past the massive entirety of LeMans. I drive the entire course in 1st or 2nd, trying not to blow out my engine, make it to the pits with just 7 seconds of a lead (down from 22), to get in there only to have the pit glitch, and get stuck there with nothing happening for 10 minutes, to then get booted. I can't stress enough how much weird stuff happens all the time.   The AI is comparable to a bunch of 15 year olds in a Ferrari race car, whom have just received their learners permits. Its clunkily unrefined, and downright head-scratching.   With all the other racing simulators, I can't recommend it wholly as there are better options. If you're looking for an amazing racing experience and a true sim, DIRT Rally is fantastic. (I race rally as well.) Assetto Corsa, although I've never played it, has never really had a uniformly bad thing said about it and I do intend to purchase it soon.  6.5/10
9900	Worst piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever. Game just stopped working and developer can't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ why. Hundreds dollar spent flushed down the toilet.
9901	Insanely glitchy on Steam Link+Controller. Menus were spazzing out, controls would reset to defaults after I set them.
9902	Don't waste your money. I have bought two different controllers to play this game. The first one, I thought it was the controller that had the deadzone problems. Meaning you could not stear softly, only in large gaps. So I bought an x-box controller think that would solve the problem. Still. Huge dead zones. As far as the 'awesome' graphics. That's an overstatment, I have seen way better graphics on Forza on X-box 360.
9903	While this may be a great game for the hardcore racer addict, it seems a bit too tedious for the balance of the gaming population. I admire the attention to detail and the depth of the game - and I certainly really appreciate the graphics - but the game lacks finesse in the manner of the career path. The go-kart racing is fun, but I really don't feel the need to star there on my career path. Bottom line, the game requires a great deal of work and a lot of time in order to get anywhere. Let's be honest...I want to have fun...I don't want a second job.
9904	Good Graphics ,Physics ect ect... but not enough content.. i want to be able to drive alot more that ''mainstream'' cars 6/10 sorry guys
9905	Just played an hour of this. It is not a casual game, by any stretch of the imagination. This game is made for hardcore enthusiasts.  I found it god awful.  I'm more of a Forza player. I've played hours of Forza, and will play many more hours of it. I will most likely buy the next Forza.  I can say without a doubt, I will not buy the next Project Cars.
9906	You can hit a wall head on, at 100 mph and keep going like nothing happened. The physics are terrible. This is even more disappointing in a game that is supposedly a 'realistic simulation'.  Definitely avoid this one.
9907	This game is fun, if you consider it an arcady racing game with simulation elements. As soon as you want a more realistic simulation this game isn't for you. If you want to get into the detailed tuning options for each and every car you can do it, however it will not tremendously affect the way the cars handle. Graphics on the car models are great, but environment graphics leave a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately the AI in this game is absolutely rubbish. It has the urge (on every difficulty setting) to always go for the apex of every corner, regardless of if your car is already side-by-side with them. The second you have to come up through the field to win a race you will get crashed into 100% of the time.  Furthermore, there seems to be some bug with qualifying times. Multiple I have had the issue that I put in a pole-winning lap in Quali, just to get an AI driver besting me by 25-50%... For example: I get a 1:04:30 time on a lap and the AI miraculously gets a 00:38:40... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?! All the others AI drivers are 2-3 seconds behind my time, but this one guy is 20 SECONDS ahead?
9908	Graphics and sounds are great but physics and FFB are much arcade compared to Asseto Corssa. So I requested refund and AC is still No. 1 to me.
9909	This game is generally great, good fun to play and great physics model. However, in the rain in career mode, apparently i'm the only one with grip issues if it rains in the last two laps, thats â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor programming. Damage model is poor, despite insinuation it will be visible it rarely is. The DLC's, cash cow anyone? unless it's on offer, don't bother, as i say with so many games on steam these days.
9910	Graphics and sounds are great but physics and FFB are much arcade compared to Asseto Corssa. So I requested refund and AC is still No. 1 to me.

9912	No good for the vive ,when you press recenter it puts you in the middle of the car , lags toomuch in vr , i get lower than 45 fps on a 1060 . I would wait until the vr support is better unless you are playing without vr
9913	I said I would rereview this game after I played a similar racing game. So... Still an OK racing game. Sound like racing cars. Turning sound, burning rubber sounds, and the impact sound are all good. Little voice work, but what did you expect it's a racing game. Sadly there is little music, at times it feels like there is no music at all. The graphics though are great! The scenery looks amazing, not blocky or jagged when going fast or slow. The cars look great! New cars, although they look boring, look like real race cars, my uncle used to be a NASCAR driver so I know what race cars look like. The older cars, which I prefer, look spectacular, I'm just guessing they look this way in real life. This game is missing an identity, it's very generic. 6.5/10 I wouldn't recommend this game because I rated it under a 7, but if you like more realistic racing game you'll most likely love this game.
9914	bad menu-handling many bugs especially in endurance missing feature for true multiclass or custom grids huge rippoff via dlc  
9915	Good Game But it could use a Pit crew
9916	Project Cars could have been a great game, it seems that laziness and an unwillingness to actually spend money on licensing has gotten in the way. Seriously, if I would have paid full retail for this game, Iâd be livid. First off, it seems they completely forgot the in race soundtrack, but donât worry they have brilliantly included Spotify âplaylistâ, because I need more accounts, and extra web browsing windows draining my system resources. Secondly, it seems they forgot to add three-quarters of the cars. Many of the classes feature as many as TWO, thatâs right TWO, different cars in the given class! I can hardly handle the variety. Finally: âGripyearâ Tires? Really? That might have flown twenty years ago, but itâs just ridiculous. When compared to a nearly twenty year old copy of Gran Turismo, Project Cars comes up thin on cars, and lacks the branding that helps make series like GT, and Forza, feel like the real deal.  When it comes to tuning the cars it feels like an afterthought. Certainly, one of the joys of modern racing games is earning custom parts, whether itâs by spending a racing purse, or an internal R&amp;D process (ala 2003âs APEX Racing from ATARI), but there isnât any of that going on here. It is spec racing at every level. With those TWO choices per class expect one thing: Monotony.   I canât completely pan this game. It plays and looks great. The game engine seems to do a great job, and itâs pretty awesome seeing such a full grid, even if the cars are all the same. There are a wide variety of tracks and configurations, and the weather makes things interesting. Racing in a thunderstorm is just as dicey in game, as I imagine it would be in real life. Unfortunately, playing the game is simply a reminder of how good of a game this could have been, had proper effort been put into completing the game, rather than simply building the framework, and then dumping it into the market. It is really disappointing that console gamers still have the only decent options when it comes to a fully developed racing game, but I hold on to hope that maybe in the future, this game engine, or someone elseâs, will mature into something that can actually hold my interest for an extended period of time. Until then Iâll putt around in this, or hook up my old PS3, and wistfully dream about what this game could have been. 
9917	This game has amazing graphics, one of the best in racing titles, but itÂ´s not fair to call this a sim racing game, this game was intended to be played with joypad, if you have a wheel car just doesnt feel real, you have almost no chance in controling the car when it slides a bit, itÂ´s just a very small gap between grip and total uncontrolable rear. Ã play sim racing games since gtlegends, and gtr, project cars has a terrible online experience, every idiot can join every race, cars have a bit of lag when online, itÂ´s almost impossible to have real close racing online.  This game is intended to be played offline just to enjoy the graphics, when it comes to ffb things dont seem real.  Conclusion: This aint a simrace title, this is something like grand turismo for Pc.
9918	Buggy, no logic and you just spin around the track.
9919	All hype crappy force feedback. Did the developers even listen to the 'real world drivers' that helped develop the game?
9920	Firstly, thousands of players of this game will give it positive reviews no matter what, as they backed the game years ago with anywhere between Â£20-Â£500 each(even more in some cases) and have become viral marketers and have a profit share to think about, so they want everyone to buy it, and will tell you whatever you want to hear.  If you're expecting a sim, look elsewhere. If you're looking for great battles with clever AI, definately look elsewhere. If you own an NVidia GPU and are looking for a racing game with plenty of eye candy, decent FFB, decent handling and physics (with assists turned off unless your looking for a full arcade experience) then you might want to give this a try, but not at full price, possibly worth picking up for Â£25 or less if you must have every racing game.  As a sim it falls way short of the following sims (that ive played): iRacing, Race07 (+ expansions), Stock Car Extreme, rFactor2, Kart Racing Pro.  As a Single Player game it falls short of the following games (that ive played): Grid Autosport, Stock Car Extreme, Race07 (+ expansions).  As a Multiplayer game it just fails full stop, same as Assetto Corsa, if they are hoping for a thriving online community then they need to revamp most of thier MP stuff and network code as the rubber banding and warping makes playing with anyone outside of your country almost impossible.  If they focus on making the AI anywhere near decent and removing those rubbish made up 'tracks' like california highway that has 'guide rails' down both sides of the road (replace with more irl race tracks instead), as well as fixing the assists so when using 'real', cars that actually have ABS, TC and SC irl will have those options in the cars setup (havnt come across a single car yet that has these options in the setup even though they have them irl and real is selected in the game options), then they might have a game on their hands that can start competing alongside the games i mentioned above. The only racing game/sim i would currently rate this above (if it was the same price) is Assetto Corsa, and thats mainly down to the poor optimization and horrible,disjointed UI and useless multiplayer in AC.
9921	Don't believe the hype - wait for it to be on sale.  While it runs buttery smooth on Nvidia Hardware and has the greatest Force Feedback I have ever felt... the game itself is not that special. Nothing I have never seen before, nothing I have ever played before.  The motivation on proceeding in the campain is not really there, the sound effects are not very immersive and the highly praised graphics arent really that special either. While the car models are out of this world, the rain effects are a joke (compared to the ones in DriveClub that came out one year earlier on a console), the tracks are really ugly, lifeless and. undetailed, even GRID Autosport did a better job with those.  Project Cars also suffers from flickering shadows and textures, this is especially noteable on the speedometer in the 91 BMW M3 E30 Group A.  I really wanted to like it but I just can't.
9922	Bad, bad, bad.  Really buggy, some absolute game breaking bugs (i.e. not registering your lap, so when cars behind you cross the start/finish they go ahead of you on the leaderboard. You finish the race and only notice when the race results come up that you finished last, not first, even though you crossed the line first!).  They have some people providing 'support' (I use the term losely) on Steam forums, ask them for very basic information (such as when the game you paid for might actually start working) and they refuse to answer unless you create an account on their forum. Either provide support on Steam or don't, don't use it to click build your own forum! There's no reason you can't answer simple questions (such as when a patch for the gamebreaking bugs might be forthcoming!!!).  They are also playing silly sods with hardware (well documented, have a search); the game was clearly coded to run well on Nvidia hardware, leaving ATI users out in the cold. By all means feel free to optimise your game for one, but don't just shrug your shoulders and think it isn't your problem to make YOUR code run on very standard hardware. Telling people they should buy Nvidia to fix your buggy code is frankly stupid!   
9923	I tried 10minutes with carting. Jesus mother of christ that was terrible!! Shame on you for making such crap in 2015!
9924	Ok, so there are some good bits.  Graphics are good and bad at the same time.  Good textures, awful effects. For example, the McLaren P1 DRS wing doesn't move an inch when braking or cornering, the same for other DRS cars. This is pure laziness and poor development. Assetto Corsa is a great competitor, with better sounds and effects.  Car sounds are also awful, I'm pretty sure they've used nearly the same sound for every car. Letâs use the McLaren P1 as an example again, the V8 in the McLaren has a very unique sound, this does not come through at all in this game.  Lots of lazy dev, awful for AMD users (I'm Nvidia, but it's unfair to have poor performance because you use AMD!) Overall, Iâd avoid giving this studio any money.
9925	I think this may be the nail in the coffin for me when it comes to buying games from this point forward. Just like Assetto Corsa, this feels and plays like a game that was released to the general public still blatantly in beta form. This isn't finished. The gameplay is dreadfully buggy, the graphics are glitchy in almost every race and replay (I'm on a GTX 970), the list of cars at this time is severely uninspiring bordering on uninteresting and forgettable... If I'm honest I can't see a single feature in this game which makes it stand above any other racing 'sim' in the genre. To add to the list, the force feedback on a Thrustmaster TX Wheel is terrible, you need to meticulously fiddle with dozens of settings per car to even just begin to touch on something realistic, I can't feel any understeer, there's no tyre noise, it's really not good at all.  Changing any graphical setting requires a client restart which then makes you sit through the opening splash screens each time, there's no explanation anywhere on what the settings means (you shouldn't have to Google a game setting), car customisation is non-existent to the point whereby it's not even obvious how to race a car in a different paint colour... which is fine if this was a hardcore sim, but it isn't, technical customisations and upgrades are minimal. To be fair, on its own merit as a racing game it's pretty good in terms of graphical quality and physics. However. It's been released AFTER the likes of iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Forza, it has to compete and offer something they don't... and it doesn't. In my book, it's failed. If you enjoy Assetto Corsa on PC and Forza on Xbox (I don't own a PS), do not buy this. You'll be bored within an hour and will fast realise there's nothing for you here that you can't have in a game you already own. It's Â£40 wasted for me.
9926	First of all: Dont buy it if you have AMD components in your computer, it is as unoptimized as can be, so even with a high end graphics card, you'll be stuck playing on low or medium.  Aside from that: -The graphics look fairly nice, I mean, if you enjoy not seeing a single piece of asphalt because of the effects blinding you.  -The damage model is awful, you can run straight into a wall at 120mph and all that happens is your splitter falling off. -There arent 110 UNIQUE Tracks as mentioned by the devs, there are about 30 with alot of different variations and reverse layout -There is only a handful of cars, used to be a fairly decent amount during the beta, most of the content was taken out because it was 'not finished' -This game is as much of a simulator as Call of Duty is tactical -Devs have not updated the game since 2 weeks after release, yet there are many bugs and glitches that have to be fixed -Game settings sometimes dont save -Main Menu displays unfinished content in a finished game -Multiplayer server browser has very little filter options, as well as informations for clients wanting to join a race -16 max players in a Multiplayer lobby -Almost every car handles the same -Have I mentioned this is NOT A SIMULATOR? -AI is either overly aggressive or doesnt overtake at all -Its Shift 2 with a few new tracks and cars -Tracks arent detailed enough -Cant to pit manually -Developer had an estimated budget of 18million dollars, yet they did not license any single seater class and alot of racetracks -Multiplayer has connection issues, softlocks at race begin, ignores input from additional shifters  On the bright side: it looks nice, if you really want to spend that much money on Shift 2, then go ahead  And please stop referring this as a SIMULATOR, just because the dev claims it is, and the cars handle extremely poor, its not a simulation
9927	UPDATED REVIEW FOR PATCH 2.0  My PC specifications, Windows 7x64, i7 4GHz, GTX980 12GB ram &amp; Thrustmaster T500 RS &amp; Xbox PC Controller.  Graphics The game looks good, weather and cars especially look good, environment graphics however look like something I would expect from indy development. Also if your not running graphics at ultra (I get 25 to 50FPS range depending on complexity of track with a GTX980 set at ultra - aura coast compared to brands hatch). The cars while looking great, are too clean compared to their environments, they need to get dirty more, have imperfect textures get dust on them etc (see asseto corsa etc). Excellent view choices from cockput, bonnet +++ best I've seen on a racing game.  Audio Still has glitches, or is it trying to simulate car body hitting floor making odd noises at times, no idea! Going through a tunnel no matter what the size puts all audio through a huge reverb and echo effect which really pulls you out of the immersion of the game.  Track They look good but to be ohnest there isn't much to them really, however 1 really big issue. Back in the old school days racing games would put collision on the sides of the track so you can never leave the track no matter what (given a little buffer / space), project cars does this. Try driving off the track even a little on one of the non racing circuits.  Gameplay Career mode starts with carts, every car race circuit time I done was invaidated as I apparently cut the track or drove off it even without having doing this. This is not so bad with the normal cars however. Carts feel very mario cart with the corner turning angles. I kept getting endless laps and blue flag to let an invisible car past to which it then says go go go!  Force Feedback Absolute rubbish, how can they take such a long time to develop this game and get the force feedback so very wrong. Curbs have greater force feedback than barriers and walls. This hasn't been fixed in patch 2.0 but the steam forums have some people whom have made fixes themselves for the game, which have made it more playable.  XBox controller on PC Patch 2.0 has improved on this, or it was either a result of me spending over an hour trying out settings. Seems the universal scale of the higher the number the higher the sensitivy is the other way around for this game. Still it's far from perfect but it's playable, if you can put up with stuff like that. And not having the ability to change these settings from race menu but only from main menu drove me up the wall!   Final thoughts If you haven't already got Asseto Corsa, Grid Auto Sport or RaceRoom Experience (free) and Race 07 then I suggest get them first. Project cars has been in development for years and a lot of the bugs even with patch 2.0 have not been fixed, the game is still very much in beta. I also cannot forgive any racing game or developers of a racing game that release a racing game where the force feedback is a disaster, even after patch 2.0 it's still an issue.   For the price and development time put into this game I was expecting something so much more, the car graphics are excellent the rest is last last gen AAA or indy game quality. The graphics push my 980 considerably set on ultra even though I don't see anything that should be pushing it that hard.  The game just feels like it's still in beta.  I can only hope that it works correctly for VR on the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift, but I'm pretry certain I wont be able to run it on ultra for that 90 FPS VR requirement.  Graphics: 7/10 Sound effects: 4/10 Music: 9/10 Force Feedback: 4/10 XBox Controller: 2/10 Gameplay: 5/10 Track selection: 9/10 Car selection: 7/10 Bugs: 7/10 = 3/10 positive Price: 2/10  Score: 52%  I would recommend that you wait till it's on sale and the game is on patch 4 or 5.
9928	I bought this game during Slightly Mad Studios buy-in early access at around Build 200-ish. Followed it until build 400 when I refunded it because I didn't feel the game was going to achieve it's goals of producing a comprehensive accessible racing simulation for everyone.  I pre-ordered it again before release, figuring I'd give this game a chance and I'm bitterly disapointed. I'm getting serious NFS Shift vibes from this, but it isn't all bad.   Pros
9929	The race directors given you a warning for slightly going off the track when you were trying to avoid an accident and so has penalized you by slowing you down for five whole seconds so that you have no choice of catching up to the rest of the pack. I love this game. So fun.
9930	Rubbish... says its a sim but its far from a sim, also its not even finished yet it still in beta stage.....  Sorry but i wouldnt recomend...
9931	After all the hype i thought this game was going to be good.  Graphics are good but that about it, i just dont want to play it very boring.  Owell have to wait for forza 6.
9932	buggy, unfinished, ai is crap, should have bought AC.
9933	Very misleading title, not enough detail of the game in the description, very limited game modes/options, no car customization other than tuning, very little color selection, just overall terrible buy if you're looking for a game to cruise in/customize cars. All in all i'm very disappointed with how ridiculous the steering is in this game and it's very frustrating to even learn how it works.
9934	The game has to few Cars and Tracks!
9935	maybe its a good simulation my BIG problems with the game are: -i bought a new racing game to have an active community to have some nice races..my problem is you cant find useful races, there are too many race courses and too less people that you can find a race for the courses you trained  - i dont like any of the cars they implemented in the game, i am a big fan of the WTCC, the cars in the touring sections are a dissapointment  -i enjoy to play a career mode from the low to the top..but karts are just a pain, also in the multiplayer are barely no open kart races, seems nobody like them. i wished they implemented more import or WTCC cars and not theses karts.  Its just my personal opinion on the game, i guess its just not for me. I enjoy RACE07 much much more
9936	Some racing games I love that mix realism with arcade mechanics. Some racing games I can't stand that try to mix realism/sim with arcade mechanics. Unfortunately, this is one of the games that just doesn't work for me. I love arcade racers like Crazy Taxi, Mario Kart, Distance, Forza Horizon 2, GRID, and Need for Speed Most Wanted/Burnout Paradise. I absolutely love realistic sims like GTR2, RACE ON, F1 Challenge 99-02, F1 2013, Assetto Corsa, and etc... I really enjoyed Forza Motorsports 5 (Half realism/Half arcade) and Drive Club (same as Forza 5). This game is utter crap compared to Forza, Test Drive Unlimited, DriveClub, Gran Turismo 5, Forza Horizon 2, GRID Autosport, and almost every single other racing game. Very dissapointed by the game mechanics. Also, the game runs very poor on my desktop i5, 8gb ram, and Nvidia GTX 960 2GB Video Card. Bad game. Another awful racing game. Moving on...
9937	this is game is (*note* my expectations were high) - quite boring - beatified 'shift 2' - doesn't have subarus or other common vehicles except ford focus rs - controller sensitivity sucks and there's no sweet spot, e.g. slightest throttle blip on my xbox controller causes WOT acceleration - it is harder to keep control of car than in assetto corsa, e.g. at one point in game i couldn't avoid renault clio from wiping out on downhill and slighest turn - real world tracks are BORING - the game engine does very nice job with weather, reflections, and other shader effects, unlike assetto corsa that supports only 1 light source (sun) and can't have night tracks / reflections etc...LoL - overall it is a good quality near-sim for right folks, i enjoy DRIVECLUB on PS4 a whole lot more.
9938	I'll try to keep this short but thorough.  I have been part of the testing phase since pre-alpha. The game has improved inifinitely throughout its development - as it should have done. I REALLY wanted to like this game!  Positives: Weather effects, day/night time options, graphics and immersive UI are all best in class.  That said, the game does not feel finished. The AI is my biggest gripe. Cars do not respond to your position. The AI in this game is comparible to that in Gran Turismo. They stick to the racing line whether you're in the way or slower.  I am a seasoned driver on iRacing and Assetto Corsa and the physics in those games is definitely mroe believable. The handling in Project CARS definitely feels scripted which is something I've heard a lot of people say.  I play with a G27 with no assists and the AI difficulty on 100% and I finish most races (set to 2 laps mostly) with a lead of about 7 seconds (not intending to sound like a ...)  What we need is the career of Project CARS with the physics and FFB of Assetto Corsa and the online/competitivity of iRacing!    FINAL WORD: I would recommend Assetto Corsa over this game personally, though Project CARS has a lot going for it.
9939	HARD!! unless your a die hard racing game this baby is tough. it also lacks the upgrade system that makes most racing games a lot of fun. And you wont find any cars you can drive on the street in here, All race cars
9940	Game has great potential as a semi-sim like Shift series. Graphics are fine, time of day progression is awesome, cars feel good... BUT! But it's clear the 'release' was rushed. FFB is all over the place and needs serious tweaking to be considered acceptable, car settings resetting at will, AI phuqs up or cheats on a regular basis, some tracks award you with 'off-track penalty' for no reason -- lots of stuff isn't working as supposed. Oh, and that ability to consult with a race engineer for car tuning? Ability, that is listed in the 'digital manual', many times mentioned in the game itself and was part of advertising program? Well it's NOT done. Customer fraud at it's worst. So, should you buy this game? Definitely!.. on 2015 Christmas sale -- maybe it'll get into shape by that time. For now -- stick to Assetto Corsa or something else. Don't touch this half-ready product.
9941	I was looking for something like Forza for PC, it can't even compare. Trying to tune a car is almost a lesson in engineering, plus a lesson in metrics/obscure measurments for Imperialists. The cars handle like they're on sheet ice. Traction control, ABS, pretty much all the assists are useless. There is no way to turn off penalties for going off track and whatever the game bases 'off-track' is screwy to the point pulling out hair. It makes qualifying more tedious than it should be. Tried using a 360 controller, buggy to say the least. Had to upgrade to a One-wired for the game to even work. Disappointed overall.
9942	Looks and sounds great but the car and cart handling reminds me of Grid, bad, and that killed it for me. Update: PLayed agian and it's stil pretty bad. Only thing I can say is that it has great graphics and car selection. Sorry if I hurt the feelings of Fan Boys...
9943	I didn't end up liking the game despite funding it's development. What's neat however, is I still get a few bucks every few months in my Paypal from these guys. If I had any idea my $12 investment would turn into $30+, I'd have invested much more.
9944	The game feels like it is still an early access game. The Bots drive like maniacs and insist on driving on their racing line no matter what or who is on it. The racing line itself matches maybe two vehicles in the whole game, any other car has to brake at some other point. The Pit is empty, except for that one guy that seems to change your tires (without animation btw), fill up your car and at the same time hold the 'brake' sign in front of you. Sometimes the Pit is so buggy that you cannot even get out of it. The Pit menu is everything but easy and intuitive, this seems to be a genral problem in the game. The weather animation looks nice but does not seem to affect your tires since, if you choose the usually appropriate tires for this weather they overheat massively.  The online mode is not perfect as well and you have to make a new lobby after every game, if you want to change anything.
9945	In the short time I played the game I found it to be buggy. The cars would consistently jerk left or right without driver intervention, and cost me several races as a result. Even on Manual Transmission settings the car still shifts for you. The graphics are a positive, but there is no way to design your own livery without photoshopping one and importing it into the game. Overall the game is ok at best, and needs more patches and attention to become what it should have been.
9946	Did not live up to the hype. New sequal anounced and monthly cars not free. Lack of car content. Waste of money for the price ,
9947	Wish I had not bought it awfull game I don't even think the graphics are nice and the physics are crap! How do you get a refund on steam?
9948	Impossible to enjoy crap game wasted $60.  
9949	This game is horrible. Not very realistic at all. Only if you have the specific brand hardware, it is just eye candy and that's it.
9950	Fix the AI
9951	Look at that shiny asphalt, wow look at the beautiful rain droplets on the screen, look those soft wavy grass. It's a beautiful looking game, but that's all that I can say about it. The physics feels weird, either that or the game is not controller friendly. Asseto Corsa and DiRT Rally plays pretty well with a controller. Project CARS has a better UI than Asseto and better ingame graphics, but that's about it. PCars should still be in early access, or should have a lower price tag. The game isn't perfect and the studio has already announced Project Cars 2. Thank lord Gaben for Steam refunds.
9952	As a SCCA hobbist in real life I felt a game like this would be right up my alley. I quickly realized that I was wrong and the 'sim' my be too sim-ish for the worst. Any car in any class handles horribly even when turning off all driving aids like TCS and ABS, selecting a full manual gearbox. I was using a X Box One game pad but just the slightest bit of movement would over steer and there is a huge dead zone on the accelarator. Over all this game is horrible in comparison to other games I have played like the Gran Turismo or the Project Gotham Racing series. Plus I couldn't find any type of way to paint your car to a color you like just ugly pre-picked racing schemes. Maybe I was just not seeing it in the menu. That is another BIG problem with this game the menus. They are so busy it is hard to tell what to do in career mode. Took about 10 minutes to figure out how to join a race. Over all not the best and I quickly requested a refund after 40 minutes of play time. Sorry Project CARS but I give you a 3/10.
9953	For control, this is the worst racing game I have ever had. Moreover, the ui of game menu is really POOR designed! If you use mouse, that would be fine; but if you use controller to navigate, you would have completely on idea what to do next, which button should be pressed.  The car parameter is also in bad design. No comparison with other cars; car performances are only shown in digits, that means you can't get the first impression when overviewing them. The only advantage of the game is the graphic quality. Full details on your own and your opponents.
9954	Project Cars is the worst money I've ever spent on anything. Look beautiful all you want but if I wipe out on every corner no matter how hard I try, 'it's a simulation game' is not a good excuse for bad physics. I'd like a refund please.
9955	Thinking of playing this game with a controller? Don't bother. Controller configuration options are confusing with no explanations for the many different settings. Cars feel like they are tanks with lots of input lag or so twitchy that one miniscule tap of the stick sends the car veering off course. I looked at many youtube videos and forum posts (pretty bad when I have to do that for information instead of the game itself).  As of this review, I have had 5 hours play time, about 2 hours of which must have been spent configuring the controller settings; the game has also crashed 9 times.  The game looks great and has potential but as of yet the controller settings are a nightmare and as such this game has been a total waste of money for me. Hold onto your money until issues are resolved.
9956	In it's current state, I would not recommend this, far too many bugs and problems that will leave you frustrated. However, once the game actually gets finished it has the potential to be incredible.
9957	its a good game at the end of the day but it is broken in so many ways its hard to explain. just watch the videos. and no one is saying the wrongs in the game with fear of being band by head Ian, whom no one seem to like and we need a change i dont recomend spending money on this game till we weed out everything wrong with the game in all aspects. the graphic engine is not built for amd and was done with the knowledge they were doing it to help nvidia the only supporters of the game on the graphic side. Management banning poeple for speaking out. and to pay 50 60 dollars and 2 weeks later it drop to 39. is a terible pill to swallow no i dont recomend it unless you hate i racing and get that away from steam. all these extra charges is ridiculous... 
9958	Well first time i saw the game it seemed to be the best realistic car simulator! When i payed for that i was sure i will not regret I was so wrong! First of all the graphics and the sount are fantastic the design of the cars also realistic and beutiful but when you start a reace... every thing goes wrong the game is so punishing! cuse if you dont got a whele controller the game is imposable to play the car get outbalanced at strait road! So for me its a waste of money cuse i just wanted have fun and play a VIDEO GAME and not trying to punish my self and dout if this is how i drive in real life And now codmasters Please show me that DRIVERS that tried the game and told you that this is how cars react so i can slap cam them for that lie!
9959	A good 'GAME', I would not say it's an simulator YET. There is a lot of space for improvements. Some thinks I would like are  - enable us to choose the beautiful colors of the cars - enable the chase camera to be fixed in one position even while driving fast - enable to drive out of the pits manualy - enable joining a session without having to wait untill the next one  The list could go on. Negative feedback just so I'm sure someone will read it. 
9960	I got a female â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when i jump back to Assetto Corsa.  10/10 would female â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ again.
9961	Well, the helpful, informative review I gave this game, with reasons why I thought the way I did, was consistently downvoted as unhelpful.. so, the Steam Community has spoken, and asked for a meaningless and pointless review instead. So here it is.  3/10 Would waste my money again. Not.  
9962	dont waste your money on this game, graphics dont look like the trailers at all even on max settings, and for whatever reason whenever you touch the brake pedal the car will instantly spin out.
9963	Don't buy it till they fix it for AMD cards.
9964	I've spend 3 hours messing with controller settings and still steering is very awful (I'm using PS3 controller). Sometimes it feels like the cars have a mind on its own and if you touch the grass - the race is over. Career mode starts getting boring very fast. The game just throws you a bunch series of races, that doesn't feel different from each other. After you win a race, it doesn't feel like you won something. Even after you win the whole season you just get a well-made 3D model of a trophy, of which you can take a screenshot or you never see it again, so there's nothing that makes you play the game again. For now this game is just a simulator for taking pretty screenshots.

9967	First impressions on the game: Driving is just about the best experience i had so far (in a sim). Graphics are stunning. The game runs as smooth as i was expecting.  Although:  After waiting 7 months on successive delays 'to deliver a finished and polished' game, they didn't quite get there. Why?  1. So, after several tries on Time Trial to set my best time (on California Highway Full, with a 12C GT3), with no penalties at all, i couldn't get the time to get saved. Glitch?  2. After being on the Time Trials for a while, i decided to start the career. Guess what, first race is supposed to be with karts agains AI opponents, on a track for Karts (don't remember the name), i tried to get in the race for like 3 or 4 times and i was always getting with a Kart on California Highway, alone. Quit the game, got back to it, and it was all fine - Kart, against AI, on a Kart track. 3. Not sure if this is a feature or not, but i find it super annoying that when on the pole position, it always sets the car on 1st gear. There are two different cam views while waiting for the green light. If you switch to N while on the first cam and start throttling, when the cam automatically changes, it switches the gear to 1st, which, if you're throtling, will get you desqualified as you start racing before the green light.   Besides these 3 annoying little things, the experience ingame is absolutely fantastic.  EDIT:  Been trying the game a little more and no, i'm sorry but this is a beta that SMS pushed out just to get the money from the pre-orders. this game has so many glitches and bugs that is just starting to be annoying.  just give a look at pCARS forums before you buy the game, and look at all the issue reports. (and worse, the answers 'this is a known issue, we are looking into it'.. details like people getting penalties for being pushed out of track from behind, or after getting out of the pit stops.. no tire sound in most of the tracks.. issues with non responsive pedals.. tire marks 10cm above/ away from the road.. the list goes on.. it's pretty frustrating to play with some of these issues. when they don't show, it's all ok, but otherwise, just makes me super mad at the game!
9968	This might be an amazing game with a wheel, but the gamepad controls are miserable. No amount of adjustment could dial this game in for me. The controls were either too twitchy or not responsive enough. In addition the recklessly aggressive AI and not quite right physics make it hard to be successful. In comparison of other great racing games like Assetto Corsa, Forza, or Shift the cars have absolutely no feel, so when you're racing on the ragged edge you don't know you've gone to far until the car spins. Can't recommend it in the current state.
9969	First impressions review!   The racing and the ambience looks great.   The driving feels different for each car. But not all cars drive like they should, i guess you can set it up properly. So it looks like this will require some time to do it right. Nothing for: let's just have some quick racing fun. More advanced settings needed to race each/all car(s).  KI Racers, like other racing games. They don't make mistakes, but are also not pro drivers. I did either win or was last depending on how good i know the car and the circuit and depending if i have made one mistake or none.  The menu is crap. Doesn't even recognize my mouse (not visible). I had to use -dx9 for the launch options in steam to get it windowed and able to do some settings. Looks very much like a console port eventhough it isn't.  Keyboard? Forget it, cant drive with it. You need a steering wheel.  I have multiscreens, but the loading behaves differently each time when loading the game. Sometimes occupies all screens sometimes just one.  Summary: Great graphics and settings. Everything else is average or below. Good game for advanced racing gamers. For all others - don't buy it. Price is for the number of problems i encountered simply too high. Therefore overall, don't buy.
9970	As both a fan of racing games, and a race car driver myself, this game is pretty spot on with handling. Throttle response, and traction are both very realistic. And the tracks themselves are much more realistic than any other racing game I have played.  Unfortunately this game is very poorly optimized, and unless you have a pretty decent gaming machine, dont expect to be able to use anything but the bottom of the barrel graphical settings. Basically making the game look like GT1. Even more unfortunate is the company behind this game seems to have no concern for this lack of optimization, or the memory leaks that cause you to require a restart of the game every few races.   Currently I have my fingers crossed that the company will pull it together and fix this little project of theirs, or this one will be another to be trumped by the traditional forza and GT.  Conclusion: Dont buy it right now, wait until its fixed. Even all the bells and whistles are not worth all the headache from this game.
9971	nvidia shillworks nonsense. stay away if you have an amd card.  edit: runs a lot better when paired with an i5 4690k @ 4.3 ghz. you just need a very good cpu if you're going to use an amd video card with this game.
9972	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
9973	Confusing menus, too hard to play, no fun.
9974	The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and crashes all the time. Avoid this game like the plague.
9975	Can't recommend a game where countersteer is non-existant Car sounds are not accurate and shifting doesn't sound like a real transmission would. The weight of the car doesn't feel like it should. The game physics are very questionnable We also shouldn't have to pay for ' car packs ' just fix the game and sell it for more. AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ too. The game will punish you for being hit by AI.  Also, AI can drive and do whatever they want without getting the penalties you would get if you did the same. Graphics are good.  3/10   
9976	This Game is broken for AMD customers, You would hit a cone and it would stay in place before being flung half across the track..... Impressive physics? I think not.... Also being able to muster 45 fps on ultra on 1080p on two 290x just speak volumes of how little optimization they did. I refunded my purchase and spent it on something that actually works!
9977	I find myself having trouble if I recommend this game or not. It really is hovering around that 3 star range for me. This game does a lot of things right, and brings many interesting things to the table. This game does a lot of things wrong.   Disclaimer: I did not play this game during early access, I'm coming to this game from a full package 1.0 perspective. I am using a G27 Driving Wheel.  I'm a pretty recent racing fan, I've played many of the recents including a brief but intensive stint of iRacing, some Asseto Corsa, and other like games such as Dirt Rally, F1 201X.   So lets start out with what I really love about Project cars. You get a good deal of cars to choose from and generally if its a race car you can think of, its there. When it comes to tracks, the game also has a healthy amount and features the Nurburring which you often don't see in racing games due its length, but I find myself missing tracks like Circuit of the Americas, Lime Rock, and a few others. But don't get me wrong, its a good list of tracks.   Being a real life F1 fan, you hear a lot about karting and it was really neat to have a game that included karting in it and really this leads me to the BEST point about Project Cars in my opinion, its saving grace. The Career mode.  The career mode allows you to start in the lowest of the low (karting) and make your way all the way up to things like Formula 1 (A in the game) . It also allows you to choose your desination from things like touring cars or formula cars. Being able to have this progress really makes the game a rewarding experience and really makes you feel like you're accomplishing something. Games like iRacing obviously have a similarly satisfying progression system but its much less accessible due to the price and the nature of having to be good against other players.   However, although facing AI makes the game more accesible, it also comes with a price. The AI in this game is bad. Not unplayably bad, but not good. If you're the type of person that can not stand AI cheating, you're gunna have a rough time with this game. If you touch grass or gravel you're thrown off the track by some mystical sideforce, no spinning or anything you'd expect. Its just like a giant vaccum just opened up right next to you. AI, on the other hand, have ZERO CONSEQUENCE for going off road. No slowdown, no weird sideforce, nothing. On top of this, AI are very oblivious to your presence. If you are on their racing line they will drive through you even if it ruins both your races in the process. You'll find yourself restarting the races again and again when the AI wrecks you which generally made me make the races as short as possible to compensate. Even with the AI cheating, they're still very bad in certain classes. In karting even at the absolute highest level I found myself crushing the AI as they just took ridiculously slow racing lines and starts. Yet in other classes the AI demolishes you. The difficulty slider really has to be tweaked in each tier to your liking.   Crash physics are extremely weird, if you lift off the ground the game reacts like you just hit a concrete wall 10ft in the air. Damage is inconsistent. Grass slows you down like a sandtrap instead of you sliding. Some cars feel like their center of weight is a lagged pendulum. When I drove in Iracing and wrecked, I always knew why I wrecked. I often found myself wondering WHY am I spinnig in Pcars. I don't know if this is because the physics model is wrong, or if the force feedback is not communicative enough about the vehicle. FFB just seems kinda there as an immersive feature rather than a feature that lets you know what the car is doing.    So! Clearly this game has a lot of problems. I do find myself coming back just for the career mode, and to experience new vehicles. Do I recommend this game? I think it really depends on what you're looking for. If you love Forza and Gran Turismo, this might be the game for you? If you play games like Asseto Corsa and iRacing, be prepared for some major steps back in some areas, but you may still be able to find your own fun somewhere.   Ultimately, I cannot recommend this game for the average racer. If you really like the idea of a career progression, I recommend picking it up, but for the amount of flaws this game has, its just too rough right now to recommend for everyone else
9978	After playing countless hours of Need For Speed's, Forza's, Midnight Clubs's, and many other racing games, I am not too impressed with this game. Its not exactly a 'bad game', but I find the quality lower than I had expected.  What I liked:  The amount of options (so many options to customize the gameplay) Up to 46 cars at once   What i didn't like:  The graphics look cartoonish, aren't very impressive compared to Forza, which is a CONSOLE GAME. This is PC, since when does a game look better on console, than it does on PC? The handling of the cars Runs horribly on my GTX 970 (overclocked) 
9979	With ai this bad even in the steam sale this game is not a good buy. Your on a track with other racers but you are actually ivisible to them. So get prepared to be bumped shunted run off the road. Losing patience already have to look elsewhere I guess.
9980	Xbox360 Controller, almost impossible to drive with... karts are all over the damn place.
9981	23rd MAY - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!   Unhandled exception errors all over the place. I have only been able to do a race then the game crashes.  I had high hopes for this game but the errors in the coding mean it's probably going to take some time before I would recommend buying it.   I played it on my friends PS4 and it even crashed on that so I don't think it's hardware based and rather something not right in the code (C++?).  Wait for the updates I guess :-(  I feel more than slightly MAD right now.
9982	Obviously project cars is a stunning game but I can't help feeling a little disappointed. All I want is to race in amazing cars and in this game there's way too much going on in terms of distracting menu's, options, complicated game play hurdles etc.. But if you're into all that then this game is perfect.
9983	Only tried this game for a short time.. with an xbox controller... I will say i absolutely hate this game. I only bought it to test with my vr setup... The handling in rain is tap the joystick a tiny tiny bit and ur car does 360 degree spins... its just not a fun game whatsoever.. not realistic.
9984	Do Not Get its terrible i thought it was good at looking at screenshots and videos but no no DO NOT BUY!!!! U cant upgrade cars or tune or anything and controlls are terrible omgL: JUST NEVER GET THIS SCAM

9986	I've tried to like this game, But its not a true sim. its more of a arcade sim. its more fun witha controller than a wheel. if your looking for a realistic sim and have fun your much better off going with Iracing or asseto corsa.  If you want a game that feels like forza or gran turismo 5 then this game is for you. fun with controller.

9988	career mode :-  graphics look great and it runs very well , however a little too complicated to navigate around set up screens  online mode :-  alot of waiting around for sessions to fill or host to start , start a race with 15 players after lap one 7 will leave , after lap 2 lucky if there is still 4 players racing , by end of race you be on the track alone if you are in first place unless 2nd place is right on your tail,  worst online gaming experience ever , unless you are recing a group of friends  summary:-  looks great , runs smooth .tricky to master , lots of waiting around in online mode if your looking for a fun racing game this is not for you, this is a racing sim only for the most anal racers  edit 1 :- after a week of more of playing,and trying to get some value for my money i think i was a little too lenient in my review and feel the need to comeback and state the following :-  more of a waiting sim than a driving sim  graphics periodically freeze for no reason whilst racing making you crash   worst online racing game EVER by far  edit2   had the game for a while now, ive continued to play trying my hardest to ignore all the glitches and waiting online, as i really wanted to like it becauee it looks great, as i've progressed it seems its not a driving sim afterall, its more of a car set up sim, if you dont know how to set the 'what seems loike millions' of car settings then you've got no chance , no matter how good a driver you are , the others will be 7 seconds a lap faster.   final summary :-  looks great , lots of waiting online , lots of glitches , Car set up sim rather than driving sim, awful online gaming  i cant stress enough how awful this online gaming is  wish i'd not wasted my money
9989	runs like crap on my amd system. I prefer Assetto Corsa for the laser scanned tracks, and the VR actually works
9990	Boat simulator 2015! No feeling of the back of the car and random frame rate drops, but the game has potential when it's finished.
9991	Dont buy it! As it seems very promising you get very little content for an extreme amount of money and the game is mostly no fun. Also it wont run smothly and bugfree on nearly any System.  And yes Linux support would be appriciated! The developers take all your money, but you get very leattle in exchange. 
9992	Not Enough Cars.
9993	Bought this game thinking It looked stunning and it would be good but I am so disappointed to say i just cannot play it. Using an xbox 360 controller this game is horrible. It is unplayable for me. Cars are just uncontrollable, they are sluggish to turn no matter the settings and they snap back causing constant spin outs. I don't have this issue in any other racing game. Poor show!
9994	Beautiful game, but way too hard to set up and drive with a standard gamepad or keyboard. I guess this is designed for professional gamers. At least I got it for half price.
9995	Whilst I enjoy every aspect of this game there is one single problem that ruins it: AI. 1. They don't leave room at all. 2. They touch you and if you don't receive damage you spin uncontrollably and your race is ruined. 3. Going wide or completely off doesn't affect them, for you it will make you shovel time to the AI  The worst thing is the AI are so close to being good, I've had a handful of great battles, unfortunately they have been outweighed by the amounts of races I've restarted due to the horse-â¥â¥â¥â¥ moves the AI pull.
9996	In setting Iâm selected keyboard and handbrake is space when I tap the handbrake in game nothing happens. I'm think this is games issue and I hope this problem will be fix. Thank you.
9997	TLDR   PROS: Decent Graphics, good physics engine, good track selecton  CONS: Little to no automotive content, pay for completion I.E DLC.   Extended Version  Admittedly, I actually didn't spend much time with the game before I wrote this review, but I spent enough time in game to know what this game is missing, and it is missing a lot. Project Cars was also released on the consoles where it's going to go up against two very large and very popular titans. And it's going to get its butt kicked for the very reasons why I am giving the game a neutral/negative review for the PC version. The content available at release is dissapointing and Slightly Mad Studios has gleefully jumped on the DLC bus so that to add to the paltry list of vehicles, you have to pay more.  I admit that I am spoiled by the way things are done in Gran Turismo or Forza, I love being able to take a beater/cheap car and slowly building it up piece by piece. I enjoy driving the street cars more than I do the full blown race cars. I would rather bomb around the track in a Honda that has some extreme performance stree tires, suspension mods and a few engine tweaks than blast around in whatever race car is offered. To me the former is far more entertaining than the latter. I don't understand why that formula hasn't crossed over to the PC sims. And PCars drops the ball here.   The car list is pathetic. I went to hop in a Ford... I had a single option. Thats ONE, UNO, SOLO. Same with BMW. Yay. Where is Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Renault, not to mention Chevrolet. And where are the big boys? Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche?   The Project Cars hype campaign promised a lot of things, but Im not seeing it. Essentially, its got some great looking dinnerware, but there is no meat whatsoever on those plates and we're getting water instead of wine.  I wish that there was a neutral option as I don't completely dislike the game and there is hope for it. But Im not impressed enough by it to give it a thumbs up. Thankfully, I did not pay full price for this. Still, Im considering putting Steams refund policy to the test.
9998	Worst game to play aginst AI, some races there are easy, some races, you can even pass anyone, No consistency, AI is not smart, meaning if something is in front of them, they brake, so hard, you end up at their back, and when touch their back, both cars wont steer, most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ARCADE game ever.
9999	you'd expect this game to be a realistic driver simulation, instead its just another arcade. the way the cars behave on track is not realistic. you'd think the amount of money these idiots spend they woul'd consult professional drivers on the handling of these vehicles. pathetic. NOT THE GAME FOR THE TRUE DRIVING FANATICS. Rather go for F1 or Forza.
10000	Very nice but requires a lot of fixes. I am crashing on a black screen all the time. PC Class AAA.  Second day of the game and it is dead on black screen. Sad.
10001	Broken on Intel I5-4690k, R9 390. It simply crashes when initialising, it isn`t even the first time, before the last time they updated the game it was only playable in windowed mode and you couldn`even change it in the settings. It was fun for several months but not anymore
10002	Wish I could but I can't. VR optimization is horrendous, at the moment at least for the Vive. Standard game is absolutely stunning, visually speaking, never got around to the rest of the game since I was hell bent on playing it in VR. If they were to patch it to make 90 FPS in VR with the HMD settings it currently recommends then I would lose my life to this game and become a fanboy till the end of my days. You can tell from the experience and the moment you load into the driver's seat of a car that this could change the way we game forever, then I go to drive and realize I'm dangerously close to having my first ever epileptic seizure if the framerate drops any lower. It can't be properly explained the amount of satisfaction you feel when you're sitting in that driver's seat and conversely the dissapointment that floods through you when you realize that's about all you can do comfortably. If they don't release a well-optimized patch for VR, which they surely don't have to since I've already bought their product along with many others, then it'll just sit in my library collecting dust with the rest of the dissapointing games I've bought along the way because there are other and arguably better, depending on personal preference of course, racing games out there if VR is not a selling point for you.

10004	I have had so many crashes and problems with this game, i wouldn't recommend this to hitler. Your VR update broken my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game. I can't see any video. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥. Prior to that, random crashing to desktop. Not impressed with your developers at all.
10005	The cars are just impossibe to drive, and the AI is stupid. They just push me aside, or crash into me from the back with such force that I fly out of the track. One example which happened today: the AI crashed into me from the back, I spun around, and crashed into the car behind me. Boom, disqualified!
10006	This is completely unacceptable. One of the glitchiest games i've played in a long time.   When the car is pre race and driving by itself, it gets jammed behind stuff resulting in me starting the race wayyy behind the other drivers.  Sometimes the game decides to not respond to my pedals, be fine with the buttons and half respond to the steering wheel (G27 Logitech)... this happens every 4th race and is completely game breaking.   Not sure how this has 'mostly positive' reviews tbh. Glad I didn't buy this when it was Â£40, but still feel like Â£16 was wasted :(  Great game in theory, but unfinished. Do not buy.
10007	Used to be a good game when it released. Now I can't even find a server with players in it to race with - not because they dont exist, but because the server browser system is ALL screwed up. It has filters that do...absolutely nothing, not that it matters because the entire list is only empty games. Even when trying to join a friends game via invite, it takes FOREVER to join IF you dont get an error while joining. When the game 1st came out this was not an issue at all - but they made their money now, and dont care about support anymore.    I dont buy games for single player.  This game as well as Star Citizen have taught me to never buy games from non-mainstream publishers, as much as I hate EA.
10008	Continues Freeze on race loading is the most annoying thing and thats all this useless junk game does !!! 
10009	The traction in this game is a joke. My economy sedan with old tires has more grip on the road than these racecars do. Anyone that's actually driven a sports car could tell you that they grip like crazy, meanwhile this game has you skidding out of a corrner if you do more than 60kph. Ridiculous.
10010	Go get Assetto Corsa, Project Cars is not even close to a racing sim, too easy to drive, only 1 'TV' camera for replays, graphics look too sharp it is not realistic; I can see a 12 year old having fun with this one, I think thats their market.
10011	good sounds, graphics and tracks. But the handling and car selection is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. On that bombshell not worth the full price.
10012	I've played almost 100 hours of Assetto Corsa and decided to buy this thinking it may be a good addition to my racing simulator collection but the force feed back is horrible compared to Assetto Corsa. You can't even adjust the suspension systems or anything like you can in Assetto Corsa. Assetto Corsa allows you to adjust almost everything you would be able to adjust in real life. The track selection is actually better than Assetto Corsa and so is the car selection (yet you can't adjust/tune ANY of the cars). The graphics aren't optimized so you'll run at lower FPS than you really should be. The car interiors look better than Assetto Corsa. The Lotus Type 49 is almost literally impossible to drive in a straight line with all default settings for my G27 and the force feed back while I have spent nearly 15 hours driving that car in Assetto Corsa and have nearly mastered it. Mod support is horrible, while Assetto Corsa has mods up the wazoo.
10013	I have a Fanatec 911 racing wheel, and I've played Forza 3, 4 and Horizon, GT5, etc... But this game is shallow, very shallow. Like there's no soul in this game: I have no motivation to play this. It's like drinking a glass of water, when you really expect to be eating a hamburger. This game is a SOLID 'technical game' but it isn't what I consider fun whatsoever. Steer clear of it if you can. This game is a dud.
10014	Despite being graphically stunning and fun to play on occasion I find the lack of car models and makes quite dissapointing when compared to other racing games on the market aswell as little to no customization of vehicles i would only recommend this game for those who are looking for a racing simulator but not for someone looking for a fun racing game to just pickup and play
10015	good sounds, graphics and tracks. But the handling and car selection is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. On that bombshell not worth the full price.

10018	Terrible with DK2 and AMD setup
10019	X360 controller &amp; Project Cars. No.
10020	It looks awesome at it was fun for the time i played but unfortunately i had crashes after every single race. I started a research on it and tried to figure out whats the problem. But i couldn't fix it and cannot recommend this game from this point of view. Thanks to steam i could claim this game.
10021	Hey project cars what the â¥â¥â¥â¥s going on after the update 10 the game wont load fix it.
10022	This game is just terrible, do not waste your money on it.
10023	I give this game 0/10 just because of Ian Bell. Oh, and game is boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ (and buggy as well), there are much better car simulations out there.
10024	This game was clearly designed for pressure sensitive buttons, if you don't have them then it gets frustrating rather quickly since you'll either be throttling to the max, or not at all, same with braking
10025	This game has been released for almost a year and there somehow seems to be more bugs than there were on release date; and there were a LOT of bugs on release date.
10026	It crashes all the time. I tried to returned but Steam donÂ´t let me.
10027	I bought Project Cars after having recently purchased Dirt Rally, unfortunately after playing Dirt - of which the car handling is very realistic - playing project cars is somewhat of a dissapointment. The car handling and sounds are nowhere near realistic, ok as a playstation arcade game sort of thing but nothing like what you would exprience in a real car. If the sounds were good at least I could forgive the basic physics for an easy to pick up type game, but the sounds are just plain rubbish - nothing exciting or powerful. I woulld only purchase this as an arcade type game, definately not as a simulator which has left me dissapointed with my purchase. Play Diry Rally, then this. I'm sorry but i can't recommend buying this.
10028	Im playing it on Xbox one and that's why it doesn't show that much time logged here.  I just got the G920 with stick shifter yesterday, then I bought for approx. $100 worth of PCars with some addons as ive read that it has some very realistic elements in it.  In my view it does have some nice driving physics, but unfortunately it falls very short in other ways.  First off, the selection of cars aren't really too impressive and most of them (all but one or two) are overbuffed up racing versions with insane amounts of power. There're no common road cars in stock trim and that's a shame as I love race with that stock GTI hot hatch.  There are more or less +/- all the usual tracks (those that are in every racing game) so that's what one would expect.  PCars beat Forza 6 on one front only and that's the driving experience, its not that much different, but some parts just feel more refined.  PCars is really overpriced, because getting the top version and all the addons is roughly the same cost as the top version of Forza 6 and besides some slightly more refined driving physics, PCars is a total disappointment compared to Forza 6.  Do I regret that I bought it? Somewhat yes, because I have to admit, that if I had been able to try the game before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it.....well maybe if the price had been at least somewhat reasonable, like $20 or so.
10029	Let's get one thing straight: the gameplay itself is perfect for a racing simulator. There are loads of tracks to choose from, and many cars. Customization options with regards to time, weather, lap amount, difficulty are top notch.  The reason I do not recommend this game is the amount of effort it takes to get it to work: - On my first PC the game would not start up at all, simple error message and back to desktop. After two days of trying out different drivers, the game finally launched. ANY GPU drivers newer than 09/2015 would NOT work, so my other games had to suffer in performance.  - My newer PC has the same problem, but this time there are no more legacy drivers that the game will boot with, leaving me unable to play the game.  YMMV, on a friend's PC the game runs just fine, without any issues. Just be warned that the game may not run for you at all, or you'll have to spend a few days trying to fix the issues.
10030	It's good as just a racing game but as something where you want to play a story, I'd recommend doing more research on racing games.
10031	Boring, not fun to play.  The cars don't steer well.
10032	Boring, not fun to play.  The cars don't steer well.
10033	Can't play at all due to some stupid access violation error
10034	Terrible game. Various inconsistancies with controls and terrible stuttering makes the game unplayable.
10035	- spin out simulator. most worst physics for having fun, cause you spin out and have no traction (the car moves even when its stopped just from turning the front wheels left or right). Since you spin out just from driving for no reason, if you hit other ppl or slightly tap them you will spin out like crazy, its like driving on ice but WORSE.  Meanwhile the cpu drivers go through dirt without reduced speed and while not losing any traction at all.   + graphics make me realize i need a better than 1080p display to fully appreciate them
10036	Cars are hard to control even with a wheel my game crashed multiple times (I know my computer sucks soewhat) even with a wheel the cars are super hard to control. I'm getting my money back screw this s**t.
10037	The game has good potential. Game sim is very good but it bores me after a while the campain is just a boring race after another nothing challenging. Gran Turismo was good because you had do more than raceing and here it is everything the same i think.
10038	I'm sure this game is nice with a steering wheel or in VR, but it need standard configuration for keyboard and mouse. It's bad to be bound to change all controls to play(ex:change driving controls from arrows to wasd) and the sensiblity of all the elements of the cars are annoying to adjust because you cant ajust them from ''a pause menu'' like most of racing games, and they should be already setted in a wise way. And you can't turn the camera around the car with your mouse.I'm not hating this game, but it need a severals updates about configuration, the rest is all good although.In all, if you dont have a steering wheel or VR, and you play on keyboard and mouse, dont buy this game, you will be disapointed. If you want to buy this game be sure to have VR or a steering wheel.
10039	Disapointed, I played a demo of this and loved it but this game is just too hard. Cars handle weird, slip out on corners, hard to get the power down without a big spill. If you have the patience go for it but this is one game Im deleting local content for something else more fun.
10040	I have come back to this game after a while out and i am not impressed with the way things have been handled with the game and the forum.  once you could chat with the devs, even the man in change, Ian Bell on the forum, but that was some time ago when PC was released. back then the game had a few issues, mostly the race and setup being locked out.  but on my return i have disocvered a large amount of issues, a big one on the whole lot is half the host rooms being unconnectable and the other half are connectable. sometimes some would be connectable then suddenly stop being connectable then i get kicked out of the room. i have tried to report on this but absoultely no one is interested in the thread i left there.  i have decided to try give it the benefit of the doubt, 2 weeks worth of time and right now this issue being the biggest of the lot is completely ruining my game play experience online.  other issues i have noted are not as big but if no one can take the time to get back to me within the PC forum, i can't see a reason to report on others that go unnoticed. it's a shame though, if this happened over half a year ago, i would of gotten some help..  do i recommend this game? no, it has become increasingly frustrating to the point i no longer wish to play it any more. i hold some hope for PC2 when the developers get around to annoncement and release, but i no longer care for PC any more.
10041	Game breaking bugs all over the place, the devs don't care. They sell us DLC but the game is not even playable for me to enjoy. Keep your money far from this game. All those gimmicks are nice, but I can't even change my settings during a race. Wtf.
10042	I wont go into too much detail here, just a few points: +Looks really good (like OMFG!!) +Decent performance, even with an aging setup of 3xGTX470 SLi, 32gb Ram and i7 3820 +Great Simulation +Great on an XBOX compatible controller -No music/soundtrack for during the races, a shame as racing games tend to showcase some of the best out there -So few cars in the base game that already costs a lot, feels like a DLC cash grab -They had announce its succesor just a month or 2 after this game came out (more cash grab feels) -Still see broken penalties system (like people cutting corners through the dirt with no penalty) -Crummy AI, or maybe its part of the realistic scenario that only potatos can afford these cars -Definitely not mouse + kb friendly at all (a proper arcade mode would have been appreciated here) -No proper Stop/Start, kinda inexcusable that this cosmetic feature is still not implemented -Sound part of the simulation feels average, for instance, tyre squeel from breaking seems to just cut in and out instead of fade  Verdict: I like this game, its fun, its well designed, but the price tag is rather high for the content you receive, especially you'll be constantly wanting to buy DLC for all the really cool cars. I feel this game is the Battlefield of car games, and as such, it deserves a downvote.
10043	Do not buy this game unless you are hooking a wheel up, and even with a wheel, the controls are twitchy and unrealistic. I have a love/hate relationship, the game itself looks amazing, but the CORE gameplay, the controls and AI absolutely 100% needs revamping from the ground up. The AI will ram you off the track regardless, they will not go around you, just try to go straight through you, they brake early which often means they exit quick, if your like me and your a late braker, but slower exits, enjoy the carnage that follows your rear end.
10044	This game could of been great, but to me it is far from worth the money. You are DLC'd for extra cars, then as I ahve a AMD card, my fps is great game looks amazing, in the middle of racing random stuttering. I would highly reccomend not touching this game unless it is on major sale as you will need to buy DLC for the complete game.
10045	If you have a amd card/crossfire setup and use a force feedback wheel. You'll be just like the studio who made it. 'Slightly mad' and most likely extremely disappointed..
10046	Dont buy this game for racing it will let you down hard
10047	Why is this $15 for Xbox one ?
10048	The game looks great, good potential, but that's it. Unfortunatelly the driving is quite frustrating as there is a stupid steering dead zone that makes impossible any fine driving.
10049	I NEED HELP. I can find no way to get help from STEAM. THere is NO PLACE to simply contact you people.  Your crap program will not run project cars from my new TIKI computer using Oculus Rift. It used to run just fine on a different machine but irt will not run the RIFt on the new computer.   HOW THE HELL DO I CONTACT YOUR USELESS SUPPORT PEOPLE????  As a REVIEW --- I am looking for any and every way to getr STEAM off my computers and NEVER NEVER USE IT AGAIN FOR ANYTHING. There has to be a way to escape you and if so, I will find it.
10050	Eh, it's a fun game no doubt. Kind of wished they included a way to modify your own car to make more of your own instead of just picking what car you want to drive and thats that. I mean you can tune the tire pressure and mess with the brakes and etc but it would be a nice feature. Another thing that was rathe frustrating was the sound bugs. If you played the game you might know what Im talking about but its pretty annoying.   I would pick up the game if you have a controller or a wheel. Using a keyboard will not be fun whatsoever (I kept spinning out at the slightest turn of the wheel.)  I might buy the game again in the future now that I have a controller but for now I would watch some youtube videos before you get the game haha I made the mistake of using a keyboard and it ruined my experience  (I also put no for recommendation but I do recommend since its probably one of the best racing games for pc)
10051	I rarely write reviews, but I felt obligated to for this.  It's not very good. The graphics are great, but it plays like a game straight from an arcade. Isn't it supposed to be super realistic?!  Meh, 4/10, do not buy
10052	This game has great graphics and the simulation aspect of it is extremely well done. The cars feel realistic and are very fun to drive.   That said, there really isn't much to do in this game. I thought the whole 'sandbox' racing idea sounded fun, but by 'sandbox' I envisioned having lots of cars to choose from, from many different eras, and the ability to tamper and upgrade them etc, without having to grind and earn money to do it. You know, like jacking up a 1975 280zx to 800 HP or something...  The money aspect and grinding is removed, which is nice, but there's nothing really in its place, and so the game just feels kind of hollow. You get a handful of cars, that you can't upgrade or mess with them other than 'tuning' which in itself isn't that complex or fun (i.e. inflating tires to different PSIs, brake adjustments etc). And, having no money, the 'career' mode is just racing through tedious championships with ONE car that can't be modified, just to move to other leagues and other cars. (hours mastering a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Clio??? why???). But since you have access to all the cars from the start, there's no real incentive and it feels pointless. You're free to move the difficulty setting around, and from league to league, and all the various settings, but why even bother...The only thing somewhat fun in this game is the online racing against other people. But again, it feels very limited because there are just so few cars, and the only way to have a fair race is if they are all the same.   I suppose the trade-off is that the cars that ARE there, are very realistic and true to life. I imagine it took a long time to program that level of realism, and it's impressive. But, if you are just a casual gamer and car fan like me ... then who cares?...I'd rather have hundreds of slightly less realistc cars to choose from, because personally I would never know the difference anyway. I haven't driven but the few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ station-wagons and sedans I've owned in my life, so I have no idea of what a Huayra-whatever is SUPPOSED to look and feel like. If this game had MODS allowed, well, then that would be a different story...but apparently that's not happening either.   The moral is to do your homework before dropping 50$ on a game. I think by 'sandbox' they are misleading people...all that means is no unlockable content and no REAL career mode. It's a nice idea, but it takes away the 'game' aspect of it, and just makes it something to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with for a few hours when you're bored. ..BUT if you are hardcore about realism and all that, and you love to drive for the sake of driving, this might be your game.
10053	Project Cars is by far the most buggy racing game I've seen.   The game is taxing on even the most updated rig. My rig: ASUS Crosshair-V Formula-Z, 9590FX, R9-290X, 16G RAM, 250GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD. Inadequate. And after reading the posts about AMD GPU performance, I bought an Nvidia GTX 980. While the performance was better, it was far short of what I expected running FPS anywhere from 50 to 110 FPS with Ultra settings.  The menus are terrible and don't flow logically. In order to change your car livery, you have to drill down several levels of menus. No custom liveries.  Entering your friends online race room is prohibited if the race has started. So you have to wait for your friend to finish before joining.  Lots of game crashes. It makes getting friends together for racing difficult and arduous when one friend and another crash at random times.  Thereâs no retiring but you can look at a grayed out âretireâ button. This is especially bad if you've lost a tire and can't get to the pit. You not only have to wait till the end of the race but you and your friends have to wait for the race timer to expire because you cant make it to the finish line; I believe it's two minutes. Speaking of which, there's no way to customize the long wait timer.  The list of things wrong with this game goes on and on. A single patch wouldn't fix something that needs an entire rewrite. Sorry SMS, this is a fail.  *edit* After patch 1 came out I thought things would get better but they didn't:  If you want to use no HUD, be carful because your LCD will say your in a different gear at the start of the race than what the HUD says. Many times the LCD on the car would say I was in 1st and I was actually in neutral.  Some cars now will not let you change to neutral if your car's moving but others will. That makes no sense, because every other game will let you change to neutral- if you downshift too far its an added element of realism. This was not the case before the patch, so in my opinion this patch broke something.  One thing I thought would get fixed but didn't: If you have Steam overlay enabled while an online race is loading, you'll lose all input systems- no keyboard, mouse, or controller (G-25 here). so you have to ctrl-alt-del and kill the game from Task Manager. I've verified this bug doesn't just effect me, it effects my friends as well.  Another problem is that tracks disapear in multiplayer. A friend and I have noticed that Mazda Raceway and Oulton park simply are not in the online list one day and the next they are. This has happened several times.
10054	It's a good 'game' but I think Assetto Corsa or iRacing is better for your money if you're looking for a good sim.
10055	Not recommend if you are using gamepad/keyboard to play. Not sure about steering wheel. Didnt have one.
10056	Really disappointed. I have a 3,000$ PC yet the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. Controls are clunky. VERY little car choice. 2/10
10057	Usual boring driving.  Over sensitive controls, twitchy movement, inhuman AI abilities. Exactly what I've come to expect from driving games.  Dont belive the claims of DK2 ready, its rubbish and shouldnt be advertised the way it has been, actual races yes have a somewhat sluggish dk2 support but menus certainly do not.  If your buying this for VR like I did, dont bother its bearly usable without all the usual eye bending work around crap!  Being an non driving game enthuisiast I felt it was time to give this one a go, I have Assetto Corsa and that is the same deal as this game essentially but with less realisim in Porject Cars.   I wish I hadnt listened to Mack now to be honest, I'm 0 for 2 both recommended games from his you-tube channel. Great comedy not so great recommendations.  The steering wheel deadzone area is screwed, using my wheel I can bearly control any car properly and consistantly, the FFB is some of the most unrealistic I've ever felt.  Â£40 that I could have spent on something I would have enjoyed. Time for me to never get another car game again.   So in short if your like me and can take or leave car games dont waste your money.   If you like car games why not add yet another snooze fest to your collection.
10058	â¥â¥â¥â¥. thats all that needs saying really
10059	Paid $50 for this today. Overpriced to say the least. Essentially unplayable.   My Setup:  - SLI GTX 780 + Intel i7  - All generic no overclock   List of bugs:  1. glitches if you go too fast while scraping walls 2. if you crash too hard into wall you flip over or through side walls. Once on other side you can drive back through, however pretty major glitch. 3. the chat interface will censor random words like 'what' 'i' 'type' into **** * ****. 4. the chat box in game is positioned off to the side and doesn't wordwrap so it cuts off more than five words typed.   Pros:  Not much currently. Suppose... - I liked the music n promo videos. - The gameplay set up is better and more open feeling than other racing games like Grid AS. - Though the chat box has glitches(see below) I liked that it had a chat box vs only allowing mics like Grid AS.   Cons:  - UI is difficult to navigate, example:   &gt; the home screen has huge single button links for no reason.  &gt; the scrollbars don't work like standard scrollbars, they do some weird auto scroll glitchy movement. - Right away the audio for engine sounds is generic and has no variation, every gear sounds the same through the entire range of rpm.  - Graphics even at Ultra and High, etc (as high as I could put them) were as plain as any free game you could download. Grass was non existant, no shading or shadows, cars look plastic. The game literally looks nothing like the promo videos or screenshots. - Physics are broken, glitchy, unfinished, not working. It looks like they're on the right track for a more realistic type feeling, however currently they're just broke. - $50 is way too much for this game in this state. Should be $5 or free, especially after however many years they've been working on it for it to still be this unfinished. - Cars don't generate damage, instead pieces just fly off randomly, glass doesn't seem to break for example.   Summary:  Seems like this game should've been way more finished by now or priced way cheaper than premium pricing. However I do like some of the general characteristics of the game. Wouldn't recommend if you're used to getting some level of quality for $50.
10060	Very dissapointed in this game, the handling is very very bad compare to other car simlation game i played before.
10061	Long story short. If choosing between iRacing, Assetto Corsa and this: go with iRacing.   Graphics are fake and all the lens flare and god rays etc etc are trying to take away from some bad/jaggy AA. Not to mention the HORRIBLE AI.
10062	This is by far the worst drivers expirience i had in a game.... in a corner (lots of tries) i am the only car that get the effects of a collision even if we are about 6 cars that time in the collision!!!! where the f.. is the reality in this???? Seriusly who did this game without any kind of proper realism??? someone told me this is a great game and i run to buy it and then this !!! no reality what so ever ...only to grab the money out of your pocket
10063	Crashes everytime I play and is a known problem. as soon as you touch grass you've lost the race. called a simulator but you can slam the brakes/accelerate while turning 100% without spinning out. Progression is not rewarding, no cash and you can still advance through your calendar (?) just by racing. no background music while racing. you can choose your starting car type (gokart, f1 or whatever) in career but have to make your way through the tiers, rather than saving up money and buying an R8 with your terrible car/gokart winnings, like other racers. I heard about this game like 2 years ago and im so disappointed, gran turismo 3 (a ps2 game) is better than this.  I waste my money buying stupid things and this tops it.   
10064	Terrible, Terrible game. For the price you pay, you'd expect the cars not to handle like they would in some Â£5 arcade game. The graphics are good, but in terms of racing quality and sim, I'd go for the F1 games ten times over before buying this game. I completely and utterly regret my decision to waste my money on this.
10065	Horrrible broken game, would not reccomend. Wish I could get my money back.
10066	Unfinished/buggy as hell apart from that awesome when you can play the game.   I would recommend this game but not in this state  
10067	Really not the 'SIM' people say. They must be used to forza or something because this handling is pretty bad. I would save your money and wait for a sale and try Stock Car Extreme, Assetto Corsa, Iracing, Rfactor and Rfactor 2 before I would suggest this great looking console port. I mean some of the daily challenges online have gamepad users holding the fastest times... WHAT? That's a bad sign and in a real solid simulation that just wouldn't be possible.  5/10 PC sim score  9/10 console game score
10068	ok.. This is what i wrote on one of my forums for others to decide. i have given it a not reccomended mark here, because of the price.. AND if you read my review you will see why, although at Â£25 or less i would reccomed it with a warning.  So my oppinion...  pcars is a game that is more like forza than asetto corsa. Not always a bad thing though.  I would not go ahead and call it a sim i dont think, but im not sure if i would call it an arcade game either.  if this was 6 years ago with this sort of handling then i would call it a sim.  the physics dont seem quite right for a car and a bit more of a scripted thing vs actually calculating grip. Although this does seem to work relatively well for the cars and tracks i have used.  the FFB settings will have to be tweaked with as out of the box they dont really give much feel, Although that is true for every racing game on the pc with ffb support. Thats why you have the sliders..  Only tried a couple of cars and a go kart so far, but i am not convinced it is calculating grip from simulated physics vs scripting something like ( if power &gt;75 in % corner then..)  performance seems pretty good. my system is not state of the art, i have a HD 7870 8GB of ram and my i5 2500k right now is at stock clocks. and with most things on medium/high 1080p i average about 75fps (i would imagine) i get over 80 but less than 90 for pretty much all of it and some lower dips that never go below 60fps.  Also it does not seem to have mugello as a track.. 'this is an abomination'  so i would say..  I think ac is a better simulator  I think pcars is more polished  I dont think PCars is actually simulating via physics calculations, but scripting the physics is being done pretty well.  PCars does look nice, although when you are hammering down imola with zondas all around you i dont think you can see the diffference between it and AC, it also seems relatively well optimized for pc. although i do think there will be some tweaks along the way.  I would say the game is on par with forza/gt. but not comparable with AC if you are comparing just the driving aspects.  if you take in to consideration the single player career mode.. PCars is probably better than AC, and not as good as forza 'obviously depends on your own personal preferences'  SO I guess I would recommend the game, 'even without mugello in the track selection' but i will play AC the most. and probably would add some caution to my recommendation, some thing like: 'I recommend it. but its not a serious racer. its just a fun MP game'  So for the ~Â£25 i paid think it is worth it.  i would carry on with more thoughts and opinions but this is not a review lol.. I cant review a game i have only played for a while.  EDIT.. Played a bit more and did some mp. I liked the method of inviting friends who are in pcars As it easier than the asetto corsa method 'which has a lot to do to fix it) but the more you drive the less of a sim it is. And it really is forza.. if this game had been released before asetto corsa im sure i would have been happy with it. AC has just set the bar so high now that PCars simply could not reach it.  The graphics as mentioned really arent that noticable when you are concentrating. the FFB really gives you no warning of impending traction loss.. the cars dont seem to handle at all how they should do.. They do handle differently to each other, but that does not mean that they handle like the car they portray. Some give way to easy at the rear. some just seem to grip and grip.. And combined with the limited feed back from the wheel this just makes for a confusing racing expirience.. If you put the aids on and drive like you would drive you will smash your opponents. so that is just a no go. If you have all the aids turned off then you just cant feel when you lose traction. and this is something assetto corsa does very well.  Really its just a fun game for casuall racers. if you are a serious racing sim fan this is not for you.  I also forgot to mention before the edit.. i would not pay more than Â£25 for it.. and if i was giving it a score.. it would be 67%-73% (depending on my mood) Playable, fun with friends, Not a serious racer. On par with forza or Grand turismo. Not even in the same league as AC or Iracing.. Career mode is not really anything good at all its just tacked on, But the same is true for assetto corsa.  I would say that this PC Gamer reviewer is possibly paid to give such a high score. and claim it is a sim.  I do think asetto corsa is a much better simulation of driving. so if you want a sim just get that. PCars is ok for casuall racing. but i dont think it will be fondly remembered by the racing simulation croud. casual and console gamers... I think this will be a hit. but its not better than forza or Grand turismo.. All it really is is a forza/GT game that is available on pc. so i dont see why console owners would buy it either. And if you mostly play single player on your console. just buy one of the other 2 depending on your console.  For those who claim its a great sim. please stop the hype now.. the cat is out of the bag, and the game just is not what it was built up to be.
10069	Junk, G25 doesn't work correctly, graphics are glitchy and handling is poor. I want a refund
10070	Junk, G25 doesn't work correctly, graphics are glitchy and handling is poor. I want a refund
10071	I dont recommend this game...yet! This game have a potential and its like 80% finished.  Pros Great graphic Car physics OPTIONS! so many tracks!  Cons Menu... There is no cars classification Not enough cars...theres many race cars but not enough cars you really want to drive! No ferrari, no nissan, no VW, No stock bmw m3, m5 etc.  force feedback on my g27 is just awful... There is some options which are coming soon so this game shoould be in beta not finished yet.  EDIT: review of Project Cars/17.8.2016  Since it was released Project Cars have improved it self very much also new VR system gives you better feel just like you would drive car of your dreams  I have swapped my G27 for G29 since my original review and I must say its not wheel it self but Devs improved force feedback and general feel of a car when using racing wheel  Game optimalization have been noticeably improved but also graphics and detail of cars and world it self have been improved too  Project cars look, feel and smell(if you are petrolhead) like a real racing game that can compete with game like Forza, NFS or Gran Turismo.  Theres still some improvements to be made and a lot more cars and tracks to add but...  This game is still â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!! WHERE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS NISSAN GTR?????!!!!!  WITHOUT NISSAN THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥, Dont waste you time and money! -9/11
10072	Doesn't work iand its buggy. I own over 750+ games and this is the first one I've ever requested a refund on. Says something. I'd like to be able to comment on the driving physics since people seem to say they are pretty good but can't play it enough to say consistently. The graphics are nice when not glitched out however, the sound is pretty good although pretty much the same for various vehicles (which it shouldn't be) and there is a decent selection of tracks and cars. Can't recommend however due to its poor optimization.
10073	Full of promise but ultimately it falls short.  AMD users should be the first people to stay clear from this game. Even with the latest 15.5 Beta drivers, Nvidia much weaker Nvidia cards still laugh in the face of an R9 290X.  On top of that, despite all the delays, there are still massive, massive rudimentary AI bugs and gaping holes in optimisation. When the studio head, Ian Bell, comes out and starts blaming the performance of the games engine on 'not up to scratch' quadcore i5 processors, then you know you might as well talk to a brick wall for more sense and less patronisation.   It then makes your head spin when the game is still in the state it is and SMS immediately starts talking about a Project CARS 2!! Well, good luck with that one... but I certainly won't be buying it.  Everything included and then the whole Wii U on-ice thing (after previously bragging about how well Wii U version is shaping up) then Slightly Mad Studios isn't a trustworthy studio whom I would choose to support with a financial vote of confidence.
10074	I don't really enjoy it, going to get a refund ^^;  Pros: + I like the helmet view + feel of the cars  Cons:  - Most the tracks are same realworld(read lazy) ones ive played to death in other games very unoriginal and boring - Graphics are just ok even on max, I was expect much more, Forza 5/Horizon 2 and Drive Club both look better overall - Glitchs, like it wouldn't even count me as racing for 3 of the races i tried in the hour and a half I played - lacks customization, no one likes look of logo filled cars it's ugly
10075	ATTENTION: Game is more immersive and playable with a steering wheel.  Pros: - Pretty visuals. - Good optimal performance. - Good sound effects. - Suprising amount of immersion. (found myself laughing at your 'fans' tweeting about your progress) - Suprisingly amazing physics. - Good model detail. - Love how almost every single car handles differently.  Cons: - Fair amount of bugs to still be worked out. - Lens flares and other lighting effects could use some work. - VERY Difficult to play with a controller and even more so to play with Keyboard+Mouse. - You most likely WILL need a steering wheel. - If you play with a controller/gamepad, you will have to optimize it. (Please don't even try it, most confusing menu I've ever seen) - Your 'fans' tend reptitivly to say the same things, ergo losing some immersion value. - Some menus are confusing, step-by-step tutorials would be nice for new players. - Multi-player is riddled with bugs. (Invisible cars? WTF??) - I found it hard to race through rain/storms/fog. (Hard to see, sliding into every corner barrier, hard to keep up with mild difficulty NPc's) - Pretty disappointed that you cannot customize vehicles. - Really weird approch to this title. (Is it simulation or arcade? it feels like both...? wtf? It has a very strange/confusing vibe)  VERDICT: Despite all the negatives, this title still have a fair amount of fun. It's not exactly what I expected due from all the hype, but it certainly isn't terrible. However, you will be annoyed by bugs, some weather effects, and the weird controls setup for gamepads/Keyboard+Mouse.  Should you buy it?: I'd say to wait until it either goes on sale or the developers get a chance to patch it up; which ever comes first. But as the game stands right now, it's not worth the $49.99 price tag.
10076	i was really excited for this game until i played it. I think it still has a lot of bugs and they should have just waited to release it. To me it still feels like its in beta.
10077	Unbelievable.  One of the poorest vehicle selections I've seen from a racing game in many years. I bought this game expecting something to improve upon FM5 and GT6, both in terms of control and experience. It's just awful. The engine noises are recycled from NFS: Unleashed 2 and the soundtrack appears to be as well, at least in terms of genre (but that's nitpicking).  What isn't nitpicking is having 2 manufacturers from the US and Japan combined, while having many from the UK; Ridiculous. The controls are frequently praised but it has no option for clutch and it feels like NFS unless all the assists are off, and even then it's just needlessly difficult without being rewarding. Lot's of tracks though which is nice. However, the visuals are either on par on below FM5, especially in terms of interiors (again, which seemed to be ripped from NFS UNleashed).   Overall, don't buy this game unless you're some sort of PC-exclusive â¥â¥â¥ who hasn't played FM5 or GT6 and clinging to your only option for sim racing this gen. It's highly overrated and I really regret dropping 50 dolars on this without doing my research first.   Don't make the same mistake I did. If you're in the mood for a decent PC racing game I would actually recommend NFS Unleashed 2 on PC, the car selection is superior in terms of breadth, just turn off the loud â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who talks to you.   GO GO GO! YOU'VE GOT THIS!  â¥â¥â¥â¥ me. And while you're at it turn off the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who talks to you in the game too.
10078	This not a sim at all. You either have grip or have none. FFB is pretty god awful. Basically every car feels like you're driving a mid engined car with a 2 foot wheelbase and infinitely stiff suspension. That's the way it feels from the wheel.  FFB options are convoluted and nothing at all like ANY other sim I've played.  The devs are totally unprofessional â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this game is truly a terrible racing sim.
10079	Was looking for something similar to Forza Motorsport for PC. Unfortunately was disappointed with the handling model and sounds. Graphics were good and I liked the way the game was setup, but overall underwhelming.
10080	Not worth downloading even for free, doesn't launch at all.  EDIT:  Got it to launch, driving mechanics are incredible when the game works but it is too unstable and buggy to recommend at this point.
10081	Complete Garbage nothing like what they promised do not buy! Wait for Forza 6 or new Grand Turismo
10082	I pre-ordered this game, and the first 4 hours of gameplay were good. Shortly after that. I ran into bug after bug. Bugs that literally completely delete your etire career progress without any warning and you have to start the gamplay from scratch all over again. Cars go through mandatory pit stops, and come out with FLAT tires!! I am not making this up guys... Over 70+ hours in this game. I regret ever purchasing this overhyped epic FAIL. Online gameplay is terrible. The paddle shifter in some cars just rotates like its broken during gameplay. Huge mess, these guys don't know how to write working code, or fix any bugs. Every patch they release makes the game much worse NOT better. Don't buy this junk. Get something better. Trying to replay a saved replay video of a race causes the game to crash every single time. Lightly Mad Studios should never attaempt to make another game. Truly pathetic fail. Epic though.
10083	This game runs like **** on AMD cards. Waiting for fix but might never get it. Lesson learned, never expect to play new games with AMD GPU.
10084	I love both the GT series and the Forza series If you love either of the above, I think you will dislike this.  Especially from Forza, the customisations (and sometimes stupid) of engines / turbos etc is gone and this game I find is too hardcore for me and I find it not to be fun, it feels like a real effort to always stay on the track 100% of the time. Controls (using an xbox one controller) were terrible and after some customisations from suggestions on reddit make it feel atleast playable (way too twitchy with stock setups imo)  I might leave it for a few months, but overall Its not for me, maybe I expected something different and it's no fault of the game / developers.
10085	simulation my left nut. the grip characteristics are entirely wrong and im not talking out of my â¥â¥â¥ seeing as i drive a 1990 300zx twin turbo on 22 psi 400 hp to the wheels and it handles like an animal with just coil overs and these 'GT' cars have less grip than my street car. massive waste of $50. also no customization whatsoever... not even paint scheme? seriously? to think i actually thought this game would be better than forza 4 which is by far the most accurate 'simulator' i have ever played seeing as i made a 300zx nearly identical to the one i actually own and it was pretty damn spot on. so save yourself the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and dont waste your money on this trash 'simulator'. so angry. end rant.
10086	Simply awful.
10087	pretty bad game/// i dont recommend to any one. graphix=bof driving=bof fun= not much cant customise cars... you dont get any thing for completing races. if you wanna drive and nothing else i guess youll like it. carrer part of game is really bad.
10088	This game is awful. I feel like the DLC content is garbage and the sounds for cars in the game arent correct. Worst purchase for a racing sim. Go get yourself Assetto Corsa or Stock Car Extreme. Much better sims.
10089	Low tier cars SO BAD!
10090	Not very happy with this game. I tried to set it up with my mouse, and the input is simply laggy.  I spent more time in the menus than actually playing it, because the controls are not comfortable at all, i don't feel like i driving. I don't get why is it so difficult to solve mouse control like it is in LFS.  
10091	What a rip off. ! Is there a chance for a refund ? Please make sure that you manage to test demo first somewhere otherwise you'll be very disappointed. Also make sure you at least own 980 GTX for low details and GTX Titan X for medium details. Impossible to play on full without SLI solution. Game/race mode is also bad. Waste of money.
10092	i can't even play this game i have a logitech steering wheel and the whole game just spaz out and keeps going up in the menu and when i try to drive the car it just has full gas the whole time without me touching the gas padel i tried everyttthing nothting worked
10093	- Cripples AMD cards - AI in most series are just unplayable - Tyre model issues - Missing basic functions for a Sim (Saving multiple setups, tripple screen support list goes on) - Lobby lack features  Only thing good about this game at the moment is that its look pretty. Until these fixes are fixesd don't buy this game.
10094	game sucks requested a refund
10095	Just tried this with my HTC Vive. Instant nausea. I been looking forward to a decent racing game but this won't cut it. Cabin view is wonder and crisp but the track view is unplayable. You can barely see into the distance, it's almost impossible to know where you going. Extremely disappointing! I have also tried LFS and it's way better in that regard but the graphics aren't nowhere near project cars. I am requesting a refund at this point.
10096	no good keeps crashing smame sa ride
10097	UNTIL THEY FIX THE HANDLING AND PHYSICS THIS GAME IS BASICALLY TAKING UP SPACE ON MY HDD
10098	I wish I would have torrented this game so I could have seen how incredibly dull the 'career mode' is. Basically just a bunch of single player missions with absolutely no goal.  It's pretty, sounds good, and the physics are meh.  Powersliding isn't possible; and when brought up in the forums the entire dev team and all their slaves and minions  jump on you for even mentioning that it's unrealistic.   This game has serious issues and anyone who says otherwise (according to SMS) should just go somewhere else.  PC2 will definitely be a torrent first game.
10099	Assetto Corsa is much much better.
10100	it takes long time to start it up
10101	Will stick to NFS and Dirt sadly.  EDIT: First game Ive ever requested a refund on...
10102	The game crashes so often its ridicoulous. ive barely been able to do a few laps. Hell even monitors going so sleep when im away for a bit (window mode) causes the game to fail.  Even need to restart the game to change graphic settings in 2016, Wow!  This has been out for how long?  Maybe you will have more luck than me but i need my graphic driver version and such for other games too, cant keep testing loads of different versions for a super buggy game where you cant touch your controls when the car is computer controlled coming out of the garrage, it will crash!
10103	NOW IT STARTS TO NOT LOAD... BUT WOW STILL WORKS DAY IN AND OUT... STEAM ARE SELLING STUFF THAT MESSES UP AND WON'T FIX... WHAT A RIP OFF... NO MORE BUY FROM STEAM
10104	Stunning game. Stunning graphics and stunning game play, but after spending about $70 on a game, then having to download another 8GB in data and then having to spend a crap load of money on extra DLS's, then getting 0 online games. Not worth it!
10105	I cant play it.The max fps that i saw was 25 and i putted all the settings in low.
10106	Boot up the game, try with few different cars. Not impressed. One may argue that you need to speed time to setup up the FFB before you can ' feel' the car. But IMO you should be able have a ball park idea how the phyics and FFB is like even with the default setting. For Project CARS, they 'all' feel the same. The FFB is LAZY. Honestly the default FFB feels like SHIFT with X2 center spring, it just feels heavy with lots of clipping. Control profile option is non-existence. You can remap any pre-set profile, but are only allow to remap one at any given time, which means you cannot have more then one custom profile. Guys who have multiple input devices (e.g. more then one shifter) and try to setup different control profiles for different type of cars will be outta luck. Clearly designed for console and didn't even bother to add this option for PC users. A glorified Gran Turismo and Forza, nothing more.
10107	Just got the game during the fall sale and it's freaking crashing. I can't even finish 1 race. This game is like over a year old, it should not be crashing.
10108	Just got the game during the fall sale and it's freaking crashing. I can't even finish 1 race. This game is like over a year old, it should not be crashing.
10109	The best refund simulator I've ever played.  'It's like Skyrim with guns with cars. 11/10' -IGN
10110	The best refund simulator I've ever played.  'It's like Skyrim with guns with cars. 11/10' -IGN
10111	CARS = Community Assisted Racing Simulator = lie. Slightly Mad Studios says: 'Project CARS is not a GameWorks product. We have a good working relationship with nVidia, as we do with AMD, but we have our own render technology which covers everything we need.'  Liars. So they put GW code and nVidia banners in the game for free ?  'NVidia are not âsponsorsâ of the project. The company has not received, and would not expect, financial assistance from third party hardware companies.'  Again, Liars. So they put nVidia banners in the game for free ?  'The MADNESS engine runs PhysX at only 50Hz and not at 600Hz as mentioned in several articles The MADNESS engine uses PhysX for collision detection and dynamic objects, which is a small part of the overall physics systems The MADNESS engine does not use PhysX for the SETA tyre model or for the chassis constraint solver (our two most expensive physics sub-systems) The MADNESS engine does not use PhysX for the AI systems or for raycasting, we use a bespoke optimised solution for those The physics systems run completely independently of the rendering and main game threads and utilises 2 cores at 600Hz The physics threading does not interact with the rendering, it is a push system sending updated positional information to the render bridge at 600Hz Any performance difference with PhysX would not be reflected with differences in comparing rendering frame rates. There is no interaction between PhysX and the rendering Overall, PhysX uses less than 10% of all physics thread CPU on PC. It is a very small part of the physics system so would not make a visual difference if run on the CPU or GPU'  This junk word says that this game still don't work properly on AMD hardware after plenty of time. I wish you all the best with pCars2 and I'm curious how will it goes sale
10112	I was banned from posting in the forums for calling Ian Bell a p r i c k. Meanwhile he is free to call the players every name under the sun. Dirty dev.  Oh and the game is rubbish, I put pleanty of hours in to it, go for assetto corsa instead.
10113	Good game ruined by overpriced DLC
10114	This game constantly drops my USB devices. The VR compatibility is garbage. The physics are flat and boring and do not even come close to the competition. Get Assetto Corsa or Dirt Rally if you want to have fun.
10115	Empty in south america. Refunded.
10116	I was really looking for a game similar to GT6/Forza 6 but alas, this game is nowhere close. The amount of cars is only about 75 compared to forza's ~500 and Gran Tourismo's 1000. That was something I liked about Gran Tourismo, you could race everyday cars as well as super cars. This game is lacking some major cars brands that I think should be a staple of any racing title such as Ferrari and Lamborghini, but aslo brands like Dodge, Chevy, and Nissan. From a control and physics standpoint, the game feels sort of clunky and like everything is over exaggerated. What would be a mild loss of control in other games turns into a full on 720 degree spin-out in this game. Using a keyboard is useless for this game and a gamepad is not the best. I havent tried using a wheel/pedal setup as I don't have that but a game that can only be played using that equipment really limits the customer base. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are fairly good. Thankfully I haven't experianced many of the game breaking bugs other users have reported but this game still isn't what I was hoping for.  Overall, its not a terrible buy, but I would never pay full price for it. 2.5/5
10117	Keyboard and keyboard/mouse controls are horribly done. Not fun at all to play with. Who assigns turning to mouse movement?  I'll give this game another try when I've got a controller available, but the devs should really try out the keyboard controls for other car games. Several of the other games I've played have had much nicer keyboard experiences, like TrackMania or Need For Speed.
10118	Just a heads up, if you use a gamepad, this game is unplayable. I understand that in-depth adjustment of settings may resolve issues, however should you have to do this throughout the game on a constant case-by-case basis?
10119	The game was working, The screen resolution changed now I can not get to the options menu to make changes.
10120	I simply can't recommend it. It seems unfinished... if you like tweeking with your tunings, and your steering input (wheel or pad) for HOURS until you get to something useable, feel free to pay the money. I had the highest hopes for this, i thought, finally something Forza-like for the PC Gamer... but nope, not nearly Forza-like.   The mechanics: are unbelievably inconvenient. You have to (or at least i was to stupid to figure out otherwise) LEAVE the race to change your controls! The Menu itself is inconvenient too, it wants to be different and it is. And thats the problem: the navigation is utter rubbish!  The looks: its a good looking game really, it has some nice cars too. But that is all.  All in all: i am still trying to find a acceptable setup because i really want this game to NOT suck... but i guess that won't happen.  So my suggestion: watch some letsplays and see if it fits your likings... then, if you see what i mean - DONT PAY A CENT for this. I regretted it pretty fast.
10121	don't buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you got no steering wheel this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t is unplayable with a controller even with doing some configuration paid 20$ like 7 months ago and still salty about it
10122	I will play this Game if they get Nissan Cars... especially the GTR... until then... nope
10123	Didn't work for me as I only have a Vive and so couldn't actually drive the car. Maybe better if you have a keyboard/mouse or steering wheel?
10124	I will play this Game if they get Nissan Cars... especially the GTR... until then... nope
10125	If you dont have a steering wheel for this game. Dont buy it, its screwed up!! Constantly oversteers and Steam would not refund me the money because I was an hour over their return policy. WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT BUY IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CONTROLLER.
10126	Great game! But no, in game MUSIC! Really! It's a simulation for crying out loud!  At least give people the option! I look for one.  You have this great intro music, then when you play the game, no music. that's a let down.  
10127	WHAT A MESSED UP GAME!!! I know I only played it for an hour but here is the thing if you like Racing sure go for it. If you hate racing well don't get this game I really wanted to try this and it was beautiful in VR too. The only thing is that I really am dissapointed with the Driving system with this game it is absolutely terrible it ruins the whole game and it's really hard to steer like that. I do not recommend this game even in VR it really is junk and only worth about 7.99 to me. Save your money and buy better Racing games out there or something else you enjoy.
10128	I only recommend this game if it's no more than $15. I won't go over the pros since you will see that on other reviews. What I will share is what I think of the AI.  The AI stinks. It doesn't play well. On some races, the AI will pit you. You lose control and spin out into the grass or sand. It's going to take you a while to get back on track.  Now, should you decide to pit the AI, don't bother. You can NOT do it. I was attempting to pit the AI numerous times. There are instances where just when you're about to ram the car, it somehow magically accelerates and moves out of your way and you spin into a wall and lose control. There are times when the AI hits the brakes to avoid you pitting them.  There have been times where I succeeded to knock the AI car out of the track. Guess what, it didn't lose control and remained driving flawlessly and did NOT slow down one bit despite driving over SAND!  You try driving over sand in a race car and it would take you forever to get back on tarmac. Not the AI cars!  This game is supposed to be a 'simulator'. Ha!
10129	Cant drift this game sucks.
10130	this game is buggy when racing it fast forwards sometimes someone please help me when i play by myself of track its fine but when i race with other cars sometimes it fast forwards itself and then stops can someone please help me
10131	VR sickness makes this impossible to play in VR
10132	Here's the thing: If you like Gran Turismo, get rFactor. If you like Forza Motorsport, get Project Cars. If you hate both rFactor and Project Cars, get Assetto Corsa because you don't deserve true simulators.  However, i can't recommend Project Cars over rFactor.   Most of the physics have been redone from scratch, but the gravity physics were took from Need For Speed Shift 2, and thanks to that, oversteering and countersteering is weird and twitchy.  Really the 3 main reasons you get Project Cars are these:  Sound (I'm not kidding, the cars here SCREAM) Career (Start from the bottom of kart racing all the way up to F1, or start right from F1 for monumental challenge) Online (Didn't survive the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community disease but netcode and matchmaking is stupid quick and it's very easy to create rooms with friends)  Also this 'Project' started as a Wii U equivalent of Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo, but then it got released in ALL consoles except Wii U. *clap* *clap* *clap*  If this game gets official mod support, with Workshop or another mod downloader, i will finally be able to recommend this game.
10133	Terrible, I cant even open the game. Do not waist youyr money on this game.
10134	This game feels great to drive, really challenging and responsive. I'm don't usually play car simulation games, but I felt like this would be a great buy. I like goals. Things I can achieve by getting better or progressing through the game. This has none of that, that's why I found myself wondering in the menu, what to even play? Shall I choose a random track and a random car while I admire the graphics and physics of the game. Or should I play against somehow really annoying AI. This game just wasn't for me and if you're someone who enjoys a game like Forza for its goals and kinda boring progression system, maybe this game isn't for you either.
10135	Buggy, annoying, and just not fun.

10138	pad for to play online wish i didt bother
10139	As much as I personally dislike this game you might like it, but that depends on how good you are at driving with a keyboard or have a racing wheel, because I am extremely incompetent when driving in this game engine with a keyboard, and when I use my Xbox 360 controller everything slides all over the place, and is uncontrollable.  Other from the fact that it is uncontrollable, the game runs beautifully and looks AMAZING, and along with that there is a lot of cars (better than Forza in my opinion because of variation of cars) and a lot of DLC that unlocks a lot more cars, and there is a lot of maps and customizable weather, and time. If you like a 'career' in a racing game go forza or something because personally I dont think it is very good at all because of in forza it goes you are racing here and there are a few different classes of cars you can do this race with where this game goes select what kind of car do you want to drive for example there is go karts of formula 1 cars or stock cars or regular sports cars, but you select one type of car and you are locked to only go-karts, or stock cars, or formula 1 cars, or whatever you selected.   There is online that i have no opinion on because I have really bad internet so it would lag all over the place so I didn't bother. And one last thing if it matters to you it is that Project CARS is the first game i have ever refunded on steam just because of the controls put me off so much and I would have kept it and left a positive review if it controlled well because it is amazing otherwise
10140	Good:  Looks nice Runs fine on Ultra at 1440p (60-90fps here) Good car selection Some good tracks FFB is not the worst Engine sounds  Bad  Engine sounds on some cars (overdone) AI Cheaters on leaderboards already pCARS 2 announced already meaning this will die  Online multiplayer seems pretty dead for a newly released game    So you have 2 options if you want to avoid racing against the stupid AI. Either hotlap or find a racing community to race against.  Overall underwhelmed and the news of pCARS already on the horizon and with the crowdfunding for it starting very soon I feel cheated by the devs.
10141	This is not a fun game for me. There's a lot of issues with the actual game client itself that's not system related but game related. There's some options missing that are sorely needed and every change to the visual settings requires a restart of the game. There is no default settings option at least none that I could find which was a pain when I just wanted to get above 40FPS and set everything to high.  The driving is just so incredibly boring. It's stiff. Really stiff. Messing with the sensitivity just results in oversteering(You actually have to lower your sensitivity as the default is way too high at 50!). Using a controller the steering just isn't smooth at all. It's like it's emulating mouse key presses and locking them at degrees to where your controller stick is. A little bit to the right this game isn't a little bit to the right in most racing games but it's as if you're quickly tapping a key on your keyboard. It feels janky...  The multiplayer just sucks a fat one. I really can't explain how incredibly disappointed I am with it. All you have is Short or Long races. Long races can last a freakin' day but default to two hours! There's even practice rounds that are default to two hours! The MP browser is just terrible by any stretch of the imagination. You can't sort by ping, you can't sort by name, you can't sort by length, you can't sort by map unless you use the filters. The only way to find things is by using the filter options but there is NO sorting options at all. Even at that the filter options are extremely poor at best which makes finding the right lobby needlessly hard to do.  MP is basically drop in and drop out from what I could see. You don't start a race with everyone else. You just kind of load in... take off from the pitstop... and drive around... you just keep driving. It seems incredibly pointless especially when races can last over an hour at a time and no one sticks around for that long. It's like paying for a drive around Mondello Park; it's you just driving around a professional track seeing how fast you can go. There may be other people on the road but you aren't racing them, you're not even competing against them. You're just driving. It's just so sorely lackluster and so unfun.  I was expecting a good RACING game. I didn't get one. I had to refund this... Knew I definitely wouldn't get any enjoyment from this. Maybe you can but from what i've experienced, if you're in it for MP(Which I am), it's not worth the money even on sale for â¬20.
10142	Interface is complicated and non intutitive. Game is frustrating to play
10143	This game feels unfinished, unpolished and cheap. It feels like a free to play or budget game even though it has a AAA price tag. The graphics are not nearly as good as we had been led to believe, but even so, the game does not run very well even on decent systems and is very demanding considering how below average the graphics are.  Very little content, few cars, everything is unlocked from the beginning, single player career is bland and pointless, no feeling of progression or achievement. No Steam cloud support.  I feel that this game has been massively overhyped and I would go so far as to say misrepresented by the developers and its 'early access' supporters. Buyer beware
10144	â¥â¥â¥â¥--------------------ing hate it cu-----------nts scamming wan----rs
10145	Seriously should have been called Project Bugs. Many of the first problem have been solved but it creates tottally new ones. Don't expect to find good solution or explanation on forum.  I have many hours on it only becaus of my friends playing it, otherwise I would have been refound - Looses FFB in races for no reason -several connection lost in multiplayer - game freeses and crash to many times - totaly stupid presentation of the menus ( steering settings have no explanation and are spread trough more than 5 pages) - screen freeze in replays - Poor A.I. - Still no tires sound But when it works ( 1 on 3 times) its a good sim racing game Arm yourself with patience - Multiplayer is littered with stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that destroy cars of other player. I only playing it when my friends are online - Host don't have control of their rooms: no kick/ban option they put a stupid vote to kick option that nobody cares about so you get stuck with trolls and other anoying players -Your car sound great but other cars sonds like moskitos  Seriously, this game had been delayed for more than a year and came out incomplete. 2 patches later, the problems just moved in other places. I'm really desapointed  Graphics are great and good choice of cars and tracks. I only would recommend it if you can buy it in discount (50% off or better) and if you have a REALLY POWERFULL computer. If you are looking for a great game to play try Asseto Corsa or other games that are 100% finish product.
10146	For a more proffesional review visit  www.pretendracecars.net   I really wanted to love this game... I wanted it to be the best car simulator, the one to write history,  more awesome than shift 1 and 2... And since this was the same developers of the shift, I had high hopes... And found high hype instead.  So, the pros:  Variety of kinds races Pit stops Weather Graphics Sound*  Cons: Gameplay (not arcade nor sim, between) Broken AI of opponents on single player Unrealistic driving, either by joystic, or steering wheel Cheaters on online (already) Missing the agony and feeling of competition on single player (due to AI) Tires not as awesome as mentioned ( nfs shift 2 imagine ) And no ability to paint your car ??? (on this maybe I am wrong, but can't find how.) AI off road is acting same as on road. Fanboys try to shut you up if you say anything bad AI doesn't change tyres AMD has serious problems. After 1 month and game still have major issues and glitches Few car brands Track not laser Scanned You need a really great system to run it smooth and without stuttering No pit crew (although they said that it has pit crew) Lot off blind sectors that you can go off track and drive unpunished. Car can not crash totally (yes tyres can fly, engine blow but thats all, not a sim after all, huh? ) Wheel and joystick needs heavy adjustment before playing. Most of the WMD members have bad attitude Ian Bell (Head of Studio) Dictatorship  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?29559-2016-Assetto-Corsa-coming-to-Xbox-One-and-PS4/page19  *Sound of tyres almost not exist.   Result: It is a broken arcade sim, nothing more and nothing less...   Buy it when it reach max 20 dolllars.... And if all future dlc are included in these 20 dollars...
10147	Huge Force Feedback issues.
10148	These guys should of delayed release a few more times and finished the ducking game!!!!
10149	I'm sure the game is great, but I bought it on the basis of it having Oculus Rift support. There is no support for VR headsets in the menus, so to get yourself into the driving seat you have to fire up the game on a monitor, remember all the keystrokes to get you from the main menu to the race, then restart the game through the head mounted display and try to playback those keystrokes.  If you're looking for something to try out with a VR headset you might want to hold onto your Â£39.99 for now.
10150	The visual are nothing spectacular and people have said it runs like crap on amd HW i have a 290x and i can confirm nvidia got the â¥â¥â¥â¥ right in there on this one and i wish i could get a refund for it. #nvidiasucks
10151	Hi, I brought this game for 30 euro in sale and I sad, It will be the dreatest racing game that I played... I sayd it becoulse photos was amazing, gameplays was positible, AND THAT HYPE! but, after that I brough, It isnÂ´t like on thge photos... ItÂ´s one big crap, it is â¥â¥â¥â¥, so dont buy it wait for Forza Horizon 2, it is planed it go to PC :) And dont buy this, this is â¥â¥â¥â¥ :)
10152	This game did not live up to my expectations and I'm going to have to caveat emptor this game until optimization improvements are made.  The Good  -Looks gorgeous  -Plenty of tracks -Tracks are laser scanned from the real counterparts -Handling is excellent  The Bad   -Very poor selection of cars(Needs more american muscle cars) - If this game had a better customisble cars it would be much better
10153	This is a waste of money. It has a very nice look but the gameplay does not back that up. I wasted $50 on this game but was lucky enough to get a refund from Steam. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless they like to drive cars that handle like they are on ice. This game is horrible
10154	pile ov crap plays terrible and looks no better than any other racer if not worse
10155	Nice graphics, needs fast machine for maximum details. Drivability is the problem, steering is console-like with steering in game lagging behind your steering input. Simply undrivable. Tried hard for 45 minutes and gave up. Ran back to live for speed.
10156	Pile of garbage overrealistic â¥â¥â¥â¥. Wasted my money thinking it was grand turismo for pc but i got grand kart racer xDXDXDXDX.
10157	This game does not work on AMD hardware. On a r9 290 cant run the game at 60 FPS on medium setting @ 1080p (framedrops under 30fps even runing alone, shame on you SMS)
10158	This game does not work on AMD hardware. On a r9 290 cant run the game at 60 FPS on medium setting @ 1080p (framedrops under 30fps even runing alone, shame on you SMS)
10159	Crap Assetto Corsa wins hands down.
10160	For someone who knows nothing about cars, this game is very difficult. Talking about bars and pressure with no tutorial teaching you how to play. Yes the game looks pretty and nice, but playing it makes me frustrated becuase I don't have a clue on what I'm doing.
10161	Installed the game on Friday last week and since then; I can't just launch it! Uninstalled, re-installed a couple of times; checked via Steam the cache integrity and all these stuff. I just don't get why it doesn't want to launch... This is a shame really!
10162	Worst physics... far from realistic controlability. Lots of tunning options. None however overcome the other problems.
10163	What a crap game! Force-Feedback is a joke. Granted the graphics are good. That is the most positive thing I can say about this horrible game. Even on sale it was a fukkin waste of money. Tried to get a refund and the A-holes at Steam refused. True customer Support you have there guys.
10164	Do NOT bother with this game, especially if you are only trying it for the VR.  The audio is terrible, and the visuals are even worse
10165	DON'T BUY IT! A racing game without split-screen? what's the point?
10166	If you're after online races, look somewhere else. Pcars is a dead game. Handful of players can only be found on the weekends. 75 lobbies, zero players.
10167	What is Project Cars? Is it worth your money? Are there better competitors out there to invest your time and currency in?  A watered down version of Forza, maybe, and hell yes.   The main problem I have with this game is that for the last two hours I've spent maybe ten minutes playing, and 1:50mins messing with the settings just to try to A) make it look anywhere near what they advertise it looks like(GTX 970, FX-8350 OC'd, 16GB Ram, see what I'm saying?) B) run at all smootly. I mean what is the single most important part of a racing game? That you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ing control your car while you race!   In a time where the animosity towards a game like the Witcher 3's performance lead me to upgrade and run it like silk I have to say it is a little unacceptable for the dev's to choose such an archaic graphics menu, and I'm assume coding for their game. These are sttuering issues I used to get with Dirt, and Need for Speed, ie other gar-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ports from the consoles to PC. And like those games, I am at a complete loss for how to fix them, or achieve a balanced state of performance and visual fidelity with the game, nor do I feel it is my obligation to spend so much time on configuring â¥â¥â¥â¥ for a game, its not the late 90's anymore, and even on the PC, I atleast have an assumption these days there should be a certain level of drop in and just play the freaking game with no issues. Sure maybe you'll want to tweak the graphics afterwards, see how close to get to maxing it out without performance loss etc, but come on almost two hours? It is just annoying.   In short, the game runs like garbage, and from looking at the forums, its a general thing not a 'Nvidia specific' issue or anything. I have stuttering, and 'teleportation braking system' with controllers, keyboard and mouse or even my G27, so buyer beward in that category.   the game also falls short in its categories when compared to various competitors. Graphics? good(or barely playable for a lot of us), but not as 'high res' it seems, or smooth as Assesto Corsa( a game I should mention I've never have input or stuttering issues with), though it does have some cool effects like water etc. Car selection? Not bad at all, but no Forza or Gran Turismo, AI, realism etc(from what I can stand to experience for the point of this review), seems pretty legit, but again nothing compared to any of the top existing realism racers on the PC.   The last thing I will say in support of this title is that the presentation is the one area where it blows almost any other game(maybe not Forza) out of the water. Every menu option is narrated, appealing interface visuals, music is great, career mode for the game seems fun and like it has a lot of replayability/tons of game time to enjoy on its own.   Due to performance issues though I have to stick a huge WARNING on this game's recommendation, look into other options if you have that need for digital speed for now, or otherwise hope and pray the devs/community admits the poor state of this game on the PC and attempts to fix it...or when the sequel comes out :P
10168	All in all I like the game for just the occasional drive. But to be called 'most authentic and technically-advanced racing game on the planet' is lacks the ability to save multiple setups per track. Come on guys, it should not be to hard to put that in. You can do one 'wet' + 'dry'. A very bad and serious commission from the start. Note I backed the game from day 1 when 'historic Spa' was still in and the statement 'most authentic and technically-advanced racing game on the planet' was still something to be believed. All is put on PC2 now. Really disappointing and something to be remembered when considering PC2. So recommend Yes for the drive, No for the sim.
10169	If you liek to drive and thats it this game is great.  If you like to customize or tweek the exterior like colors sticker etc then this game sucks
10170	i dont really like this
10171	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI nice graphics meh gameplay  Does graphics matter much? if not i dont recommend this
10172	Overrated graphics, primitive collision physics...
10173	After all this time, still no Steam Cloud Save? Have to use Game Save Manager to sync progress between 2 machines.
10174	i just dont like any of anything
10175	this game sucks it is impossible in the rain and the steering is so hard. i've messed with the settings and i've won alot of races but the more powerful cars you can t even keep them on the track. sorry but 60$ down the drain here!!
10176	Great performance on desktop but abyssmal performance on the Vive with all settings on low on a 1080. Do I have to say more?
10177	Pretty much, this is  Gran Turismo for PC.
10178	no wheel, no fun;  btw. project cars. a good name since this 'project' isnt finished yet. poorly optimized and as i mentioned, if you have to play this on a controller, no fun, no fun at all! also i dont know about graphics, good car model no question but the rest is just....well it a car game, trackdetails are meh and if you havent the power to play this in 4k its just another racing game with rain. dont get the fuss about it also because its engine is a joke (restarting if you alter a graphik option)   buy it if its on sale otherwise ignore the hyped product that cant live up to its hype....not even close
10179	School Project Cars  Project Cars is supposed to be a simulator, but it fails to achieve this. The game is definitely hard and people often confuse this with it being a simulator. There are so many aspects which make it unrealistic it can only ever be an arcade game in my eyes. Why itâs not a simulator:  Remove the driving aids and the higher power cars become un driveable even with steering wheel and peddles. Itâs not easy to drive a Ariel atom but guys itâs not impossible either.   No pit crew.  Pit lane traffic light normally red, AI control drives you straight through it.  No penalties for crossing pit exit line.  No parade lap.  No checkered flag, (or any coloured flag for that matter as no marshalls.)   Unrealistic damage, smash head long into wall at 100mph and car just seers to one side.  AI driving is of the 1990âs era, AI cars often just drive in a parade around the whole race behind you. AI hardly ever tries to overtake you unless youâre on a straight.   At 100% difficulty some series you will be faster by 2 seconds a lap others you will be 20 seconds a lap behind.   Allows ridiculous corner cutting. For a startâ¦  The graphics engine is lame, even on 980GTX you get micro stuttering in corners. The colours and lighting are also very unrealistic. It is a detailed game graphically but not in a realistic way. Itâs also behind graphically with other games of this generation. If you compare it to Driveclub or Forza 6 although arcade games they do have a much more realistic look about them.   It canât be that bad as Iâve played 66 hours, but I generally just load up play 30 mins and get bored. I donât regret buying Pcars but I wouldnât bother with project cars 2.  You only have to scroll through the reviews to this how appalling the development team are at addressing bugs, they seem to have contempt for anyone who has purchased the game. On the forums people are banned for raising bugs or for asking questions that reflect project cars in a bad light.  For the reason Iâm giving it a thumbs down.  
10180	The game is very pretty, the driving is very good.  The problem is is that there is no content for this game, the multiplayer is horrible and dying, you never know what the AI is going to do, runs considerably worse on AMD cards, they expect you to buy DLC for things that were promised befor released. On top of all of that the next game is currently being worked on and a Kickstarter is out while this game is still a buggy mess with no content. If you want a racing sim go pick up Asseta Corsa
10181	I'm sorry to say that as beautiful as this game is, it sucks. Sorry. :(
10182	This game started out good. However this morning it will no longer support the mouse during play which makes the game uncontrollible. Very very unhappy as there is no way to get help.
10183	Don't like this game at all, even on sale for 20 euro i think it's to much.... PLEASE FORZA COME TO PC!
10184	Trash game dont even buy it
10185	Graphics didn't look good on HTC Vive.
10186	I got this cause I wanted to race with people, but it just isn't that fun. I mean once you're on the track and you are going it's alright, but to get to that point you have to deal with a lot of nonsense. It's about as interesting to drive as grand theft auto. It doesn't require much skill, but you can make it hard on yourself if you really wanted to. Anybody can pick up this game and win easily, which is pretty much the only reason to like it... but it's not very rewarding. Meaning, you just don't have much of a reason to play it. If you like casually racing it's cool, but if you really wanted a hard core racing game you'd look elsewhere.
10187	Does not work in vr with G29 do not buy there is no support for this game! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!
10188	How do change the screen size ? it show far to big on my 28i screen , on start up ???
10189	This game is unplayable on an Oculus Rift. Wish there was a way to return a game.
10190	Throthle sensitivity is a scam! 0% throttle sensitivity will still be 100% GGWP dont buy this scam
10191	Will not run great on AMD R9 290 even with overclocking. Cars do not have any 'feel' on a controller. I also prefer to race for money or credits to purchase new vehicles or upgrades. Sadly, all vehicles are unlocked from the get-go and no upgrades are available for purchase. I miss Forza 4.
10192	I really want to like this game but using a keyboard and mouse makes it practically unplayable. Firstly there is no option for panning with the mouse to look around so that threw me off at first. Secondly, the steering with wasd is unsensitive (I have tried adjusting it) and so often I found myself spinning out uncontrolled. Finally, with a keyboard, the throttle maxes out as soon as you press a key, so the track is more like an ice-rink most of the time. In short, I would not reccomend this game unless you have a steering wheel and pedals. Other than that, the graphics are great and the selection of tracks and cars is superb! Great design, but I feel as though is is optomised for console rather than for PC.
10193	well i have the minimum system req, and even on full low i can get max ~20 fps. LOL. (maybe because i have amd? ). I also tried with laptop which has gtx 650 card and i7 processor, but the same, maybe A LITTLE BIT better (30-35 fps on very low lel).  Also, unplayable with controller, and no proper force feedback for wheels (g27). No settings option during races, no tuning like in assetto corsa.
10194	This is one of the worst racing sims i've ever played. Not the worst but definitely down there.  Pros: -The tracks and the car look fantastic. The details and the asthetics are top notch. -The sound of the cars is brilliant. Other sims somewhat lack a decend liquid dinosaur burning soundtrack. PCars has nailed it with the sound of these cars.  -Pretty good selection of tracks available. -Has good steering wheel support. I.E easy remapping tools and defaul setups for many steering wheels. Even though you have to tweek the deadzones and senstivity quite alot. -Game Menus look pretty good.  Cons: The game has been out for over 1 year now and STILL suffers from instant game crashes, unplayable tracks, bugged car tuning and the worst mulitplayer in any car racing game.  -Car handling is all over the place. Some cars will stick to the road like glue, others are like driving on sheet ice. Regardless of track conditions. Any input from you, whether brake, throttle, or steer, you will end up spinning out of control and smashing into a wall. Even when you are going slowly, high gear and low revs to reduce tyre spin up. Doesn't make a difference. -Frequently insta-crashes when starting a single player race. I.E You select a car/track, click start, once past the loading screen and into the pits, game crashes. Only way out it to task manager end task. This also happens with multiplayer. -About 70% of the the time when you load into a multiplayer game, after clicking 'Drive', AI will take you of of the pits, revert control to you and suddenly you have no control over the car, it will slow down, hit a wall (because you cant steer) and the game will crash. -Some players get randomly kicked out of multiplayer games when they are just trying to join. -Pits system seems like it was forgot about until the last minute; confusing and buggy (say you want to change your tyres, nothing happens and you get sent out of the pits with the same worn tyres). -After setting up a multiplayer game, after the loading screen and being placed in the pits, on certain tracks your car will just fall through the floor. This has happened to me in single player too. Thought I was playing PCars not FSX. -Single player AI seems to based upon that 14 year old that only wants to ram every single car of the track. Sometimes they are good at 'shutting the door' on you and actual competitive racing. But only sometimes. More like, 30-40% of the time.    My average PCars day: Load game up. Fancy a bit of multiplayer. Find some active lobbies, most being compeletly empty, some with 3 people in, the odd one with 10+ in. Select a lobby, choose car, join session, game loads, into pits...game crash. End task, re-start game. Repeat above, get into the pits this time, AI drives out of pits, maunal control, nothing. Watch as a huge crash barrier gets closer and closer with no way of controlling my car, hit it, game crash.  Repeat above about 2 times more, actually get into game and start racing. no further issues. Unless you want to change your car which you can only do by completely exiting the session and re-joining, and having the same issues as listed above.  Needs alot of improvement. Wish I didnt buy the game, thought it would be alot better.   5/10
10195	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game .. hope for a forza ... no tuning ..... no modification .. no simulation ... want to get refound isnt a forza for pc dont buy ..buy asseto corsa ...
10196	For some reason, 20 VR games in and this is the only game to give me motion sickness.
10197	Piece of crap, constructive criticism - yes , because i described what they gave us, a piece of the biggest â¥â¥â¥â¥ they made, the other pieces we have to buy over DLC ;)
10198	Nowhere close to the GRID series, tracks are just static settings, no barrier interaction, no tracks in sand, nothing.
10199	wanted gran turismo pc edition got sim racer with 'story mode' that is bad and not a story mode  come on people just make a game I can put a supercharger in a 60 year old mini cooper that's all I ask
10200	I really wanted to play this game for a long time, now i've got it, n waited even longer to download it (slow internet) aaaaannnd it didn't work. It kept on crashing everytime i started it.  I read multiple reviews and tried several ways to fix it, from updating the drivers, removing them and reinstalling them, switching to another gpu, fixing the voltage received by every single peice in my rag and many others... still didn't work!  What a shame, lost almost 50$ just like that, for nothing :/
10201	I HEARD THIS DEVELOPER WAS WORKING WITH REAL DRIVES AND WANTD TO MAKE A REAL GAME WITH REAL LIKE CAR CONTROL BUT NOW I REALIZE IT WAS ALL A LIE.   I OWN HONDA ACCORD AND I TAKE SWEEPING BENDS AT 140KM/H WHICH I AM UNABLE TO DO ON THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS SO USELESS I WASTED MONEY ON IT.   DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EXPECING REAL LIKE CAR HANDLING. I DONT KNOW IF IT IS THE FAULT OF STUPID DRIVE WHO IS HELPING THIS DEVELOPER OR IF ITS THE DEVELOPER.. END RESULT IS ITS A USELESS GAEM.   ALL CARS HAVE LOSE REAR END WHICH RIGHT BUT THE AMOUNT OF GRIP YOU HAVE ON REAR TIRE IS BAD.. ITS NOT REAL LIKE.   CAR SETUP IS ALSO USELESS. YOU CAN TRY ALL OF IT AND IF YOU HAVE LUCK, YOU WILL FIND SOME GOOD SETUP. MYSELF A AUTOMOBILE ENG AND WHEN I LOWER REAR TYRE PRESSURE AND ADJUST BREAK BS.. IT ALL HAS COUNTER EFFECT TO WHAT YOU SEE IN REAL LIFE..
10202	worst piece of crap that ever been described as a racing game
10203	Horrible.
10204	Its bad  
10205	0/10
10206	It's almost impossible to go though menus using htc vive and steam controller, it's just unplayable.
10207	Driving simulator 6/10 AI 6/10 Graphic 9/10 Online 1/10 physics 6/10 track realism 6/10 car details 10/10  Overall 5/10 This is Not a driving simulator, still a very nice outstanding looking Game . 
10208	to sum it up, its one of those games where they tried too hard to make it seem realistic, but just made it bad.
10209	Nice cars, nice graphics. But the worst FFB i've ever seen ! Guys you did nothing and we must tweak the game to get something of it. Do not recommend this game because of that...
10210	Dont buy!
10211	Do you want a headache? If the answer is yes then this game is for you. You will have joy in learning what every little controller variable in the set up menu does as you try to get anything close to a realistic feel. You will expeirence the absolute joy in trying to get even a basic gamepad (xbox/ps) controller to work with this game. And you will have to do this for both a game pad and steering wheel everytime you start up the game, it's especially fun when the game crashes in the middle of races. Enjoy.
10212	I have bought this game only for VR experience. And this game very often brings headaches with customizing it each time that developer update it. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. Additional, when I am buying any game in Steam, their developers without any questions giving special Oculus Home key. But Developers of Project Cars give no reactions at all. It's too much for game that cost a lot. Looks like I will ask take my money back.
10213	Hell i can go around coners faster in my Chevrolet Silverado 3500 Duramax 6.6Ldual one ton and i am a real car car driver too so i know what i am talking about. i drove the m3 BMW in the game it drove like â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont handle good and i have a m3 BMW i drive every day it handles good and drives great in real life. The cars in the game drive bad dont handle good. You dum programs need to drive real cars then drive the cars in the game u can see the diff mybe. Cars dont handle good like in the race games dirt 3, f1 2014, grid or Toca race driver 3, Need for speed Hot Pursuit, dirt, they have the cars driving like â¥â¥â¥â¥ do not buy this game they need to fix it.
10214	About me: - The Project Gotham Racing games (1 and 2) on the original xbox were my favourite ever driving games.  - I find full race weekends tedious. - I hate 'Endurance races'. - I like to have fun when I play games. - I get a sense of achievement from expanding a minimal roster by spending 'kudos'/xp points. - I enjoy Grid Autosport. - I use a gamepad.  Project CARS bored me. Returned for refund.
10215	Beautiful game, handling with a gamepad makes the game almost unplayable.
10216	Not as fun as i expected. i first looked at the review on iGN before bying but i geuss you cant really know if you love it or not till you have tryed it. Play the game with a Razer Onza gamepad was just awful. The Cars felt way to heavy and even after adjusting sensitivity and dead zones ECT driving was still unpleasant and annoying. Maybe on console the game could be enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend buying.
10217	The most buggy game on earth, IT WONT EVEN GO FULL SCREEN FOR MY 3 DISPLAY SETUP!!!! ONLY WINDOWED
10218	Pros: Fantastic game great graphics even at lower settings amazing gameplay feels real fun af good online community great career mode HELMET VIEW tracks cars KARTS  Cons: unhandled exception error no fix for unhandled exception error unhandled exception error unhandled exception error crashes game at random times unhandled exception error sound is eh unhandled exception error

10220	This game..this game... at first it was the best racing game to date, but when i got further into the game i ran into an isuue.   This issue was that this game is far too complicated for a regular racing game fan. If you understand a lot about cars, this is the game for you. But for me its too big. There are loads and loads of configurations and options that i cant simply wrap my my head around. When i got to my second racing series, or whatever you want to call them, my car was uncontrolable, it was all over the place, i searched online for solution but ended up empty handed. when i say uncotrolable i mean it was all over the place, i couldnt even move forward, i was spinning circles and running into the terrain which got my frustraited enough to quit the game for good.   Short story short, if you know a lot about cars and theyr configurations, this is the game for you, otherwise DO NOT BUY THIS GAME or atleast get a cracked version first, just to try it out because this game isnt for everyone.
10221	another broken,buggy,overhyped garbage i think im gonna change my hobby
10222	It's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10223	 I didnt find this game very fun...      There arent many cars    Career mode is boring    Not worth my money (sorry gaben)  
10224	Game hits 60fps at 1080p on a normal monitor but in VR it is almost unplayable on low settings.
10225	Nothing special here EDIT: I feel like I should reiterate - there is nothing original about this game that would warrant its purchase if you have played literally any other racing game since Gran Turismo 2
10226	For anyone who wanted this game for its hyped up realism, please just walk away. However if you enjoy difficult racing games whether the cars handle like â¥â¥â¥â¥ or not then this might be the game for you :)
10227	Turned to â¥â¥â¥â¥ at midpoint. Too bad.
10228	Solid racing game with realy bad AI racers and A LOT of bugs and i mean A LOT. (Piling up AI on start grid, steering ratios changing mid race, magically fuel dissapearing. Total physic â¥â¥â¥â¥ups. etc. etc.)  Pretty crappy with controller. Funny with wheel.   Bug infested racing game with so much potential. Sad.   No honest person could recommend this game at this stage.
10229	Not even an full hour of gametime and i am already done with this. this game is impossible to play if you don't have an expensive steering wheel set.  You want to enjoy this game, buy a racing wheel set. with a regular controller it is simply impossible.  Kartracing is supposed to teach you the basics, all it does for me is when i hit a kart, my Kart angles up and loses all control.  I don't know about you but i have done karting myself and that is not supposed to happen.  this renders any gameplay absolutely impossible, i get penalized for everything that is out of my control.  Being pushed of the track costs me points.  this sucks.  Waste of money for me.
10230	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!. It is not worth it, I have 200 hours in this game... i have tried to love it so hard, but it is imposible to love somthing this bad.  I can say it is pretty, but then so is watching motorsport on TV and you get far less issues with that and much more enjoyment.  This game is nothing but a buggy broken mess of a game that the developers seem to have no care for long time.   I am pretty angry writing this, because for the 2nd time in a row a race i competed in was lost because of a bug with refuling. I was doing the best i could do in the car i was in, actually bette the second time. both times in pit stops when i asked for 40L of fuel i got none. I have encountered nothing but bugs, the AI is hopless and just drives into you, the actual feel of the cars ir off most of the time, and well the online comunity racing? yeah i tried three times and none were good. do your self a favour buy a copy of the 2002 F1 championship Review on DVD, It will give you the same enjoyment you will recive in this game at a much lower price, that enjoyment factor being none.
10231	 iracing.com  is still the best
10232	
10233	This game is broken as F and the developer will tell you 'shut up you idiot' on the forum if you give constructive critisism.   Plus the lead dev (Ian Bell) looks like a potato with a face.
10234	not that great
10235	if you do not have a racing weel do not get this game it is crap with a 360 usb contraler same with mouse and keybored go to turn and the weels just stick even going slow and its always to the left for me i know its not my contaler i use it with my 360 no problem might be fun with a weel not sure just stay away if you want to have fun
10236	This game SUCKS! Not only does it keep crshing, but the game play is terrible. Worest driving simlator I've ever played. I WISH I could get a refound.
10237	Now I know I am not recommending this game, but that is solely based on personal opinion.   This game is beuatifully made, has excellent graphics, and its simulation engine is second to none. The reason I am not recommending this game is solely because I was looking for an arcade racer and this did not fit the bill.   Pros: Excellent Graphics Very realistic Great community  Cons: Not what I was looking for Doesnt have steam cloud, so i recommend using Gamesave manager
10238	This Angry Man Sums Up My Project Cars Frustrations So Far
10239	Not a fun racing game. Save your money and time dont buy it.
10240	zero support. what a joke. still haven't turned a single lap
10241	Don't buy this if you don't have a steering wheel. I tried it with xbox360 controller and it just s*cks and there is no way to fix it. Just google 'project cars countersteer' or 'project cars xbox controller' and see how many people got problems.  The user interface is the worst i've seen in the past years.
10242	They should have called this game RACECARS. Please tell me where the project is... There is no building or tuning.
10243	Simulator YES BUY IT! Racing game NOPE!  Really Really good simulator, stunning graphics and probably the best part of the game is the sound that comes out of the god damn cars, however nothing like i expected. boring and repedative gameplay with only about 20-30 cars that are all race spec cars and no customization or anything, just tuneing on an advanced level. I was expecting a game such as Forza or Grand Turismo with a collective gararge to obtain but you own everything on the get-go and career mode is the same. hense refunded however i was 50/50 questioning to hit yes or no on this recommendationg.  as for a simulator review, this is a MUST GET! it supports even playstation and xbox steering wheels!
10244	Absolute rubbish. The cars are competly unstable like you're driving on ice all the time.
10245	I really really was waiting this game! the game is not done yet!! a lot of problems! online racing SUCK BIG TIME.  the selection of cars very poor! I mean pffffffffffff....... a lot of stuff wrong!!! ASSESTTO is better BUT the father of simulator always will be GRAN TURISMO 4 . 5. and 6.   safe your money!   
10246	Project Cars has the best graphics to date for a racing game and the physics are just as amazing but for a high dollar game theres almost NO CONTENT! The amount of cars and tracks in this game is Despicable for the amount of dosh they expect you to throw at them.
10247	I regret ever getting this game. Too realistic. However, this game is very appealing visually, but not my cup of tea.
10248	This pice of crap doesn't work for me. It crashes and says some EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS ERROR and never crashes. I cant play it. I just bought the game and my pc is i5 6600k nvidia 1060 6gb and 16gb ddr4 ram. I mean WTF

10251	  This game have a nice graphic and gameplay but too many bugs, and they dont do anything bout it, espcially on multiplayer online race. And everytime i want go to online or back to main menu my controller always dont have a response. For me no dont buy this game too many bugs.
10252	Hasn't lived up to the hype; it's just another generic racer.
10253	this game is pretty bad i did a poo when i played it because it was so bad and then showed it to the guy i hated the most so he would die lolololololol  love cole xx
10254	horrible controlls imposible to play and overall just a dingus of a game
10255	 Basic Comments
10256	horrible controlls imposible to play and overall just a dingus of a game
10257	My friends are too good
10258	Just never works Recommend against it
10259	How project cars was made. 1. hire the guys behind shift 1 and 2. 2. strip off the tracks and cars from shift 2 game. 3. add some tracks and cars to the game. 4. change menu. 5. release unfinished broken game. (it has sections in the game with title 'coming soon', maybe if u pay more for dlc)  6. dont fix anything via 3 major patches. 7. sell dlc to cash more money. 8. rebrand project cars into project cars 2 and sell it again.  Sorry if i offended the fanboys but this is true.  Edit: 5 months after it has been released many bugs are still present in this game but the devs are only interested in hyping the next dlc. shame.
10260	It doesn't drive like Assetto... although it looks great the simulation side of it is not what I'm looking for, feels particularly arcade like after spending so many hours in the better product. Sorry fanboyz
10261	Want to not learn how to drive a car? Want to smash your keyboard into a million pieces? Want to imagine throwing your computer out onto the street and running it over with you fat mom? Well then this is the game for you! For only a rediculous amount of money can you play this STUPID game!!! Probably the worst game I could of ever spent that amount of money on. NEVER BUY THIS GAME!
10262	-
10263	you cant buy cars, this is why game isnt so fun
10264	This was one of the worst car games ever because the cerar mode is very bad and the game is very buggy. I completly recoment The Crew
10265	Quick buyer's warning:  The game looks NOTHING like the screenshots on Steam. I was looking forward to this title in the hopes it would be a high fidelity racing game I'd enjoy on my stupidly overkill gaming PC. With all settings maxed (aside from AA) it looks like something you'd find on PS4 or Xbox One. Textures outside the car are sub-par. The crowds are immobile 3D sprites. The quality of the shaders is average at best. The shadows inside the cockpit were not looking too great.  As far as performance go it's good on my machine (i7-5930K/GTX 980 SLI/32GB DDR4) in 1080p which is no surprise. I keep a steady 120 to 140fps most of the time with all settings maxed (aside from AA). That's probably the best thing about this game, it runs great (so far).  For anyone intending to play this game with Keyboard &amp; Mouse you pretty much can't. I have found no options to customize my keys. You don't use the mouse at all. As far as I can see there are some options missing when you using a keyboard. After trying every single key on my keyboard twice I can confirm there are no options to change the camera view. The customization menu offers me controller controls, yet I have none connected to my machine.  I'll continue to play the game. I'll try my Logitech F310 controller and my Xbox One controller later when I have the chance to. Perhaps a patch will fix most of the issues, but as of now, this is looking close to a Watch Dogs. Show some pretty graphics to hype the game, but never deliver on them. All that's left is a modder unlocking them from the files.  So for the moment I can't recommend the game. Perhaps that'll change as I play. Perhaps it'll be much better with a controller, which is a shame because I love driving with my keyboard, as unreal as it might seem to some racing fans.
10266	Almost no customisation options, apart from some tire, brake and traction tuning stuff.  Serious lack of cars, like really, so bloody few cars it feels like I only got half a game.  ...but the worst thing is the terrible controller handling, it's 2015 for gods sake, could you not at least have gotten something so bloody important right ?  I mean really, one of the most important things, especially considering there's no realistic keyboard control options either (g'luck with that even if there was).  The handling of the Karts is a mess too, the 125CC's are fine but the 250CC's are a joke.  Wouldn't mind but the AI controlled karts in the 250cc bracket handle amazing at super top speed but you'll find it hard yourself to even keep yours in a straight line if using a controller and they end up flying all over the place when taking some corners, literally, flying, up off the ground, in the air, flying !  Meanwhile the computer controlled cars have cornered at top speed flawlessly and zipped past you.  Meh, I still like the game, I've a decent PC built and it looks great imo, real sense of speed when racing.  Just fix the controller handling, 250cc Kart handling, add a lot more cars and at least some basic customisation options apart from the under the hood tuning - would be happy enough then.
10267	Do not like this game at all, limited to track races only and cant customise cars like wat u could do in forza, recommended for a racing sim but not recommended as a casual racing game
10268	The game sounds and looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥ DONT BUY IT
10269	Good grafics and all, but sucks
10270	Graphics are ok But the game has terrible controls,the cars do not respond or they turn of their own accord NFS Hot Pursuit,Dirt Showdown and Mario Kart are all better this is boring
10271	dont by it
10272	WHY THE ALT+F4 DONT WORK IN THIS GAME? CAN YOU ADD IT ?
10273	Don't launch with the project cars desktop icons and by Steam library on window 7 64 bits. Don't know which has tested this game but works is not well done.  4 years to do that LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 
10274	This game is great, it really is. The driving is great. Wide variety of cars. Heaps of tracks. Deep career mode. Car tuning. Statistics. Multiplayer. Community Events. Time Trial.... and more to come in the future !  There is just one problem here, it doesn't feel as amazing as it is. Not as in the feeing of the cars(which is very good) but in things like how information is presented. The menus are just messy and confusing. It doesn't make you feel like a race driver. You really have to try and ignore the presentation of the game and imagine how much better it could be to make the game feel great.  I played the game during early access and always thought they had just never quite have the greatest user interface and menus, something I thought would be overhauled by the time. The full release is here and nothing has changed. It is a strange thing because it HAS all the features and everything in the game already; there is nothing missing from the game. It is just waiting to be unleashed.  This is what I think will put most people off the game because they won't realised how great the game is hidden behind the bad visual presentation(again the graphical visuals are crisp and clean and very well done)... The thing about this is that I can see signs of a great presentation all of the place, I just feel if SMS took the time to redesign how the game was presented they could have really made this the amazing game that it is.  It's like the room got messy and they didn't bother to clean it up, everything is in the room but it is just jumbled around everywhere and all you can see is a mess if you don't know where anything is or what it does.  For any game trying to make it with a mainstream audience the presentation is much more important than the gameplay, in fact presentation IS gameplay. It's like when you go to a expensive resturant and everything is expertly cooked and everything about the taste is perfect, but if made it to your table and it just didn't look very apealing you probably won't enjoy it as much simply because it didn't look that good. You would feel a bit ripped off. With such a great game you need great presentation. I just couldn't recommend the game in the state it is and I don't know if it will get better with time when the problem is so fundamental. I couldn't imagine SMS doing such a big change to the presentation.
10275	Some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ran me off the track on the last lap of a race. So I tried to go the oppisite direction on the track and get in a head-on collision with as many cars as I could but the game ended the race and discualified me, ruining both my fun and my immersion.  Isn't that good looking, for a car game.  Controlls feel weird, and somewhat unrealistic at least with a controller.  I don't understand who this game is for. If you're looking for realistic get Forza. If you're looking for arcadey, get Burnout Paradise.
10276	Before you rate this down with 15 alt accounts, and spampost below, I would like to tell you something.    - Pre-Introduction -
10277	Stupid game, you can't even get out of the car lol. Were they even trying? Also the game is an unoriginal GTA copy
10278	28 mins of gameplay and i already broke my xbox controler cause the cars would just go straight in the ditch or do a 180 turn. (no its not my gamepad i tried with keyboard and my wheel as well) 0/10 would not recommend this game to anyone
10279	Cars handle like sh*t on a controller.   Lack of cars.  Looks nothing like screenshots.  The difficulty of actual racing offline is too easy with assists, but the cars still handle like crap, must be super easy when it works.  Your car will slide about doing 30 MPH and and heading in a straight line.  Overall really crap controller support, GFX no where near screenshots and pre rendered stuff. (i have everything maxed out) Poor amount of cars, lack of actual car editing like weight, and engine stuff.  The physics are wrong. It feels like a development build with a lot of work left on it.
10280	Review: ------------------  -Trash- ------------------ End of review.
10281	It's full of bugs and all you do is pointless driving without clans or leaderboard
10282	I had the game longer than 2 days , i'm banned on project cars forums than after that they deleted my game from my game inventory do not buy or support these devs. 
10283	Screenshot Simulator 2015  EDIT: Saying as how NO major changes were made to the game in order to improve it in any significant way, I can only assume this game is still in the same broken state as it was at its release. The constant influx of positive reviews is indicitive of how rabid the community was for shilling the game before it even released, as most of the reviews talk nothing about the actual content of the game or what it does well.  Abandon all hope yee who enter here.
10284	.
10285	I've only had crashes with this game.
10286	No left foot braking.  Can't access options while in race.  2/10, would refund again
10287	this game have only bugs beta
10288	Don't buy it, the gameplay is awfull
10289	It's almost impossible to drift.  If you like Gran Turismo you will like this game. I do not like Gran Turismo.
10290	controls are unplayable and the handling is awful I already got a refund because this game is bad
10291	Alright ik that a lot of people are thinking. Ah this game is great on computer bec of graphics and good frames. BUT WAIT YOU NEED TO HAVE A CONTROLER OR A STEERING WEEL FOR THIS GAME!!! NO KEYBOARDS WILL DO WELL OK. JUST LETTING YOU KNOW SO YOU DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.
10292	'it's a no from me.' - simon cowell
10293	Don't....just don't even think in buying this if you look for a simulation...this is far from it... The bugs turn this into a pile of manure! There are no physics present..or Earth physics for that matter.. Drive in game the same car I own in real life...and no...just NO! not even close, because my car can make turns at 50kmh...in this game, you just can't!   WORST CAR SIMULATION EVER!
10294	Great game, Driving is very realistic, Damage is very realistic. Only thing I don't like is lack of customizing cars, buying and owning your own cars, I hope they add a DLC that adds customizing.  I don't recommend this game because of the lack of customizing options. They have allot of tracks but not the most like they promised. If you like to just race realistic this game is for you. I am glad I did not pay but half price for it.  The graphics are alright, Nothing like the screenshots though, I have everything on ultra and its no where near as good as the screenshots.
10295	I do not like this game because of the lack of vehicles. I would not reccomend this game to anyone who wants to be able drive almost any car like forza.  
10296	if your not a veryyyyyyyyyyyyy patient person dont buy this game .
10297	Drifting in this game suck... If you want gr8 sim you need to buy assetto corsa, not this one. Graphics ain't everythin
10298	Not enough cars. 
10299	Very very limited Oculus Rift Support! Most feature are completely Unavailable when using VR! Unfinished Product!  Game absolutely horrible without the help of third party sofware on the Oculus Rift! Not too mention all the features that are completely Unavailable when using VR No Telemetry, No Lap info, Split/Delta, Speed, no Map and no Gear info etc. Nope not if you use the Oculus Rift not to mention you have to open and close the game to set things up can't use menus while using VR and too think these a holes advertised Oculus Rift support well that's BS! Where is the integrity great game but Very limited VR and no support or even a simple paragraph of info for the Oculus Rift. The game does work in VR but again most features don't so why advertise that it does? Once you set up third party software and read forums on how to setup, game play with the Oculus Rift DK2 is great but only after hours of adjustments! But not so great seeing I just payed $50 for a game that has 'Oculus Rift Support' in big letters on their website. So yeah great game false advertising! This is an UNFINISHED PRODUCT! I have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (and many other agency's) I hope Slightly Mad Studios gets Fined!   Note: review is for VR other than that I'm enjoying game would give it a rating of 8.5 or better as far as the game itself goes!
10300	I am looking for a game similar to Forza, and this has to be the closest. This game needs one thing to be fun, a rewind otpion while racing.
10301	Negative because it's not Crossplatfrom.
10302	Call this suck â¥â¥â¥ game slip slide racing............... I want my money back
10303	its a bad game there is no point to the carrer you already get the very little cars that are in the game and there is no custimization what so ever the controls aren the best i say its not worth the 50$ and looks like more of a free to play game
10304	So, although I've only driven for 10 minutes I can already tell you that this game is just not worth the money. Assetto Corsa, a game that costs less and is not even finished feels far better over all, has better graphics and is a game that I actually like to play. Project Cars feels like a console game in regards to the graphics and the way cars handle - Unless it's a bug, any car apart from an LMP1 car is impossible to control and is just plain unrealistic. Although it may seem small, the sun rays and lens flare effects when in first person are almost blinding and glitch through decals on the windscreen every few seconds (plenty more bugs like it appeared throughout my 20 minute experience) - I really didn't expect this from a Â£40 2015 'driving simulator'...If you're not willing to purchase Assetto Corsa however, Project Cars is almost certainly the second best option for you - It is up there when it comes to PC driving games (due to the very low number available), but due to the cost and high anticipation I had for it, I'm incredibly dissapointed - Assetto Corsa is just a better game overall. It is very early days however and so I'll give it time but for now, back to Assetto Corsa.
10305	GRID Autosport is far better when it comes to handling the car and how it actual feels to drive. The graphics is not good either. Feels like playing a 5 yo game.
10306	I wanted to update my review on Project CARS as I can no longer recommend this title.  Why? Because it's a boring game. For a racing game, it is so god awfully boring to drive or race. Racing is more of a chore than it is fun in this game, especially do to the awful AI that essentially ramps its speed up or down depending on the 0-100 slider. The way that AI is leagues faster in the rain, has incredibly erratic pit schedules, and just overall seems to be driving a different race than you, is frustrating. For those who have played Civ V in great depth, it's reminiscent of how the highest difficulty AI doesn't necessarily outplay you - it just plays a different sets of rules than you.  The physics in the game are good to me, but it falls in this strange area of not exactly sim, but not at all arcadey. I (somewhat controversially) prefer it to Assetto Corsa, which feels like cars on ice skates, but it still isn't 'fun' to drive. Many of the cars are just plain awful to drive, and on top of that, they don't feel fast. It's a strange sensation to be going down the Mulsanne at 180+ mph and not feel any sense of speed. This makes free lapping feel bland and doesn't drive me to try and beat my times. Coupled with few cars/tracks and numerous cars/tracks locked behind DLC, and it's awful.  Online is particularly dead these days unless you get involved with some sort of league, which are still small.   From a technical standpoint, graphics are outstanding, sounds are very good, and setting up controls were fairly simple for me.  In short, it's a pretty game with nothing fun to do inside of it. Racing the AI is boring, being alone is just useless, and there's so much cut content that you'll be paying $50+ to hotlap for 5 minutes and then go play something else.
10307	Nope, not even after 7 patches the first year (!!) can this game bring any joy. Buggy physics, crappy AI (worse than Assetto Corsa) and the dev just keeps pumping out DLC like once a month. Don't buy this game, not even during a Steam Sale. The game causes more frustrated than joy, and fails at every point possible except for graphics. But a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that is beautiful is still a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
10308	EDIT: Since the game has been released... Nothing much has been progressed. It still misses a lot of tracks, it still misses a great car roster and it misses modding options. The worst of it all is that PCars 2 has already been announced with all features that were promised during the crowdfunding to go in to Pcars 1 untill they suddenly changed the entire feature schedule!  They also add a few cars per month via a paid 'On Demand' system. With some cars in them that should have been standard in the game already or atleast made free. This is just ridiculous.  So yeah, stay away from this game unless you fancy graphics, physics and a few cars that you can race in. Nothing much else really.  My previous (naÃ¯eve) review:  --- Where to begin... well, lets just name all the positives and negatives for now:  Positive: - Absolutely amazing sounds, music and overall sound quality per car - Graphics are something never seen before in other racing games and every track still amazes me in how much detail they have put in it - Rookie to Pro career, IF you want! No strings if you go from F1 driver to Kart racer - Online with a massive options list for you to shape your own online session - The physics! YES! - Helmet cam immersion - Amazing weather effects  negatives: - Low track count. Coming from Forza, Gran Turismo and a heap of other racing games, I find the tracks to be on the 'meh, It works, but I miss some of my and my friends' favourites...' side - Low car list, really nothing much. Nissan GTR fans, sorry, its not (yet) there. List will hopefully improve as time progresses!  And thats about it for now! ---
10309	This game is crap compared to Grand Turismo 5!
10310	After what is something like almost a year after release the game gives the exact same feeling: an unfinished product. What really strucks my though is that SMS rather than concentrating in completing the game are releasing DLC's with a few cars + tracks each. This is simply ridiculous. I am not planning to invest neither on this game nor on the upcoming PC2.  Now as far as it concerns the gameplay itself: If you drive a real simulator such as Assetto Corsa and then jump in the same car-track combination driving on Project CARS you will immediately realise why this game simply sucks. It's almost like half the driving experience is not there (needless to say both games require a steering wheel). In a couple of words this is a NFS shift re-release for god sake...
10311	hmmmm This game is arcade
10312	Nope. The game itself is good but that's not the point. I don't like a game which does work really fine on a certain hardware, and doesn't on the other. This is not fair, I don't like this kind of acting. Devs say all the opposite but when you try it, when you see it how it works, when you read many facts then you get that this is not a fair treatment on both sides. Just no. Shameful politics, that's it.
10313	Compared to Assetto Corsa this is arcade racing.
10314	I've played about 6 hours (2 were AFK) but these are my impressions so far.  I've been told this game is excellent with a wheel, but I cannot confirm this as I sold my racing wheel a while back. I'm playing with an Xbox One controller. The default settings for the controller are absolutely TERRIBLE. Steering is WAY too sensitive, brakes are not sensitive enough. You have to adjust deadzones and sensitivity for nearly everything. And even then, they are still lacking. The game doesn't punish you for using assists like Forza does but the developers unfortunately have still not gotten past their NFS days of LOL OVERSTEER and cars are too subject to loss of grip from any reasonable amount of acceleration, even in a straight line. With TCS on, they behave much more realistically and only oversteer when they should. Unless you have a wheel and pedals, you're going to want the assists on.  That said, there's a good bit of content and realism, and there's interesting stuff to be seen in the singleplayer seasons. There's tons of disciplines of racing, tons of goals to reach and different vehicles to master. I'm doing kart racing right now, and aside from a few very annoying mistakes made by AI that ended up in me going from first to last place (2nd Place Driver: WHAT ARE BRAKES?) the races are fun, and you can set the length depending on how patient you are and how much time you've got on your hands. I've also done LMP2, GT3, Road car racing, and Clio touring cars. Everything seemed to handle very well with assists on (as I said, the game issues a huge 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' to anyone who doesn't have a wheel and turns off the assists)  There is presently an issue with online racing where it's very unclear what to do after qualifying. There's a countdown timer but all options other than Quit are greyed out in this menu. One would assume you are supposed to press 'Quit', since it's the only option, and then you'd be put in the lobby to wait for the other players to finish their final qualifying lap and then prepare to race. However, Quit kicks you out of the session. I figured it out before pressing it luckily but I've had several sessions where we went from ~7-10 players to ~3-5 players because they hit 'quit' after the qualifying lap.   Car Selection: All cars are unlocked from the start, which is a huge plus because you don't have to start from the bottom with some slow car and work your way up, you're free to race whatever discipline or spec you want from the second you start the game. However, the car selection is rather lacking. I hope you like European cars, because pretty much everything in the game is European. There is ONE Japanese car. One. And It's a Lancer Evo road car. There's one American Ford, everything else is Ford UK. There are no Lamborghinis or Ferraris, no Toyotas, Nissans or Subarus, no Corvettes. It's missing so many cars. Developers say they are adding more as DLC and more for free, but seeing as Forza Horizon 2, a game which had a severely cut down car list from even Forza 5, which had a even more severely cut down car list from Forza 4, has 225 cars without any DLC, I'm going to have to complain about this one.
10315	Good game. Was hopping for a more realistic carreer simulator like having to worry about repairs and money ect ect. but still more reason to play than just good graphics and unlocking more pointless cars such as forza and GT. Problems are all over the place though. controls are way to weak at times, unplayable with high power cars in the rain. Played 30 hours or so and uninstalled it.
10316	Was an excellent Racing simulator. Stay from this game! nothing but trouble! seriously! Career mode save gets wiped clean from out of nowhere..
10317	As a Gran Turismo player since 2012, I'm glad that I tried something new. Deep and demanding but user-friendly, it's Project CARS.  Well, it's been over a year and I have to admit, I expected more for the 50â¬ (Previous base price), let's have a summary what the simulator does like before, the praise and critics.  You can either start up with a career from kart till Le Mans, or go straight to your desired races with a big selection of tracks and cars, weather and competitors. Multiplayer is included too of course and you can compete with the whole globe during online time races. What I most liked are the graphics, especially the weather effects impressed me. The textures, sounds, everything. As long as your hardware can take it. It's 'alright' optimized for AMD cards, while Nvidia cards can run it much better seemingly because of PhysX effects. In the other hand, the physics are not as good as Gran Turismo and I could barely adapt to it. All racing simulators I play are controlled with a gamepad and I'm fine with that even without driving aids like on Gran Turismo. Unfortunately, Project CARS is another case. I tried to adjust dead zones and sensitivity here and there and it's just not comfy enough. Sometimes I don't feel guilty for an accident, some scenarios just aren't understandable so I have to use plenty driving aids to barely enjoy the game. Especially the AI gets me nuts sometimes, when the 2nd placed driver spins my ride fabulously right at the end of the race, and so on.  So what have we got now? Loads of unnecessary expensive DLC? Most of the ongoing online time races are DLC restricted? A new base price of 30â¬? Already working on Project CARS 2 and leaving the first one behind that fast?  Project CARS had so much potential to me. But at the end, I just feel ripped off. I pretty much respect the developers that they created a simulator with their own preferations, without the dependence of EA like on NFS: SHIFT which I also liked. Still, my expectations werent met at all.   Since refunds are possible, I recommed you to make your own idea of Project CARS. However, my thumb turned to a red one.
10318	Overall it's a really good game, with amazing graphics (no other racing game comes even close), amazing sounds and models. Car physics works really well too. My only complaints are 1. Bots are incredibly stupid, they ram you at every chance they get and 2. For some reason SMS don't believe in saving your controls (if you switch between wheel and controller like I do you're gonna have a bad time) and saving your hud settings. But overall the game is awesome and most of the DLCs are worth it too!  Update: This game is largely unchanged, same issues still exist. Bots still don't acknowledge your existence, and the problem with the HUD's settings is still there. But they have no problem in putting out more and more DLCs. They give us an Indy car and stock cars but no oval track, yep makes so much sense. And so I will no longer play this game, the visuals and the sounds are polished very well but that's it. I'd much rather play Dirt Rally, a much much more realistic and enjoyable driving experience.
10319	Changes my desktop backround when launched, werid.
10320	'Green, green, green!' - Ben Collins (Stig) shout on you. BRAAAAAAAAP STUTUTUTU *shift* BRAAAAAAAP *shift* BRAAAAAAPPPP STUTUTUTUTUTU *downshift* Karusell - almost clear and fast, I'm happy. *GLITCH, I sink into road* Losing control, crash, my wheel overtakes me. Race ends.
10321	Overall a very well rounded product at release and will only get better with future updates and support The good FFB/physics Career mode and the best ive seen in any racing title to date Multiplayer net code Very good ai compared to the majority of racing games Sounds great, maybe not RRE good but still very good Graphics......No other racing title compares Modern easy to use UI Leaderboards and community events dedicated servers The bad No current triple screen support at launch but word is its in the works  alot of ffb sliders with little info on what each do BUT....once you you do some research and figure them out it brings every car ingame to life and becomes extremely enjoyable! I would have liked to see some more cumminty/club features like what was in forza 4 where you could form a clan, have a clan prefix infront of your gt, share tunes and paints etc aswell as a private league support like iracing where you could create an online series and track the point standings. sadly amd gpu on multi screen setups dont perform all that great and need to lower some settings, but still looks great. SMS have done alot of optimization and now claim its up to AMD to optimize there drivers for this title.  Overall an excellent well rounded product that every racer will enjoy be it hotlappers, offline or multiplayer!
10322	cons/: amd fps is shocking,  cars are not well polished online is terrible   pros/: graphics amazing, cars are beautiful.  until they opermise this game for amd products do not buy.
10323	Compared to MotoGP 06 on the xbox 360, this game is terrible. Seven years on and the MotoGP licensed games have not seen any improvement.  Poor gameplay, poor graphics, poor sound  Avoid....
10324	Phenomenally crap 'photo realistic graphics' - videos that show far far far better quality than available in game. I'm running everything on max settings, Game play is clunky, messy and looks awful. Huge waste of Â£9.
10325	Online doesn't working any more because of low server storage :))))) funny reason
10326	After trying many,many different setups the responsiveness in turning still sucks. Its like a two wheeled tractor. Wish I would've saved my money. I give this game the finger!
10327	Could have been a lot better. Graphics are quite good, but all the riders look the same. Physics are quite good, but again, could be better. The game feels sloppily and quickly made. For example, there is a 'team management' type thing after every race, where you can check emails and social feeds from other riders and team managers, but they all say the same thing every time. Utterly pointless. My other gripe is if you have a crash or slide out, others riders behind you just ride straight through you like you are a ghost, wtf? This is a very rushed game, and corners were cut everywhere. 4/10
10328	I really can recommend this game only for a big fans of MotoGP and only because there is no other option. For others it's not an option. First of all, it has some critical issues which lasts for months without fixing. You can find occasionally that your career is no longer saving or the game isn't starting. But even without this it's far from perfect. AI is too easy to beat (on some tracks even extremely easy) on the higest difficlty level (with semi-pro physics), graphics was great seven years ago, it's almost always rainig, AI has cheat lap times in qualifying and a boy, who beats everyone in Moto3 and Moto2, winning almost every race, is only welcome in CRT teams (which makes your career looks pretty strange). But if you're ok with that, go and buy it right now! In fact, you don't really have a lot of choice in moto games, do you?
10329	Do I think this is a good game? In some respects, yes. The bikes are fairly hard to handle as you move up the classes (as it should be) and the tracks are actually kinda fun. However, they need to put the difficultly up to a point where you're doing well to be midfield on a midfeild bike. The AI drops around 1.5-2 seconds in race trim, while yourself can keep the same laptimes. Takes away from a lot of good battles. Frustratingly, in the wet, the game is horrible. No realism, too much grip (even on pro mode) and not enough sliding. Ruins all the positive points.
10330	Won't load at all; i should have read the forums before buying. WIndows 10 64 bit isn't supported? I can't tell...all forum recommended fixes don't work....reinstalling C++ no good; my version is newer. Copied .dll to game folder and still no change. I'll change this review if I ever get it to work...
10331	I was a bit dissapointed with this game from a visual level and also from a game play level. Its 2013 and the graphics for this game are just really really basic. Also everytime you lean into a corner it seems like a life time, especially when you go through the twisty parts of tracks. There is no visual damage at all and if you do fall of the motorcycle it dosent even break.
10332	Sorry, I even refunded this game to Steam after 2hours of gameplay.   The handling felt not real. I couldn't control the bike even I setup the bike exactly the same with the settings in MotoGP 14. I can win the race easily in MotoGP 14, but here I can't even control my bike. I don't know why, but the bike skidding too much.   So despite all the negative comments, bugs, &amp; all the minus of MotoGP 14,  MotoGP 14 is still the best! Much much better than the 13!! It brings out the rider spirit in you!!!  Can't wait for the 15...
10333	Milestone doesn't care about your feedback !
10334	This game is really glitchy! it gets really bad an screws you up!!!
10335	I usually give games at least 3 hours before I write a review about them. I could barely stand this game for 30 minutes. The graphics are out of date even for 2013, the sound of the motorcycles are terrible and the physics are F-ING HORRIBLE. I have driven motorcycles too. This is not even close to a motorcycle Sim. This game isnât even realistic to how a motorcycle reacts. I got this game for 5 bucks and 5 bucks is nothing. This game isnât even worth 5 bucks they should pay me to play this game again. Avoid this game. 3/10
10336	Worst MotoGP game of recent time...  Had that feeling from watching online gameplay vids.. only brought it because of the sale and ended up even worser than i thought.  Any of the last 3 MotoGP games are better in pretty much every aspect including the last one that milestone themself made back in '08... Yes the game made by the same company 5 years ago had better visuals, audio, gameplay, simulation... it even had better controller feedback.  The 1 thing that this game does better then other MotoGP games is the near crash/saves animations but seriously feels like that was all they spent their time on as everything else was comparable to motorbike games of 8 years ago  uhh hope they step it up for 14...
10337	Having played MXGP by the same developer, I was really REALLY looking forward to this game, must have hell good graphics I thought as I waited for the 5.5Gig install to download..........well what a surprise...with EVERYTHING set to maximum, it looked to be something from the mid-late 90's at best and as for the sound, well...how can I put this....imagine a very VERY p@#ssed off wasp trapped in a megaphone, underwater, inside a submarine, under a rock...that's what the sound is like. In fact what it actually reminded me of was a sound my OLD acorn electron used to make when I was playing Mars Lander (written in BASIC, by hand, one rainy Sunday afternoon) way back in around oh, say 1980! As for the rest, good physics but yeah, presentation killed it for me after only 37 minutes of playing, I just couldn't deal with it...........it looks NOTHING like the screenshots and they aren't that flas for a game that's only 2 years old! OK, so having had another loook, the graphics aren't QUITE as bad as I made out.........
10338	I used to love this series and assumed that not having played it for some years it would be so much better now and if I got a Motorcycle controller it would be more controllable. I don't usually put much store in reviews as they are always subjective and based upon the individuals experience, likes, dislikes, skill level etc. However, I wish I had taken notice of all the negative reviews on this one. Clearly the console version has been given all the development funding and the PC version left to rot and just there as a token gesture. graphics were better on my Amiga (may be pushing it s bit) but clearly not designed around PC Platform, mouse doesn't work as you would expect on menus etc. it is just horrid. Don't waste your money, I'm going back to my PS3 for this game.
10339	Good Good graphics.  Bad The game feels cheap(subjective).  Bike control are clumsy.   Verdict I was expecting newer Moto GP 3 URT. But Milestone are not Climax. And great Moto GP games are the ones made by Climax.
10340	This game is made by milestone, the game have less option for graphic settings and it is also the same for other racing games made by them. This make the game harder to play on moderate PC. The graphics quality are mediocre and it requires better graphics card.
10341	I auctualy ride, and feel the designers of this game have never even seen a real motorcycle before, otherwise they may have been able to make it auctualy handle like a real one. These bikes have no ability to turn, and you will spend more time on the ground then in the seat. the visuals will feel like your going maybe 10mph at most, and should be able to take a corner fine, but the speedo sais something like 130kph, and you will lay down the bike in almost every corner. WTF?!? I bought this game a few months back when it was on sale for about 3$, I finally was able to take a few minutes to play it. and spent most of the time trying to set up the bike to auctualy be able to take a turn. I regret even spending the 3$ on this pile of garbage. I played this searies Way back when i was a kid, I think their first or second game. And I remember having a blast playing it then, I guess they just lost their touch. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! it is a complete waste of money. I wish Steam had a refund program that went further back then a few weeks.
10342	Game crashes at track loading screen. researched the problem as much as I could and could not come up with any solution other than disabling audio, which playing a videogame without audio seems totally stupid. I am running Windows 10 with all current drivers and the high-end Nvidia graphics card. All of my specifications exceeded even the recommended level for this game. It simply would not work once you got to the track loading screen. To make matters even worse you cannot control alt delete to get out of this. I had to actually log out or force a hard power restart. With such little information regarding this problem and how to fix it I cannot in good faith recommend this game though it seems like it would be a very good one if I could get past this issue. I will likely be asking for a refund.
10343	seems i can not change controller deadzone and sensivity.....in a racing game.......oh dear developers. *facepalm*
10344	Well this hasnt aged well at all... Personally I wouldnt pay any more than a few Â£ for it and I cant really see myself investing any more time into it.
10345	Worst game ever... Basically the same as all the other motorcycle games where you can't control you're lean angle. You just CAN'T steer the bike properly due to the way the game is setup (no manual control over this either!) I have tried KB, game pad (Logitech rumblepad II) and a wheel. Nothing can overcome the lack of steering control.   The issue is... When cornering, your either on full lean angle or no lean angle.. Nothing in between is controlable, so holding the racing line or any line for that matter is impossible. Basically it's like driving a car around any angle of corner with either no steering lock OR full steering lock to choose from!  The game is impossible to exit too, you MUST finish your race before being allowed to exit. I needed to restart my computer on each occasion to exit the game fully. My computer is a top end self built machines and has no issues with any other programs including all the others in my 400GB+ Steam folder.  Wish I hadn't wasted the Â£9 on the special offer now!
10346	dont like this game controlles are bad graphics bad overall a bad game
10347	Shocking.  Bikes. Do. Not. Move. Like. This.
10348	Sound has problems. Whenever it is enabled the game will crash.
10349	Awful. Looks, feels &amp; acts like a really bad port.  Despite dual 7970s, lags frequently for no reasoning whatsoever.
10350	Why are you looking at the bad reviews? This game is awesome!!!
10351	Ugly graphics (a DX9 engine in 2013!) and jerky controls make this game eyetorturing unplayable, just give this one a pass.  Strangely, I have Superbike 2000 on cdrom from the same devs which looks and plays better considering it's a thirteen years older game.
10352	Well, if u look at the pictures, the graphics look nice, but they are actually â¥â¥â¥â¥, im not saying the game is bad, but the graphics look 10x better in the trailer. + u cannot use ur mouse, what is anoying af, and the control settings are weird af.  i do not recommend it, its a reason why its 85% off.
10353	This is by far the worst game I have ever played there is no tutorial, you can only select items with arrow keys and enter. The controls are strewn through the entire key board and I couldn't even get 30 seconds into a race before the game crashed. On start up the controls we're broken and everything went wrong. But by far a complete waste of money and time. You'd be better off playing bear simulator.
10354	Critic: The game it's a little bit hard to control, I am always falling off the bike. Graphics are not bad for a 2013 game. The tracks are good too.  Rating - 35/100  Conclusion: The rating was bad because the critic doesn't have good things in it, so I'm not recommending this game to you guys.
10355	Dont buy this game, it is waste of your hard owned money. Using arrow keys as steering makes it impossible to manouvering the bike naturally. Absolutely waste af hard owned money, and you time. Paying 40 Euro for this game is a joke ! 
10356	bad/10  * Bad controls * Bad Physics * Bad price (even on 90% off sale it is a rip) * Old game with a little paint on it * Not fun * Trainer does not work properly * Controler uses only 1 stick for leaning and steering. This is not a motorcycle simulator. It is not really a n arcade game either. * Sounds suck * Bad PC port   If you like bad games , you will love this one.  If you like motorcycle games I suggest MX VS ATV unleashed. You have one stick controlling the steering, and the other stick is for the riders weight shifting.  If you want streetbike raceing, Grand Theft Auto 5 has much more realisti controls, and physics than this 'game'.
10357	I'm using a laptop so I can't really play a lot of games. And I didn't know anything about refunding games when I bought this game.  I wanted to play the game even tho it was lagging (and I put my video settings on the lowest but it didn't work). I didn't have a controller so it was hard to control the vehicle.  then the next month my friend told me on how to refund games then I got mat because I can't refund it.
10358	Well. The Crew... I honestly was dying to get this game, and I dropped the $85 for the gold edition. I figured since I loved racing games to death that this would be the perfect fit for me. But boy was I wrong. I do have a lot of fun on it but beware, the car physics are horrible and the map is sub-par at best. You get this hype from looking at the game that it's going to be awesome with a gigantic map and tons of cities to drive through but then you get in and BAM, there's only 2 cities that are slightly like 10% close to the historic scale of it, and those two are LA and New York. The problems with those are they take up 1/4 of each region they're in. West Coast: 75% nothing, 25% LA. East Coast: roughly 40% New York and 60% Hills and forests. The handling in the game is sub-par too, which I kinda braced for knowing it was on a havok engine. But when you really get into it it's one of the single most disappointing things in the game. Most of the cars either handle like you're steering them with your feet or handle like you crank the wheel over on each turn even if you're trying to only follow slight contours in the road.   +The cars are nice +The map is still nice despite the major lack of any cities between New York and LA +Bonneville Salt Flats is acutally made to a barely historic scale (only for the speed area) +Street cars handle pretty well +Circuit cars are hilarious +Circuit Silverado +HUMMER  -Miserable offroad physics because of the vehicle flipping limitations, Raid car physics leave a lot to be desired -crash cutscenes are the most annoying things ever and tend to take ~15 seconds to go away -Missions are subpar at best -Campaign is linear and not even racing -some of the fastest cars in the game are some of the slowest performance cars (Koeniggsegg Agera R: 279 mph fullstock (amazing buff), and 219mph level 1299 perf tune. Real/recorded top speed: Nowhere near any of these at 263mph) -Between LA and New York the cities are horrible and very half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, 90% of the giant cities that rival LA are just represented as small towns (Dallas, Washington DC, etc...)  -A lot of major cities aren't even represented in the game (Houston, Phoenix, Glendale, Palm Springs [I know it's in the game but that's like one house, palm springs is a pretty nice place], Denver, etc..) -The game feels like minimal effort was put into it. --Crashes every 1-3 hours, usually during something important like the end mission or a skill --Graphics depend too heavily on shaders and shadowing, not real effort and modelling skills. -Cops are kinda annoying but really not bad any more, updates changed the police and made them hilarious golf balls for Hummers. -Tuning the H1 to Raid spec is horrible because it tunes it like a gas engine. The Duramax LLY diesel tuned to 600hp on a would NOT have only 700lb/ft of torque, it would EASILY be in the 4 digits (around 1,150ft/lb) for torque and it would be unstoppable. Work on diesel engines, then it gets my vote (granted it's an extremely small gripe because I still love the H1 to death ingame) -Mapping is horrible, around Black Mount there are patches of trees floating 5 feet off the ground and trees growing in the middle of the train tracks that the train just drives through, and in New York the storm gutters in the tunnels underground have no collision meshes and your wheels get stuck underground if you hit that area.  My personal thoughts on this is they should put it as an early access game, not a full release game. This release is just.. For lack of better word, it's just not good, it's an incomplete game marketed as a full game.  If they announce they have no plans to do any major revamps I would never recommend this to any of my friends. All in all, The Crew pretty much turned out to be exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be, and that is just another overhyped game that isn't worth the money, destroyed by Ubisoft forcing the game developer to cut a lot of corners and release a broken game  EDIT: My view of the game went up a lot with the addition of the Mini with a circuit tune and a Ford Focus with a Raid tune (the 2 funniest cars in the game now) There were plenty of updates after that but I have neglected to mention them, but it's still not worth paying the full price for, anyone interested should get it while it's on sale.  Another edit: They fixed a lot of the AI issues, the races are extremely easy to win now if you play your cards right. The cops are like golf balls for Hummer golfing.  Still not worth the price tag, though.  Thank you for reading.  The game is getting better but it still leaves much to be desired.  EDIT: 1/27/2016 Also since Wild Run released the game WILL NOT run AT ALL for some reason.  EDIT 11/23/2016 I fixed it and it runs fine, still the same issues and fun things though. Again, not worth the money whether or not it's on sale. UBIsoft even tried to give it away.
10359	Over time and what not, Ivory Tower corrected some of the issues. Corrections are written in  italic  after each section. Enjoy reading!  After more than 70 hours of playing this, this is what I observed:   'RACING-MMO'?  Announced as an Massively-Online-Multiplayer-Game, a single Session only holds 8 Players. ALSO: Uses NAT-Connection system. A player who is not in your region won't necessarily be able to join your session. The Crew  (Steam Worldwide) ? Yeah, sure.   (April 2015: They improved matchmaking, merged PvP-Lobbies and improved game hosting, it's basically faster now. No other sewere issues were changed online-wise.)    CARS:  This game holds a breathtaking amount of 27 cars + DLC cars. And they are not even available in every spec. Test Drive Unlimited 2 had 130, for comparison. They also handle next to nothing realistic. Muscle cars have better grip than a BMW. RWD, FWD or AWD? No difference either.  (March 2015: Handling SEVERLY improved, more and more specs got/get added every month. April 2015: More specs added, Raid DLC pack added.)    ENVIRONMENT:  Pretty neat. Animals. People. Cannot be touched but still a nice additon (That's Ubisoft Reflections for you there --&gt; Driver:SF). The Map is huge and even after 40 hours of normal play time you wont even have it explored half-way. Environment is a huge plus here. Very good. 7.8/10 because there's too much undetailed water.   (March 2015: Water updated, better reflections, realistic depth effects and more natural colours.) Yes, I am seriously criticizing water. It looked horrible back then, believe me.    TUNING:  Well, yes. Better than Rivals. Not as good as Underground 2. It's not bad compared to other recent racing games and you can tune your car just enough to be 'individual'. Severe Lack of stickers.   (March 2015: This game is OVERFLOWING with a giant variation of stickers!)    AI AND POLICE:  THE RUBBERBANDING IS REAL. Ivory Tower SERIOUSLY managed to make a rubberbanding system 1299 times WORSE than EA. It doesn't matter if it's a Crown Vic, F-150 or Corvette. Cop cars have astonishing speeds of up to 250mph (400kmh), weigh about 30 metric tons and can seemingly drive through traffic, other cop cars, YOU if they want to, and can make objects in their way such as fences merely DISINTEGRATE. Also, if you're too far away, they just fly to you. Really neat. It's impossible to outrun a bunch of Lexus Sedans with a high-end Ford GT. The cops either keep up with you for 20 minutes straight or magically stop chasing you after 10 seconds. Sometimes they jump. Sometimes they fall through the ground. But most importantly, a CROWN VICTORIA can just BRAKE and STOP in front of a HUMMER H1 WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY STOPPING THE 4 TONS HUMMER H1 IN UNDER A SECOND. Oh, and the cops bust you in like 3 seconds. Also: If you're under 30mph, you've got next to no chance of escaping the cops.   (March 2015: weight-Issue corrected! Police cars weigh about 1.5 tons as they should and you are able to escape them too, pursuits are A LOT more fun now. 3-second-bust not changed. Disintegration and teleporting still exists too.)    IN-GAME-MONEY:  Not enough. There's just not enough. Everything is overpriced, the game is almost dragging you towards its microtransactions. 40000 Crew Credits for 6$. You're not even able to buy a car with these 6$. 40000 is nothing. You can buy 4 good vinyls with that. Stickers.  ALMOST. THEY ALMOST HAD IT. IT WAS OKAY FOR LIKE A MONTH AND NOW THEY CUT THE FACTION REWARDS BY FRIENDS IN  HALF . RIDICULOUS. April 2015: YOU GET EVEN LESS NOW! WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥!    CONNECTIVITY:  As I mentioned before, terrible. NAT-based. Lag Simulator 2014. There's a pretty high chance you can not play with anyone outside of your region, depending on your NAT-type.   SERVERS:   Ubisoft    GRAPHICS:  Pretty good...? Textures not too great, and I'm not talking about the world. Your characters jacket looks like it's from Just Cause 2. No mirror reflections in first person mode. Alternate graphics in first person mode, increasing SSAO. Might cause frame drop on older graphics cards. Framerate absolutely awful compared to other games. Distant textures --&gt; Assassins Creed: Unity. Texture filtering? Not really.  This game is still unfinished.   IGNs 6/10 is completely justified. Polygons 4.5/10 is still justified. My rating below based on my listed points in this review:  MMO-Aspects: 4/10 Cars: 6/10 Environment: 9/10 Tuning: 6/10 AI and Police: 2/10 Online Features: 3/10 Graphics: 6/10  Overall: 5.1/10 (This was the initial release score I gave The Crew) 6.2/10 (Early March 2015) 5.4/10 (Early April 2015)   As you can see, the score didn't really improve much over time.  This game is in the Top 3 Worst Releases Of 2014 in my opinion. They are all Ubisoft. How depressing.   And yes, I'm kind of still playing it after writing this (negative) review. They continue to add more content (that should've been here by release but whatever) so that kinda keeps it going. Will edit each month or so.   I LIED. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS ANYMORE.  
10360	This game can be summed up into two words, 'Wasted Potential'.   The Good - Large detailed map than can be driven for hours on end with little to no repetition  The Bad -Sub par car selection -Car/Driver levels are pointless as all races/racers will scale to you - Cheap AI features that borders on cheating/hacking, they can move at impossible speeds, plow through obstacles with no slowdown, will rarely spin out while a slight nudge will send you flying -Bad navigation system, so many times the navigation system will point me to an off-ramp only to curve back onto the highway, or will direct me through obstacles including walls  Simply put this is a lazy attempt by the devs, they did not put proper effort to make this game fun. Instead they took the cheap way out and its more frustrating than fun. It is not an MMO. They intend to fix the problems but this is just another game that follows the disturbing trend of releasing unfinished games for full price then slowly fixing it to be what it should have been. I wish i could get a refund and spend the money once I see a REAL COMPLETE game but i guess i just have to hope they actually do what I paid for.  EDIT: Please remember the history of the game that when i wrote this review it was a buggy mess, there have been updates and changes to it but I for one am finished with this game for now.
10361	 Driving around the US is the best thing this game can offer.   I was looking forward to this title, and that makes writing this review even more disappointing, but I believe that the only pro of this game is that you can drive around a miniature version of the United States.  I will begin with what you are going to experience first - the physics are awful, and I mean it. It feels almost like it was not even meant to be a driving game. As for the next thing, The Crew also features a story - though most of the time, it is simply ridiculous and worse than Tommy Wiseau's The Room. And throughout said story, you are going to notice one little, yet rather important fact:  The Crew is not a racing game.  It is a game about driving from spot A to spot B under time pressure, or escaping the police, or perhaps winning a race to settle things down with your evil leader enemy rival who wanted to outright kill you, but then realised it would be a better idea to try and race together.  You are going to repeat the same missions over and over again, with the game cheaply giving you different reasons to do so each and every time. For example, it can tell you to go and crash into 80 randomly positioned boxes to ruin some dark, evil guys' delivery plans. And then, half an hour later, probably assuming you will have already forgotten by then, you will also have to crash into 80 randomly positioned boxes again because one of them is guaranteed to contain evidence you need to stop some dark, evil guys' plans to destroy the world. In short, it does not make any sense whatsoever.  But when the time comes and you get to a mission where you actually have to race your opponents, now that is the time to realise that it truly has nothing to do with racing. No matter how good you are, the other cars are always going to stick to your back. You can be flawless for the entire race, but they are always going to be right behind you. Then, you can make just one little mistake - or a school bus might spawn right in front of you, which is not unheard-of - near the end, and your race is entirely ruined.  Not to forget, as a little bonus, The Crew also features microtransactions.  Please do not get me wrong - the game has the potential to be fun if you are simply looking to drive around with your mates and do not care about how the car feels in the slightest. But it honestly sucks for everything else apart from that.
10362	Well, that was The Crew... After about 42 Hours ive seen the most things, beat the Campain and most of the Challenges.  I bought 'The Crew' with Hope for a Game that would be as entertaining as 'Test Drive Unlimited 2'. If you played that before, you will notice the similarity, many parts of TDU2 are also in The Crew.  Sounds good right? No, not at all. Short Pro+Contra List on bottom of the Review
10363	  do NOT purchase, even on sale!
10364	Season Pass + Gold preorder (64,99â¬), still have to pay for Wild Run DLC GUD GAEM  WP Ubishit
10365	After the FORCED 5.9gb wildrun update, game is unplayable. They locked the controls customization and they expect every player out there to play with the d,i,l,d,o controls they have assigned. .. nope, i can't do that. I've been playing for over 10 years with the layout I like to use, it's like telling Formula 1 pilot to jump into another F1 that is not setup for him ... uncomfy seat, pedals in wrong place ...etc.  Just not happening, I'm no longer playing or supporting this game. Something as small as locking the controls can destroy the game. GG ubisoft ... as expected they don't have much brain nowdays. Why would you even include 'controls customization' if you can't customize? I mean some stuff works, but some stuff is locked, the locked part is VITAL to me and it cannot be changed, very bad. Useless game, hope they go bankrupt.  Also new update made grass look like out of a cartoon. Speaking of online, it's very bugged. When trying to play with friends, it keeps disconnecting and friends keep disappearing on map, you see their name, but not the car or they disappear completely and then it complains that 'can't join session' or some other bs like that.  On top of all that, at some point entire coop and PvP was unavailable and Ubisoft was blaming steam servers for this, how can it be STEAM servers, if this is a 3rd party game? It doesn't even run on steam, you can purchase and download via steam, but servers are hosted by Ubisoft.  Ubisoft is very bad and untrustable company, they lie and deceive and scam. They show you one thing, but release something completely different.  Also savegame is 100% server sided, If it corrupts (which it does sometimes), then only way to fix this, is to contact ubisoft support and it takes them 1-3 months to reply to tickets. I was literally stuck for 3 months, because my savegame was stuck on loading and their support took 3 months to reply (not over reacting, literally 3 months).  Concept is nice, map is huge, but entire game is very badly executed and nearly no support, Ubisoft is money greedy company and all they care about is money, they don't care about gaming experience. I don't recommend this to real gamers, it might look like a cool game, but after bit of playing it gets' very irritating and frustrating to deal with bad support and all those bugs and glitches.
10366	 I was escaping the police pursuit. Suddenly one of police cars started to ram me (on speedhack of course) and when he touched my car we both started to fly reeeeeally high. I landed in the middle of the forest &amp; the police car landed 2 meters near me. He blocked my way out (well, I couldn't move either because I had Street spec car), arrested me and then the lady in the police radio said '5+, very good work'. Yes! Very good work Ubisoft. Welcome to The Crew.    Pros:
10367	buy the game  buy 'THE PRE ORDER OF' season pass or complete edition expecting for some important content.  wait a year for new content because season pass only give u â¥â¥â¥â¥ so far.  u need buy a new content even if u have season pass or complete version.  well done ubiSHIT
10368	For the most part I can IGNORE the BAD BAD BAD AWFUL AFWUL cop chases, car customization and stuff but I bought this game for my friend HOPING that we can play together. Never ever had it crossed my mind that my friend and I CAN'T PLAY TOGETHER this so called MMO. Pure crap! And the 50 euro price tag is a cruel joke. I can't begin to say how sorry I am to have payed for this game.
10369	Don't forget to visit the police shop! You have a free police car waiting... as long as you pay $30 first.
10370	Breaks rule #1 of racing games: Rubber Band AI. If I'm ahead of you, and I'm going flat out, you shouldn't catch me in 5s.
10371	It could have been such a wonderful game. The idea is solid, the map and community/social aspects are fantastic, but Ubi really screwed up some pretty major details.   The car handling, as I'm sure you'll read in a thousand negative reviews, is terrible. 260 km/h feels like 100 km/h, rivals and NPC racers seem to rip around the track like they're on rails, and they have absolutely no problem pushing you out of the way while you struggle to change their course even slightly.   The raid events are frustrating, as the vehicle seems to swap ends for what looks like no reason. Off road, every vehicle handles like butter on a hot skillet.   It could have been good, but I think I'm going to turn my Xbone on and stay with Forza. Maybe Ubi should play Horizon 2 and take a page or three from it.
10372	  If you get TL;DR syndrome then skip down to 'Verdict of The Crew' but I encourage you to read the specifics so that you can accurately judge if this game is right for you.      First Rule of The Crew:
10373	-Sir, the game is ready, it's friggin'' awesome, we can release it ! -Woh, woh, woh awesome you said ? Do you know who are you working for ? -yes, Ubisoft. -Right, and what's our reputation ? -Being the best at screwing up good game concept and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off our customers ? -Exactly ! Now this game has many flaws but none of them are really frustrating -Indeed, that's why we created Uplay back then -Not enough son, not enough. I want the whole team in the crisis room in 5 minutes  (gathering the team and explaining the situation)  -Sir, I got an idea -Sure go ahead -Well why don't we force the player to connect to a main server ? -Many games do that, not really frustrating. -True, but we would require the player to be constantly connected -ooooh, that's good, I like it -And the main server would be super instable and people would be kicked from the game at anytime, loosing their progression ! -Genius, I promote you president of Ubisoft.  EDIT : You guys say it's a MMO ? Do you actually know what MMO stands for ? Just the first 'M' ? You'll interact with 8 players max. at a time...holly molly, that's massive !  Ubisoft used the term MMO for marketing purpose only, there's isn't a single solid reason to prevent us from playing this game in SP.
10374	Its 4 AM so take this review with a grain of salt.  Summery: Not an MMO! Never more than 8 players per session! Micro-Tranactions! Cop chases are a joke Cop cars are tanks (compleately different physics than normal cars) Opponent AI is BAD Not NEARLY the custemization that NFS games used to have in the 90's!!! Uplay Non-existent tuning Binary progression Chat system is never used   Rant: '6k people are currently playing The Crew' and yet, I'm forced to play single player half the time. The way the pregression system is set up, people who have already compleated the missions you are working on have no reason to help because they have already unlocked the part that you earn for compleating the mission.Not to mention that those 6k people that are currently in game are devided up into 8 player lobby/sessions which means that you will almost NEVER run into another player unless you are going out of your way to do so. Currently the chat system isn't used by anyone, and so the game just feels like a giant single player game. I repeat, this game is NOT AN MMO, its a single player game that wants to be an MMO but doesn't know what its doing.  The Crew also has annoying, easy to fix flows that you don't see in older games like NFS carbon. In its current state the game is unfinished and needs a lot of work.  The one thing that really grinds my gears is that I bought the game for $60, and yet ubisoft wants me to spend more money on crew credits. Why is it that you pay $60 only to be met with micro-tranactions. Ubisoft, STOP IT!!!  Edit: Alright, now that I've gotten some sleep, I should mention that the game is still a lot of fun, and compaired to other modern racing games that I've played this one is my favorite, it still has some things that need to be fixed, buts its fun never the less.  Driving across the massive map is awesome Took me 120 minutes to drive from one side to the other Custemization is good compairitively speaking Once you reach level 20+ drifting around corners is a blast  I have high hopes for the game, and I hope that eventually we will be able to play with more people. in my opinion its not worth $60 at the moment, but if it goes on sale or gets a major update that might change.
10375	This game is basically 'how to not make a good racing game 101'  1. Auto catch up 2. AI is over tuned to try and make up for the players ability to use cars 'over the cap'  a) cops are unstopable all seeing terminators and getting away from this is more chore than skill  b) it literally ignores the in game physics  c) uses non spec (street,dirt, perf) cars perfectly in any situation Perf car on dirt? No problem, you however won't stop being sideways 3. The game at points forces you to use sub par spec cars because 'story' which are usually just time trials with an annoying npc yelling at you 4. PvP is waiting in a queue to never getting into the game 5. co-op is just two people suffering through a race and most the time even if someone pulls up next to you in the same race they'll just ignore the co-op request 6. Overly expensive cars with arbitrary limitations on what can and cannot be certain specs 7. Raid spec activities are just awful 8. car spec designs are generic and the for purchase asthetics don't fix much 9. If you do manage to find someone in co-op then the lag shows up pretty bad  10. world is flat and uniteresting until cars randomly pop in and you crash  If you're on the fence about buying this game don't do it. Just wait until GTA 5 comes out on PC and play GTA Online because it's superior in every way.
10376	Updated at 9/1/2015, Status update   Appearently I have written too much, please click  HERE  [puu.sh]  or  HERE(doc)  [puu.sh]  for the full review
10377	For a game advertise as an 'MMO' for cars it's quite sad that you have only a limited number of person by instance (something around 8 person).  The car choice is nice, if you like muscle car and exotic. But there is also a serious lack of diversity (2 asian car, that is really not much). We should have iconic car that was used in rally racing, audi quattro, mitsubishi evo (at least one), a subaru STI (at least one also), the first mini, toyota celica. Also we are missing nice super/hyper japanese car (no nissan GTR R35 really ?, no Lexus LFA)  The car customisation is quite poor also, we have a lot of choice for the starter car but not so much for the rest of it.   The driving experience is cool though driving through the whole united states with friends is quite nice.  I would still recommend this game, but not at this price.  
10378	Where to start ? ...   I gave my hope away on this game, I was expecting so much and it disapointed me. Such a great map, good graphics and simcade driving, was everything I was looking for, to play with some friends, I was hoping with the updates they would fix the majority of bugs, and add some new stuff to the game, but no. So far I think they released the beta version on the game, sometimes I even think the beta had less bugs then now, lol ..   Pros : - Great map, it's really awesome; - Graphics are good; - Cockpit view, the interiors are well designed; - Simcade driving is fun; - Many specs ( Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Circuit ).  Cons: - Lack of cars, only 47 fullstock cars (if I'm not wrong.); - Exterior car custimization is just poor:  - 200 rims ? And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors.   - The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.  - Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them; - The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against. - Cockpit view:  - When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.  - In cockpit view your mirrors don't work; - AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down.  - Some of the game physics are just out of this world:  - You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.  - You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h; - PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly. - In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.  (...)  And there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to 'farm' money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week. Because you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.  Should you buy the game? Yes/No. - Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted. - No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this.   To me this was the most expensive 'early-acess' that I've ever bought.
10379	While I have had an amazing time playing this game, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Ubisoft support is lacking on a good day, downright rude and dismissive on bad.   At the time I write this, I'm 9 days late recieving a Crew-Credit pack, while their store is still up selling them.  Also world records on every skill challenge/mission is held by hackers, so there's no recognition for actually doing well.
10380	Edit (2016) They have sold a 'complete edition' when there is more content on the way, so you can pay once for the game with the season pass, pay again for the content that doesn't come in the season pass, then pay one more time for more content not included to be released. To hell with this game.   Edit (4/25/2015) : They added a few new cars and some specs, fixed some bugs and managed to improve the main menu with a slideshow and the online matchmaking with a merge-all lobby system. Perhaps it's enough of a change for you to enjoy this game? Me, I checked and played the 'new' content for a few hours and unninstalled it again, personally I can't find any improvement worth a buyback into this game since my gripe is the terrible driving mechanics alongside the bad physics. I remain true to every word I wrote in this review.   I had high hopes for this game, I played the betas, followed the forums and pre-ordered it. Then I forced myself to like it and play it even after I was completely frustrated by everything I'm about to say.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE AND/OR PRICE TAG.  Before the ugly : THE CREW is not a complete mess, there is the possibility of having a great amount of fun playing this game depending on what kinda of player you are. One thing it gets right is the map diversion. Every spot, every city or zone as they say, has it's own feeling and design, it's unique, and driving around the map with a friend is sure entertaining. but that's it. if you're not the person who enjoys cross country trips or american cars, there is not much for you here.   Entitled as 'MMO CAR-PG' but you can't develop your character, not a single aspect. In theory, every player has the same exact character, solution? Let's hide other player's driver. and that's it. Let's say you play against remote controlled cars, for immersion's sake. you CAN'T call it an mmo, without character development, the best you'll get are perks, nothing really groundbreaking. but we have cars, don't we?  There are 30~40 cars and all of them seem unfinished, except for the first ones. because you know, 'first impressions are always the most important'. the first five cars have all the specs available, street, dirt, performance, raid and circuit. other cars usually have 2~3 specs only. so you wanna go crazy off road with that expensive car? too bad. also, most cars are American, so no luxury here. what's most stupid is the unbalanced performance cars have, the starter vehicles run faster then the most expensive car in the game.   But driving gets better as your car and player level increases, right? No. That's an excuse for the handling in the game. It doesn't get better. I have 1299 ( Max level ) cars and with assistance off, they just don't grip on the road as the default low level mustang does. With assistance on, it's just 'drifting'. The crew should have stayed as a street racing game only, the street tracks are okay, the handling on street is OK. but when it goes off-road becomes soap ( and not in a good 'Dirt game' way of soap ), on circuit the game just doesn't have enough decent physics to feel solid, and while climbing mountains with raid spec... I wish you good luck trying not to roll 900Âº in the air after hitting that small rock. this game is unpredictable thanks to it's physics, you never know how is your car going to react to crashes so expect for the worst and try avoiding collisions. worth adding : some elements break, some doesn't, and in this game this is not okay because when someone tries to cut their way trough some houses, the fences breaks. When you're doing the turn on a corner, well, the fence it very likely to be the most solid virtual object you'll ever find.   Progression is BROKEN, I had to try various missions at least three times due to disconnects that WIPED my progress, my statistics are currently like this ' main missions complete : 167% ', and the rewards are ridiculously unbalanced. Let me explain this : I leveled from 1 to 50 in ONE DAY AND A HALF doing no more than 60 PvP matches, 10 or so story missions and some exploration. Yes, I reached maxed level on an MMO in basically a day. It gets better, I was being rewarded 16k bucks every time I finished first on a PvP match, and when you are disqualified because you couldn't get to the finish line in time, well, TAKE THESE 16K BUCKS ANYWAY. You just know they didn't really put any thought into the game's progression when all it takes from level 49 to 50 is 2 races in 10 minutes.   The customization feels incomplete, some categories are there with no parts to purchase for you car, get used to the 'No part available in this category' message. the stickers are single color only and there isn't variety among those, expect to see everyone using the same 2 flame stickers or racing stripes. the real car performance parts are available with a grind of challenges after level 50 which is not very cool given the insane difficulty of some challenges, but don't worry, it doesn't matter how fast your car is... AI CHEATS, it goes off track and spawns in front of you, It rams you constantly and the Catch-up is ridiculous. there are some gifs on Polygon's review of the crew if your interested.   The story is not good, you bounce trough one generic dialog to the next and I couldn't connect to any character of this game, I couldn't care less to be honest and not skipping cutscenes was a challenge at times. At the end of the main story you are rewarded with a mix of every CGI they made for the game, which felt very very lazy.  And I could go on, there is the server instability problem, the always online 'DRM', the NAT problem that causes online atrocities, the lack of mirrors promised by launch, no weather system, the 'crew joining different lobbies' bug, the 'Hitting someone back at 20mp/h and flying like when hit by a giant on skyrim' bug, the 'I regret the money I spent buying this game' case and the first time I actually emailed steam support to ask about their refund policy.   I'm frustrated. I just wish I could go back to those TDU2 Times.   tl;dr  + Every area is unique and has it's own feeling. + Driving with friends can be fun  Edit (4/25/2015) : - A 2014 Racing game Lacking mirrors, promised by launch - Server instability, constant disconnections and progress Wipes - AI CHEATS - Incomplete customization ( Specs were added ) - Not a great amount of cars ( Cars were added )  - Unbalanced car performances - Terrible car handling - Physics make for an unpredictable game - Broken progression system - Broken statistics system - Unbalanced reward system - Outdated graphics ( They fixed DoF at some camera angles ) - Fake car engines - No photo mode - Cliche, generic storyline - Only 7 players on Screen - Season Pass could have been part of the game  - TERRIBLE Online pvp lobby system ( Now fixed )
10381	THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH $70 dollars, I'd pay $20 bucks for this piece of crap. This is NOT the game we were advertised, the videos displayed showed a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fuctioning game with legitimatly good looking races. Cons= -Only 40 cars -cars are unbalanced, a 1967 chevy impala can apparently catch a 2013 ferrari, every nissan car dousn;t even have a top speed in this, and those cars that do have a top speed all have the same top speed save for a 10km here and there, example, 2011 mustang has 240km, BMW z4 250km, camaro 250km for both old and new. -A.I are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, cars are super unbalanced when the A.I is driving, so many times I have seen a golf hit 300km an hour in less than a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing eye blink, and their made of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing adamantium, ford raptor beats a ferrari in speed but a ferrari knocks the raptor off the track like it was nothing, and the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cops, dousnt matter whether you have dirt tyres or road cops hit their top speed anywhere, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing going vertical up a mountain, and they are always faster and beat your â¥â¥â¥ till you cry -crew system broken, everytime I hop on my buddies are auto ejected from the crew and I must add them again and vice versa, and most time the invites and mission invites don't go through. -â¥â¥â¥â¥ing story sucks, save lives and stop crime through street racing, â¥â¥â¥â¥ off, we had enough of the rehashed â¥â¥â¥â¥ with the fast an furious films -â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Uplay, steam has to download the Uplay launcher to verify that you own the games, like they don't trust steam security, and so they can ram â¥â¥â¥â¥ from their other games down your throat, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing check the news for the crew on steam, there is none, you open the page and the two most recent things is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing apology basically for how â¥â¥â¥â¥ unity was and the other is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing advertisement for computer parts, guess what Uplay/american gaming companies, not all you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing customers are american, more than half live in Australia and other english countries and more also in countries like india, no one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cares about america, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥, you cram your â¥â¥â¥â¥ stained propaganda down every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing countries throat, jsut once I would like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game that is based in england or preferably australia, or just a game that was developed in another country, sick and â¥â¥â¥â¥ig tired of american corporations â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ down the throats of consumers and saying their welcome, â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU CORPORATE â¥â¥â¥â¥ NUGGETS!!!!!  Pros= -it's free roam...  Am not ashamed to admit I bought a game for a lot of money and it was complete â¥â¥â¥â¥, just another â¥â¥â¥â¥ up like watch dogs, seriously this is a major gaming company and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minor or unknown gaming companies can make better games in their basements like warframe, I don't know who â¥â¥â¥â¥ing made it but they must not be a big company if they did't ram their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ logo down our throats, and warframe is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ cost 70 bucks, or 87 for me in australia, so not worth it, bigger disapointment than an ebola outbreak. May god have mercy on Uplay, and whatever â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mongoloid decided to release this game. And to all game developers, STOP RELEASING UNFINISHED GAMES, â¥â¥â¥â¥ ALL THE LITTLE KIDS THAT WANT IT NOW, APPEAL TO YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE, HOLD THE GAME OFF UNTIL IT'S COMPLETE THEN GIVE IT TO US, GAME DEVELOPERS USE TO TREAT US THE CONSUMERS AS ACTUAL PEOPLE, NOW THEY TREAT US ALL LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WALKING MONEY BAGS, NOT ALL OF US CAN AFFORD TO BUY YOUR GAMES AND WHEN WE MANAGE TO SCROUNGE TOGETHOR ENOUGH TO BUY IT WE EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD, I'D RATHER HAVE A SPIDEY MONKEY â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOWN MY THROAT WHILST HAVING MY BALLS PULLED THROUGH A WOOD CHIPPER.
10382	Welcome to The Fabulous The Crew,where if you want to actually have everything it has to offer you will need to buy the game 3 times,1 for the actual game,2 for the season pass,for the cars and stuff and 3 for the wild run expansion because without it you cant have the drift spec,and you want the drift spec,don't you?  You will encounter a lot of bugs and glitches on your way,but dont worry,you can send a ticket to ubisoft,they will respond to it...someday,THEY ARE UPDATING THE GAME! to add a new car that comes in the season pass  Lets not forget about our competitive level racing lobbies where there is one car,and there is one spec that you gotta use if you wanna win,the legendary Perf Laferarri,because everyone knows that if you enter a lobby,there will be at least 1 guy with a laferarri,and you know what happens when a guy takes laferarri? everybody takes laferarri.  Have fun with the game,10/10 would get a refund and buy NFS 2015 instead
10383	So, Ivory Tower. A good studio. Exept, they are managed by Ubisoft, and that means problems. I have the season pass for The Crew, and it did not come with Wild Run (Â£14.99) or the newest DLC Calling All Units (Â£19.99). Now, am I now entitled to take a poo on their doorstep? The season pass only comes with the DLC's that are much cheaper than these new ones. Also the previous large DLC which was Wild Run did not support all of the cars, and the reason for the game having a mostly negative review space is that the game studio is owned by Ubisoft, and Ubisoft have a known reputation for releasing DLC, sorry, WAY TOO MUCH DLC, for a game that feels incomplete without it. It feels as if the updates for this game have been payed for and added in a DLC form, now this game is actually quite a good one, exept for the overpriced nonsense.
10384	Wild Run Update: WR is out and after a few hours with it I can safely say that literally none of the concerns I have stated below has been fixed, in fact the game has gotten noticeable worse including, but not limited to:  The new vehicles included in this expansion are even more expensive in the in-game money/real life bought money conversion. While a high-end car would set you back roughly 15-20 euros/dollars(!) in the original game, the new high-end cars will be over double that. You're looking at almost 40(!!) euros/dollars for a single car and that is without any upgrade which will easily be another 20 euros/dollars if you don't have 3-4 hours to grind the in-game money for it! Also they included something called 'Smart loot' which instead of having you travel around to certain areas of the map for challenges, you can now instead just do the same challenge over and over and over again for 5 hours and eventually you'll have your fully upgraded cars. The new extreme modes, monster trucks, bikes and drifting are essentially gimmicks that will be fun for roughly an hour.   The idea around The Summit is on paper a good idea but the execution of it is probably one of the worst ideas in a while. I could go into why at lenght but just know that unless you are ready to spend several hundreds (Yes, no joke) of hours in the game, it will leave you feeling unfulfilled and that you've wasted your time because The Summit requires you to compete against other players and only the best gets rewarded properly. I could go on and on and on, with how the side walks in the game are now actual edges that will make you car fly randomly or how drifting is 90% like driving in the snow in the vanilla game or how the game is so poorly optimized that the wet roads will make your computer stutter (Even on a 980 Ti!) and how the graphical update overall is a complete disappointment and the thousand other things I haven't mentioned.  I'm going to have to stop writing here as I realize the more I think about it, the more I am actually going from thinking that the game was an okay game to directly hating it and regretting this purchase full stop.  The Crew and The Wild Run could've been so much more but instead we got this...   Original game review:  I tried being positive about this game, but in the end I can't justify it from a gameplay perspective. I like exotic cars a lot which is what has kept me at this game for so long, but I doubt a lot of people have my level of 'addiction' to exotic cars to justify it and end up disappointed in the game. Be aware that this is an arcady game, so if you're looking for a realistic simulation game, this is not it.  The traffic is poorly implemented so if a player in your session has a bad connection, the traffic will swerve left and right and it will be hard to overtake.  The max number of players in a FreeDrive session is capped at 8 which in 2015 is hilariously low for a game so heavily focused on multiplayer. In addition to that, you have no control over what session you end up in. And that is without going into the required always-on DRM that will eventually happen to kick you out of the game (That is a promise) that will set your progress back 5 to 45 minutes.   The graphics are mediocre and everything in the world except player cars looks like something that was made in 2010. The sound is bordering on the ridiculous (Sorry UbiSoft, but a Koeniggsegg does not sound like a BMW with a custom exhaust) and the forced disconnect if you are AFK for 10 minutes (You are returned to the start Splash screen, not even disconnected where you parked your car before going AFK) gives this game a overall poor immersion.  The price decrease came too late and the game population has sort of fizzled out - That being said, it was briefly revived by the announcement of the upcoming expansion pack and the 2 hour trial. A trial that was poorly implemented. When you play the trial you meet people which makes this game a lot better, but by the end of the trial people are straight up disconnected with no chance of saying anything to the other drivers the person was driving with - The only way around this is to add them to your UbiSoft friendlist - But good luck remembering the names of the players!  The game gets grindy real fast. The laughable short story does not reward you in any way towards a full upgraded car, nor does it provide you enough cash to have an acceptable level of cars with upgrades. The game essentially forces you into buying in-game cash for real money to a gross extent. 20 euros will roughly be the equivalent of 5 hours of gaming.   Speaking of Euros, having encountered a bunch of Americans in the game they have proudly told me that they pay in dollars instead. In UbiSoft's world 20 euros = 20 dollars.  If you ignore all of the above and you spend the 30 euros/$30 just to cruise around and complete the main story the game is fine.  However, if you know cars you will cringe. If you're a completionist you will burn out fast as the game has Tetris levels of variety in gameplay.  With all that being said, will I continue to play it just for cruising around in the single car I spend 15 hours to upgrade fully? Yes, I probably will.

10386	I will start this by saying i have been playing racing games for many many years.  Really dont have very much to say but. This game sucks and dont buy it. One thing the police cars. They go as fast as any car i have tried. Doesnt make any sense ~500 hp r34 no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing problem just speeds past you. And the NPC racers. My car was lvl 165 an NPCÂ´s car was 153 still dominates at the straights without using nitro.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ i cant even write anymore on this. So â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of.
10387	1 - Crashes everywhere, since release date, and you will be punished when game crashes in PVP (you lose League Points), because you leave the game while playing PVP. Sounds fair, no?  2 - Let's remember that false marketing: a world full of players at the same time. What we see is a session with 8 players  3 - Some awards (in-game challenges) reset for no reason. Even with monthly updates, still broken
10388	I wanted to love it, and I thought I did. Little did I know, I was in denial. In the trailer, they made it seem like you could roam around and see hundreds of people driving different cars. This wasn't the case, because 1) There are like 12 cars in the game, so no one has anything different. If you're used to Forza 4 or Horizon, don't buy this. 2) There aren't any massive servers. There are only 8 cars roaming around including yourself.  Overall, I'd give this game a 6/10. It's really fun for the first two days; I'll give it that. Once you finish those two days of cruising, it gets boring. It gets to be a pain to play. It becomes a grind to get what you want, which wouldn't benefit you in the long run anyway because unlike Forza, where certain cars have more potential, you can take a 370z and make it faster than a Pagani Huayra, both in handling and speed.  And the AIs. Oh my god... The AIs. They're not part of the physics engine. If your car is one point behind the 'recommended level' they leave you in the dust. If your car is one point within range of being too low, you leave them in the dust. It's not even about skill.  This is my first time leaving a review, so I'm not sure if you guys can message me or not. If you can, feel free to ask a question about the game. Message me.  Once again, 6/10.
10389	I was fooled with promise of open world and MMO style racing, instead, I recieved closed quarters and microtranactions. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing microtransactions. It's a cancer.
10390	Pay full price for a game, and they still want you to pay for the best cars. I will never recommend a cash grab of that nature. Yes, you can purchase some of the cars with in-game money. But of course the best (most fun) cars require cash-only purchases.   I actually enjoy the game and will continue to play it. But I will NEVER recommend it to my friends.
10391	'You couldn't join crew'  #ForeverDriveAlone
10392	'The Crew' is supposed to be advertised as this revolutionary 'Always-Online' MMO car racing game that many people have been sitting around for years to be made. It delivers an exciting experience when read on paper, however when actually excuted makes for a sloppily made game which show obvious signs of outdated programming, and included with it an even archaic attempt to jump into the racing genre a few years too late.   The ideas presented for this game are fantastic, an always online MMO where people can join crews and race against each other representing their gang, crew or team. (Basically whatever you want to call it.)  The main problem lies in the focus that the game progression system, driving mechanics, progression system and general programming are flawed in so many ways it makes me wonder what year they drafted this game in before they took it to the crafting table.   Design wise, the game's success is at the core of it's pitch. The 'Always online racing MMO car game that thrives while you are offline' with a 'Progression system of great detail and complete customization'. The game focuses hard on trying to give users a feeling that the world moves on without them, and you can visibly see this in (what should be) other players actively driving around the map going objective to mission points while in active traffic along side you.   Theme wise, it catches the feel of Detroit decent well, but sadly seems more or less like a rip-off towards other racing games themes that tend to stick with the south-central LA area and Detroit (Generic East Coast Theme.) There's no variation in location until the later portion of the game, and for the most part you will only see major shift changes in the locale when you move away from Detroit when you move across central USA, the dirty south, the pacific northwest, and the southwest.   The map's design is heavily (and for the most part completely) based on the idea of the whole USA as a driveable entity. It's lacking point however is that there's little to no detail outside the area of Detroit, and similarly detailed areas tend to stay grouped up within each other leaving huge spans of empty road between the different regions. (Example : Central US, Between Detroit and Florida).  Progression wise, the game tries to give users a sense of calm as progression unlocks aren't solely limited to 'street races'. Other goals lead to stunt jumps, checkpoint races and time attack objectives. These types of objectives spark the inner racer within all of us who prefer to beat personal times, which is great for some users. However, because progression is done with small objectives in mind to 'Level' up your car to qualify for specific races, you'll spend more time driving frustratingly difficult time attack, check point, and stunt jump objectives due to the lack of responsive and 'actually useable' car handling.   Car handling is heavily tied to progression as the cars at early levels drive akin to that of an ice cube sliding on the ground. The cars when driven at their base level tend to be very unresponsive at the least, and you're more then likely to spin out regardless of whether or not you slow down at a corner properly or use the emergency breaks. Early game progression unlocks help ease this problem, however like I said before, you will spend a huge amount of time on small unlocks to truly level up your car to it's max potential. The pitch for this is that higher level cars are more responsive, and thus drive better.   Mechanically speaking, the game runs well for what we've seen of it's previously noted issues. (Previously in beta, the animations were directly tied to the frames of the game data). Now that full 60fps support is 'Unlocked' in the options, the lack of speed that users claimed to have in the beta is completely gone. You now have a complete sense of speed when you throttle your car above 100mph. *(160kh/m for you other homies out there.)* However, optimization in this game and it's calculation of physics and other players tend to take the game's performance below the 60fps region when in heavy traffic, but never drops below 30fps. *Hint hint* None the less, setting the graphics down in this game will tend to ease the wrath of traffic, of the obvious drawback of image quality. In addition, there are still flaws with the animation which obviously give away the fact the game was from the start developed with 30fps in mind. (Which isn't entirely a big problem, however when you play games like this which rely on user input, the resonsiveness and feeling the user gets while playing is the biggest selling point in how the game performs on a face level.)   **Plot**  I'm not going to say much, so far from what I've experienced the story seems akin to most standard street race movies.  You are the brother to the leader of an infamous street racing gang called the 510. One day he needs you to follow him to a meet up, brother is shot and you get framed as the murderer. Fast forward five years, in an effort to clear your name and find your brothers killer, and the crooked cop who framed you for the murder, you proceed to work for the FBI to rise the ranks and bring justice back to the streets.  Simply put, not exactly the best writing, character development for the lead character is non-existent and the progression of the prologue goes by so fast I honestly thought there was another beginning section I had skipped beforehand.   Multiplayer wise, you're more likely to have more fun playing with the CPU then you do with actual players. Missions introduced throughout the game have two options for execution. You have the ability for solo gameplay which allows you to compete against computer opponents and progress through the game. (The only real MMO online element begins here.)   For actual multiplayer, lobbies are formed via missions when you select the option to 'race online' for that specific mission. Users are then paged, and/or formed based on who are currently doing the mission and are gathered from that method. Users past that area, or users who have not progressed to that specific portion of the game typically do not respond or bother to play online due to the lack of users because of inconsistency with progression. Half the time you will spend it again, with the CPU racing offline. With a majority of your online experiences happening at the higher levels where non-mandatory race missions are more freqent and people will be fully utilizing the 'Crew' feature more.  Overall, the game is a fun chuckle. It has it's flaws, and could be a great game with fixes. Due to it's limited playability however, and it's very difficult progression system combined with a linearly designed multiplayer it falls short on the expectations created for it at it's announcement. Did Ubisoft deliver what they promised? Partly.  The game however is far from complete. For this, I have to give it a thumbs down. A game in general should be well fleshed out especially past it's multiple alpha, and beta stages which had the ability for vast numbers of user input. At this point in time it should be moderately well developed enough to not show this many flaws.   I've already spent my money, and I'll continue to play it to see how development progresses. At this current point and stage from it's inital release from CORE features that were already planned for the game and is executed in it's fullest, there's no telling what can happen.  tl;dr it's a rushed poor mans version of need for speed before EA became return of the sith
10393	This game should have not have been $60. With all the DLC, it is such a shameless money grab. Just to buy certian motorcycles, you need to own TWO DLCs! TWO! Each being $25. And it's not like you unlock them once you get both DLCs... YOU HAVE TO GRIND THE MONEY UP FOR THEM! Seriously, this game has gotten sad. I was excited to get the new cars in the game, but for some reason, you need the 'Calling All Units' DLC to buy these, EVEN IF THE CARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DLC! Just shameful...
10394	Paid for a bundle only about 2 months ago or so (which cost more than 'The Complete Edition' which comes with everything INCLUDING 'The Wild Run) that was The Crew Gold with season pass and I don't get The Wild Run?! I want my money back!
10395	The game is fun, The racing is just arcadey enough to be fun and just as real to be a challenge in close matchups.The multiplayer aspect is cool but currently not an 'MMO'.   Community manager Natchai_Ubisoft on the forums said 'you'll currently have a maximum of 8 per session ' and to me that's bull. I paid for an MMO racing game not forza horizon with a bigger map and less people. So if you're looking to get this for the social side and expect to constantly be talking to people or bumping into others who want to tear down the highway it's kind of a bust. I am indecisive but my end decision is going to be not recommended because of the lack of MM in an MMO game
10396	This Review is heavily outdated but I'll give you the summary of how the game is now.  -Traffic exists and is always annoying in free-roam. [Shout out to the downhill drifters in the mountain state smashing into buses on every corner] -The servers are trash and sessions barely work most of the time. -New Car releases being only buyable via microtransaction currency is garbage for a game that's dying, which means Ivory Tower and Ubisoft are trying to get as much as possible from this game's whales. -Physics are awful -Customization is still awful and isn't being expanded on other then condensing categories of existing elements. -Monster trucks were a mistake.[Wasted Development Time] -Who the hell wanted bikes?[Wasted Development Time] -Shader revamp still isn't good enough, the car headlights are dying flashlights that barely light up anything. -Race track lamps don't cast light (what the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ivory Tower?) So it's dark as hell with your awful car lights. -Most previous issues about the game still exist like barely anything to do other then drifting (Which you have to buy the wild run for) (Wild Run DLC is literally 'Buy this if you want to drift and have actual fun') -Drifting isn't as good as it could be (Because you can't edit anything about the handling of the car apart from RNG Parts WHICH THEY MADE EVEN HARDER TO GET.) -Rx7 was put in for ridiculously high prices to force more Microtransactions.  gg Ubisoft edgelords being incompetent still. Ivory Tower you can do better then this â¥â¥â¥â¥, c'mon. _____  [OLD REVIEW BEFORE WILDRUN]  Summary at the Bottom.  The Crew is a game I was quite excited for since I played the Beta, though it is suffering from some massive issues and probably more as I play more. My review style is usually pointing out the negatives, as negatives are easier to see then positives, which positives clog the list up if you try to find them and it becomes a mess. Note: I didn't pay fully for the game with my own money(I sold TF2 â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the market), so I am not biased by how much money I invested. Lets get started..  â¢AI -The AI is the type to mimic what the player does if it's not in 1st place, you'll notice this if you're already playing. -And they just do things that are outright impossible. In the video Jim Sterling made at the 8 minute mark, there's a AI controlled car that just does what he is doing except at a ridiculous level and still is faster. This is a massive problem when you're racing AI and they pull this. -Source of the ridiculously bad AI;  http://youtu.be/MJbAt5QWDhU?t=8m21s  He's not even racing him cause it's the prologue and he's doing this cause that's how they're coded, and in races they do the exact crap. -There are also times where they go through civilian traffic vehicles to keep up with you, it's extremely unfair and frustrating. -Faction missions where you have to race these very AI for an hour or 2 is just the most infuriating thing imaginable, imagine that AI, doing insane stuff and keeping up with you while you're trying your best to not slam into traffic in crowded cities at 150-200mph and the AI is going through it like it doesn't even exist with no consequences in handling. Not fun at all and I'd say avoid ones that have you racing the AI in those long missions.  â¢Customization -Kits are another issue, many kits aren't done yet which should of been if the game had to be delayed. -Kits like the raid or circuit, you can't customize the body for the few cars that currently have it. -You can't color your rims(Which would be so easy to put in), so you're stuck with Grey/Default, black, white, and sometimes gold) -There isn't too many selections, for instance in Dirt, if I wanted a certain headlight setup, with fog lights, I couldn't do it, I had to have fog lights with a different setup of headlights. A tad restrictive and could possibly be easily fixed seeing as the fog lights are ontop of the model. -Vinyl's are somewhat dull as well as restrictive seeing as what you see is what you get, no color changing what so ever, so you'd have to tailor your core vehicle color to the vinyl or just either have no vinyl or pick a different one.  â¢Cars -Pretty much a 14 year olds wet dream, there's a bunch of Exotics and Muscle Cars with barely any Japanese Cars. -When you start, you have the choice between 3 identical looking American boats, or the one Japanese Car, barely much variety to start with. -There's some Civilian cars that look pretty damn good and would add greatly to the selection, but they chose to make them just cars to pass by or get in your way. -Tuning is pretty much non-existant, the only thing you're doing is upgrading parts, not tuning. Static upgrades. No body tuning, or engine tuning. The spec kits are the only thing that 'tune' your car.  â¢Misc -G27 and other wheel controller support is still awkward and the Force Feedback is not good to play with, it jerks the wheel randomly and you're constantly fighting it, no matter if your on Sports or Hardcore, you have to turn Force feedback down to play with a wheel enjoyably -Personally I don't really like nitrous boosts in games, but that's just my peeve, the mechanic is there so note that. -Crew system has problems with disconnecting at the end of missions, instancing, etc. -The Police are ridiculous during missions or higher level stars, like they're psychopaths who got a Police car and want to kill you at the cost of killing themselves, and suffer from the typical AI problems. -Physics are ridiculous, as the community calls them Cat-Physics, your car will try it's best to stay on all 4 wheels, which causes ridiculous things to happen if your wheels get off center. -Text Chat censors such stupid letter combinations making it impossible to have normal conversations.   On the topic of drifting; If you want to know what kit is best for drifting, it's Street. It use to be Dirt, but the handling changes made the the dirt kit less optimal for that.   I will add on more to this review as I play more.   â¢Summary. -The AI is Terrible and Unfair -Customization is more limited then it should be(It doesn't need to be NFS Underground, but it can easily be better then what it is) -Car selection is very uninspired and bland. -Currently doing missions in a crew has issues and kicks people out of the game and having their rewards lost. -Nitrous is a mechanic and is pretty much needed to be used in missions. -G27/Wheel support needs work -Assets in the game that should be used but aren't. -Game is still unfinished even after a Release delay, unobtainable kits cause they're not 'finished'. -No user radio for immersion sake, and the music selection is very boring. You'll have to resort to listening to your own music outside of the game. -Missions due to the AI aren't fun -Popo are not fun and you might as well let them catch out outside of missions if your star level is too high. -Text Chat censors are terrible, and was rushed. -Physics are counter-intuitive and can mess you up especially during jumps. -There is no Tuning, changing Specs is the only 'tuning' you'll get.   Wait for a discount or hold off until more updates come out. It's not that fun in its current state. It has the potential to be fun, just not currently. 
10397	My expectations for this game were large, but what we get from games, nothing!! This is still one of the bad games from Ubisoft. I played it too much, in the hope that it will be repaired.  But after a month and few days after release game, nothing's changed. I can tell only, DONT BUY THIS GAME!!
10398	Buys season pass, Begins to realize.... it's a waste. Sees new update, Gets excited :). Finds out its just more DLC for more money. Begins to realize.... it's a waste.
10399	I paid $60 for this game to play with my friends, then after more then a FULL YEAR of owning it, out of nowhere it suddenly tells me that my 'trial period' had ended, and they are forcing me to pay ANOTHER $30 for DLC just to keep playing? oh HELL no! thats bull! I shouldn't be FORCED to pay for DLC just to keep playing the game I payed full price for!
10400	wild run update wont let me play the game anymore. Ubisoft pleas fix thats the only reason im voting this as a no. until it gets fixed its unplayable. literally
10401	The game is quite fun, and I have spent many hours in it, and will probably spend more too. However... there are some pretty big caveats to this. The price for one; I have the Australia tax, and the base game costs $75USD, not including the exchange rate and everything. Then there is the DLC - each one is a pack of 4 extra cars, hardly worth the price considering they don't really offer too much more. And then there are the Mi-crew-transactions. Seriously? Extra in-game micro transactions on an already pretty pricey Triple A release? There are two different forms of currency in-game, one which is solely earnt through missions, skills, and stunts. And then there are CREW CREDITS. You are given 100,000 reasonably early on in the game, but that's not enough for anything good. And so... you are invited to use real life money to purchase these in order to quickly obtain cars or specs that you would otherwise spend countless hours grinding for. The grind for this game is pretty ridiculous - not only do you have to grind for in-game cash (unless you pay real money) for the cars, but then, upgrade those cars, you must complete skill challenges to acquire parts to improve your car... for each individual car. The best parts are also RNG based, so you could easily spend hours farming the same challenge to try and get that specific part you wanted.  In contrast to some others, I've had no issues with Uplay, but this could just mean I'm one of the lucky ones. Unlike some of the Trailers, the world isn't as filled - this is both a good and bad thing. If you like PVP, well, you'll be in for a long wait. But otherwise, the comparative lack of players is actually a bit of a blessing in disguise. Particularly if you are farming money or parts, the smaller population sizes actually makes it much easier to do what you want without getting in each other's way, which is extremely inconvenient and can be extremely aggravating. One of the biggest draws, the co-op, doesn't really seem to work completely as well, sometimes crews doing a mission won't finish properly. That said, it is still incredibly awesome to drive around America with a group of friends, or accept a random online invite if you prefer that instead. There can, however, still be connection issues even within a crew, so that is something to keep in mind if you plan on primarily playing the game in multiplayer. You'll also want to do this with a friend, playing with strangers online can be dicey and very hit and miss.  The campaign is pretty standard and boring despite how short it is - done and dusted in about 7 or 8 hours. The campaign really offers nothing new, interesting, or relevant. It's very cliche with some pretty glaring plot holes. I enjoyed cruising around the map in free roam doing whatever I wanted more than completing the campaign.  This brings me to by far, the best part of the game - the world map. The Drive is the best open world driving experience I've had by far, with you literally able to drive from Canada to Mexico and coast to coast with an incredibly diverse environment to explore, with vast tracks of open road and off road land to discover. Many cities are either scaled down or removed completely, understandable but potentially annoying to some - I never had an issue with it, it would not make sense to make everything completely to scale. The exploration of the map is great, although sometimes the game feels more like a tourist guide... noting landmarks like the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam. Regardless, the environments are fantastic, from the dense urban cities of Los Angeles and New York, to snowy mountains, deserts, and swamps. The time and environmental system in The Crew is also well worth talking about. From snow, rain, cloud, and sun, the weather is quite well, although rain does not affect driving as much as it should. The day/night system is a highlight, although sometimes streetlamps and headlights turn on and off at weird times... The poor standard of NPC traffic is a let-down. Not only in terms of how they look, but also in terms of how they spawn and despawn. I understand that this is to reduce the stress of the game, but it still looks odd to see other vehicles randomly appearing or vanishing, especially at night time, where headlights are the only thing which shows other road users.  Now to the gameplay. The driving and racing offers nothing spectacular, although the game's physics and hit boxes are inconsistent. On one hand, it's pretty good to see a driving game where your car accumulates visible damage. However, repair prices are exorbitant, and the damage does not seem to effect the car's performance. Then there are odd times where you hit another car or object... sometimes you get the 'crash cam', sometimes you spin to the side, sometimes you flip, sometimes you are bumped backwards or sideways... but there doesn't seem to be much consistency. And sometimes you'll be sent flying over rocks or curbs through invisible walls. It can be entertaining to see your million-dollar car flip and tumble... but also frustrating and physically wrong. I feel the handling is quite poor in the game, with strangely large turning circles, the surprisingly high propensity to skid (not drift), something exacerbated off-road. Landing after jumps is also poorly handled, and you always land nose first, generally but not always, causing you flip and crash.  There isn't too much racing in this game, with a variety of other missions such as 'disable' or 'deliver', but the game's AI is very frustrating and completely unrealistic. Regardless of how your car is upgraded, the AI will always be right on your tail. Collisions will ALWAYS affect you more negatively than the other car hit, regardless of whether it's a race or police pursuit, and who intitiated the contact. And the police pursuits are not fun either. Pursuits only start if you hit a street lamp, but you will be ignored if you speed through a red light at four times the speed limit past a police car? And then, when the pursuit starts, it's actually quite impractical to see the police cars catch up to you... it just doesn't make sense that a random squad car could catch up to a supercar and then insta-stop and bust you. The speed with which you get caught, and subsequently the amount you get fined, make police pursuits far more trouble than fun. The traffic can also behave oddly, especially at lights and when merging.  And then, finally, the cars themselves. I really love the fact that most of the cars are licensed, and have official paints, rims, etc. There are exceptions though, such as the two RUF cars. The stature of the cars is further refined by the 5 different classes, or specs - Street, Dirt, Performance, Race, Circuit - which are all noticeably different to each other, in both looks and performance. This is in contrast to some other games, where differences such as Rally or Muscle cars actually really don't offer much difference in terms of gameplay. In The Crew, the different classes all have their own strengths and weaknesses, and perform differently. Even with the classes, however, the selection of cars is really quite limited, especially if you do not purchase the DLC. While there is a reasonably large range of physical modifications available (bumpers, hoods, spoilers, etc.), these customisation options lack depth and are limited. And some, like the license plates, are barely noticeable. That said, you are able to do some incredibly fun and potentially silly things. Like drive a Mini Cooper down a ski ramp like THE STIG, or hit 300km/h in a Fiat or Dodge SRT.  It's months post release, but there are still bugs - getting stuck or going through environmental hazards, , and graphical glitches where roads vanish or turn strange colours... Don't get me wrong, I enjoy The Crew, and it isn't bad, per se, but it's hard to justify the price, especially with microtransactions thrown in.
10402	Pros: Beautiful graphics The community ain't that cancer You can try the cars before buying them A lot of upgrades  Cons:  When you start the game on steam it automatically redirects you on uplay Not a lot of drifting missions Too many police missions, it becomes annoying The 'calling all units' is a need Bugs like disappearing the waypoints  Ubisoft servers, which are the WORST   I really wanna give a 'Yes' to this wonderful game but too many things are wrong with it. Edit: From the latest update is randomly kicking players from the session after they finish any mission, and ofc nothing gets saved, well done The Crew!
10403	Watchdogs racing, but with rubberbanding, a horrible plot and godawful physics.
10404	 How to Ruin a Potential Hit Title, a Ubisoft Guide to Future Bankruptcy:
10405	How do I get a refund? This game was Okay but with the recent 'Wild Run' update makes this game unplayable. I paid $60 for this game, I paid $25 for the Season Pass and now they want me to pay another $30 to make the game somewhat playable again... â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that made it. I want a refund.
10406	Dont buy it. Dont make the mistake i made.  -Cars handle like driving on soap with no difference between fourwheel, rearwheel or frontwheel. It literally makes no difference. I did a burnout with the rear wheels in a Ford Focus. -No character development. It tries really hard to sell you a dramatic tone but doesnt even touches on bonding with the npcs. Every mission feels like a chore with dull dialog, repetitive gameplay and all around cliche premises.  Simply the worst, most overhyped piece of garbage I have ever laid hands on.    P.S. Dont even try to use a steering wheel with this.... Makes it basically unplayable.   I feel ripped off
10407	Whats the point of playing the game when every 5 minutes I get an add in my face telling me to buy the DLC. This makes the game hardly enjoyable. Just as bad as the free games on an Iphone.
10408	This is horse aids. Bought the 'season pass' expecting a Season pass. here i got this thing that gave me nothing. Finally something Hype is coming out. Does the season pass give me this... of course not Ubgoâ¥â¥â¥â¥yourself
10409	A few years ago I bought a game at release, $60 it cost me. It was a HUGE disappointment. I swore to never buy another game at release nor while the price was at release price ($60), at least not without at least trying a demo, or even downloading a torrent. But I did it again, with The Crew. I couldn't help myself. I'm a sucker for an open world driving game... boy oh boy was it a mistake. First off you have to deal with Uplay, which is never a good thing, But I am a anti-launcher/DRM/Always online person. Second, you are always ONLINE, there is no Offline mode. Also there is no way to start over, once you start the game, make careful choices with your money and crew credits, and which cars you get, there is no going back. Oddly, though this isn't a deal breaker, the mirrors do not work... On a driving/racing game from 2014 and on, little things like mirrors, turn signals, whipers, refueling, turn engine on/off and other assortment of small eye candy should be a must, especially on a game where people will spend so much time just free driving to look at the world that has been created. I've seen a number of people 'obeying' traffic laws, stopping at lights... How cool would it be to refuel, and use turn signals? Well you get none of that. Not to mention, and I know the creators of TDU made/worked on The Crew, but it mocks nearly every aspect of the TDU games aside from it's greatness. So bottom line, I played the 'story' if you can call it that, took about 15-20 hours, fairly difficult if you dont have a much better car, but thats for a different discussion. Spent some time after that running hour long races for some cash, got bored and dropped the game. Went and bought TDU2 for $20 which is SOOOOOOOOOOO much better. So if you need an open world driving game, go with TDU 1 or 2 both are multitudes better than The Crew, not to mention, they are much cheaper. If The Crew were $10, I'd say go for it, but at $60 it simply is not worth it.  Pro's:  Decent Graphics Large map Decent sound Cars look and sound good  Con's: Missing car features such as working mirrors, turn signals ect. Crap Story Cars slide everywhere Campaign is a bit too difficult for casual players Upgrade system is worthless, eg. If your Car level is 1200 and the opponents is 900, they can still keep up and pass you with sudden bursts of speed, going from 60 to 150 in an instant.... literally. NPC traffic pops in and out, sometimes right in front of you, causing a crash. No weather system, no rain, no snow, no fog, no ice... so on. Requires internet and Always Online Requires Uplay Players tend to harrass and smash into you just... becuase I guess. Car handling is aweful Lag is awful when other players are around. (no its not my internet, becuase it's freaking amazing with 126.78Mbps) $60 is too expensive for this game
10410	Sounded like a great game and it was at first. but when you realise that it didn't deliver what the trailer showed. you start getting really bored when there is nothing to do but grinding cards.  I liked the beta so much i preordered the gold version with the season pass. this included 5 in my opnion worst dlc's i have ever gotten in a game. After that they made 3 proper dlc's which is pricy and ofc you wont get with the season pass.   if its very cheap and you love crusing around this is the game for you. if you look for more than that keep away.
10411	corners were cut, drastically. im not even gonna bother writing an actual review since all the reviews under most helpful are quite literally on point. the game needs more cars, period. how can you have cars be customizable for dirt and not have a subaru or evo? you have an f150 but no cars that people actually tune in real life?  THIS IS NOT A RACING GAME. IT IS A MMO WITH CARS. races arent races theyre point a to b and no matter how good you are and dont crash or spinout (which btw is very hard to do with the crappy handling) the other cars are still right behind you. cant tell you how many times ive gotten to the end of a mission and a car/school bus spawns right in front of me and i crash and lose the faction misson ive been working on for the last 2 1/2 hours. buy this game if its on sale dont pay full price for this uncompleted game. i got it for 40$ and change and its barely worth the money. its a good game to screw around in. and as far as the season pass goes, if youre gonna buy the game might as well get the season pass. otherwise youll be stuck in your first car for a while. only way to win decent money is faction missions. story missions barely give you 2k and an r34 costs over $100,000? okay buddy  I REALLLLLLYYY wanted to love this game but unfortunately as everything ubisoft has had their name on lately, its a disappointment
10412	This was one of the games I was looking foward to this year. But it does so little in the areas where it matters most that it falls short of where other existing games pass with flying colors.  Sure I love the visuals of the game and it plays decently well, but the focus of the game is cars and... There's quite a lack of focus in general on them. From what I can see, there's only 40 cars that you can get from dealerships yet this game has one problem that a lot of these style of games have. They tend to favour one or two manufacturers over the rest and that leaves the variety pretty thin, especially when you only have 40 cars and around 1/7th of them are Fords.  Another thing is customization. If you wanted to make awesome murals or just a silly paintjob for your ride, I got two words for you, 'You can't'. The customization feels like it came right from need for speed most wanted (2005) but with even less content then you would even think of. I can't even change the color of my Dodge Viper since there's only 1 color for it and it's terrible.  That's another thing. Everytime I get a racing game, I make it a personal objective to get a Dodge Viper because who doesn't strive to earn their favorite car? But I practically started off with it. You can't buy it but instead, use Uplay award points to buy it and then BAM! Instant car... I already feel like I have nothing to work towards in the game now and I only just started it...  In comparison to Test Drive Unlimited 2. This game has much greater visuals and world design and also doesn't have those annoying houses that make it take forever to manage your cars. But lacks in everywhere else like car selection veriaty, customization and pay to win mechanics. Yes, this game has paid for currency in it which you can use to buy skill points that give passive benefits to your stats or immediate access to any car.
10413	There will be no objectivity in this review, just my opinion on THIS stuff.  First question for now is 'what the hell?'   I preordered this game in 2014 with season pass, I was waiting for it, it was something new to me, just whoah, look, you can drive through all the USA(okay, almost all). After release I played about 60 hrs and then gave up, because I bought and upgraded all the cars I wanted to 1299, after this it was nothing to do anymore. Between this time and WR release I entered The Crew couple of times just to check new cars(imho there are not so good to buy season pass).  Wild Run. Okay, when I was watching all these trailers, reading news I thought 'okay, this can be really interesting', but after WR release I understood, that all my thoughts were... wrong. Three new useless types of cars? Really, anyone used them anywhere except summit challenges? I haven't ever seen someone was driving through on drift or dragster or monster truck. I played in WR, participated in summit, even won something but I was still asking myself: 'really, i paid for this??' Maybe I didn't know about some features?  Calling All Units. I thought I won't have to pay for it *sigh* And I will NOT buy this, because it's just stupid. I preordered The Crew+SP, bought WR and now I need to buy CAU. And also I'm offered to buy Ultimate version which is much cheaper than buying The Crew+SP, then WR and then CAU. Nice job, well done, good game :/ Okay, we got it. But it's not all. Where's my lambo Huracan? I can't see her in my garage. Is it so hard just to add one car to 'veteran' players? And why the hell I can be arrested when cop is driving near me with the same speed? Some guy arrested me on 200+ km/h... Just what? It's not funny, even if you are a cop.  So, we got(imho) useless Season Pass, useless WIld Run and Calling All Units, not useless, but though I'm not sure after what happened. I am very dissapointed. The Crew had great potential, but Ivory Tower(or maybe its Ubi fault, don't know) think in another way. Yes, it was fun to travel around the USA, but without these DLCs game feels incomplete. That's not the way how it should work.  P.S. optimization on PC isn't good at all too.
10414	Wild run came out, i had season pass, i was like 'yes, i'll play the wild run' enters game, plays turtorial, im like 'yay more turtorials' done with turtorial, game says 'ahahah did u realy think that u were getting this with ur season pass, eyyy lmao, u need to spend more maniiiies to get this â¥â¥â¥â¥ bruhhh' now im like 'hype lvl less than 1 bruhhh, i ain't spendin another penny on this trash, when i get my dlc's i'll write a good review' sorry ubisoft but this is kinda true don't you aggre?
10415	No discount for Season pass holders or for pre-ordering?
10416	Medicore racing game filled with low poly traffic, lame-â¥â¥â¥ races, untextured roads, and horrible AI.  Needless to say, this would be impressive if it had come out in 2005. It manages to take the multiplayer concepts of Burnout Paradise and remove all the fun.  Don't even get me started on the 'police chases', what you think would be the best part of the game is actually the worst. If you think that you'll have a fun time driving up and down the US with your buddies while the cops are after you, go play an NFS title. All police chases in this game end the same way, the cops pull out infront of you, insta-stop and insta-bust you. Rinse and repeat.  Awful excuse of a racing game, simply horrible. I'm sure there are better tagents and rants out there and I'm only touching on a few minor things that really ruined the game for me.  The 'beta' was also a great way to generate hype while the devs did nothing. Highlighted by their lack of fixing the roads and other odd glitches. (Flying off the map, cops teleporting around, traffic not navigating correctly, etc)  Beta  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307076303   Final  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=371415301   This was reported back when the beta ran (september/october?) and is still yet to be fixed.

10417	If you are looking for a solid multiplayer experience with your friends, do not buy this game. At the moment, the multiplayer aspect of the game barely works, and ironically, forming a crew with your friends is nigh on impossible. The singleplayer is solid enough, though gathering enough cash to buy new cars is a bit tedious.   Edit: As of now, the multiplayer does seem functional enough for me to edit this review. While I cannot speak for the crew aspect (since none of my friends are interested in reinstalling the game so I can test it), PvP does seem to work fairly well for the moment. However, I was disappointed in the lack of variety in some PvP races; most notably in the Perf spec races. There is only one viable car to race with, the LaFerrari, forget trying to race with anything else because you will with most certainty lose.  In the Street spec the Skyline is heavily favored, though it hardly matters what car you pick since most are fairly competitive. Sadly it is a spec that people rarely want to race with.  As for Dirt spec races the Skyline is again favored by most players, though a skilled player should be able to stay with the pack in pretty much any car, granted it has all platinum parts installed.  Raid is my favorite spec, but only because most cars in that class appear to be relatively balanced. What car you choose to race with appears to matter the least in this specific spec. As long as the car you choose has all platinum parts, you should be just fine with pretty much anything.  And finally we come to the Circuit spec, and here the car does matter. From what I have seen you have three options in this spec. The Circuit Hotrod, the DLC Cadillac Escalade (I wish that was a joke) and finally the Alfa Romeo Competizione. The Hotrod is free, so that is what I recommend you get.   When in a PvP lobby, expect to play a lot of Circuit and Perf spec races since these appear to be the most popular. And maybe once in a blue moon, you'll get to play a Street spec race.
10418	Its time for me to write my very first Review, and its going to be about The Crew. This, was a fun game with a lot of potential, but Team Ubi and Ivory Tower Turned it into... well, into what it is now, I've spent some hours on it, there are ppl with more hours than me but anyway,  people might think that somebody with a lot of time spent on a game would obviously recommend it but thing is, i saw it going down slowly... and the potential got wasted. First lets state the important and obvious details about this game:  Not sure if i should list this as pros and cons, so i'll just list the good and bad about each feature: -Specs: This is of the main features of this game, i even dare to say its the core to the crew's gameplay, when i just played it, it was cool as you see when you pick your first vehicle, you can have every spec on that vehicle, That being, Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit(drag, drift and Monster truck if you have WR Expansion but i'll get to that later), but as you progress in the game you start noticing that its only incomplete, while this is indeed a cool feature, its quite lacking, most of the vehicles in the game only come in Perf spec, wich is annoying, yeah, we get it, not anybody would turn a Lamborghini Aventador into a raid vehicle, but thats the fun part of a video game, do things you can't do in real life, So, as for the specs, i find it quite lacking, specially because some of my favorite vehicles only come in one spec...   -Customization: When this game came out, there wasn't a lot of racing games with this option, So this was a nice adition to someone's library who is looking for a nice racing game with this feature, while its not perfect, its decent, but as i said, its not perfect, why? first, choosing the color, you have to choose from an already existing color list, if your favorite color is not there, you are screwed, the parts you can choose from, some are nice, but i wish they were better, you can't choose your wheels color, customization parts are only for Street, Dirt, and Performance specs, Raid and Circuit, you can only change paint, decals and wheels, there are some elements on the customization menu that are actually empty and only makes you wonder why the heck are they there?? like the Fender one, That being said, Customization is there, it sorta do its part, but i just wish it was way better, like letting you blend your own paint, put the materials you wish on whatever part you wish, etc.  -Graphics and optimization: The graphics are not top notch but for me, they were enough to say it looks good, specially after the visual overhaul they did, not much else to say. As for the optimization, it sucks, there are graphic glitches that are still there from the very beggining of the game,like the stuttering, doesn't matter how amazing or beefy its your computer, it will ALWAYS stutter and have fps drops randomly.  -Gameplay: a lot of people find it bad, it feels stiff, clunky or whatever, as for me, its good, the controls are not that bad, the races andevents are good(but quite lacking...) the physics are quite odd but not odd enough to ruin the game, the best part of the gameplay? you have a really big world to play, the bad part of it? the devs were lazy enough to cover all that ground with all kind of events and racing tracks, instead, they added a game mode where players can create their own races, wich its not that bad, but not that good either, a poor excuse to cut work and let players do the devs work. So, overall, the gameplay its just Decent.  -PvP: while i have'nt spend a lot of time on pvp, i can say that its only for those with very good conection, or else you will just get glitchy af races with oddly moving trafic, pvp its indeed one of the main features of the gameplay, and at first it was amazing, but with time less and less players were available to play with, it still have a good playerbase but still feels a bit dead sometimes, cant really say much about pvp so i'll just leave it on Neutral  And now comes the fun part: the dlcs -Wild Run: To me it was a nice addition with a lot of potential in the beggining, why? cuz it would keep new vehicles coming monthly to the game, so it was worth it a try, also, it came with new Specs, Drift, Drag and MT, new events, wich could get better with time, but actually didn't, at first, new vehicles were suposed to come montly, then, every 2 months, now, 3 months, wich sucks, each summit event its the same and the same, the yjust repeat it on different days, never updated it, and now, the just announced that they wont be rewarding new vehicles on the montly summit, they will just reward already existing vehicles, as for players who already have those, we have nothing else to do in the summit. The extreme specs are also lacking, why? only a few vehicles can have SOME of them, and most are badly designed, why? i'll just say this, you can't have a drag classic muscle car, and honestly, classic muscle cars are meant to be drag cars...  Drift, can't really be done outside of the summit, you can play with drift spec, but no point to it, there are not a lot of drift events you can play multiplayer. MT, same as drift. Seriously, they didn't think about adding cool MT races on the mountains or smething?  Overall, WR HAD a lot of potential, that got wasted over time, as of now, its just bad.  -Calling all units: when they first announced this, it was a good addition to the game, when it came out, it was the typical McDonalds burger Meme, its not as good as they made it sound. The Story mode for CaU is there, pontless, but its there, the new character, Clara, sounds like unmotivated dubbing actress(or actor...) who only knows how to speak with sarcasm, the story misions are just boring and pointless. The Police SPec its completely lacking, only a very small slection of police vehicles its available, its not that hard to add every single spec available in this game into the police lineup, they just needed to add the paint job to the existing body kits and add some police lights... but that would mean work for the devs so screw it.  Currently, there are only a few police players, mainly because not a lof of ppl bought the EP, wich i'd say it was wise. The crate events are quite boring without police players to chase you, and reward you vehicles that you can buy with ingame money, again if you have every vehcle, this is a pointless activity. Skills, are there, they do what they are suposed to do, but not a big addition to the game. The new vehicles are only a few, and also, made me angry about them, if u had complete edition or something similar before CaU release, you just got a Nissan GTR that anybody could get, and a Lambo Huracan that now EVERYONE can use, no longer require CaU, so, basically, you could wear a T-Shirt saying 'i gave the devs al ot of money and all i got was this â¥â¥â¥â¥'.  So, in the end, why can't i recommed this game? in its current state, it feels lacking and incomplet, it gives the feeling that they just starting to not give a 'turd' about this game anymore, so if they dont care, we should stop giving them money.  TL;DR This game had potential, that they never developed at its fullest,now its just plain boring and feels like an incomplete game.  This is not a definitive review, might change over time, but as of now, i dont suggest to buy this game, get it if its on sale, like 50% off or something, its not worth its price, don't buy half game for a full game price...
10419	Thank God I did not buy the season pass, not worth paying that money.
10420	I have one problem with this game..... I can't play it. I bought it... but then it doesnt load. If it worked I would recommend this game...
10421	This game keeps â¥â¥â¥â¥ing with me every single â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day. The Cars are lagging and i keep disconnecting right after if finished a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing race. I really wanna play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, but it breaks my heart every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day. Please. Update this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. â¥â¥â¥â¥
10422	Season Pass. Thank you.
10423	My experience so far is that while still a fun game it seems that everything done with the cars is done wrong. When I played the beta I just kept telling myself 'it's just a beta.' Boy was I wrong. Let tell you of my frustrations as well as what needs to be updated.   -The car selection seems like someone obsessed with American muscle as well as DuPont catalogs. I don't want to street race in Ferrari and koinsegg (spelling). While I understand a few of these cars in the game it seems stupid for half the roster of a street racing game to be these kinds of cars. And there are 2-3 versions of old and new muscle. We have about 3-4 actual tuners to play with. Who made this car selection?  -Pre-order bonus. Well I pre ordered the game for the Mini Cooper personally. Because I own one in real life. Was horrified to see that the pre order cars can only be used in street spec. Making them utterly useless.   -The specs oh oh the specs. Advertised your game to be able to switch out specs on our cars on the fly for different race types. Reality sets in when you realize only a handful of starter cars can do every spec as well as only 1 truck having dirt spec. I'll say that last part again, only ONE truck in the game has dirt spec. Even the Hummer doesn't have a dirt spec. Once again WHAT WERE YOU THINKING. Is this a bug?!!!!!   -Customization. If you thought the crew was gonna have the best customization since need for speed underground, then you better go back to your ps2. Customization is nonexistant. Besides a decent variety of paint and rims that's about it. Roughly 4 bumpers which are really just variations of the first 2, no trim paint options, no sticker color options, no painting of rims, no underglow, no ride height, no anything really. Watching your car be pulled apart while you customize it is merely a visual to make you think you have options. When in reality it needs some major work.   Once again I will say this isn't a terrible game as the map was done really well and the game play is fun. But this is a story line based on street racing games and there isn't much street racing in the vehicles. Failed to capture that culture making it sub par in the end. So many details missed and little to no focus on the cars. Already the season pass promising more half million dollar cars instead of cars we asked for that are commonly found in street racing. I would rather see generic copy cats like the rx7, honda civic, Subaru sti and so on then have named car brands of crap nobody wants to use. You only need 1 mustang in a game not 15 versions of it.
10424	Pros: MMO Open world Upgrade system easy to use Good car variation  Cons: Story short No real depth in characters Game constanly crashes (ubiSHIT) U-play
10425	This game makes Big Rigs: Over the Road racing look like a work of genius.  AT LEAST THAT GAME DOESN'T COST ANYTHING AND RIP YOU THE HELL OFF.  If you want to feel like ending it, just play this game. It will make you re-consider life and you'll want to blow your brains out.  Edit: Now it doesn't work altogether. GREAT.  Edit2: NOW YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE DLC DESPITE HAVING THE SEASON PASS
10426	I purchased this game because it seemed to be just what I was after, However the game fails to launch and was still running up the timer for the 2hr refund window.  Please take care, if uPlay is opened by Steam, and the product fails to start, any time will be clocked as 'Played' and count towards the 2hr window.  I may consider repurchasing again later, however the Wild Run DLC appears to have some problems atm the moment Clarification point: My experience was shortly after the Wild Run DLC launched, after I purchased the 'Wild Run Edition'
10427	Keep in mind: I rarely, very rarely, ever dislike a game. I don't even think bad rats is that bad, even with all of it's weird 2d-but-with-z-axis-inconsistent-physics. All I wanted was an open world racing game, much like Burnout Paradise. I can't even fathom why they published this.   â¢ The ground is made of ice â¢ The cars are made of styrofoam â¢ Every little bit of audio is muffled â¢ Hitting anything or even trying to turn the car slightly turns you into a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tornado â¢ Cars going in a straight line is physically impossible â¢ You'll spend half of your play time fiddling with the handling options â¢ Cars act as though they just have one, gyroscopical wheel in the center, instead of one regular wheel on all four corners â¢ The pedestrians, which serve no purpose to begin with, are made out of wax, and teleport out of the way â¢ Instead of crashes tearing your car apart, particles that could make up an entire other car are emited out of thin air â¢ The people online are either five-year-old-glue-sniffers, or they see no reason to play this game other than to ram into the front of my car while I'm in the options menu. If it's the latter, I don't blame them  It's like this is a college student's game design thesis made in unity. I paid $50 for this ON SALE from giftcards, selling trading cards, and going through the headache that is Paypal to Steam. I could have spent that money on getting 10 really good games that I would have never played. Most of Ubisoft's games get flack for being unoptimised, yet I still enjoy it. This is the complete opposite: It's fairly optimised, but my god do I cringe when trying to even remotely enjoy it. I'll probably still play through this just because of how much I spent on it. Even Supra Mayro Kratt controls better  http://www.kongregate.com/games/ericthecooldude/supra-mayro-kratt 
10428	pay 40 dollars just to install and uninstall the game, NO MORE UBI GAME!!  okay new review. I remember the time when I used to play NFS WORLD, i can see many player in the city, they hangout in the stadium and show off their cars. THE CREW?? when I was playing with my friend, I could not meet even in the same city and the same spot. No players in the game, after half an hour they appear a maximum of 5 players then gone again.
10429	Can't actually 'Crew' up with anyone. My ports are more forwarded than ever tho. 10/10
10430	Idea was quite exciting until I play the game for the frst time. The looks checks out, the story and the mission/car development structure has potential, but game physics &amp; mechanics are so poor, I almost felt like I'm playing test drive 25 years ago.   Unfortunate they didn't nail the driving experience, because without it, a racing game (no matter even if it's an mmo) does not worth to be played.  
10431	The game really isnt worth buying. At first the game was really fun and seem to have a lot of potential. once you hit the max level you can pvp, do 1hour+ long faction missions and free roam. The faction missions aren't that fun to do and are basicly made pointless when you can easily send friends out to (not actual friends they send and ai) to do the faction mission for you. Pvp is ok but needs to have a lot more game modes. The free roam is fun but I end up driving in the same areas seeing as how most of the map is either highways or ai filled citys. The offroading is a lot more fun than the on road seeing as how you can either go onto the dirt roads or make your own 'roads' with the raids spec. One issue with the game is that getting any car in the game is as easy as just farming a few pvp missions or sending friends on faction missions, even getting the hidden cars isn't satisfying at all. Another issue is that the so called fixes they have implemented into the game dont seem to fix much, a lot of the performance improvements to some of the rear wheel drive cars dont actually improve anything. Car customization is great and all but what I would rather have is a system more like forza horizon 2 where I can swap engines, buy diffrent parts for the car, body parts that actually affect the performance instead of just looking cool. The games car progression system compared to horizons is very dull, all you do is find a few jump challenges that are easy to do with the car you are using and just sit there farming for a few hours till you have a max level car. I am going to end here, there is a lot more I could talk about but this review is already long.  tl;dr: The game is fun but lacks in certain game mechanics. Its also very boring once you realise how easy it is to get the most expensive car. patchs dont fix much.  If you want something better save your money and buy something more along the lines of project cars or if you own an xbox buy horizon 2 there is a larger car selection and you can properly tune cars. Although I did have fun with the game I would much rather have horizon 2 where I can basicly tune the tyres, gearing, springs, damping and all that good stuff. Again there are more things I could talk about but I dont want to make this any longer than it is.  Edit: Another issue that I really wanted to mention is the car variety is very little and the dlcs only add 3 cars each.
10432	Can not recommend this game to any new players at all. There are so many issues, bugs and crash problems with this game that Ubisoft has acknowledged and refuses to fix. For more than a year these issues have persisted, you can even youtube these problems with keywords as ' The Crew terrain bug '.  Ubisoft has not shown any support in fixing these problems for the duration of the year despite the community having upwards of 40+ pages on both the Steam forum and the Ubisoft The Crew forum. There support consists of ' Please give us more information about the crash so we can help fix it ' while doing nothing.  The Crew has some of the worst finicky hardware related issues I have seen in a game in my time, you can deck yourself out with the greatest hardware and still have problems, or you can have average to low and have little problems and then vice versa again.  The Crew is a beautiful looking game for it's release date, platforms and multiplayer capacity, I have enjoyed many hours driving around the ' virtual usa ' map which is not 100% accurate, probably not even 60%, but it has it's moments driving passed landmarks, or through new york city for example. On ultra settings the game will definitely impress for visuals and excitement. Plently of entertainment driving around completing missions or cruising with friends, performing co-op missions, on that note though, you must be aware that anyone in the world can and will affect your gameplay experience.   You are not really 'locked' behind a security blanket in The Crew, your missions can be interupted by other players which will effect your personal experience, due to a lack of any form of moderation or adminship in the game, trolling others is not at all against the rules. Blocking entrances, ends of races, race markers, anything goes.  The Crew's over all performance for game play is a fun and enjoyable experience, if you can enjoy it that is. With constant crashes and terrain issues, or game freezes it becomes a frustrating mess at times. If you're willing to give the game patience and grit your teeth through all it's cancer, you might be able to sit down and have a pretty good time, and godspeed to you.  However, I must conclude with, the price of the game vs it's overall problems, is not worth the buy. Ubisoft shows no support or help / compensation for players so the price will never cover the frustration of it's downfalls. With a 2nd expansion in the works and issues still unresolved and full pricing for the expansion with no compensation for the previous owners who are not able to even load the game due to ' The Crew has stopped responding ' at startup, I can not give this game a passing score. It is a flop, a fail, a miserable purchase and a game that gets shelfed quickly soon after your bad experiences become more infuriating then attempting to load the game time and time again.  TLDR: Ubisoft doesn't support it, it's priced heavily for a broken game. 2/10, do not recommend. Find another game.
10433	Can't play with friends, can't hardly connect to anyone, havent been able to start one co-op race. game is okay. online sucks, gameplay relies heavily on online multiplayer. yet I cant play it. 0.5 out of 5 stars
10434	Car selection and variety sucks. 3rd-party DRM is extremely annoying.
10435	I'm 50/50 on this game. Its not bad, but its not great. The story is boring, the characters have no development and once you're done with the story you're just in freemode with not a whole lot to do. With this calling all units dlc, it gets really annoying to play. You have zoe every three minutes or so say 'Dont forget to check out the shop, you have a FREE car waiting.' The thing with the free car is in order to get it you have to buy the dlc. So if you dont have the dlc then you're stuck with zoe saying the same thing over and over again. Almost forgot to mention that when I opened up the game, it said something like 'Congrats you have unlocked the Nissan GTR, in order to drive it you have to buy the dlc' Yeah well â¥â¥â¥â¥ you people. Dont say I unlocked something when I didnt.
10436	Regarding The Crew is not a bad game, but 'Wild Run' expansion is overrated and overpriced. What you really get is a few car specs and few events. And a motorcycles, yes. That's all. And this 'expansion' claim price even higher than original game. Ubisoft is starting to be veeery greeedy. I don't want to play the game when I see such a 'future'. And I wouldn't recommend it to you either.
10437	+Amazing concept  +drives well, +very fun +nice range of cars +Bikes (req Wild Run) +massive open world +Graphics +Drifting (Req Wild Run) +Drag racing (Req Wild Run)  -Horrible support -Bugs that prevent you from playing -no recent hotfixes  I'm hoping they pull their finger out and start patching up the game because with the latest arival Wild Run comes new bugs, the worst being is the world not loading up during an event and you get stuck solid you can reset ur car causing the loading to continue but by time you do that you're miles behind the race. tied with that is a forever stuck on loading screen unable to do anything so you have to ALT+F4 out I'm struggling to do the new events with a crew because of this.  I really wanna recommend this but I can't. if bugs like what I mentioned doesn't bother you then do buy the game + expac. very good aside the bugs. But going to leave it on a negative rating.  Ubisoft, sort it out...
10438	First of all I would like to start off by saying that I have played approximately 20 hours of the game. This has basically put my most of the way through the campaign. My background with the game started earlier this summer when I got invited into the closed beta. (Played about 6-8 hours) The very first problem with this game is that you can't just use steam, on top of steam you have to use UPlay(Only works about half the time and takes forever to get into the game) The next problem is that once you get into the game (assuming you have an internet connection) it tends to be rather buggy. There seems to be an issue with optimization because my computer is rather capable and more than meets the minimum and recommended specs. As with most AAA titles lately if you have AMD hardware you definitely need to beware (my laptop with Nvidia hardware runs the game much better) The main problem seems to be around the cities(Lots of buildings and poor optimization). All in all this fits together to be a rather poor title but the one thing that keeps nagging me is the physics of the game itself. I could probably get past the online all the time (Wasn't explicitly stated that you have to be) or even the sometimes poor framerates. But the poor and might I add inconsistent physics and handling between cars is terrible. Now I can personally say that I have never driven most of the vehicles in-game, but last time I checked a 600-900 horse Ferrari should be able to drift much better than an off-road Chevy Silverado(Actually have driven this). However this is not the case all the muscle cars that people have been sliding around for years and years are impossible to drift. The only game mode that seems remotely realistic is that of circuit racing. I wasn't expecting this to be Forza Motorsport realistic but I at least expected it to feel something like Dirt 3 or Grid (Something sim-cadeish). Finnally about the physics we are looking at the terrible bug where sometimes you will be cruising along and hit the same curb or patch of dirt you have hit 100 times with no consequence and now all of a sudden you are tossed into the air and are placed miles behind your competitor. All in all I am extremely dissapointed with the crew as I have been waiting for a U.S. playground for cars for years. Guess I am still waiting.
10439	honestly, I like UBI before, but haven't bought any games from UBI after I purchase this sh*t...this is the only one I've ever seen that the season pass only have the car pack in it, you have to pay if you want to play new DLCs...  I bought the Ultimate Edition long time ago, when they release the Wild Run DLC, they ask me to buy it so I stop playing this until I saw there is a new update of it. the Wild Run is included in the season pass and free to play now, because there is another DLC called Calling All Units released, and they said I need to pay 40CDN to play that.  Nah UBI. I'm going to play the Forza Horizon 3 now, it's much better than this
10440	After clocking in 36.1 hrs in this game. i have come to the conclusion that this is the first and LAST time i EVER buy a game from Ubisoft. This was a huge let down in many aspects. While i try my best to focus on the good of the game ( will be stated lower down), from time to time i find my self regretting the fact that i went against my instincts to not buy the game ( reason being deep down i felt like this game would be a total let down after ACU: Assasin creed Unity reviews).  Pros( may or may not state all) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- +Huge map +driving never really feels repetitive unless doing specific races +open world +fun skill challenges, races, and faction races +being able to make crews between friends and or people you don't know ( Chance to make friends online). +Earning money is not a struggle therefore buying cars aren't a headache ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cons ( to many to list)  -Crew are limited to only 4 people  -very low car selection from since launch  -Car modeling is sub par for a next gen game  -Street cars and circuit cars have a fetish for driving offroad  -when turning corners in any class of car, it feels like you're slamming the vehicle to the left/right  -driving dirt cars feel like you're constantly drifiting on ice  -not much to do with friends besides races, missions and more races just pvp this time  -Story line is a little to predictable ( not a deal breaker)  -driving against AI constantly feels like the game is trying to recreate a movie scene where the race ends in NECK&amp;NECK -IF MY CAR HAS A RATING OF 900+ THERE IS NO REASON OR SENSE FOR AI CARS RATED AS 600 AND BELOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH ME.  -Cop chases feel like you're car weighs 5 lbs and the cop cars have the wieght of an Airbus A380 jumbo Jet. when they hit you, you're car gains the speed of a bullet and goeing into the direction you're hit too, how ever when you hit the cop car that looks like it can be taken down easily, u still gain the speed of a bullet and fly into the opposite direction you hit the car into.  -Cop cars that aren't exotic or have have the potential to go past 200MPH should NOT be keeping up with my Lambo. thats is Blazing by on the highway @ 245MPH. I swear, this game makes police chases feel as if some of the cop vehicles have magnetic propulsion systmes in them.  -Graphics needs to be boosted up ( a bit apauling for a next gen game) i also felt like more effort were placed into using shaders and other techniques to mask the bad graphics.  -For a game that has such a huge scale map, the entire world feels empty to some extent; eg: the only place civilians are prevalant are in medium to large cities in states such as like NY, LA and Illanois. And despite their presence in these locations, their numbers are outstandingly low leaving a feeling of deserted city with just civilian vehicles going in and out of.  -THE DRIVING PHYSICS, HANDLING &amp; everything else involved with the movement of cars are ABSOLUTLY APPAULING. ( driving games like NFS underground feels alot more bearable than this in my honest opinion. countless times while driving circuit cars, i begin to get the feeling like im driving my car on ice when moving at high speeds (it feels like im moving a lamborghini at rocket speeds on ice while trying to stare).  -Accident situations are just wacky. by that i mean if i get careless while racing and make a mistake, and go offcourse i just have to hold B on the controller and i will respawn OR sometimes when im 150 mph+ &amp; i am about to hit a tree or a car i sometimes just slide to the side like nothing was there. If im not lucky that happnes then i must endure a mandetory cutscene of my crash that sometimes happens in the wierdest ways. (cutscene can be skipped once 1 or 2 seconds have passed its bearable).  -The speed of the cars are just all over the place. exotic cars can have the tendancy to bearly feel different ater leveling them up to 1299 ( max level ) in their respective classes ie street, dirt, raid &amp; Circuit. for example. i bought a lamborghini Mercealago after spending some time doing races, the car top speed in full stock was 219MPH , currently i have leveled the car up to 1230, the max speed i have reached with this car is 249 MPH with NOZ blowing out the exhaust pipes like the mouth of a dragon.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There are much more CONS, however you the reader should get an idea by now.  In conclusion i felt completly let down by this game. i haven't bought a racing game since the new NFS most wanted was released in 2012. I Thought Ubisoft was going to really dilever on this game but i was WAY out of the ball park with my expectations. I was fooled by the CG Trailors of the game they were releasing to hype this game up. To me there is limited fun to have in this game so therefore i will not recommend this game to anyone as of this moment unless this game undergoes heavy amounts of fixing.
10441	Has a very vague story line, weak performance, funky physics which can be described as bumper car physics, now they offer bikes in the game as well but at ridiculous prices, since the wild run update im getting about 5 frames less but game still looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥, not to mention the wild run expansion costs 30 euros or 24 pounds. Crappy game in general made for money grabbing.
10442	Game has a lot of potential however multiplayer is broken as hell for me.
10443	Dear Ubisoft and Ivory Tower  -I bought the game.  -After a while I bought Wild Run DLC -&gt; I really enjoyed Wild Run for a while. Would have recommended the game  -Then the calling all Units DLC came out -&gt; Now the Wild Run expansion is locked behind the Calling all Units DLC -&gt; I have to buy another DLC just to be able to play what I already bought...  Seriously Ivory Tower/ Ubisoft?  Instead of discounting the calling all units DLC for the people who already have the Wild Run DLC you chose to give the Wild Run DLC away for free to everyone who only buys the Calling all Units DLC.  I'm speechless. I'll never ever buy anything published by Ubisoft unless this mess gets fixed.   Sincerely, a lost customer of yours
10444	Updating the review to Wild Run update.  -Graphics are worse than they were before. -You can't access a lot of game functions if You don't have the useless 30 euro DLC bought.  It's just another ubisoft scam, what did You honestly expect?  
10445	Pros:  Stunning Graphics. Huge world to explore. There are several types of cars to choose from. Customizations are good.  Cons:  Slow progression. Awful story, which does not really revolve around having a close crew, or cars themselves. It is a stupid revenge story with terrible dialogue. Pvp is not even balanced. all car tiers are allowed. there is no way to race friends equally. Frustrating AI. Ridiculous physics. Online functions are shallow. It does not feel important at all. They are repeated over and over again. Cars do not feel that different. Pointless radio towers. Police are on all sorts of drugs and cant catch â¥â¥â¥â¥.  And mainly the game focuses more on stupid arcarde missions like collecting packages or smashing cars, which are repeated over and over again in the story mode.You spend more time doing stupid side missions that are repetitive.Instead of racing.  THE GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A CREW
10446	i spent $70 on this? â¥â¥â¥â¥ do i ever feel ripped
10447	New update is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheeks. Not paying another 25 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bucks for features that should have already been in the game. Tired of Ubisofts shameless money grabs.
10448	THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE FREE SOON,DO NOT BUY. GIVE ME YOUR MONEY INSTEAD.
10449	Overall this game is good, but for $60, it's not worth it. Here's the breakdown: Pros: - Large map - Detailed car designs - Decent online multiplayer experience Cons: - Huge lack of cars (only around 40) - Lack of options to customize car parts - Very poor AI - Police chases are awful - Annoying, boring campaign
10450	2 years after release this game is still crap. Lags, loading textures, cheaters, unstable servers and many more. And now they want more money for another overpriced DLC. No, just no don't buy this, save your money for another better game.
10451	I enjoy the driving and graphics in The Crew... also I hear a lot of people complaining on driving itself and what they have to go is open the settings and set 'Hardcore' for assists, plus in some cases tune a bit...  CONS: Even without FPS drops at steady 60fps everyone gets microstutters which don't affect fps (even if graphics is set to low). Ubisoft PLEASE FIX The MicroStutter so we can enjoy the game at its full!  GameBreaking: Another issue is map texture load glitch when map stops loading and you are stuck in raw textures, usually it helps to use back to track button and the map loads, but sometimes it doesnt work and you have to restart the race (In races as Highway child and coast to coast) which makes it extremely frustrating as those are 50min-1:30hr long races.  Will change to positive once microstutter and map load glitch are fixed... I mean it's been over a year now and I think it's time to fix it now! Year and a half...  UPDATE: Released 19/12/2014 today is 17/08/2016 and they still didn't fix 'Map Load Bug'... Don't buy this pile of garbage.
10452	 THE CREW REVIEW     Image of the in-game options  [cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]      Image of more in-game options  [cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]     Image of the World Map  [cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]     Image of an in-game event  [cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]    The Crew is not a good game.   While the concept of the game sounds great, Ivory Tower fails to execute it well. The cars all feel similar (the performance cars all feel the same as each other, the raid cars feel the same, etc) and don't control as good compared to other driving games. The game borrows many ideas from previous Ubisoft releases that don't really translate that well in a car. The online community for this game may as well not be there. There is a chat in-game but in the 20+ hours I've put into this game I've yet to see one person use it.. which can make it hard for people to find a Crew to party with in-game. Invites to races and events other people usually go unaccepted. While a large portion of the Crew relies on having a Crew, the game doesn't have a whole lot to offer for people looking for a single player experience.   The map for this game is huge and allows you to drive from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. In between are rocky mountains, open plains, wildlife darting across the road, cops, pedestrian vehicles getting in the way, little towns at the end of dirt roads and huge cities. In between all these are hundreds and hundreds (it seems like) of events. There's a handful of events such as staying in between the lines, smashing through 'gates', going as fast as you can, mountain climbing, and more. Completing these events (and other races) reward you with a score based on how well you did and are rewarded with different car parts than you can equip to cars; increasing their overall stats. Instead of climbing towers to unlock portions of the map; making you work a little for your progress, the Crew has you drive up to the satellite dishes located by a blinking aura on your map and GPS.   The story is extremely dull, laughable and perdictable.You play as Alex, a man wrongly jailed for the death of his friend. You have the chance you redeem your freedom as FBI Agent Zoe sends you information on the man who killed your friend, and she believes the police officer, Coburn, who arrested you is working behind the scenes with Shiv. You must race your way to the top, earn your ink, and take down Shiv. The music is subpar, instantly forgettable and I found a hard time finding something I enjoyed listening to in-game.  If you're interested in the Crew to get your racing game fix I would suggest looking elsewhere. There's plenty of other racing games out there that are multiple times better that'd you actually enjoy. Also, uPlay sucks.
10453	Tried my hardest to like this game. I love the idea of driving across the varied landscapes of USA, but the story they've tried telling, the characters and the missions have all been in my first 6 hours of gameplay. I've hit multiple graphical and mission bugs - unacceptable from a (AAA?) game a year after launch.
10454	Fun for a couple of hours at most doing the storyline and collecting car bits, playing against online players reminds you that unless you pay real money to buy virtual cars you aren't going to do terribly well. Bought the season pass which didn't include the first actual piece of DLC that isn't a single car. Good job aiming for EA's title of worst price gouging company in existance this was my last ubisoft product.
10455	Wild Run DLC is a complete scam. If you only had the base game and played co-op with random people up until now, now you can't, as 'look for a crew' thing now requires you to pay â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on of money for the new DLC. Yep, you heard it, Ubisoft actually removed a crucial feature and turned an Online game into essentially a Singleplayer experience, hell, this game is named 'The Crew' and 'Look for a Crew' button is paywalled? What the hell?! You call it an MMO, and ask me to pay for the second M? WHAT THE HELL?!  Did I mention Uplay? Better not.
10456	Worst driving game of the generation, pure crap in all aspects, the graphics look shiny but is actually mediocre at best, gameplay is cluncky as fluff, and don't get me started on the physics . . . .  Oh and the Gold edition? its not so gold as it so happens, Wild run costs you another $25, and for me who's paid $100 for the Gold edition on release thats a load of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, Wild run should have been included in the Gold edition. Shame on you Ubisoft for this twisted business model.
10457	What a scam , bought the wild run dlc spent lots of time driving the drag / monster / drift cars , decide one day to go for a cruise and see there is a new dlc for sale....cant use the old dlc that I paid for now , complete bs
10458	Unless you are rich like me, I really don't actually suggest this game.  If you want to get anywhere, you gotta spend money. When the wild run expansion came out, it costed like 30 bucks here and you were literally just paying for 3 new specs, a bike, a drift car, and a monster truck. Why the hell is this not free? The Crew wasn't even released that complete, and then they lock off half the cars just to milk money. The game itself is actually pretty fun, but the handling needs to be adjusted in the options, and the map wasn't the 'whole america.' The selection of cars is very little and it's stupidly small added with the wildrun dlc. This game has microtransactions everywhere, and although it is pretty easy to make money in this game, it's obvious Ubisoft is a money milking corporation. The graphics are beautiful, though.  TLDR Unless you have around 150 bucks, don't expect to get much content out of the game quickly Graphics are good, and the map isn't really the 'whole america,' though it's still pretty good.  Kill yourself Ubisoft, why can't you design a game that doesn't milk money for once. (wink wink nudge nudge Assasin's Creed annual releases)
10459	I bought The Crew 2 weeks ago and I haven't been bored of it yet! The game accomplishes this by using the clever tactic of crashing before the player even has a chance to do anything, thus eliminating any possibilty of the gameplay getting stale.
10460	This is not about the game, it's about the company.  I bought this game with season pass for about 80 dollars just after it released.  Then Ubisoft, please tell me what is included in the season pass????? Just couple car packs??? I DO NOT think anyone who bought your dumb season pass just for thoes cars, we were expecting some new content just like other games.  And then you released a new expansion to the game next year finally some new content and I have to pay more to get the expansion???   ABSOLUTE SMART STRATEGY Ubisoft!!!!!
10461	30â¬ of nothing. That story mode was awesome, but after that it was only credit farming. Same in Wild Run if you dont wanna pay those micros. Sorry, you made your game bad.
10462	It's a bloody mess.  I have to admit that I fell for the 'we'll listen to the community feedback' lie, genuinely thinking that this game would go in the right direction. But it didn't. It went straight into a DLCfest. The season pass doesn't grant you access to all the paid content, Wildrun isn't part of it, and on top of that, it costs almost as much as the game itself.  Plus, it gives so little content that it makes no sense to pay that much: a bunch of bikes, new specs made with recycled and/or slightly edited assets and a new gamemode which should be competitive, but in reality it's just about who glitches the most.  The physics are broken, the cars don't feel alright at all. The steering capabilities also differ depending on input peripheral, with DirectInput ones having increased precision and steering radius, while keyboard and Xinput pads users get impaired controls. This issue hasn't been fixed, despite being a hot topic on the game's forums.  Vehicles aren't many for today's standards and they're terribly unbalanced. While updates fix the handling of some cars, all they do is changing the current kings. On top of that, bikes seem to dominate in almost any spec and they're locked behind a paywall. Despite the major outcry on the forums for more balance, nothing seems to have changed yet. Moreover, the engine sounds are terrible.  The only saving graces of this game are the graphics and the game world.
10463	Uplay server is not available at this time please try again later. I try again and again a again...... The same message over and over again ERROR code #0_1 â #0_35 error also ........... The Crew Error!! #0_35 The Crew Error!! #0_35 The Crew Error!! #0_35 you pay money but you cannot play this game
10464	Game is shoddy at best. Another blatant cash grab by Ubisoft. Ubisoft deserves to go bankrupt at this point. I would be okay with this game if it weren't for the process used to level up your cars. You need to do challenges to gain better parts, but the reward system is an ubelievable level of stupid. Rewards are randomized so it doesn't matter if you barely scraped out a platinum or absolutley crushed the challenges. What you're gonna get is complete chance. It'd be like going into work on payday and getting payed the exact same as that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Debrah from accounting, you know the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who doesn't do any of the work, â¥â¥â¥â¥s around in the break room for hours at a time, yet still gets payed exactly the same. This game reminds me of Debrah. You remember when you were a kid and you wanted your Dad to read you a bedtime story and he was all like 'Not now I just got home from work,'? But you kept pestering him until he agreed and then when he read it it was like 'Mary had a little lamb. The end.' That's what this story is like. In short, I'd rather have a dart frog ejaculate his venomous â¥â¥â¥ into my ear canal than play anymore of this game.
10465	it was really good but now it just keeps crashing on launch so its ruined my fun
10466	This game is a poor ripoff of Garfield Kart.
10467	The next great game from the industry veterans who brought to you great titles such as Need for Speed, and Test Drive Unlimited, I present to you, The Crewâ¢  Play as   Walter White     Phil Fish   Alex Taylor, a man struggling to identify as either a hipster, or a lumberjack, just as he loses his brother, (who we were told to care about after we meet him 30 seconds earlier) to the ruthless   Razor     Shiv   Eminem, who then usurps the leadership of the 4-20 motor club.  Start from humble beginnings and work your way through the   Blacklist   4-20 motor club to get your shot at the man who killed your brother. Build your crew with loyal members, such as Omar, the black man with 4 voice lines in the whole game, or Roxanne, ub3r l33t h4x0r love interest that becomes completely nonexistent in the story after 5 races.  Escape cops as you rack up   heat levels   Most Wantedâ¢ Stars, Defy gravity as you drive on the sides of walls, make 14 bucks by destroying the US-Mexico border, and run from the Illuminati. The possibilities are endless.  #NeverDriveAlone, theres got to be at least two other people in your instance,   somewhere  
10468	Ubisoft is even worse then EA. So, let me explain: The game itself cost 30 bucks, then you must pay 25 more dollars to get the DLC cars, AND THEN (yeah, thats not it) you must pay about 40 more 'greens' to get another half of the game, with many new cars, game-changing specs of the cars, and many-many things. That half of the game named 'The Wild Run', which is a DLC, coming pretty soon to the market. So, after some simple calculations we get a FULL game for about 90 bucks! Great job Ubisoft! Now about the game itself. Yes its kinda good, but after you drove a little, completed the story mode, got EVERY car in the game in EVERY spec, drove the whole map, discovered tons of the bugs, like wall-breach and go-underwater bug, some skill races in top-50, you got basically nothing left to do. So the conclusion, should you buy it or not. Well, there is a litteraly a few people, like me, who can truly love it and fall into addiction, who think that the freeroam, huge map and 72 cars is enough (though i never felt like there is so much, and was actually shocked when i got that fact, as the cars feel pretty much similiar). If you want to risk, as its CAN be on of your favourite games, go ahead and buy 'Trial' version for just 30 USD, and then decide if you ready to pay same to fall into that game for some hours more.
10469	I bought the Crew, THE FULL GAME ONLY, and got a DEMO. This is ILLEGAL. I would like a full refund, and am certain I will not get it. Because let's face it. THIS IS UBISOFT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. They would kill their mothers for a nickel.
10470	all i bought was the crew for Â£24.99 and IT SAYS ITS THE TRIAL SO ITS telling me to spend more money to play more
10471	Okay, simply put, the game is falsely advertised. This game is NOT an MMO. - Allows only 8 players in a session - That's pretty much it Everything else about the game is okay except for the annoying DLC prompts... Really not okay when DLCs are that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing expensive.  Ubisoft needs to get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together ^_^
10472	The story is complete crap, however the racing is pretty good...but the story just flat out sucks.
10473	Doesn't even start, like wiping â¥â¥â¥ with 15â¬
10474	You cant start it . Not wery good . Plz Ubisoft Solve the Problem
10475	Sucks, all the potential in this game and it does not meet any of them..  and the support with problems like crashing and others are not there at all.  not worth a penny.  Ubisoft can burn.
10476	I thouroughly enjoyed this game when it was available for the BETA; now I don't.  Ubisoft has failed on a majority of its launches this year, this game is not an exception.  Off road physics are the worst I have ever seen. Taking out cars is more frustrating than filling out your taxes; the opponent always shoots up to 200 miles an hour when you get within inches of taking them out. The reward system gives bronze for EVERYTHING.   All the starting cars are muscle and a Nissan. *Yawn* I picked up the season pass and you can throw a Ferrari into that group. hooray...  So far, honestly, the game is not very enjoyable. I do have a few friends to free roam with (the main reason I will keep playing this game) that enjoy it more than I, however, this game was much better during the BETA.
10477	Typical Ubisoft game.  Horrendous UI. UBI server issues, I just played 2 days and I already know 4 different connectivity issue codes. Cheating AI for both Cops and Contenders.  It is more playable than TDU at this time but barely.  Still, the game is fun with friends, but 50â¬ for that, haha, no. Wait for 15â¬.  Would recommend if the game is patched and ubi get his â¥â¥â¥â¥ together with the servers.
10478	The Crew is just a trail version what a scam. You cant even play the game without dlc.
10479	Don't buy it if you doubt Ubisoft. I have been struggling for a week to get Uplay to work, even just on its own and I still haven't found a solution. Any website with info on the startup crash is two years old and irrelevant. If I could get past that problem I would probarbly recommend this game, but not until Ubisoft sorts out their Uplay â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10480	Bought the gold edition when the game came out thinking I would get all the future content for free since it came with a season pass...but i guess all future content doesn't include the Wild Run Xpac. :( Can't justify another $25 on a game i already paid $90 for...
10481	This is a Horrible game if you play solo its very hard to make any credits and collect all cars this feels like pay 2 win to me with microtransactions . And the Wild update is just as bad with horrible car handling I wish the guys they hired from edensoft would make TDU3 .
10482	Fun for the first 15 seconds
10483	PLEASE DONT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥. THERE IS A LOT OF BUGS,ERRORS IN THIS GAME AND PEOPLE CANT PLAY THIS ANYMORE CAUSE OF SOME ERROR. MY FRIENDS HAS 16 GB RAM 3 GB VRAM AND I7 WITH OVERCLOCK 3.7. AND UBISOFT DIDNT FIX IT. PLEASE JUST DONT BUY
10484	Fun for the first 15 seconds
10485	BEFORE I STARTED PLAYING THIS HOW WAS MY FEELING OF THE GAME im not into car games (maybe cause i suck at them), but had to try the new 'mmo star' from ubisoft (i dont like ubisoft much as company when it comes to multiplayer and patching, seems like the just fish after wallet money and move to next projekt.) But had to try this one  WHEN I TRIED IT HOW CAN IT BE COMPARED TO THE HYPE I HAD: i had a OK feel, i knew at once i will grow tired of doing the repetetive missions and boring main story. its a game i log into and feel i play alone, like need for speed. I really wanted to like it .  TOP 3 I LIKE 1. graphics are stunningly beutiful  2. good driving mechanics and lot of stuff to do 3. learning curve is easy  TOP 3 I DONT LIKE  1. repetetive  2. world feels so lonely 3. felt the story where very dull..   So overall points by me given are 1/10 where 10 is max.   Multiplayer experience: 1/10 (played with a friend in party and not good, also PVP endgame is worthless with ques for 15 min for a round where the best car wins..) Graphics: 10/10 Developer update game: 5/10  Developer informing us about their team and state of game: 5/10   IS THE GAME WORTH IT? i have to say NO on this one, since you have to pay a steep price for this 'single player' game and yet there are micro transactions in it... ohh god its very repetetive and will be forgotten by me fast..     My pc specs.  Screen: BenQ 27' 3D LED XL2720Z (1920x1080, 144Hz, 1ms, 12m:1, VGA/DVI/2xHDMI/DP) AMD FX (tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (8 CPUs), -4.0GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 (4gb Memory) 24576MB Memory    - Mspaint out
10486	At this point in time until someone at ubisoft fixes this error , i rate this POORLY .   I bought the crew with Wild run DLC and then i get into game and it says You have to buy the DLC again.. nope , not happening . when they fix this issue , i'l change this review to possitive , till then ..... go buy something else.
10487	This crap doesn't even want to start. Crashes just like it did in BETA and it has been â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ages since BETA. Don't buy it until UBISHIT does something about it
10488	It rains too damn much. Driving in rain simulator 2015 is what they should have called it. 50% of the time it's raining, Even in the desert. THE DESERT.
10489	What a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
10490	lovley game but alot of annoying bugs like crashes and disconnects
10491	Great game, storyline is solid. But you can't 'customize' your car, you can only add packages, i.e. street package, performance package, with some flexibility otherwise. Graphics aren't the greatest, but gameplay is more important. Well, offline gameplay is, considering the community is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. What people like to do is form little posses of 3 or 4 cars, then find solo players just cruisin' around and run them off the road to the point where online gameplay is literally intolerable, since you can't drive anywhere. On top of that, grandma's Nissan has the same physics as a Dodge Ram 1500, so theres no way to defend yourself. To add insult to injury, I bought the 'game of the year' edition, or whatever they're calling it now. So thats just 85 bucks down the drain.  If I still haven't turned you off yet, I'd like to mention that you need UPlay to run this game. What's UPlay? It's like Steam, for Ubisoft. UPlay and Steam hate each other. It's nearly impossable to get in a game with people from your friends list because it's so hard to get Steam and UPlay  to work together.  Still need more? Recently there was an update for The Crew that added a new feature called 'Wild Run'. Wild Run is 25 dollars, regardless of whether you bought the season pass. What? I just paid 85 dollars for your game and I still don't have everything? Now, Wild Run includes a feature for the player to do races with other players, which was availible as a part of base game. Was. Now, unless you pay  Ubisoft even MORE money, you can no longer play with other people, which was the original intent of the game; multiplayer co-op racing. Ubisoft just decided that it was a good idea to completely disable the most vital part of the game in favor of petty amounts of profit.  Ubisoft recently released a new DLC for police chases called 'Calling all Units' which I was really psyched for. Turns out, just like Wild Run, even though I have a season passI still need to pay EVEN MORE for this content. The Crew, plus the season pass, plus Wild Run, plus Calling all Units equals well over 120 dollars. Honestly Ubisoft, when does the money hoarding end?  Screw you, Ubisoft. I'd give anything to get my hands on one of your devs right now.

10493	I really looked forward to this game because the idea behind this is very appealing. But unfortunately Ubisoft didn't do a great job of implementing.  Positive things about this game, the map is huge and there is so much room for playing so that's certainly a good thing. The graphics are ok, but that is not something that bothers me too much. The idea to form a crew is also a good thing, but is poorly implemented and there are so much things to do with it to make it better, but they didn't. Faction races are great, but could be a lot better. For instance, make a race with a destination point and you can choose with route to take. The physics are not great, but not bad either. Only thing the cars should do is drift, instead of constant understeer.  So yeah, there are a lot of things that could be done better and it really dissapoints. This game had a massive potential to become something great, but it didn't take that chance. Maybe The Crew 2 will be better, if that game will ever arrive of course. Not something you should buy i say, unless you really really want to.
10494	They really dropped the ball. preordered this because i absolutely love cars and racing games, and it is fun as long as you dont mind the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over. Not to mention the lobbys that never work and the 1000s of bugs you will run into. If i could get my money back for my season pass and the game, i would in a heart beat. also once you max out there are only certain cars that can even compete so if you dont drive those specific cookie cutter cars you dont win -.-   do not buy this
10495	While the story is somewhat entertaining, the gameplay is really quite boring. There's literally nothing to do but race around, and while it is a racing game, the trailers hinted at other forms of gameplay and much more exciting cinematics. It's not a bad game, but its not a good game either. The story is pretty minimal compared to most games, and trying to tie this story into a continually running server-based platform makes for some really annoying drive times.  Also we were promised the whole country, as though that would be to scale. Nope. Everything has been scaled down so that most of the cities are a third of their actual sizes. I threw down a lot of money for this game because I thought I would be getting a lot out of it. Really, because of the setup we actually got, I say this game is worth no more than $30. If the animations and the LOD look right up your alley, you might be inspired to pay $40. But never is it ever worth the full AAA studio pricing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So now that we have Wild Run, I guess the only thing I can say is WHY didn't I get it with my season pass? Considering it adds modes like DRAG racing, DRIFTING, etc. that most racing games have from the start, I think it should have been a free update. I won't be wasting my money on Wild Run though. The gameplay as a whole is still really boring.
10496	I bought this game because it was developed by the same team behind Test Drive Unlimited, TDU and TDU2 weren't top notch games in terms of handling, but they had this 'charm', I found TDU2 so relaxing, I played it for hours and it was really fun just driving around the islands, it had its big flaws like the ridiculous handling but somehow it was fun.   I expected the same calm and relaxing mood from The Crew, sadly one of its biggest selling point was their worst feature IMO, the change to RPG style ruined the game, the idea was good but the IA of your opponents is completely crap, to the point that the game wasn't fun to me at all but frustrating, I really wanted to continue playing this game but I just couldn't, I don't have the time I had a few years ago and the fun isn't there anymore, that's why I cannot recommend this game to anyone, it's not a simulator and it's too arcade that it's not fun either, please note that I played this game with a Logitech G27 wheel, that made it worst because the game is intended to be played with gamepad for its ridiculous handling, TDU was playable but The Crew is not, and you can't progress through the missions if you don't level up, so you will find yourself wasting time on repetitive side missions in order to play the story missions.  I hope that in the future there will be another Test Drive Unlimited, with the same idea but improved, if I wanted to enjoy 20 minutes driving trhough the beautiful Hawaii and Ibiza, without feeling pressure to level up or completing frustrating missions TDU was the one, maybe I'm wrong because I thought The Crew was going to be that game, and the team had a completely different idea of the game, but this wasn't the game I expected.
10497	It is a great game, indeed, but when major content are behind paywalls, you know it is garbage.
10498	 Are you looking for a Next Gen racing experience? Go look somewhere else.    UPDATE: 01/11/15  After nearly 3 months after launch there were only 2 patches correcting minor stuff but not a single commitment from Ubisoft on addressing wanted features in the game.  The Steam user satisfaction dropped its recommendation from 96% to 77% and it will continue to go down as more people figure out how little this game offers after 20 hours - which is a ridiculous little time for a MMO. ---  CONTINUE TO STAY AWAY .   I've pre-ordered The Crew Gold +Season Pass expecting that all publishing on hard working to bring a new concept of game would be delivered. After my first 8 hours with the game I'm never ever buying Ubisoft games at launch anymore (As I'm already doing with Assassin's Creed franchise since Brotherhood).  The game isn't an evolution from what we've seen on the Beta phase, it is just a 'stability' upgrade in all aspects. To be honest, the only thing I've seen implemented from what was asked on forums during closed and open betas was the ability to change the gear faster while on manual shift, almost everything requested by the community was ignored.  To review the game I've used a Nvidia GTX-780 + i7-4770K overclocked, my personal impressions below:  - Are you ready for Ubisoft concept of MMO?  It was confirmed by Ubi Community Manager that the 'bug of few people per map' is in fact working as designed since they believe 8 player per map is OK. For a game where the selling point is 'Massive open world' this is a flaw.   - Don't expect to be able to play multiplayer, cause it isn't working as it should. It took me about 50 tries to be able to do 1 single coop mission since the message 'There is no one in your session' was constantly been displayed even while I could see about 10 players on the map screen.   - Do you like driving from cockpit and using the rear mirrors? Hopefully not cause they we're NOT implemented at all you will see is a gray piece of junk that since it isn't showing your rear shouldn't even be there. Surprisinly and adding 'more fun' to the randomness of this issue, when you put your view in 3rd person mode (behind the car)... TA DA! The mirrors magically start working! W-T-F!!! Lets pause for a little reflection:  Since 1987 we have working rear mirrors thanks to Test Drive 1 but not in this advanced 'next gen' title? There is no other racing series considering doing the same crap.  - Anti-Alising is so horribly implemented that even downsampling from 4K resolution to 1080p you will notice the jadded edges everywhere.  Specially when you're wandering inside cities hopefully you will not bother on blinking edges in general scenario elements like fences and light lamps, buildings and cars as you will be near to have a convulsion. Surprisinly AAs seems to had worked a lot better with 'wild nature' elements so trees and vegetation don't suffer in the same heavy way cities do;  This is my tweak guide to correct the game Anti Alising to an standard expected by a Next Gen title:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/617321352146025421/?tscn=1417713397  Still considering the fact that at DAY 2 I'm trying to manually override what was delivered in the 'official pack' , Customer Satisfaction is barely achieved on that aspect;  - Looking for Dynamic Lighting and Shadows? Bad for you cause your car and whatever is capable of emitting light doesn't create any shadows! Ugly absurd issues from WatchDogs are all back to terrorize people dreams of playing decent games;  - Your car is the only thing on the screen that seems to be made with more than 20 poligons. When compared with your own, all other cars and objects are ugly and seems to be toys or re-used models from games launched back from 90's - Specially Mini Vans - Maybe they have used the same from SEGA Crazy Taxi? Seems very similar to me.  ** This can be minimized using my Anti Alising guide - check the LOD BIAS section **  - Real bad textures. If you stay like 5 meters from any building you will few like playing GTA3. Ambient Occlusion made them feel more alive but they're all ugly and not even close to HD;  - Dust and smoke effects from Counter Strike 1.6 are better than what we can see here;  - Offline mode isn't working. You need to stay online on UPlay or, once you get in the game, it will ask you to connect to UPlay and restart it;  - There is no dynamic weather at all;  - Engine sounds are very generic;    TL;DR: As it is right now, there is no reason why you should buy this game for more than 20 dollars. If you want a good looking racing experience, buy Shadow of Mordor and ride a Warg. I ensure you that your experience would be better than any hype you may have here and you will have a really good game.  Besides that, give the game some time to have Ubisoft to fix its outstanding issues and the magicians from the internet to discover what Ubisoft have disabled under the hood to make it similar to the console versions.
10499	Every time I start the game(on windows 10), it crashed!
10500	While I finally got it running, the story and games are hardly worth playing. I bought this game to modify cars but It lacks everything I see in a game.  Has: cars, Customization (Extremely tight limit), races in general, police? sortof  Needs: Better leveling system, easier access to leveling, more car parts, less dlc, Normal fkn money system (For once would it hurt to be realistic?) less focus on dlc sales and more on the story and ability to actually play the whole game without suffering through story after story to get some sht parts they throw about on these pidly races. Not even worth my time to play.  This game is honestly not worth even sale price. this feels like a 2 or 3 dollar game I'd buy to mess around with friends but I wouldn;t want to inflect the horrerss of over priced dlc they cut from the game to make a quick buck.  Not to mention it's 3rd party so you might as well buy it on uplay because you'll be logging in there anyways to play it. Face it ubisoft, Your games are rushed and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Chopped up like ham for easy money.
10501	To give you an idea i was in the beta before i had even pre-ordered the gold edition.  ...I thought i liked this game and then game the delays, the broken servers, the crashing, no one on the servers, the microtransactions, the amount every car in the game costs ...seriously what car is that expensive, the falling through the map, the in car view is broken if you apply the handbrake during a turn, the buying of parts, the fact people were playing it before it was released, the broken physics, the fact that ive driven a 70s cadillac that feels like it would handle better than any of the cars in game, the fact that you dont get enough faction points or whatever to rank up at all seriously do you know how long a mission with good payout is. I still haven't been able to unlock my free supercar.  Ubisoft screwed the pooch again...like right after you release one broken game you decide to release another how do you do this. It's like the level of glitches and broken code in new vegas, but without the modability. The game feels like alot of ubisofts other racing games as well but combined all recycled ideas to creat a steaming pile of 'idea'.  The crew gold gives you a whole what 16 extra cars, for an extra $25. Think about that now that is alot of money for something i would consider what should be the size of one car pack. The crews Vehicle selection, what a fun topic. They seem to pick alot of old musclecars, some new muscle cars, some exotics, and 2 tuners..... a 370Z and an R34. No subaru's, no mitsubishi, no hondas, and no toyotas 'not even a supra, a legendary car'. Like do you hate imports that aren't considered exotics.   If you do buy it wait a year until the price drops significantly, then also wait for a steam sale.
10502	spent two hours trying to get the game from not crashing at start up. In the end i gave up and asked for a refund. 0/10 will be waiting for fh3 in sept :D
10503	All right, i bought it on friday, still trying to play... No fixes works.  People are saying it has a problem with NVIDIA Drivers...  I hope a can get all my money back.
10504	This game is supposed to be an MMO but it hardly feels like it. There's really nobody to play with. When I try to play a mission in 'co-op' it says there is nobody in my session. Also I can't see anybody on the map which is just...weird. This game is just single player in multiplayer...which means you have a single player game that you can only play online. This game is far from what it was advertised as. They showed us trailers which had multiple people playing together as a team but in reality not even a single bit of that happens. I can't even make a crew with my friend because it is bugged. I suggest staying away from this yet another bad release from Ubisoft.
10505	If you like to drive forklifts too fast (rear wheel steering), this is your game. Worst driving experience i've ever felt...I have been playing race games on a serious note since grand turismo for ps1...this is a disgrace to race fans.  The game has amazing graphics and a beautifuly large map. Outside of those two things the game leaves everything to be desired if you love racing games. I couldn't even force myself to enjoy the driving experience.
10506	An amusing game... unless of cause you lose connection to uPlay because then you can't play it because you can appearantly go to hell!!! JESUS CHRIST uPlay! Why!!
10507	Thinking about buying this game? Don't. Unless you plan on playing with a few friends, this game is absolutely horrible.  CONS:    60% of the campaign you're not allowed to play with friends.    Bots have PERFECT handeling, I mean P.E.R.F.E.C.T. handeling, making for extremely frustrating gameplay.    The amazing 'always online' gameplay is not entirely there. Sure there it's online but it's not what they make it out to be.    The bronze silver gold ranking for races are absolutely wonkers. For example, I was first place 94% of the race (according to the end race results), and by the finish of the race I had 10 seconds on the 2nd place runner. I not only had to restart a million times, but I had to make the other bots crash for me to get in first. I got a bronze medal.    Vehicle customization is not there what-so-ever. Most vehicles have near to no body kits, and it costs money out the â¥â¥â¥ to make your cars look cool.      PROS:   Game is pretty. Not gorgeous, but pretty.    Police chases are mediocre at best.  
10508	The Crew is a game with so much potential that it actually upsets me playing it at points. There are a few main points of contention I have with the game.  #1. The car list. Maybe there were licensing issues or something along those lines but the car list in this game is a massive disappointment. If you're making a game set in the entirity of the US give us some good American cars. I'd love to see classics like your C2 or C3 Corvettes, Pontiac Trans Am, Impalas, '60s Mustangs and even weird obscure stuff like a Buick Grand National. Another thing is that for a game released in late 2014 all the 'new' cars seem to be a few years old. For example you have a 2010 Camaro, a 2010 Challenger, a 2010 370Z, a 2010 Continental Supersports, a 2009 Corvette ZR1, a 2010 BMW Z4, A 2011 M5, a 2010 Focus RS, a 2011 Mustang, a 2012 V8 Vantage,a 2010 Viper, a 2011 Grand Cherokee, a 2011 F150 Raptor and a 2011 McLaren 12C. Maybe it was due to a lengthy dev time but it just seems strange to have a new racing game with a car list this slightly dated. Another thing that annoys me about the car list is that there is an R34 GT-R V-Spec that is Left Hand Drive, they only ever made them RHD that's why Americans who are into 'JDM' (That's another rant for another time) go crazy for them.  #2. The customisation. The vehicle customisation in this game is odd in that it's very in depth but also very limited. An example would be that I can put a stripe on my car but I can't change the colour of that stripe. All I want is a purple Camaro with a green stripe to give other players their daily dose but because of the arbitrary restrictions in the customisation menus I can't. All they had to do was emulate Forza or one of the PS2 era NFS games but Ivory Tower screwed that up.  #3. The vehicle classes. When this game was hyped in pre release and during the beta it was shown that every car could be used in every class (Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit) but when the game was released there were restrictions and limitations as to what car can be used with what class. For example a Golf GTI can only be used in Street spec which sucks because Street spec is garbage. A Dirt or Perf spec GTI would be fantastic but it can't happen because the game says so.  #4. The Physics. Not necessarily the driving physics, they're fine but they do start out pretty terrible (they improve as your car improves) but the crash physics and impact physics are screwed up beyond belief with my cars commonly performing physically impossible maneuvers. Another thing that isn't entirely physics related is that during the start of every race an animation plays where you cars rear wheels spin even if you have a front or all wheel drive car, as someone who likes detail in their driving games this upsets me greatly.  #5. Crew Credits. They're a currency you buy with real money. Need I say more?  #6. The 'MMO' aspect. This game is not an MMO. Ubisoft are lying to you, it might be multiplayer but it is 8 people per server and with a map this large you are spread out most of the time and barely have any interaction. The 'Never Drive Alone' tag was a lie as I spent most of my hours in this game driving alone.  What this game needs is a sequel made by more competent devs and with more attention to the little details. It also shouldn't be marketed as an MMO because it isn't.
10509	'there's a difference between actual difficulty, and things you can't do anything about.' -VGD  like forcing you to do an unskippable mission that's just a badly designed ad for their new game. In which you have to get right next to an enemy for 10 seconds, when he has a faster car, and flashbangs that make you swerve off the road even when you slam on the brakes immediately. You also only have 3 minutes to catch him even if you can still see him, so if you mess up you have to restart. and if you mess up in the begining you can't restart until after you get the prompt to pick your abilities (which you will have to pick again after you restart). Oh, and it stops you mid chase to pick out those useless abilities, then throws you back into a high speed chase with no warning when you exit. even after I beat that mission it just made me lose interest in the game.
10510	Well uh.. No. Just no it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mid range soulless ubisoft game that's all.
10511	after speaking with 3 different ubisoft techs, i am still able to not play this game, even though I have a great computer to run it on. Also heard that before the last update, it was running great and now most people cannot even get the game to start. CMON ubisoft, stop screwing this up!!!!! dont waste your money. The beta was awesome but its not worth it if you cant play the damn game!
10512	Big Map, Short Story, Waste money... DLC Wild Run only added 3 new spec &amp; no use in Story Mode
10513	I stopped playing a while back when they came out with the betta for wild 'cash grab'
10514	Runs worse than a cripple. Ubisoft please fix whatever you broke.
10515	It was okay before the new expansion. Now its an epic grindfest.
10516	Runs worse than a cripple. Ubisoft please fix whatever you broke.
10517	Big Map, Short Story, Waste money... DLC Wild Run only added 3 new spec &amp; no use in Story Mode
10518	I like this game very much but make sure you buy the full edition to get the full experince. If you only buy the crew,not the wild run editon you get a 2 hour trial.Get the full game or you get a ripoff.The handling was perfect,in the middle of arcade and realistic.The car models and game looked amazing.The storyline is great too.But get the full game or you get a ripoff. I rate 6/10.
10519	Triple A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I spent 60 sum odd dollars to play 'the Crew' but its now claiming my Trial is up and I need to purchuse 'Wild Run' to play 'the Crew' and im struggling to play the game I got on launch. it is poorly optomized, has constant issues and you have to play online.  We really need to stop feeding companys that relese crap (EA, Ubisoft, etc)
10520	Why is EA worst company in america? Because Ubisoft is in Europe.
10521	Nice map, cringeworthy physics, boring cliche story. Aspects of a free to play even though its not (Thanks Ubisoft)  This game is everything I didnt want this game to be...
10522	Do not buy this unless it's on a sale. Unless you have people to play with, don't buy it at all. Plus, the game has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Anti-Aliasing so even an OCd 960 with 4GB of VRAM can't run this at over 60FPS if the AA is cranked all the way up. A 960 is light years better than a GTX 580 (The recommended GPU) and it still can't max the game at an acceptable framerate. Also, after finishing the story, unless you want to go into PvP, you have nothing to do apart from roam around looking at the landscape. Which doesn't sound bad for a game like this but believe me. You get â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tired of just driving around doing nothing pretty quick. The story is really damn fun but if you put time into this game daily then that's over pretty quick. I just wish that this new expansion had added more story missions but nope. I bought this on sale for $35.99 CAD ($27.60 USD) and I feel ripped off   TL;DR : Unless you have people to play with, don't buy this. Even on a sale. Little content. Gets very stale after finishing the story.
10523	i want to refund this,but it already too late :(
10524	It doesnt seem like im drifting like in need for speed games. Running from the cops is literally impossible because they are faster than any train or rocket ship. The level does not matter when pvp and is complete ridiculous. Dont buy
10525	Now requires you to buy the crew wild run. was a good game until 3 hours later it said sorry your 'trial is over would you like to buy the crew wild run!' wtf would like my money back!
10526	just downloded the dlc with bikes and it f.ed my â¥â¥â¥â¥ up had to download uplay again and still wont open tho steam or uplay
10527	Ubisoft has created a new genre of racing game, it's neither arcade or realism, it's Ubisoft genre which is really, really bad.  This game is one of the worse racing games I've ever played.  The cops are like walls of brick.  I finished a quick activity where i needed to drive through the arrows and a cop was after me, it shouldn't since i was in an activity but oh well i end up the activity and now i can't to anything cause a window appear to show me my score and right after i was gonna click on something so I could retry it I got bursted... What the heck is that? There are many flaws other than that but In my opinion, that is the worse of them. It is an MMO but why is the connection always required? That's ********, In 1, 2 or 3 years, when the servers will close, what we'll do? Lost 100$ for a game that is not even worth 2$ that we won't even be able to play anymore?  I'm not pre-purchasing games from Ubisoft anymore, I got my lesson, thanks Ubisoft and congratulations.  Seriously, If I could get a refund I would ask for a refund right now. Now I'm stuck with an horrible game to finish. I thought that this game would be so great, I'm really disappointed to be honest. It could have been a really great game. 2/10 (I can't give it more than 2, I'm not even sure if it does deserve 2 to be honest). The 6/10 review is way too good, a 6/10 game is a under-average game and this game is far but really far away from that. Facts are facts. This game is crap, it's not a simulation, do not believe those idiotic morons who says that this game feels like a simulation one, it's pure arcade, the problem is not that this is an arcade game, the problem is a that it is a really, but really bad arcade game. It feels like a Pay2Win game (or spend a lot, but a lot of time grinding for crap) that I have paid 110$ for. Of course I'm done pre-purchasing games, from any developers, developers and publishers are cancer nowadays, the only game I am glad I pre-purchased even If i didn't not play it alot back then, was the Witcher 3 because it has content, the price was okay and it doesn't have crappy greedy 'we're too incompetent and brainless, we need your money, feed us with your money, we're w**res' microtransactions.   People who pre-purchased the game (such as me, not pre-ordering any Ubisoft or EA Games never again, never did with Activision, Treyarch and Infinity Ward) paid 110$ for this piece of trash that required you to be online 24/7 if you want to play, the season pass is not worth **** and the game is made by a bunch of pathetic incompetents, we barely got any content and we have to pay for crappy 'expansions' that should be in the season pass since we got barely anything off it. Like always, they're lying, they says that there's more than 100 cars on this game but there is NOT, it's just different variations (dirt, street, raid, etc). You can't say that there's more than 100 vehicles, that's just bu**sh** and you know it. The driving is horrible, the handling is horrible. The physics are simply horrible, the physics were better in many 2000 racing games than in this one for fu**'s sake. Microtransactions on a 110$ game. The cops catch you way too fast (you stop for a second and you are already under arrested, that is not realistic at all). After finishing a challenge, It brings a screen with your score and stuff but if you have cops after you then you'll get arrested and you can not do anything about it. They sell DLCs that should come free with the game, let's be honest, anyone with gray matter and who know how a computer works can make meshes and textures, animations are more complicated but if you spend the time learning, you'll be able to do something way better than what those morons at Ubisoft did. There's not many vehicles and they all feel the same but with different speed. Microtransactions on a 110$ game. Now they sell an expansion that people who bought the season pass should have for free. I could say a lot more but I'll stop here, well done Ubisoft, well done, you are seriously pathetic and your name is the definition of 'greed' and 'incompetent'. Wait, did I said that this game has motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing transactions? Because there is.  In my case, he only reason to keep playing this game, It's because I paid 110$ for this crap so better make it worth it even if the game is in all honesty, sh**.  And it will probably be too late in a few years when they will close the servers, will they add a offline mode? Seriously, I doubt it, we're talking about Ubisoft after all, a bunch of brainless, worse than headless chickens, ****oles.  I'm always straight when it comes to facts.  Save yourself some money and do not buy this game, they're probably going to close the servers way before 2018 and they probably won't even add an offline mode, if they do, then I'll be impressed and they'll deserve an award for being somehow competent. This game should be free to play, seriously, just stay away from it.
10528	This game was quite a letdown, to be honest.  The physics are awful, every car handles like it is front-wheel-drive, any collision will send you into either a cutscene, or will shove you into oblivion,  Traffic will spawn randomly causing more collisions and annoying cutscenes, The story is flimsy at best, Objectives are repetitive, Map is large, but sparsely populated with cities, and the cities that do exist in game are much smaller than they should be. Police chases lack any real substance (all they do is follow) Lack of cars Lack of customization The customization that the game does include feels like it came straight out of F&amp;F   The Crew almost feels like it should have been released about 10 years ago with NFS: Most Wanted, because that is exactly what this game reminds me of.
10529	An amazing game for us 60fps racers but lacks being able to restart the story and or game to enjoy all over again which is absurd as the game save is on ubisofts server and unable to delete. apparently only option to play from scratch is to buy it again. If i had to do that with any need fo speed game and counting how many times ive replay`d those games i would have paid thousands. If ubisoft gives us this option i would give 10/10 but 5/10 as its an impoant feature to all games otherwise many great games would be long forgotten.
10530	Meh, just because Assassins was awful to i got this game for free, and even that way i just don't like it: - Bad Graphics, feels like NFS but withouth fun
10531	Mediocre, racing machanics are good but their is nobody around. very boring
10532	If you are looking for a good racing game, do not get this one. The steering feels unresponsive and the car physics are terrible.
10533	Idioticly bad steering, AI is always ahead, whatever you do, can't change difficulty, got to go back and get a platinum everywhere if you want to buy anything at all.... 0.2/100
10534	â¥â¥â¥â¥ i cant launch this game,i dont know why  i launch the game and nothing happen, i try again and same like that NOTHING HAPPEN  FIX THIS !!!!
10535	I like the ideea of the game and where it's heading, but i don't like that I had to pay that much for the basic game version and then I would have to pay more for the cars and upgrades! I mean, if you want money, name your price for all pieces of the game and not only for chunks of it !
10536	I bought the ultimate edition of this game (which came with the season pass) and when the new dlc 'Calling All Units' came out I excited to get to try out the full version of the dlc. I never got the dlc the ultimate edition doesn't include the new dlc and that was what I was told by steam support so don't waste your money on ultimate edition unless your ok with being ripped by Ubisoft.
10537	With this new update, â¥â¥â¥â¥ man you guys have to fix a LOT, seriously.  - The race guilde line. ( the ones that tells you where to go and when to hit the brakes or gas ) is completely broken, it was never that fantastic, but it was playable, but now it constantly tells you you're off track or the line just completely dissappears. example: I was just playing a faction race in the south, one of more than 1 hour long ( according to the game... ) and after every check point the line dissappears after about half a mile after you hit the checkpoint, you're better off without than with the raceline.  - Setback to track. djeezes, that one is one of the worst things there is to complain about rn. IT BLOODY SET'S YOU BACK TO THE PREVIOUS CHECKPOINT INSTEAD OF JUST BACK ON THE TRACK. During my faction race in the south there I had lead of more than 1 minute, they were more than 4 or 5 miles behind me, I crash into another car, I get reset, â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HALF A MILE BEHIND THE CARS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY 5 MILES BEHIND ME. and it didn't happend just once, happend multiple times. and now that I'm writing about setbacks, if you go off track for too long with a street, dirt, perf or circuit car and you wanna get a setback it sets you in the middle of where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you are, everywhere but on the road.  - Guardrails. whenever you're going with a decent speed over the highway ( or any road ) and you end up sliding along a guardrail if you don't watch out it'll stop you at an instant. flip your car to the other side of a road or just crash your car completely. seriously? I lost soo many times because of this glitch. along with all the other â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up stuff, look into it and fix it.  I used to enjoy this game a LOT, played over 200 hours on it because I really did like this game, but not anymore, with the new update that went live couple of hours ago, there is soo much to fix, seriously. I like this update with the cop cars and stuff, but instead of being greedy to money and making a new dlc, focus more on glitches and bugs in the game. I do know you probably have a team working on that, but put more people on that team because with this update, you have a LOOOOT or work to do.
10538	Good game but doesn't work anymore game crashes soon as you press play on steam or uplay not very happy 25 pound game unplayable with no fixes
10539	I'm sure this is a great game. I wouldn't know because the game didn't work. From the moment I first downloaded the game and launched it, it didn't work. It would say that 'The crew game stopped working'.
10540	bought game. downloaded. installed. updated all drivers just cause it said i should. 3 hours later finally load game. and what does it tell me? oh. no. you cant play unless you buy wild run too. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you ubisoft.
10541	I was a big fan of TDU2 and this looked a lot like it, which sold me enough to pre-order. 20hrs later and i am as bored and restless as a kid without his ritalin. There is simply nothing to really do in here. There is a story line and little mini trials to get better parts to put on your car, and thats about it. What I really loved in tdu2 was setting up races for the community by going to the street, laying out the checkpoints then racing it to establish a time to beat, also had modes like follow the leader so you and your buddies could enjoy racing against a course as a team instead of just against each other all the time.   I found the car selection to be very limited compared to tdu2 and the physics of the cars didnt feel tight like when you are pushing your own modified car down the street at 100+.   It is a beautiful game that runs well turned up to full 4k resolution, but if you have ever had a pretty girlfriend that sucks to talk to and do stuff with then this game should make you feel like you are right back there again,. Have two friends that bought and played this and everytime we talk about playing or do log in, we just kind of sit there and feel like, what now?  This most disappointing part is you are probably really looking forward to going to somewhere you drive all the time and checking out how close it is. Ill save you the trouble, it isnt. Im from utah and the entire state looks a bit like a generic park city. Many of the places i have gone and traveled to from here i tried to recreate unsuccessfully.   I really want a good driving simulator that does a good job of recreating states, this wasnt it.
10542	I cannot reccomend this game in its current state. It's in a obvious beta form, which is unthinkable given how there were 3 open betas before release. It's like Ivory Tower has never made a driving game before. And it IS a driving game, not a racing game. It's all variations of 'point-a-to-point-b' in this game, unless you're being chased by the police or a gang.   The AI racers rubberband incredibly badly, the AI police/gang chase vehicles are moving brick walls that can go faster than you on any terrain and can only be outrun through sheer luck. Totally unplayable to people who don't min/max. Sometimes in Freeroam a cop will glitch out and try to arrest you, even though you don't have a wanted level (though him ramming you will cause you to gain one soon enough).   The car handling model is hellishly bad when the car is low level and either fun but challenging or boring as hell at high levels depending on the car.   The graphics are outdated and has a fair share of bugs. The antialising (aka the anti-pixelation stuff) is pretty much nonexistent, which makes areas with lots of foliage an eyesore.   The instances flat out don't work. You can't ever connect to friends or even your crew once you've moved out of the instance you met in, unless you get rematched together out of sheer luck.   PvP isn't balanced at all. If you crash once, you lose. If you don't have a fully-specced supercar, you lose. Simple.   Money is attained primarily through a system wherein people on your friends list can be used as ammo to start a 3-hour timer to do faction missions in order to get 1/4 the award of the normal payout. All other moneymaking is completely moot.   The endgame is an interminable grind to max out your favorite cars whilst also micromanaging the above-mentioned grinding system.   The cars are not very varied- the majority are american muscle cars and random supercars, with a few european tuners here and there.   The car parts system is not very well explained (what each part do, etc.) and boring as hell, especially given how to get the best parts you must gring the same jump, speed or hill climb 'skills' for around twenty minutes each for each part for each car. Alternatively, you can spend money to buy parts you unlock for one car for the rest of the same spec. This costs a lot of bucks (ingame cash) but not much crew credits (microtransaction money). Hm...  Visual customization is pretty varied for each car but you can't ever equip the stock parts of the Fullspec vehicle. Annoying.  Specs are not well thought out. Circuit, Perf and Street are all for road driving in descending order of effectiveness. There's no downside to using a circuit over a perf or a perf over a street. Just straight upgrades. Dirt and Raid could have been rolled into one without an issue (Raid goes better off road, dirt goes better on dirt roads).   The story is one of the worst I have ever seen, with extremely cardboard characters and a boring revenge plot that has a totally contrived happy ending and no direction whatsoever. Attempts to be heartwarming or funny fell flat, except for one occasion that made me crack a smile; one Chinese 'Vaas' expy in big debt once enthusiatically said simply 'Money money money money money!' to remind me to do a mission to help him.  Story missions are cookie-cutter from something like four or five types but with arbitrary additions, i.e. a 'A-to-B' (they actually call them that) could be 'don't take damage' or 'you've got a time limit' or 'you have to escape pursuit before you reach the destination', often without even any in-story justification. Sometimes an NPC will be in the car, giving you an infodump that you probably won't pay attention to while you haul â¥â¥â¥ trying to complete the objectives. Or maybe they'll just yell at you every time you bump something using the same three lines.   Ubisoft and Ivory Tower failed on every count reguarding this game. This is despite the Betas and the fact that we know Ubisoft knows how to make a good racing game from Driver: SF. It's incredible how bad this game is. I only play it because I want to get my $85's worth, and I'm hoping they'll fix most of these issues in due time. Knowing Ubisoft, it'll just be more DLC and mircrotransactions, but just maybe...   TL;DR This game has literally every bad element of every bad driving game ever. Don't buy it.   
10543	It has a OK story even tho we all could have seen that coming but there is alot in this game that they should do something about!   Plez Fix: Mirrors (i mean come on in the trailer you have mirrors and they work when you look outside the car but not inside) Way too OP cops (No way a car like that could make you go from 360km/h to 0 in just 2 sec by braking infront of you) AI cars that just spawn in whenever they feel like it (usually right infront of you) More Cars (Just the usual cars they have in all racing games) More Customization (There can never be enough of this) And the servers that usually derp out (sucks for people with poor upload speed)  3/10 I payed way to much for this â¥â¥â¥â¥  not worth it unless its ATLEAST 75% off
10544	Absolute piece of rubbish. From the unwanted Wild Run 'upgrade' that is one big advertisement for the Wild Run DLC, to the inexplicable graphical and physics bugs, and the rubberbanding AI, stay away from this game. It doesn't matter if you are a fan of racing games or massive open worlds, this game is not worth your time. Trust me, I've played 100+ hours and I just had the final straw. While playing a long-running faction mission (&gt; 1 hr long) the road disappeared and left me unable to steer, accelerate or brake. I had to abort the mission. The usual fix of bringing up the map doesn't work because you can't bring up the map during missions. If you are a fan of games that have a well-designed difficulty progression then this game is not for you, either. Some missions are overly easy and others that are ranked as easy are next to impossible. Likewise, some hard-ranked missions are way too easy. It's as if random goals were set for each mission and the difficulty rankings were randomly set as well. That said, if you like games where you have to grind to progress, then this game is for you. Not only do you have to grind for upgrades, but just playing the game is a grind. In my experience the most fun thing to do in the game is to free drive with your friends, and not the game itself.
10545	well i have a bad feeling about this game  and yeeppp it is true  i must buy another edition?  well nope
10546	â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU GUYS WHO MADE THS I JUST BOUGHT THE GAME AND THE NEXT DAY I HAVE TO BUY THE WILD RUN EDITION SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU GUYS WHO MADE IT AND WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY  
10547	Since the Wild Run dlc came out it has broken fraction missions, and endless black loading screen when fast traveling or playing missions. The only thing you can do is resart the game. Not worth buying at all.
10548	Internet Error Every Time This Is A Piece Of â¥â¥â¥â¥ !
10549	This game has a lot of potential. The biggest problem I have is the AI is ridiculously overpowering when running from police. They are like tanks that accelerate faster than any car you can buy. They will push you right off the road but are impossible to be moved or budged themselves.   Also, the handling on some of these cars is whack. Not so bad that the game can't be played, and I really like the game even with the ridiculously hard to kill cops.   There aren't very many people playing this game, dare I say 'yet'?   This game seems to be one of those game where you buy it and get hooked, and then they start releasing more stuff at extra charges. It'd be nice someone made a complete game before they sold it to people.  All in all, I like the game, and will keep playing, but only because I've already got it.
10550	Mediocre game.... It had great potential and missed the mark in several ways.   - handling is off , wayyyyy off. Feels like assasins creed controls were just switched over into a racing game.  - AI is crap - Servers are crap  - Low graphics quality it spots it shouldnt be ( textures, other cars on the road ect )   I am interested to see more games of this nature come out... I feel this had great potential , but wasnt quite what I was expecting... 70 / 100. Will look into the series when the next one comes out.. maybe.
10551	It has a OK story even tho we all could have seen that coming but there is alot in this game that they should do something about!

TL;DR This game has literally every bad element of every bad driving game ever. Don't buy it.   
10557	I may have enjoyed my time playing this game, but I can't run from the fact that the game is wasted potential. I really only enjoyed my gamtime bacause I was was playing with friends. The game is fine for the first 20-30 hours of gameplay, but after that the game feels like a chore. Locking in every 3 hours to get money bacause it's to boring to acually earn money yourself doesn't mean that a game is fun
10558	Are you sick of good games? Do you want to be unable to play a game? Then here it is the Crew! Yes the Crew, the only released game that crashes every 20 minutes and has exclusive bugs from the beta which are not fixed.
10559	I would recommend this game, but I am not buying any more DLC until they fix their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing servers. They earn enough money they could upgrade every single server they have, but no. Sorry Ubisoft, but I am not buying anymore of your â¥â¥â¥â¥. Once you guys make it better, Ill change my ratings.
10560	  Pros   - Decent wheel support for an 'arcade driving' title. At least with a Logitech G27. - OK car physics and handling. Hardcore 'petroheads' are probably going to laugh at this but from my experience, car handling is fun AND challenging. - Huge and very diverse environment. Driving game with huge environment are not exactly common so... - Nice graphics during sunrise and sunset: Very impressive lightning.    Cons   - Extremely poor support of TrackIR. Cannot even look behind with it while you can with the mouse! - Glitches: All over the place. Floating cars, 'cars inside' the road, floating rocks, slight but constant stuttering when loading assets. Heck, during a cut-scene, my car literally went through a prop in the scene! - Intense network rubber banding/teleportation of other players cars. - Washed out, ugly lightning effect during storm and raining... Nights are also very dark. Lightning is not consistent: Range from superb sunrise/sunset to WTF moments at night and during cloudy weather.  - The game use some sort of 'instancing' where players are not necessarily going to encounter each other, even when exactly at the same spot on the map. - Lots of DLC exclusive content and 'buyable with real currency' cars. Not a fan of the latest. - Of course, UPlay, which totally sucks. Add another layer of unneeded complexity to the whole experience.   So, if I could, I would give a 'maybe' rating. But I can't so, I have to rate it negatively.  If you like sand box, non-hardcore driving game, you might find it interesting. Exploring the map is a blast... but expect glitches. Get it during a sale at 50%-80% rebate.
10561	I am in two minds about this game. The gameplay itself is quite enjoyable, it's an arcadey racer much like Driver San Francisco. But there are far too many flaws for me to recommend this.   1) The grind! If you want a decent car you better be prepared to either grind tedious missions over and over or buy some in game credit. Most missions net you 2k, but top of the range cars come in at 700k not including the tuning which some will set you back 500k. That's a lot of grinding for little reward.  2) The story is abysmal, I didn't care at all about what was going on or who these people were. Which would be ok if it wasn't for;  3) The missions. The missions in this game is the same repetitive few types with different locations/cars. It will either be a race (by far the best), an escape from the cops mission, a checkpoint time trial or a Smugglers Run esque cargo smash. That is as deep as they get and you will soon get bored.   4) Little reward. I don't really consider this a spoiler and I think perspective buyers should be aware. There is no reward for completing the story. No car. No paint job and just the same diddly amount of cash as the rest of the missions.    5) Always online and Uplay. Not really an issue for me but understand this is important for people with limited internet connections  That being said there are some positive points to this game. The map is huge and full of landmarks, the Wild Run add on creates a bit more variety, and if you manage to get a crew cruising round the U.S.A can be fun.    I have played this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and it will work ok, but the arcade controls are far more suited to a controller, both controller types are supported well with mappable button configs.  All in all I can't really recommend this game, especially not at full price, but it may be worth a punt on sale if you are looking for an easy on the eye arcade racing sandbox. It is what it is, and is easilly worth getting on the cheap for the map and crew antics alone.
10562	This is a full priced game that if you buy it after about 2 hours of playing it tells you to buy a $30 dlc to continue playing the game. Do not buy, such a rip off.
10563	At the moment The Wild Run has broken the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, Ingame it tells you that you have The Wild Run, It even give you missions and cars, and when you try to drive to that location, your game will crash, and you wont be able to close the game unless you open task manager.  Until they fix The Wild Run, stay away from this game. It's a great game, but this update had â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken it.
10564	When im being chased by police in this game it makes me rage more than call of duty because you can be 2 miles away and somehow their crown victoria can catch up to you within 5 seconds.   Pros : - Great map, it's really awesome; - Graphics are good; - Cockpit view, the interiors are well designed; - Simcade driving is fun; - Many specs ( Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Circuit ).  Cons: - Lack of cars, only 47 fullstock cars (if I'm not wrong.); - Exterior car custimization is just poor: - 200 rims ? And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors.  - The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights. - Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them; - The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against. - Cockpit view: - When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent. - In cockpit view your mirrors don't work; - AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down.  - Some of the game physics are just out of this world: - You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked. - You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h; - PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly. - In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.  (...)  And there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to 'farm' money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week. Because you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.  Should you buy the game? Yes/No. - Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted. - No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this.   To me this was the most expensive 'early-acess' that I've ever bought.
10565	Game would be good if it didn't contain so many connection issues. Gameplay is great, the cars feel great but not being able to play because of random disconnects. Would not recommend as of now.
10566	What you should expect from and MMO-Racing game -- at least:  - MMO - Racing  What you are NOT getting, when you buy 'The Crew':  - MMO - Racing  What you are getting, when you buy 'The Crew':  - 8 other players, somewhere far, far away doing thier stuff, wasting your time while you are tossing unanswered invites to your story events, which are useless to them, or while staring and starving in the PVP lobby - Mediocre, unfair, story driven 'checkpoint-in-time-reaching' with rubberbanding AI cars around you  At least the first 4 hours were great fun ... I will refer to them as 'potential' and combine it with 'wasted'. I hoped for patches ... some love ... a way ... a plan ...  I stopped. Sad. 
10567	Liked the game at first for it's open world and things to do.  In end I find it hard to keep playing because the car simulation is just too lacking when you can take street turns at 80 mph and stop on a dime.  The MMO aspect is not really deserving of the name.
10568	WHen I try to run this game the Uplay app starts up automatically asking me to porchase this game again.  CD key while installing tells me that the game is for another region (so it wont activate)  i am nor able to play this game. nor am i able to activate this game.   ITS SUCH A WASTE TO PURCHASE 'THE CREW GOLD'
10569	I have to say this game is sometimes horible to play on the pc. I mostly got it because of the story and the fact you got to drive in the US. But this game is glitchy at times and the scenary is mostly bad. Of course though this game is suited for low graphics range that makes the game more playable but makes the scenary worse. I don't reccomend you get it on the pc but do get on the PS4. If you have shortage of screen cut off that is mostly because you may not have 1080p. That is okay, still play it!
10570	I don't really recommend it, it was way over-hyped and is terrible in many ways. The beta was way better. After the beta and release, the AI rubberbands and it's terrible, the servers suck, and the car health and damage was taken out. ------------ Pros: - Huge World, variety of envrionments, cockpits are nice, some envrionments look nice. ------------ Cons: - TERRIBLE physics, terrible AI, Terrible races, cop chases, the cities are tiny, a lot of copy and paste, could use more cars, customization was over-hyped, boring story and campaign, poorly optimized, servers suck (NOT AN MMO), micro-transactions (After spending $60, really?), speedometer is off, roads feel like ice, damage physics are bad and weird, Uplay, and the fact it's published by Ubisoft. ------------ It would of been a cool racer, but all of these things make it quite boring and very over-hyped and dissapointing. Ubisoft probably pushed the game so it screwed up. ------------ Even on sale, don't purchase, you'll be dissapointed.
10571	For a game that was intended to be fully about player custimization and choices. As well as a huge diversity in the way you drive. This game falls short. Extremely short. This is by far one of the worst excuses for a racing game I have ever seen, after the first hour or two, you'll be completely bored and out of will to do more of the grindy missions, with the generic story. But then again, it's a Ubisoft game, we can't get our hopes up with them folks, they are one of the WORST names in gaming as of 2016, stop buying their cashgrabs and trash, I surely will.
10572	I would recommend this if it wasnt for the fact you cannot reset your career and Ubisoft have refused to address this since release.
10573	I want to like this game. I really really do. But, I just can't. After tons of hours played, the game's mechanics halt the fun. From cops and traffic to 'wow' style car upgrades, you can't get over the fact that this game's 'arcade' feel isn't arcade at all.  The game is bad. There's no way else to put it. I've played the game for hundreds of hours and given it chance after chance after chance. I love the car selection. I love the map size. I HATE the game! The game RUINS the experience completely.  The story is SO cheesy and bad. It's just bad, bad, bad. It's as if a passionate professional made half a car simulation game, then a buch of dumb teenagers took that idea and made it into a wow-like mmo loot system with the most ODD objectives NO ONE in a car would EVER do.  The traffic and cop AI is .. well, it's non existant is what it is. Take how bad it was in NFS Rivals times about 10,000 or so and you have how bad the AI is in this game. It's bad.  The game is bad. The game is bad. The game is bad.
10574	This is the worst game i have ever played. In freedrive, the moves good, but when the race starts its like a completly different car. The car suddenly moves very slow in the race nstead of moving like it was in freedrive.  Cmpared this cheap game, Need For Speed is way better with car controlling.  I never prefer/recommend this game to my friendz. :(
10575	Its Not good Optimized, it has a lot of bugs ffb and wheel settings doesnt feel ok. But the world is nice to see.
10576	have to pay 40 bucks to play the game they actually advertized
10577	IT WAS FUN THEN UPLAY MESSED UP MY EXPERINCE HAD 2 HOURS OF GAME STILL GOT A REFUND CHALLENGE ACCEPTED UPLAY... YOU will Never win UPLAY CAUSE IPLAY 
10578	Best trailer,best opening..BUT worst story,big map,long distant,story tooooooooooooooooo short.Buy many cars and bikes ready for battle, but less using.....the foe..GREAT DAMN Foe!!!! Too dark in the NIGHT!!! you need to buy your own a night vision device..The opening did well, but you NEVER have any change to play just like the trailer did... The best of this game is.....TRAILER &amp; OPENING!!! Drive WILD!!
10579	â¥â¥â¥â¥
10580	As a driving game this is pretty good. Big map to drive, looks ok, runs ok (60fps cap). Arcade to drive. but has some wierd technical issues.... Don't know even where to begin. Well you need to start BOTH steam and UpLay to start the game. getting the dlc to work was really hard... And even trial version was still installed when I bought the real version.... When I close the game, it says the Crew is still running... So long story short: the game is OK but has some technical issues. Fix those ' Ivory Tower in collaboration with Ubisoft Reflections' developers
10581	Me Giving a Bad Rep for this game doenÂ´s mean that I wouldnÂ´t recommend it all, but the thing is: The game has too much going against it to really recommend it.   The game throws you right into the Actionand it gives you some nice cars to play with right from the get go and within the first few hours of gameplay you get to drive cars from 4 of the 5 Spec sets so you can get a glimpse of what lies ahead. And you can do all that either on your own or in Co-Op with a Crew of either some random people or with your friends. The game tries to tell a story about revenge and stuff, but it is so narrow with unintresting characters that it makes Fast and Furious look like The Godfather in comparsion. However I do like the variety in gameplay, you get to drive some races, escape the cops every once in a while, take down a target, destroy some boxes for reasons or just try to get to the finish line within a timelimit. All that both on- and off-road.   I also like the huge map, you need roughly 90 minutes to get from New York City to Los Angeles, and just to make sure that you donÂ´t get bored during your road trips you get tons of little Skill Challenges all over the Place, these range from jumps to Race Line challenges and you can win parts to updgrade your car and money in these challenges. The Map itself is basicly a compressed Hollywood Version of the entire USA (not Including Alaska and Hawaii) without all that boring stuff. ItÂ´s the first time in an Open World Racing game that I donÂ´t feel that the game world is limited too much.  You can visit tons of famous Towns and Landmarks, the map also Includes some, honestly bad, recreations of real life racetracks, you get everything from the time Square to the Hollywood Hills, you can drive up the Pikes Peak or reach insane Speeds on the Boneville Salt Flats, you can Visit Mount Rushmoore, the Swamps in the Southern Regions, take a road trip along the Route 66. You get the point.   The Car Handling takes a while to get used to, but once you figured out how to drift around corners it gets much easier because you would have to slow down way too much to drive around corners the regular way.  However here is why I donÂ´t recommend it, and uPlay isnÂ´t any of the reasons, I donÂ´t mind it too much. The game requires you to be online all the time, if the servers goes offline for whatever reason or you loose the connection the game throws you out of whatever you are doing, even if that means that loose your 3 Hour Progress into an almost 4 Hour long race. However there is no real reason that the game has to be connected to a server at any point because you can do everything on your own. Also the game is NOT an MMO in the classical sense, while in Free Drive you randomly drop In and Out off Online Lobbys, players inside a Lobby can Invite others into their Crew and play Story-, Faction- and PVP-Events together. A Crew can have up to 4 Players and all 4 will Drop In and Out off the Sessions together. While it works, it almost feels like a gimmick to me.  I have a feeling that the car Levels and Perks donÂ´t mean anything, at least when there is AI Involved. The game has some of the worst rubberbanding AI I encountered in over 20 Years of playing Racing games, even with cars close to Level 900 you canÂ´t really drive away from the Low Level AI in the earliest Missions th game has to offer. When Playing PvP the Car Levely do Matter, however a goog driver can still beat a car that is 200+ Levels above him when the other driver isnÂ´t that experienced. The whole concept is untransparent, you never get a feeling that all the carparts you collect even do anything.  Also it throws you the Option for Microtransactions in your Face every time you are anywhere where you can buy stuff within the game. You can get everything without ever using them, but I get a strong feeling that you donÂ´t earn money fast enough in the game so they can sell more micro Transactions.
10582	I mean isn't bad like AC Unity, but it just isn't fun. The camera is infuriatingly jelly-like, and has microtransactions everywhere. And other than that there just isn't that much to do once you've done a few races and missions, and done the obligatory cross country roadtrip. 5/10: 'Meh'
10583	Ubisoft launcher â¥â¥â¥â¥. Constantly stuck on loading screens. Cant get past Vegas story mission. Horrible desync between COMPUTER CONTROLLED AI. MMO Driving games should not exist. Avoid.
10584	Perf spec PvP race:  Use fully upgraded 1299 Koenigsegg Agera R with 'Top Speed Bonus' and lose to a Pagani Huayra on the straight road with the same upgrade.  Use fully upgraded 1299 Pagani Huayra with 'Top Speed Bonus' and lose to a Koenigsegg Agera R on the straight road with the same upgrade.   My name is Brian BTW. 
10585	Got the gold edition. This game is absolutely TERRIBLE. It crashes randomly for no apparent reason after 5-10 minutes of gameplay.. MANY people in the Steam community have had this issue for a very long time, and only with this game... Despite numerous complaints in Steam forum and the game developers forums; they have not fixed this issue at all. All the $ I invested into this game bought a BIG frustrating headache of inablity to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time without it crashing. I re-installed the Operating System and all the latest drivers twice, on two seperate machines and then re-installed this game twice and the problem did not get resolved. This is NOT a hardware issue, but a well known problem reported by many who own this game--that has not been fixed in many, many months. Trust me please, save your $ and don't buy this!! If they fix it I will change my review, but until they fix it DO NOT BUY IT. You will deeply regret it as so many of us have.
10586	You pay full price for this game, then they want money for DLC, you buy DLC, then they charge 3 bucks extra for a car. How about go eff yourselve Ubishit.
10587	[Closed BETA Review] Finally a good competitor against NFS. I'm a huge fan of NFS series myself. I have all PC versions of them since 1994. And i can tell, in my opinion, that this game made the perfect balance that EA didn't do in 20 years: A vast and consistent open world (also real places), mix the simulation and arcade style, and have cars for other purposes (Dirt and Raid). Looking forward to see the final version.    [Final Version Review] Although i maintain most of my previous statements, after playing almost 100 hours, here's my considerations:  -They managed to make a worst history telling than EA. Too much clichÃ¨, weak story.  -No invisible walls! NICE! -The car selection is modest, but they say there will be more cars, so ok... -They could improve the physiscs. -The graphic is amazing. I give you that. -There are races with 2h duration on the game that award a good money. But UPlay is very unstable and after a few frustrations i quit trying to do that races, because if you're disconnected for some reason (most of the case is their fault), you lose the race and all your effort. -The police has some tactics, do PIT maneuvers, has helicopters, but i think there could be more challenge. Also spike strips, rhino units and faster backups. -The car tuning and custom parts are good. Could be more options though. -The rubberband AI levels in this game is too damn high! -Although they say it's a car MMO, you can only see 7 players max. Also, i rarely found someone to play with. -And most important. There's micro transactions in the game. They're not vital, though. I bought several times and the transaction got bugged. Took weeks to receive the proper credits.   [Wild Run Review] Now they f... up So they managed to make you pay for the base game and buy credits to decently progress in the game. What a shame...
10588	This is what I have been waiting for a long time,The Crew may be the top list on my wish games but it gave me the wrong idea of buying this game.First of all the story was good,and the car look good too,and what suck of it is that the car spec that it couldn't even drive well.Its just a waste of money
10589	I want to like this game. I really really do. But, I just can't. After tons of hours played, the game's mechanics halt the fun. From cops and traffic to 'wow' style car upgrades, you can't get over the fact that this game's 'arcade' feel isn't arcade at all.  The game is bad. There's no way else to put it.

The game is bad. The game is bad.
10590	Prelude and Tl;Dr   I beta-tested The Crew back when it was first announced for beta, and at that point I believed there was true potential to the game. The story, while cliche, wasn't terrible like some other racing games of late. A large and open world full of sights, and iconic cars. BUT, as release came, I am left wondering what if anything they did, Servers are worse than anything I have experienced, Only 25ish cars, physics that beg belief, and a map upon further inspection leaves you scratching your head in disbelief at the laziness of the devs. So no I do not recommend this game, it has some good moments in the free driving, yet you still have that nagging presence of all the issues and poor quality.  The map  One of the positive things of the Crew is the map, it is big, ~100km across and has some detail in it. Honestly you can spend hours driving and still be discovering new places, which makes cruising down a road and being able to say, 'what is that' and go find out the best part of the Crew. However the map has massive issues, a mesh that makes even games from the 90's shudder to look at. Case in point, just driving over a desert, which is pretty flat, you will occasionally ramp off and spin out, all due to such a low polygon count that the ground is jagged and often impractical. It is bad enough I will not use my FFB wheel in the crew due to the jolts it will give the mechanisms in the wheel. The textures are barely passable for a game of 2014, and often are quite lack luster. And the bounding boxes on object and the road often do not match the objects and can cause frustrating moments as you spin off or stop dead due to a fence or some invisible outcrop in a building. MAP (6/10).  The Cars  there are only ~25 of them, and there isn't much different between them when they are in the respective specs. Also the specs available to put on a car are limited, some cars can have all, while others can only have one spec installed. AWD cars feel like FWD cars, RWD cars feel like drift cars. The Physics are at their best are abysmal and often cause a moment of frustration followed by eruption of laughter as your car is catapulted from hitting a foot high rock into the sky. There is also a general disregard to grip as cars tend to slide more than turn. CARS(5/10) PHYSICS (3/10)  The Specs  The specs offer the true differences between cars as some will be off-road 'capable' (nothing is prepared for the horrible polygon density) and others fast on road. There can be some fun to be had racing the different specs, but the physics issue often steals most of the fun, when the other issues are not.   The Missions/Skill Challenges  Fun, for the first couple, then a long drag to the end, often making you look at the next mission and groan. The race type is straight forward, the checkpoint missions often are the only ones that are enjoyable, the takedown missions are messed up and often don't recognize the hits, and the smash the crates are just plain idiotic. As for the skill challenges... Jumps are awesome, speeds makes you hate the traffic, scrambles frustrate, race lines are meh, presicion frustrates, slaloms make you hate traffic, seeing the pattern? MISSIONs(4/10)  The AI  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ than PayDay 2, nuf said... AI(1/10)  Servers  Yeah, what servers? Can't stay connected for more than an hour and often dumps you out of the race at the end when in COOP giving you no rewards for the hour long race you just completed. Often can't see friends who are right in front of me. SERVER(0/10)  Pay2Win...  Summary (4/10)   
10591	I used to consider this to be a great game and would have recommended it, but while I don't regret buying it, I wouldn't say it's worth anything more 60% off retail price, meaning most sales will be meaningless, it's still not worth the buy.  As a US cruiser, it's a decent game, though you will suffer from the flat textures on buildings and apauling physics, still, other parts of the game are nice, it's definitely amazing driving through the wild plains, deserts (especially death valley) and the fields of green rolling hills. Cities are just really boring to drive through though.  Chances are that after finishing the story, you won't have explored everywhere (and some places are really golden as previously mentioned) and there will be things like faction missions available, little trials on the road like driving fast or jumping far and you can even replay individual missions.  But what happens when you get bored of the monotony or driving around? You can buy more cars to do more driving around, though this does require vast amounts of grinding that may or probably not seem worth it. You will then decide to buy the crew credits instead through microtransactions, which... don't bother! So naturally, the best thing to do would be to replay the story. That's what I like doing, especially driving games, but naaaah!! You can't replay the story. You can only do the individual missions. Parts of what made the story a cohesive story are no longer there. What's better is that Ubisoft know their player-base would like such a feature to go through the story again in the linear fashion it was originally in but still refuse to implement it.  Bottom line is that I wouldn't recommend this game because it does lose replayability. It simply becomes a cruiser after a while. Racing against other people isn't even really a big part of it. It's very rare that I get even a gimpse of racing other people. Instead, you'll have some random driver drive alongside you until they get bored.
10592	The game did not even start because of the insHelper.exe can not finish.
10593	This game has a concept of my dream. The freedom that the map allows us and different types of cars could have been build a masterpiece but thanks to developpers, now this game actually sucks with terrible driving mechanics and other small details and bugs. Thanks ubisoft for ruining my dreams.
10594	you hit a car with 400 kms per hour, you are still driving. you near miss a car with 60 kms per hour, BAM, you wreck your car. and when you get 100 uplay points and finally get the stunning viper, hit just one sign, and try to drive first person. you just cant because your lovely bumper bumps out like it is trying to reach god and it wont let you drive until you get your car fixed. and well i have been wronged about mirrors my whole life i think because ubisoft told me that mirrors have a grey color and they dont reflect well i guess they dont know what a mirror is, see if you make a racing game, mirrors should reflect. they have LOTS of cars like 30 or 40? :/ are you fkin kidding? even need for speed underground had more. (and weird thing is that i missed underground because at least cars were not worth 5 times a bugatti veyron). i expected that this game would be huge, lots of drivers on servers, no lagging and stuff, but this game showed me that this is just my imagination. the players are laggy and at least a session can contain players up to 8 players!!! YAY! i mean even races in a regular racing game or the races in this game is sometimes with 10 people, what about that? whatever yes i know i have a playtime of 3059672409658246940968 hours or something, but these are the truth.
10595	Waste of Money! If you want a racing game buy something with realistic car physics, and something thats not complete crap. Game has micro transactions like most AAA games, Story is a joke, and everytime you start the game you have to listen to a stupud rant. I dont even see a point in completeing the story. Its just a bad game in general. Buy something like project cars or Iracing. Funner experience and alot more player, I have a hard time seeing more than 10 in one game.
10596	Its not terrible. The game itself is fun, but it is kind of a waste in a way also. Given the size of the map and extremely small amount of visible players allowed, it feels pretty much dead. It claims it is a living game, but in reality it isn't. There is nothing innovative about this game. Basically it is a prettied up version of NFSW with less visible players and a better map. It is always online, so if they decide to shut down servers, you won't even be able to play it. Other players in the game seem to keep to themselves, have yet to find a pvp match or co-op in time played and I queue for it fairly often. I bought this game on sale and still feel kind of ripped off. I'd give it a thumbs up if it was in the under 10 section, but its not.
10597	I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It's grossly plagued by A.I glitches, fantasy car data, a huge lack of selection and server instability. If you are a car person and actually know anything about cars, this game will frustrate you.   The A.I in this game defies all laws of physics from letting a 1960's mustang out turn and out run a pagani huayra to magically and without warning throwing your car about 100 feet in the air on a straight stretch of empty road.  None of the cars in this game perform even remotely close to their real life counterpart. Frustrating to car people, otherwise a minor detail most won't care too much about.  This game has a heavy bias for American cars, and an overall fleeting selection of cars. Essentially there are only one or two cars worth getting for each category. This is not Gran Turismo or Forza, do not expect that.  But worst of all is server instability. You are guaranteed, regardless of how superb your internet connection may be, to be disconnected on a regular basis during or even worse right after crossing the finish line. None of your progress will be saved and you'll be forced to do the race again. This is particularly frustrating during the long endurance races.  The story is a complete joke, but that's not why we play these games. It is however worth mentioning that my most anticipated racing style 'circuit' is actually identical to 'performance' racing (racing through traffic on public roads) but done with circuit category cars. Only ONE race in the entire game is actually done on a race track. Despite there being several race tracks in this game, you only ever race in one with your circuit car. The remainder of circuit races are done on public roads identical to any performance race.  There is NO end game content. You only ever need one car per category of racing (and many categories can be achieved with one car). So unless you have a burning desire to collect every car in the game, once the story line is complete there is no reason to continue playing. Even the bonus cars you can get through finding parts throughout the country are all performance wise, terrible cars (with the sole exception of the buggy).  The ONLY redeeming factor for this game is the environment. It's absolutely stunning and a joy to explore in. When a race comes together and works it can be an enjoyable experience but I cannot recommend this game to anyone because it feels like a beta, that costs you 60 bucks.
10598	It was fun running around for the first week or two, but slowly you realize that there is bad execution here. TDU2 was more fun. I can't believe they still want $60 for it, I'd recommend it at $25.

10600	UPDATE: I bought the season pass expecting it to cover all DLC because its a season pass and thats the whole idea BUT NOOOOO IT DOESENT COVER ALL DLC BECAUSE â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU THATS WHY &gt; â¥â¥â¥â¥ UPLAY AND â¥â¥â¥â¥ UBISOFT POST 2012.  Ever wonder what it would be like to drive a high power supercar with bald tires on ice that is also covered in oil? I still dont understand what who ever aproved these driving physics was thinking. To give you an idea of how it fells its a cross between Gta IV and Test drive unlimited 2.
10601	Complete crap! Do not buy. All the cars handle like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the plot is pig â¥â¥â¥â¥er tier
10602	This game is like a punch in the face, its fun but it hurts. The Crew base game is absolute chicken â¥â¥â¥â¥ so the can add expansions and DLC to make up for its AIDSieness. This game is slightly enjoyable with friends, and only fun with friends while you're completing the super short easy as hell campaign.  5/10 - â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awful game, disregard how many hours I have on it.
10603	the controls and physics are dissappointing. tried using a wheel, and game pad and it becomes unplayable.
10604	Waste of Money! If you want a racing game buy something with realistic car physics, and something thats not complete crap. Game has micro transactions like most AAA games, Story is a joke, and everytime you start the game you have to listen to a stupud rant. I dont even see a point in completeing the story. Its just a bad game in general. Buy something like project cars or Iracing. Funner experience and alot more player, I have a hard time seeing more than 10 in one game.
10605	you hit a car with 400 kms per hour, you are still driving. you near miss a car with 60 kms per hour, BAM, you wreck your car. and when you get 100 uplay points and finally get the stunning viper, hit just one sign, and try to drive first person. you just cant because your lovely bumper bumps out like it is trying to reach god and it wont let you drive until you get your car fixed. and well i have been wronged about mirrors my whole life i think because ubisoft told me that mirrors have a grey color and they dont reflect well i guess they dont know what a mirror is, see if you make a racing game, mirrors should reflect. they have LOTS of cars like 30 or 40? :/ are you fkin kidding? even need for speed underground had more. (and weird thing is that i missed underground because at least cars were not worth 5 times a bugatti veyron). i expected that this game would be huge, lots of drivers on servers, no lagging and stuff, but this game showed me that this is just my imagination. the players are laggy and at least a session can contain players up to 8 players!!! YAY! i mean even races in a regular racing game or the races in this game is sometimes with 10 people, what about that? whatever yes i know i have a playtime of 3059672409658246940968 hours or something, but these are the truth.
10606	It was fun running around for the first week or two, but slowly you realize that there is bad execution here. TDU2 was more fun. I can't believe they still want $60 for it, I'd recommend it at $25.
10607	Its not terrible. The game itself is fun, but it is kind of a waste in a way also. Given the size of the map and extremely small amount of visible players allowed, it feels pretty much dead. It claims it is a living game, but in reality it isn't. There is nothing innovative about this game. Basically it is a prettied up version of NFSW with less visible players and a better map. It is always online, so if they decide to shut down servers, you won't even be able to play it. Other players in the game seem to keep to themselves, have yet to find a pvp match or co-op in time played and I queue for it fairly often. I bought this game on sale and still feel kind of ripped off. I'd give it a thumbs up if it was in the under 10 section, but its not.
10608	I bought this pice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game and now it says: 'Trail version of the game is over'... WTF!?
10609	I liked the game yeah, but i was expecting more, it repeats a lot, and the missions seem a bit apart from the story, ItÂ´s enjoyable, but not as much as i thought, this is my personal opinion
10610	If it's not the trial and error pursuit races where you have to try 5 times before you memorize when and where the target makes turns so you can finally hit it, it's the dubious escape from police events where they accelerate a lot faster than you regardless of how upgraded you are, or it's the normal races where your car bounces upwards off bizarrely elasticized hills and curbs and into trees and walls, where you bounce again as if your car sides were made of rubber, to face backwards while the AI zooms past you, or just coincidentally the traffic is in such a way you have to slow down to dodge traffic as you take the turn and lose seconds.   Incidentally the graphics may be acceptable for PS4 or XBOX One but they are a bit of a letdown compared to other racing games on the PC, if you have a high end card.  Not that you care, as you lose control of your vehicle every twenty seconds, or try to make goals that require the RND to smile on you.   Not a good racing game. Regret spending my money terribly. I'm going back to Hot Pursuit, where at least banging each other's cars and making chases actually feels like play and not like player abuse.

10612	Trying to like it. But they are making it so hard on me. It keeps asking me to purchase wild run but I don't want wild run, I want the game I purchased WTF. 2.2 hours later it tells me I'm playing the trial and should purchase Wild Run. When I buy a game, I don't feel like I should have to jump through hoops to play it but here I go.
10613	Poor game play and limited race types.
10614	(AFTER 20+ HOURS EDIT) This game did not turn out the way it felt early on. You feel like a total Bad@$$ through the first bit, then you keep playing with the same car, just little upgrades to it, then you keep playing, and keep playing, and keep on... Eventually, you beat the final race, and you've still only got the first car you bought (or in my case with pre-order, a Mclaren). My in-game wallet after the whole story line, was just enough to buy a mid-range car. Anything in the modern era that's considered a 'SuperCar' was still too much for me, but hey! You can always buy credits on their system to get enough, only a mere $XX.xx+ to unlock this car! Unfortunatly, you can see below from my review, I was hoping this would feel like Test Drive Unlimited, which I have 200+ hours in (on xbox) but it just did not meet up. In test drive, after the story you feel rich, buying mansions, yachts, bugatti veyrons, etc. In this, you'd be lucky to end up with a mid-range prius. Unfortunatly, The 5 other people ever online do not seem to be driving anything in the super car range either, so there's nobody to ask how they made their money.   Oh well, another dust collector.   (Old Review) What can I say. I'm a sucker for open world racing games.  This game feels like TDU3, the game I've always dreamed of. I put many hours on TDU2 (Xbox) and always looked for a game that would compare. Need for speeds customization features have just gone off the radar since they're underground series, which is the only thing that made that series fun.   The Crew, although just played in beta, felt like a perfect combination of the two games. A decent amount of cars (Will be 50-60 from what I've heard) lots of customization, and lots of land to drive. It took me about 2.5 hours to drive from New York to San Francisco. I made a few stops in Vegas, Grand Canyon, And other landmarks of course. I can't get enough of this game, and can't wait for the full version to be released.
10615	Trying to like it. But they are making it so hard on me. It keeps asking me to purchase wild run but I don't want wild run, I want the game I purchased WTF. 2.2 hours later it tells me I'm playing the trial and should purchase Wild Run. When I buy a game, I don't feel like I should have to jump through hoops to play it but here I go.
10616	Poor game play and limited race types.
10617	  Cant compare to the playability of testdrive unlimited 2, i thought maybe it could replace can it fook, crap game
10618	Game is amazing so far. It's a good 4/5. But there is one very important thing you need to know. If you don't wanna buy the dlc, don't buy the game. My friend told me to buy the crew, after me saying I don't want to. He told me it was amazing and should play it. So I decided to play the base game. I didn't plan on buying dlc. And here is what happens  If you don't buy the calling all units dlc, a character in the game will remind you ever 2 mintes in the free driving mode. You go the place, and yes, the car is technically free, but to get it, you have to pay for the dlc. Most expensive car i paid for in a game, and they told me it was free.   If you do plan on buying dlc, I do reccomened. But I feel like they did this just so people buy the dlc. It worked on me, so good job, but it's a huge d*** move.
10619	so well i have only play 5 hours of the crew and i allredy hate it first the ai are wizards/the programers were smoking so wered â¥â¥â¥â¥ when they were programing the ai suddenly has so mutch speed they over take you even if they are a lower rank than you and also sometimes the ai drive drunmk sometimes they are profesinal drivers i do not recomend the crew for anyone who dose not have experience in handling ai that are imposible to beat sometimes
10620	By the time I've completed the story of this game, less than 21hrs of game time has passed. The only form of playability is for achievement â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the form of mini events to get parts scattered across the whole map.
10621	Luckily I get this on sale considering that rant over the newest DLC that costs half of the Gold Edition and isn't included in the Season Pass
10622	I purchased testing version for 15â¬ and game told me after 2 hours i canÂ´t play the testing version any longer and I must buy the full version... I expected the testing version will be for like 20 or at least 10 but 2 hours is nothing for game what have big map where you canÂ´t do in 2 hours almost nothing...  For that 2 hours what i played it, story started good and i must say the map is really big but you just canÂ´t get 2 hours only for 15â¬ when the map is that big! I just started the story only, get my car, completed few races and get lvl 3 and thatÂ´s all. I do almost nothing. I just send request for refund..  So, i really recommended full version, the game is isnÂ´t that bad but in 2 hours i just canÂ´t see everything what i can write to this review.
10623	Let start off on a very clear thing, I like the crew. I have loved it ever since I heard of it, when it came avalible for pre order, I bought it, then went out and bought parts to make sure my computer could handle it. I still like it, getting into a car and just driving across the huge landscape is just extreamly relaxing and thrilling at times.  With that being said, I highly recommend you -DO NOT- buy this game. Ubisoft has been for some time trying to be worse than EA in jackassery, and they have somehow suceeded very well. As pointed out by the other reviews, season pass effects nothing with Wild Run, a forced update and major expanshion that the game now prettymuch relies on and costs as much as the normal game, dispite only giving you limited content. [Four new class types and new event zones mainly]   If you are able to pick this game up dirt cheap, sure, go for it, the aimless driving is fun, but that is all that this game offers now, aimless driving. I hate Need for Speed, but you'd be highly better off buying one of them, and that hurts for me to admit that. I really believed in this game, and if it wasn't for ubisoft, I believe this TDU3 could of really shown.
10624	this isnt a game i intended to buy a buddy said it was fun but i dont have internet all the time im sure its a good game but not the one for me
10625	The game is ok to play overall but there are some downsides to it. For example: &gt;The events are the same thing over and over again. &gt;Lacks in the amount of manufacturers. &gt;There are a few bugs like when you're going at high speed, the sceney doesn't load and i fall out of the map. &gt;You cannot upgrade your car with money and instead you have to go to competitions in order to upgrade your car to &gt;meet the requirement of the mission. &gt; Raid spec cars suck!, They have the worst handling and speed. They aren't as useful as dirt spec cars. (except for going uphill sometimes).  However: &gt;I like that you do these quick competitions and you can get upgrades instantly for free. &gt;You have the whole of USA to play with. &gt; There is customisation. &gt;You can teleport to places. &gt;Lots fun things to do wiht your friends. 
10626	Thanks ubisoft for ruining good game with f/////////g Wild Run update. I never again buy a game from Ubisoft.
10627	As an owner of The Crew, with the Season Pass, it would cost me more to buy Wild Run by itself than it would cost a non-owner to buy The Crew-WIld Run Edition, as they would be paying just $9 for Wild Run whereas I, someone who bought the game at Full Price when it came out, have to spend a GREATER amount of money, $15, to get Wild Run. This is punishing current owners, even if you don't account for the drop in price or the discount, because it means that as someone who actively owns the game it effectively is more expensive for me to get to the same point than it is for someone who doesn't get own it.  If you compare gained content, rather than raw price, I am gaining the same amount (Wild Run) for $15 that someone who buys the Wild Run edition gets for $9.  I wanted to get Far Cry Primal to play with my life-time coop buddy, because I love Far Cry. I own FC3 and FC4.  I am never buying an Ubisoft game again. Ever. Because I know this company direction is going to continue forever. Ubisoft used to be fantastic back when they first started making Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft has become more loathesome than EA.
10628	60FPS Hardcapped racing fun with bumperkarts on iceroad 11/10
10629	always drive alone !!!!!
10630	I like the game but everything is made to get you to fork over more money  edit: Also.... Half the cars require seperate purchases to get
10631	This game is absolute garbage.
10632	NEW DLC IS STILL 29,99â¬ AS I ALREADY BOUGHT THE SEASON PASS ??????????????? WHAT IS THIS HELL. SADLY I CANT EVEN GET A REFUND OF THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME; MONEY WASTED
10633	Bought it two days ago Still haven't gotten it to even start Good game Ubisoft...
10634	this game is totaly awesome believe me BUT if you want to do more than 3 missions you have to buy the wild run dlc. really this is a scam. o hay the crew is now only 15 euro and you buy it. then you get a huge map and all kind of tunes. you start playing and after 2 hours the game says buy wild run dlc to unlock this. with EVERYTHING. if you want an awesome game pay 50 or 60 euro but you cant just pay 30 or with discount 15 euro.
10635	you know what - â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. when i first saw this game i tought that i could not live without it, because i like open world, racing games. now i will show you positive things and negative things in this game.  +okay, good graphic  + nice cars + open world + you can customize you car  - driving is piece of sh** - boring story - too much expensive if you want to play it ( 60 $ wtf??) and some of the cars you have to buy it with your money on steam. - all cars sounds like a â¥â¥â¥â¥  do your self a favour and do not buy this game, unless you truly want it.
10636	Pros: very big map, nice graphic at lowest setting, smart loot enable to get better part at lower level race, nice cutscene, nice story line, nice kits for car, nice scenery and detail at background.  Cons: smart loot give me â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ part which is much worse (eg. +2 performance) compare to gold (eg. +20 performance) on the event with a car with stock or low level part on the slot. worst game inefficient game processing low fps everytime only get 60 fps at the last moment of the race. crown race is so boring and annoying. game always crash or lag the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of my pc I7 with GT755 SLI. nfs rival look and played much better with high setting at 60 fps. everytime pvp the map never be the same so my pc need to load the new map which take like the whole race with 10 fps is the worse even with a max performance car. experience time lag when my pc lag (eg. game time is slower than real time. drive on a straight path still lose to a much lower performance car with no lag)  What can the developer do : make the game run smoother or require lesser pc performance etc. smart loot will give the gold part of the event if the part on the car is lower performaance than the gold part.
10637	This game is a lagg fest they need to fix it. Or just refund me my money! But I will recommend this game after it is fix.
10638	'Buy The CREW Gold' of s*hit, Please do not do it because I do not even enjoyed to play it
10639	5/10 would play if desperate
10640	This game was destroyed by its own expansion. Calling All Units brought a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'refined' police ai, some reskins as cop cars. No customization for police cars at all and a another horrible protagonist without any story.

10644	Maybe im a little bit salty but after HOURS of troubleshooting to get the game finally working and it runs terribly? that pisses me off. I mean single digit FPS on the LOWEST SETTING and then it tells me i dont own any dlc after buying them and giving me a 'trial version' and I am god damn salty.
10645	The game itself is fun and has a great idea behind it with a large open map to explore. But the many bugs and random errors, sometimes online connection problems (for days long) kinda destroy the fun and pleasure in the game.  Each patch solves a few of those but also comes with new ones. It seems Ubisoft has a lot of problems with optimize games for the PC lately. And they still like to force Uplay on you which is useless when you already use Steam. My first and only game from Ubisoft I bought on PC...
10646	I bought this game hoping it would be awesome and i could have fun with it, but instead, after downloading, deleting, then downloading again, it never fixed the issue of when i tried to start it it would go to a black screen in fullscreen and then a second later my mindows would say 'The crew' has stopped working. tried things the fourums suggested, like deleting the crew file out of my documents but it never fixed itself. when i tried to debug it, it said something about an unhandled win32 exception occured, but i have not been able to actually play the game.
10647	WTF IS THIS UBISHIT! I CANNOT CONNECT THE GAME. I HAVE CONNECTION BUT ALSO SAY NO HAVE CONNECTION WTF!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK
10648	Slow control response, AI isn't fun -just speed past, and everything costs extra. One of the worst driving games I've ever messed with. Wish there was a refund, but at least I didn't pay full price. AVOID!
10649	Hi All,  Firstly, i'm not gonna say DON'T BUY THIS GAME, just because I have an opinion.  I myself tried the game, got the demo, bought the game on the Lunar Special - Got The WildRun Edition. I was so looking forward to playing it.  The intro, amazing and the story seemed like it was going somewhere I did so much research into this game, the massive open world, the customisations all look so amazing.  BUT...  If you think it will drive anything like Shift 1 or 2, or any of the Need for Speeds. you are going to have a bad time.  I seriously couldn't look passed the driving style. The Game has everything else but the driving, oh my goodness i can't even explain it.  If you like arcade like racing style then this game will work for you, and be immensely enjoyable, but playing all the Realistic Driving simulators prevents me from playing this game with a smile on my face.  Customisation is awesome, the car selections are cool, the open world is cool but monotonous at times as you feel like you are always driving on the same roads.  It won't feel like Need for Speed, even Underground 1 has better driving physics and what i mean by this is that, You could do a donut in underground 1 because even though the game was old, it had some form of physics instruction that would let you do that  The Crew seems like the car is just a Polymodel wrapped over a blip that you move around in. 
10650	Refund pending. Great game, but uPlay is still the garbage barrier to gaming that it always has been. It's bad enough that uPlay makes you go out of Steam to authenticate your purchases, worse still when uPlay doesn't unlock the DLC you've paid for.  The Ultimate Edition will not give you the Calling All Units DLC if you purchase it in Steam. I imagine getting the whole thing through uPlay is a safer way to buy this (which is probably what Ubisoft want you to do and the reason why the experience through Steam is so poor).  Base game (trial) is great, shame I paid Â£40 for it and got nothing else.
10651	Free Roam is the only part of the game I like.  One thing that really grinds my gears are the NPC's ability to catch up to you in seconds. As well as being able to speed up while hitting into posts, which slows the Players down.  Is this really a MMOCARPG? I am only able to see other people across the map from a few seconds to a few minutes before their names disapear. When i crew up with someone it makes it harder to see other online people.
10652	This game has become complete and utter trash after the release of Wild Run, and even before Wild Run it was pretty bad. To level up your car to level 1299 takes LUCK. Has nothing to do with how skilled you are or what you do. It's pure chance you get that level 50 platinum part at the specific bonus you want. It was like that before Wild Run; it was better that way. Now you also get rims, hoods, and other generic faff parts you could buy at a tuner for all the Bucks you get from trying the skill minigames. This is awful. It was already hard to get specific parts, now they nerf it so you CAN'T GET ANY PARTS TO LEVEL UP YOUR CAR. No matter how good this may look, under the hood is a 1 cylinder engine that only outputs 1 Brake Horsepower. It's literal garbage. I'm lucky I guess that I got to play this and get to some 1299 level cars, because now, that's all I have. Don't give into this UbiShit trash. It's unplayable now. It takes $120 away from you and expects you to like it. ($120 comes from my GOLD edition preorder with season pass, and purchase of crew credits) Get Need for Speed 2016 when it comes out on Origin. EA probably doesn't do this to their games. At least most of them are still playable, anyway.
10653	Garbage, DLC shoul've been a free gift for the amount of false advertisement in the mechanics and overall quality of the game. Don't waste your money; it's just Ubisoft banking their income on the reputation of other great games they've made and using this as a cash dash.
10654	Would rather buy winrar
10655	bought the game, downloaded, but says its a demo version after buying the full game....da â¥â¥â¥â¥
10656	money hungry
10657	29.99E for trial version? Kidding? â¥â¥â¥â¥ this Wild Run update, i play 2 hours and after 'Buy The Crewi Wild Run 29.99E. Yup, a â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10658	Just. Don't even bother.   A complete and utter waste of money that would be better spent on CS:GO cases. The mechanics are completely broken and unplayable. You can count how many cars there are in the game with your fingers, You want more cars? Too bad! Gotta pay extra for them sonny.  Cars are like tanks and gravity in that game is apparently 200x that of normal earth. Goku's gonna have a grand old time. Seriously. A 1969 Dodge Charger RT has 5 speed transmission? Where did that come from? The sound of the cars in the game's as authentic as my Hotwheels collection. Made in Taiwan.  If you're going to buy this game for the multiplayer, don't. It's as unexistant as Ellen Page's boobs. You have friends that play The Crew, you say? Good. You can be as idiotic as them for buying this game.   The only real reason I ever bought this melarky is because it was on sale. The only reason my play time exceeds 2 hours(Steam's policy for a refund) is because of my perfectionism when playing games. Lo and behold, there was a collectible HotRod you could use after painstakingly searching for them and even so, the HotRod was incredibly not worth the effort.  All in all, don't buy it, don't look at it, don't talk about it.   - 2/10 'Dissapointing'  IGN - 9/10
10659	bought the game three months before the Wildrun, WICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SEASONPASS. i put 90 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DOLLERS down on the game im not spending another 24 on an expansion that should now be included in the game with gold edition holders. very unhapy with ubisoft very unhappy
10660	bought the game three months before the Wildrun, WICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SEASONPASS. i put 90 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DOLLERS down on the game im not spending another 24 on an expansion that should now be included in the game with gold edition holders. very unhapy with ubisoft very unhappy
10661	This game wasn't worth the purchase for me. If you're looking for a realistic driving multiplayer game, this is not it. Your only solution to evading police or winning races is by driving around them. If you try and push them, you'll slam in to a wall and spin out of control. Your sessions hold a very minimal amount of players that you will only ever come across if you actively seek them.  The trailer made this game look like it would be a very fun play, but it is very repetitive and eventually boring. The fact that cops can drive at impossible speeds and ram you like a wall doesn't help.
10662	Ubisoft really good at trailer, really impress, but the gameplay is VERY BAD.  - AI is incredible stupid, they will just speeding and does not slow down during corner, even after a horrible crash, AI still manage to chase you. A simple mistake and you have to restart the race and replay. - Citizen cars always spawn randomly in front of you. - You always lose becaue of last minute car crash(random spawn cars). - You need to buy crew cash to learn more skil point (which is really bad, pay to win?) - Never drive with others. No one is joining your crew. - Police car always faster than your car no matter what car you are driving. - Your car made of Toufu, and other cars are make of metal. - Control is a mess.  There is too many things to complain. I regret bought this game. I will only hope i can finish the game story and hope Need for Speed 2015 is better than this.
10663	The Crew  The crew is a large, open world environment with lots of multiplayer aspects and huge POTENTIAL. But from there, itâs all a bit downhill. I bought it because I wanted a driving game where you could customise your car, get chased by cops, play with friends even for a nice little drive down a motorway at 200km/h.  I got what I asked for, but not what I paid for. I get my custom car, which then gets pulled away from me for mission specific cars. Now, Iâm in a mission with an unfamiliar car and AI designed to be perfect. I know they are. Get the perk which shows you the lines to a race mission, I almost guarantee that the AI in 1st will be perfect to that line. Have all the skill you want, if you donât take shortcuts or have the better car, you wonât win and if thatâs the case, donât even bother going for a perfect score. I know there are people out there who are pros and know every corner, every braking point and every shortcut. I can only imagine how much time they spent and how much sass from the NPCs they got. And then there are the regular AI cars. Not the race ones, just the normal run-of-the-mill pedestrian cars. God help if youâre going for a high score and one of those come along and pull into the lane youâre in about 50m from you. â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens, but not to the AI racers.  Then the authorities. Hands up all those who love a good chase scene. I do, and I thought âYeah, lots of road and different terrain, this should be good.â Oh sweet innocence. First, find a patrol car and then crash into stuff. Problem. Find one. Iâd hate to believe that there are only two patrol cars in New York. Of course, if you destroy enough stuff, you might initiate a car chase, but only after ruining the front of your vehicle and giving half a city a reason to build a concrete wall as opposed to fences. Of course, you wonât get booked if you ram into all their parked cars unless a patrol car is nearby. Oh and donât worry about pedestrians either, theyâll jump out of your way while your barrelling down the road at high speeds. You may have noticed Iâve refrained from using the word âcopâ. This is because, if you find one on foot, try running him down. Heâll jump out of your way and yell obscenities at you no matter how many times you try. Wonât even call for backup.  Multiplayer. Oh boy. My friend and I tried to do a multiplayer session. We attempted about three times with it saying âunable to join crewâ. About to give up, we tried once more. *pop*. Weâre in lobby together. Okay then, well, weâre in, letâs meet up. We did, or rather, our name tags did. Neither of us could see each otherâs car, and we were poorly synced, to the point where I would ram a cop car next to my friend which would proceed to arrest me with my friend laughing because there was nothing there.  Hmmmâ¦.have I missed something. Oh yes, state of the art graphics from 2011, forced music when in missions (I like my classical), handling which feels like the roads are made of ice and a story which feels like it was pulled out of the âHat of predictable story linesâ with more plot holes in it than the Brony Clopper fandom.
10664	this is truly an awful game you go into a tuner and you cant buy a single part for your car! every part you want you have to earn the cars in this game slide like theyre always on ice! this is by far the worst racing game ever ubisoft needs to make a lot of changes to this game and it never shouldve been released! its a total waste of money and time! buy any need for speed game gaurantee itll beat this p.o.s of a game!!
10665	Can't get pass the first mission. Game just goes black.
10666	Can't get pass the first mission. Game just goes black.
10667	Connectivity - sucky Multiplayer - its ok if you can even find a match Customization - not that much Physics - unrelistic and sucky Story/Campain - boring and predictable Missions - repetetive and annoying Gameplay - sucky Servers - crash all the time Graphics - mediocre AI-players - unrelistic   This game is unfinnished and only worth about 30 bucks. I was exited for this game, but there are too many holes and bugs and glitches that are unsatisfying. And the overal game quality isnt very great.
10668	I had high hopes for this game, it turned out to be a total waste of money. The AI in the game is rigged, no matter how many upgrades you get, the AI will always zip away.   The whole game feels disconnected and seems to pay no attention to the experience of the player.  Any victories feel more like a matter of luck than skill effectively defeating any sense of accomplishment the player might receive.  It is NOT the open world MMO racing game it pretends to be. Your character is a bearded hipster that resembles the guy from Half-life. You are forced into a boring, cut and paste, extremely linear storyline that reeks of a bad Fast and Furious movie. The missions are lackluster and feel like a huge chore.  Dont get me started on RAID or the Garbage truck mission, or the time I logged in and the server reverted and 6 hours of achivements and part unlocks were magically gone. (RAGE!!!!) Contacting support is a joke.  I canât believe I got suckered in for $60.00 bucks! this game is one big lie!
10669	Even though the car handles decently (albeit arcade-ish) and the graphics are also good (not great, mind you), the Uplay service really f*** it up, by dropping when you enjoy the game most. I was in the middle of a 2.5 hours checkpoint race for the Wolves when the connection was lost and the bloody game demanded to exit to Windows. The race was started Solo, so there is absolutely no need for an always-on connection!!! Such a turn off, really! I guess those who are playing the offline, pirated version don't need to put up with this crap!
10670	Wish I could have my $85 back, I questioned the hype at first, thought well, its most likely not as horrible as everyone says. I was very wrong, in fact, most everything about The Crew is a huge disappointment. This game belongs in the steam greelight corner. What ive gathered from forcing myself to play more of The Crew - unfinished, buggy, horrifingly bad gameplay mechanics, physics engine that never seems to work, and worst of all, unrealistic to the point where NFSUG2 looks damn real in comparision. Swing and miss to a complete FAIL. Dont buy this game!
10671	this game is unfinished and not worth $60, i felt like i was playing disney Cars Mater national championship. The detail is underdone and they are 50+ flaws i could point out. It is a 2015 'next gen game' but the mirrors dont even work... its a car game. Racing games from 13 years ago had operating mirrors. The car selection is bad, the customization is horrible, physics are bad, the damage is nonsense, every car feels the same, every mission is the same, online is completely unenjoyable, and the cutscenes ughhh the cutscenes your cars glitch back and forth its really bad the whole pursuit is bad when your at a stop and you have just one police officer on you, you mine as well just give up. The graphics are like early ps3 graphics and a bit boring. I just want my money back so i can buy GTA V... 
10672	The Crew  The crew is a large, open world environment with lots of multiplayer aspects and huge POTENTIAL. But from there, itâs all a bit downhill. I bought it because I wanted a driving game where you could customise your car, get chased by cops, play with friends even for a nice little drive down a motorway at 200km/h.  I got what I asked for, but not what I paid for. I get my custom car, which then gets pulled away from me for mission specific cars. Now, Iâm in a mission with an unfamiliar car and AI designed to be perfect. I know they are. Get the perk which shows you the lines to a race mission, I almost guarantee that the AI in 1st will be perfect to that line. Have all the skill you want, if you donât take shortcuts or have the better car, you wonât win and if thatâs the case, donât even bother going for a perfect score. I know there are people out there who are pros and know every corner, every braking point and every shortcut. I can only imagine how much time they spent and how much sass from the NPCs they got. And then there are the regular AI cars. Not the race ones, just the normal run-of-the-mill pedestrian cars. God help if youâre going for a high score and one of those come along and pull into the lane youâre in about 50m from you. â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens, but not to the AI racers.  Then the authorities. Hands up all those who love a good chase scene. I do, and I thought âYeah, lots of road and different terrain, this should be good.â Oh sweet innocence. First, find a patrol car and then crash into stuff. Problem. Find one. Iâd hate to believe that there are only two patrol cars in New York. Of course, if you destroy enough stuff, you might initiate a car chase, but only after ruining the front of your vehicle and giving half a city a reason to build a concrete wall as opposed to fences. Of course, you wonât get booked if you ram into all their parked cars unless a patrol car is nearby. Oh and donât worry about pedestrians either, theyâll jump out of your way while your barrelling down the road at high speeds. You may have noticed Iâve refrained from using the word âcopâ. This is because, if you find one on foot, try running him down. Heâll jump out of your way and yell obscenities at you no matter how many times you try. Wonât even call for backup.  Multiplayer. Oh boy. My friend and I tried to do a multiplayer session. We attempted about three times with it saying âunable to join crewâ. About to give up, we tried once more. *pop*. Weâre in lobby together. Okay then, well, weâre in, letâs meet up. We did, or rather, our name tags did. Neither of us could see each otherâs car, and we were poorly synced, to the point where I would ram a cop car next to my friend which would proceed to arrest me with my friend laughing because there was nothing there.  Hmmmâ¦.have I missed something. Oh yes, state of the art graphics from 2011, forced music when in missions (I like my classical), handling which feels like the roads are made of ice and a story which feels like it was pulled out of the âHat of predictable story linesâ with more plot holes in it than the Brony Clopper fandom.
10673	This game had huge potential. As somone who preordered the Gold edition, I was was leading the hype train. Sure there were a few features missing on launch, but surely a big name like Ubisoft could get that fixed quickly. 3 months later, and they are no longer even making pretenses of fixing the launch day problems or keeping their early promises.
10674	Garbage, DLC shoul've been a free gift for the amount of false advertisement in the mechanics and overall quality of the game. Don't waste your money; it's just Ubisoft banking their income on the reputation of other great games they've made and using this as a cash dash.
10675	Every couple of months you have to buy the $25 DLC, or else you lose all of your vehicles!!! Don't even think about playing without the DLC, because there is no game without it. Whenever a new DLC comes out, the one you previously bought doesn't exist anymore. It is LITERLY replaced entirley by the new DLC without a refund! You have to rebuy the DLC! When a new DLC comes out, you don't even get a huge difference. maybe a new gamemode or car, but barely anything. This was a waste of money.  (PS: There is an Ubisoft Fan boy that goes by 'Rgeers' on Steam.)
10676	PIECE OF SH*T !  on startup black screen flashes and windows says 'The Crew has stop working' .  F**K YOU UBISOFT  AND F**K YOU UPLAY
10677	This is basically this: Buy Wild Run DLC to access the whole game. YAY. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DLC needs to be bought for you to play the game. Besides that, the game is cool, but you basically can't play it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Ubisoft, you always do this â¥â¥â¥â¥ to us game lovers! Stop caring about money and care about us!
10678	Still having problems with the game when starting up it doesnt respond ive upgraded my desktop to windows 10 it wasnt it please fix ubisoft i brought the game last year and i still cant seem to find anysolution to the problem tried all guides/ubisoft forums but still doesnt work people that buy this game it will rip into pieces if it doesnt get fixed  Help PLEASE!!!!!
10679	Good game, but i can't play beacuse i don't have 'calling all units DLC'  I did buy 'Wild run DLC' but i can't play this DLC, just 'Calling all units, that cost 30$. You canot continue play the rest of the story mode.  Now the positive tings: Good graphics, Look like a good story,
10680	Cool, fun introduction. Cool for first few hours.  Then you realize the entire game is do objective A, drive 15 minutes to place, do objective B, drive 15 minutes to place, do objective C, drive 20 minutes to place, do objective D which is just like objective A, drive 23 minutes to place, do objective E which is just like objective B, drive 25 minutes to place, do objective F which is just like objective C. Congratulations! You're higher rank! Now drive for 30+ minutes halfway across the country.
10681	So much potential ruined by greed and Ubisoft's practices. It's a AAA title you pay full price for, then has all the elements of a F2P title.   Pay to win/Pay to progress   1) After buying the game for $40-60, you're given a starting car that is very underpowered and handles like crap. It takes a *lot* of time to grind out upgrades, level up your character, and earn perks. OR, you can pay a few real dollars and unlock a super car straight away. Not with premium currency, *literally* with real world money. However:  2) There IS premium currency. You can buy packs of Crew Credits to unlock parts and upgrades faster.  This wouldn't be an issue if you could only buy cosmetic things, but the cars on sale for real cash and the parts you can get with premium currency give you an edge over most players in PvP.  Also, don't forget Uplay. If you launch the game from steam, Uplay has to load up and sync, then the game tries to load. Which can really bog down your system for no apparent reasons.   Game performance   For some reason your car stutters and jumps all over the place in cutscenese. However you're fine during the gameplay itself (albeit capped at 30 to 60fps). This has been a bug known since before release from what I've been reading, but nothing's been done to fix it.  Your car handles like crap. If you watch closely, when you're travelling at speed your car doesn't follow real world physics:  it pivots on an axis  instead of turning. This is extremely apparent if you visit a highway with steady curves or a race track, you can watch as the trunk of the car slides out and the wheels don't line up to where the car is heading when you're not drifting.  Speaking of wheels not lining up, visit an airport. The aircraft (which are all scaled down and scaled up copies of each other) are just static models that slide around. Their wheels don't spin and the nose gear doesn't turn. Heck, they don't have any animations at all, and their engines are obvious polygons. I haven't seen aircraft that poorly modelled since 1998.  In conclusion: Hell no. I wasted $40 on a game where you have to grind for days on end before you're even competitive, or give Ubisoft more money.  (The tiny straw that broke the camels back: They made New York and Chicago huge and detailed, but my ENTIRE state gets a few highways and a handful of buildings? The two towns they added and named are literally a dozen or so buildings. And they're both tourist trap villages, they didn't add our biggest city or our capital.)  EDIT: almost forgot! The AI cheats. Regardless of how much more upgraded your car is, they speed up to keep up with you, and  dirt roads don't affect them . They get to fly at max speed as if they're on pavement, while you're struggling to stay on the track as you drift around corners. Even if your Dirt Spec is levelled up far more than theirs.
10682	it was working fine managed to get 24 hours of play time into the game. then all of a sudden it wont load up. supposedly it is not windows 10 compatable. i wish that had been stated somewhere so that i didnt waste all of my money on this game.
10683	Well, normally I don't write reviews of games, since it's always a personal opinion and a question of wether or not you can live with the faults a game might have. All games have problems, but with the release of the Wild Run DLC, I feel scammed.  Originally I pre-ordered the Limited edition of The Crew, setting me back 65â¬, including season pass and all DLC car packs available at the original release date. After the release of Wild Run, all these have been revoked and needs to be bought once again. That means I have spent around 20â¬ on something, I will now have to pay for once again. And that's on top of the 25â¬ I have spent on the Wild Run DLC, which in hindsight I shouldn't have, since they call it a DLC, and therefor it should be part of the The Crew season pass, and not a seperate expansion mini-game, like you would see in other MMOs.  Legal or not, the fact that they now force people to buy all the DLCs once againt, this is ethically not something, I want to support. On forums I have seen, that I am not the only one to have experienced this, and with that business model in mind I would not recommend this game.  The game itself is suffering from a few bugs, some worse than others, but the most annoying is the endless disconections, usually at the most crucial time during a race.  I can live with bugs, but I have a hard time spending money on buying the same game once more.

10685	Worse racing game ever. The AI is absolutely garbage, it's heavily scripted and cheat against you. When you're leading they will accelerate at 600+ KM/H just to overtake you, and then slow down to normal speed so you can repeat the process over and over again.
10686	Man I know I don't have the best configs to run games, but dropping to 20 FPS just because some smoke and a f*cking police chopper? Jesus, stay away of this abomination, Ubisoft does not know how to properly optimize a game for Laptop, even for PC's, I'd recommend you to not buy it if you have a Laptop, stay away...
10687	This game had a lot of potential, but in the end its just a giant failure.  Graphics: The game looks really nice and runs pretty smoothly when other players arent near you, i am able to maintain a constant 50-60 FPS, my system stays cool and i dont get stuttering too often unless im driving over 200 MPH. The enviroment is attractive and makes exploring the huge map even more worthwhile, the waters not the most attractive but its not an issue since you should be spending most your time staring at the road or the cars.  Customization: Theres enough to make your car unique and the game allows every spec to be different so your car can look completly different in street then it does in performance. However Raid and Cicuit spec have almost no custumization available and dirt spec is sometimes lacking as well. Also higher end cars ussually have less then cheaper cars meaning aventadors and vipers ussually look identical while mustangs and camaros can be heavily customized.  Map: Its large, it takes about 30-60 mins to to drive between 2 major areas (ex. Detroit to Miami, Maine to Texas, NY to LA) mostly highway averaging around 160MPH. Most areas look pretty accurate and you can ussually guess where you are if you have seen the place in real life, however many areas are located FAR from where they should be and some are sized quite oddly, for example Salem MA is up in Maine and Miami is most of florida.  Cars: This is one area where the game fails miserably, while it does have some great cars the balance is horrible and very unrealistic, mini cooper is one of the fastest cars in the game, bentley continental outruns sklyine gtrs and vipers with no issues, no point buying an expensive dirt spec since the ford focus is pretty much the best for dirt, mustangs are faster, better handling, and have better traction then the 370z, the murcielago feels like its on ice all the time ect. Many cars cant be put into specs that make perfect sense to be available, most supercars cant be circuit, f150 cant be raid spec, golf gti cant be anything but street spec, high end cars can ussually only be performance spec and thats it. AI uses vehicles in specs that you cant for example circuit spec trucks, Some cars are just pointless like the golf gti and jeep cherokee, and others are so expensive its not worth getting since there are faster cars for half the price. Also when theres only about 30 cars in the game why would you have 4 lamborghinis, 4 mustangs, 3 Trucks and 2 SUVS, 2 camaros, and 2 chargers, but not include any hondas, mitsubishis,porches or toyotas and leave out cars like the suburu impreza and lancer evo despite how well they would work for street and dirt spec.  Driving: Suprisingly the game worked perfectly with my g27 racing wheel as well as an xbox controller without needing any configuring or calibration(other then turning driving assists off). It has a lot of options for adjusting force feedback, steering deadzone and sensitivity making it easy to get a comfortable set up as well. Unfortanetly despite good settings the game feels very unrealistic, collisions never make sense sometimes you go flying 1000ft into the air other times you bounce off like nothing happened, other times a bump at 10MPH totals your car, some cars spin out randomly for no reason, traction is terrible for some cars, theres no difference between FWD, RWD or 4WD , for some cars the game handles very arcadey much like an old need for speed game where you can just drift sideways through a corner without slowing, other cars you NEED to brake before a corner like you would in a simracer. Also if you play manual transmission on a controller expect to be heavily disadvantaged since the only way to reverse is to shift all the way down to 1st, then down to nuetral then into reverse and theres a forced pause between every shift so you cant just drop two gears quickly.  Online: Honestly, dont even bother. For one the game has no level scaling so all pvp is mixed together meaning a lv 300 f150 will be expected to race lv 1299 (max lv) lamborghinis and vipers. PVP is very buggy and laggy cars teleport 500yds ahead of you, cars lag into you causing you to crash, and disconects are very common, back on track feature sometimes places people far ahead of where they were, and sometimes you can clearly finish in 2nd only to have the game tell you you finished in 4th. PVP is also full of hackers and the developers dont seem to care, expect to see a lot of people with infinate nos, 300MPH cars, invincible cars that dont get slowed or moved when rammed into and even some people who just instantly win the race shortly after it starts. even if you do get a match without hackers or terible lag its boring since everyone only chooses highway races in performance spec with traffic off and then everyone is in either an aventador, bentley, or one of the free cars from the season pass, ive never seen a pvp in dirt, street or raid spec, ive only found a couple of circuit specs, and ive only seen about 10 of the 30 cars in the game in pvp. Outside of PVP the other players on the map can be really annoying, you will probably never see them while dirving around exploring but go to a skill challenge and expect 5 people to telaport there after you and start parking in the way or even trying to ram you off the road for no reason.  AI: the AI cheats...A LOT. doesnt matter what car your in or how fast your going the ai will be faster, cops will catch your 250MPH ford GT in a crown victoria, ram your Hummer H1 off the road easily without damaging their own car, cops can arrest you if your driving below 40MPH for more then 3 seconds and they teleport to your position sometimes if your escaping. Races against ai can be really annoying because the game decides to tell you that you were in 3rd place despite finishing 1 mile ahead of the 2nd place guy, the AI will teleport miles ahead in a race sometimes and you cant ram them off the road but they so much as bump you and your sent flying off the road.  Multiplayer: The games really fun to play with friends however i played the whole story mode with a friend and we did all but 3 mission at least twice due to the game disconecting one of us after winning and not giving us credit for completing it on almost EVERY SINGLE RACE.  Overall: Its a fun game to play with friends, tons to explore, cars are expensive so theres a lot of farming to do, plenty of acheivments, skill challenges and multi hour races if your a completionist, however its a mess of flaws, bugs, cheating AI, lag, disconects after races, and the pvp is honestly by far the worst pvp i have ever played.

10689	Man I know I don't have the best configs to run games, but dropping to 20 FPS just because some smoke and a f*cking police chopper? Jesus, stay away of this abomination, Ubisoft does not know how to properly optimize a game for Laptop, even for PC's, I'd recommend you to not buy it if you have a Laptop, stay away...
10690	This game wasn't worth $60 then and it's not worth $30 now.
10691	WHY DOES THIS GAME KEEP PROMPTING TO BUY THE FULL GAME???? ISNT THIS ALREADY THE FULL GAME? AND IT ALSO SAYS ITS A TRIAL VERSION. STEAM PLESE EXPLAIN
10692	After wildrun game started to lag for no reason even on lowest settings, i loved the game before the wildrun update but now? its â¥â¥â¥â¥
10693	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Game was broken, so they fixed it. But season pass holders have to pay for the expansion. â¥â¥â¥â¥ ubisoft and their asshat business models. Never buy 'season' passes......
10694	Do not buy this game if you:  1. Do not want to 'Upgrade' to Windows 10 2. Have multiple monitors 3. Expect the games to be complete without DLC 4. Don't want a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of DRM framework software on your computer 5. Expect to get your money's worth. 6. Want the tech support you paid for when you bought the game. 7. Want to have fun when playing your game.
10695	  Does not let me launch game, it has issues connecting to my Ubisoft account. :P
10696	It is a decent game, but for the price, and the fact that in the middle of a live mission, you get stuck in any â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way, you are screwed... this is a huge problem, especially when you are running a hour+ long mission and you get slammed into a guard rail where your bumper gets stuck on and you have NO way to get unstuck except quit the damn mission... I am giving this game a negative rating because I feel this ruins a lot of the end-game play, but it was a decent game till I was racing hour+ missions and realizing this happens often enough for it to be a big deal and months after release this is still not fixed.
10697	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wretched. I picked it up thinking it was a steal, with dreams of the old need for speed days in my head. First off, I expected some huge expansive enviroment. There are invisible â¥â¥â¥â¥ing walls sectioning off all of the cool places, the cities are generic and small, and burning out in a cornfield is only fun for like 5 minutes.  The story line is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage. Youre some weird â¥â¥â¥ ex-racer turned narc trying to avenge your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing juice head brother and it doesnt even make sense. You have this weird â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who keeps â¥â¥â¥â¥ing calling you all the time, even when your free roaming you hear her â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ voice; 'DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN INVITE YOU FRIENDS! YOU SHOULD GO DO YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MISSION!' SHUT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ UP YOU STUPID â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I HATE YOUR VOICE AND I DONT WANT TO DO A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MISSION!  The handling feels like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dead donkey's being dragged around by a snowplow. All cars feel like they came out of GTA IV. Like somebody spread butter all over the roads and squirted honey all over your wheels.  The physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and your car often glitches. This is really common, like, your car will teleport 10 feet when you hit a tree. They also try to rip off the cool burnout crash scenes, but the only cosmetic change that can happen to your car is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bumper pops off. So you have to endure a 10 second scene of your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bumper popping off. Its so anticlimactic it cringes me out.  The real nail in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing coffin for me was the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ online. Its literally broken. â¥â¥â¥â¥ UPLAY â¥â¥â¥â¥ UPLAY â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOUPLAY! MMO MY â¥â¥â¥! I cannot join my friend. We bought it together and I cannot join him no matter what. If we get real â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lucky and get in a crew, one of us will DC right away. Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken. My favourite part is that when im trying to join him my personal helpful little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ narrator will remind me I can join my friends games.  Just for the love of god, dont by this utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. Ive never written a review before, but I just had to after that aweful experience. This game is worth 5 dollars max, and it still wouldnt be fun.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ ubisoft, â¥â¥â¥â¥ uplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the crew. 
10698	I really want to love this game, I really do. But I'm just not feeling The Crew, on paper, this game seems amazing, maybe even one of the best racing games ever made. The idea is revolutionary. Too bad the gameplay is sub-par. The car handeling is just about the worst I've personally seen. Maybe I'm just used to the NFS/GRID series, I don't know. The cars just seem so weird, you either oversteer or understeer 75% of the time, I just don't feel it. The idea for a 'Racing MMO' is fantastic. Sadly, I can't really take advantage of it, since I don't have any friends that currently own the game, I'm sure it's probably very fun with a few buddies. Just playing by myself, I got bored very quickly. In my opinion, this game has one of the worst prolouges I've ever played. The story itself isn't very original either. This game has/had a ton of potential, but I just don't see it at the moment. I'll try it out on the Xbox One. 4/10
10699	Pro: -you can drive cars Contra: -worst driving physik -rubberbanding enemies -you cant even tune all cars to the max like ubisoft said -even in gta you can tune your car better -even in mario kart you can tune your car better -even in any barbie game you can tune your car better -even a browser game on facebook has a deeper story -hurr durr we have 60 fps..but when you activate it your cpu is burning down :^) -you must stay online any time when you play it..but you will never see a other player.. -ubisoft tryied to create 'real players' who are bots -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ they even have a profilpic  -the crew feature...sucks...you are in a crew and you cant do â¥â¥â¥â¥  -you can choose beetween 5 fractions..doesent matter where you go cause it will change nothing  ubisoft sucks last 5 games where the biggest mistakes...  10/10-ign
10700	Boring, braindead game.   This game becomes extremely trivial once you upgrade your vehicle at least +50 from race requirement, and this isn't hard to do.   Game can be completed with just your starter vehicle, there's hardly any incentive to buy a new vehicle unless it's something that catches your eyes (and you can afford it) or its practical and covers all 5 Upgrades.   You do not get a great sum of cash income at all. I've spent probably $4k (Crew Bucks) in total for cosmetic items like paint, bumpers and rims. By the time I finished the game I had 300K. Which can barely get you â¥â¥â¥â¥ all.   The Crew can easily be completed around 14Hrs if you just tunnel vision your way through story mode - While upgrading your vehicle on the go. Getting to max level (50) took me around about 10hrs. The Crew's story it self was trash. It's not interesting it makes barely any sense and it's really not worth paying attention to at all. You'll often be questioning the choices made by writers who wrote the story.   The game does showcase key-parts to cities well, it isn't exactly to real size, however it does take in the important parts to places within USA.   Performance wise, it ran well on my PC on high and with 60FPS cap on (Note you can apply this within game setting - initial install its locked on 30FPS). Sometimes frames dipped within motion blur and unnecessary police red. blue light flashing on border of screen, but majority of the time i had a solid 60.   Honestly this game is decent at best, if you want a braindead game that can be slightly enjoyable and relaxing at times. But you will get bored easily.     Main reasons i pressed No to recommend game as it felt incredibly empty, boring and overall did not fill my expectations when I saw trailer for this ages back. You will 90% time be on your own and rarely EVER come across anyone online. IF you ARE keen on buying this though, do recommend buying on sale - not at full price.
10701	+ cruising around on a big map can be fun with some ppl + theres a ski jumping hill that you can jump off :)  - only 7 players at any given time in this MMO racing game - bad sound design, NFS most wanted 2005 has better sound, alot of the sound is just recycled ( dodge viper, chevrolet camaro, ford mustang or gt have all the same engine sound ) - at first it had graphics like NFS pro street, now they updated it and it looks almost like grid 2 - bad singleplayer, it just booring - multiplayer is chaos, the players are constantly lagging around, so you cant have collision on cuz you will get hit everytime - the map is too big, empty and nothing to do in it ( it should be smaller, so they can ramp up the graphics ) - theres no weight to the handling feels like playing a toy car
10702	not a realy good racing game 1 its gets boring after the first 10 races  2 you have to get first place every race in campaign to proceed. it just gets frustrating when you lose and dont get in exp at all 3 not a lot of cars to drive  4 a lot of people say that the driving physics does not feel real i agree  5 it seems that everyone can drive fast and take better turns than you can even tho you have a better car 6 i have not found a way to compare cars stats efficiently ( side by side ) 7 if they are going to do a open world racing game dont do it half â¥â¥â¥ LA dois not look like LA ,CA dois not look like CA lake tahoe is not to size, Los Vegas also dois not look real, at lest to me it doesn't  
10703	worst driving game ever played! waste of money and time!
10704	This game panders to anyone who has never played a racing game in their life. Super arcade style physics. Like more arcade feeling than Need for Speed. You can be going 200+ miles an hour and handbrake drift around a 90 degree corner with great ease. Worse than that, hitting the wall and other players in corners actually makes you go FASTER than traditional braking. All the cars feel the same and have very similiar, if not identical handling. The handling of cars is very boring. They all feel like I am piloting a hovercraft that has better side to side movement rather than a car that takes turns and corners in lines. The controls are unresponsive to a point of feeling like a beta free-to-play game. The graphics look like they were built on an engine about 7 years old. The music is all whiney and or emo sounding alternative rock. The user base is very rude and anti-social. The story line is uttelry absurd and stolen from Need for Speed 'Most Wanted'. Unlocking items and upgrades for your car requires entirely too much time and effort. If the person you are racing crashes into traffic or rams into a corner it doesen't matter because they just use NOS to get back to speed. The game has a very juvenile vibe in general.   The only saving throw this game has is a large open world to explore.
10705	I just brought the game and I can't play because the oldest drivers are playable, the recent aren't. I don't know, but life is in foward not to back.
10706	I have the season pass but i didnt get the DLC Wild run. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Season pass doesn't mean anything
10707	Good looking game but its very simple to what it is. Just driving a car and racing. But if you are into that stuff you might like it but its my opinion that this game isnt worth the money and i was impulsive to buy it.  But my travler we all have our own opinion dont we? Good luck to you.
10708	I bought this game on sale expecting it to be similar to Test Drive Unlimited 2. The open world is indeed interesting, but all the other elements didn't impress me at all. The story was generic and I found myself bored in no time. All the cars handled very similarly. Didn't like the multiplayer either. Last time I've played this game I've searched for a PvP lobby for about 5 minutes and then I was presented with 3 other players all of which had upgraded cars and I've had no chance to win at all. No wonder Ubisoft are giving the game away for free for the whole month right now, the community is almost dead. I wouldn't recommend to buy this game, get it for free while you can if you want to check it out.
10709	last update broke the game. works for 2 minutes and then crashes to desktop every single time.
10710	Ubisoft... you did again and again and again...
10711	Its not an MMO since only 7 people can play with you at the same time.   The police are faster than they should be- using boost doesnt do anything when trying to escape.   In missions where you have to destroy another car they're faster than you are.   You're forced to use a specific class of car for each mission.  There are only a few cars that can be used for each of the car classes.   Its a good game- the physics are pretty good, graphics aren't bad, and the map is immense but it isn't an mmo, the cops are faster than they should be, and you have limited freedom in choosing which car's to use for each mission.
10712	Do NOT waste your money on this hollow shell of a game.   It's titles like this that move the title of 'greediest gaming company' to other people than EA. Your initial $60 gets you a whopping 40 models of car, with somewhere between 1 and 5 tuning settings each. Then, you're forced to pay for any additional content they provide past 'updates' for those first 40 cars. Now that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't waft all these extra rides in front of your face on every vehicle select screen, including the new car lot, making every completionist out there cringe. Oh, and the icing on the car cake? Your vinyls/liveries for your car are limited to whatever presets are available in the game, and some cost as much as a new car. Talk about limited customization!  On top of all their swindling of your cash, the map is far from fleshed-out, with vast expanses of nothingness where only one relatively small subset of the vehicles in the game can get above 60mph. This makes the game feel very empty, and it's only compounded by only being able to see 7 other players (in an MMO, haha!) at a time in-world. The rest of the 'life' in the game are NPC cars with little to no driving skill who will inevitable get in your way more often than not, NPC pedestrians with whom your only interaction is 'spooking' them out of the way, and random furry critters that act suspiciously like the people.  The story is short and will only take a day or two to finish for a decent player. The endgame content is lacking and the leaderboards are dominated by trainer-using cheaters, so you can give up your dream of being e-famous in this game.  It really feels like I paid $60 for a very pretty but very empty tech demo. Despite desperately needing some games to play with new PC friends, I'd never recommend this thing to anyone.
10713	ONLY BUY IF UNDER 30$ (might be skewed, havent played in like a month or two)  PROS: -HUGE HUGE HUGE Open world -Long races can be very fun -Can run from the cops with buddies in an open world -Lots of cars and modifications  Cons: -It's a really annoying interface  -Some of the roads the developers just phoned it in, because it's such a huge map -MIssions suck â¥â¥â¥â¥ -PVP is impossible -THe factions are dumb -Long races become pointless when you can have a worker do it for you -Getting upgrades in your car is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying, its GRINDING challenges that arent fun -Cant pvp until you have the best fastest car -Confusing way of getting upgrades in your car sometimes -AI will ALWAYS find a way to get in front of you no matter how fast you go, missions are scripted -Takedown missions suck horribly -The way multiplayer works is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, makes you feel alone among so many others  Lots of cons and can be annoying but i still think it's worth a play through just because the idea of it is really cool even if the game mechanics such horribly.
10714	Dont get me wrong, its fantastically hilarious to glitch the cars around. Flipping them and what not.  However the negitive part is the map. The cities are bad, sub-par at best.  The cars are fantastic, but handling is terrible.  You get my point. Not worth 60 dollars, or 80 for gold.. AT ALL.
10715	No.  Cons: -Time wasted to download this 20GB game. -Third party uplay â¥â¥â¥â¥. -Windows updating relating problems. -Can't start the game. ('The Crew has stoppped working') -Hours of searching for solution- failed.  Pros: -Refunded within 24 hours.  There are strong reasons this game gets mixed reviews. Don't buy it. Trust the reviews.  
10716	This game.. sucks ! I am so disappointed. The NFS series are waaay more better than this one.  The visuals are ok, but the sound, yuck.  A game combination of Test Drive Unlimited 2 and NFS, wich is a big fail.
10717	It regularly crashes and the (XB1 controller) controls feel wrong. Steering is way too arcadelike, isnt much fun.
10718	TL:DR the game support and uplay lancher is trash this game has gone from bad tho elite tier garbage. between the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t with the season pass(not including all the dlc) and its horrible multiplayer and support you will ove very little fun playing it. game play its self is not all that bad but suffers from bugs glitches recenlty bad lag. The 'crew system' is just broken. it does not work like it is sopose to.  stop buying ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥ games. dont fall for a trailer. all stuff i learned from this game.
10719	After playing almost 28 hours I finally quit this game with absolute RAGE !!!!!. This is a total misunderstanding and a terrible joke.   Firstly, the game offers a very big world where you can go everywhere, really BUT WHO CARES IF PART OF THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOT LOADING AND YOU FREEZE IN A F@#$%NG UNLOADED TERAIN TEXTURE!!!.Through this problem you can't complete many races, and drive to many worlds areas. This problem occurs always.  Secondly when you are trying to teleport to another location or wait for the race, loading screen freezes and nothing happens. This problem occurs after 2 to 5 loadings screens.Through this problem you need to restart the game very often. So practically when you turn on the game you will have to restart EVERY F@#$%NG TIME AFTER FEW MINUTES !!!!. This problem occurs VERY VERY VERY VERY OFTEN but not always.  Thirdly in fractional war, game daily deletes xp you gained in factional races so it is very hard to keep any rank, and if you can (do that will take you a very long time and days )still at the end of each month rank is reset. PEACE OF JOKE !!!!!  4: Ai cars are cheating teleporting before us or reaching too high not achievable speed.You can win with them but they make level system of our cars is absolutely pointless.  5: Maximum chaotic mechanical parts system I've ever seen!  6: A small number of cars but if you buy seasonpass you get many cool models.  7: Funny driving unrealistic system.  8: OOOOhhhhhh I forgot ! MEGA F@#$%NG PROBLEMS WITH GAME START-UP (On my computer reinstal Nvidia drivers on older helped but i read on many forums that this solution does not helped many players).  9: The graphic is at an early Alpha level in my opinion (Cars look like they were flying over the street, this is so funny).  Finally, speaking the game would be good if not first two problems that I mentioned that completely ruined it.This is my opinion but I sincerely advise against buying this game :( .Few years ago there was a game called Fuel, which has many more Bikes ,Cars, Quads, Monstertrucks and everytching than The Crew and The Crew Wild Run and she was just perfect. If you want more open world, more vehicles ,absolute perfect gameplay ,go and buy Fuel istead of absolute ruined The Crew. ;)
10720	BUUUUULSHIT y play 2hours and the game is perfect and after that y can play , y can LAUNCH THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME EVER and you can refund you are play 2h â¥â¥â¥â¥ the crew worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game esti de caliss
10721	PAY MUCH MONEY THAT COMES OUT #0_1 EROR BUMP. UBISOFT WE WANT TO HAVE FUN NOT A GARBAGE PROXY EROR.... YOU HAVE TO FIX IT
10722	Okay so I bought this game on July 3rd one of the last days of steam summer sale 2016 and I like it, in my opinion I find it to be a very fun driving game to just cruise around in different vehicles and such. At the time of writing this review I have 14 hours invested in this game and have still not drove on the entire map. However as much as I like this game I can not reccomend it fully so I'm not going to recomend it at all. Let me explain that a little I bought the complete edition for this game for 29.99 which is the price of the regular game but to me that's still a pretty steap price considering how I buy mostly indy games or really cheap games that run about 15 dollars or lower my point in stating all of this is that I paid money for the 'complete edition' for a game and the game has microtransactions while you can get all the vehicles or at least to my knowledge by normal means of just playing and earning money it still has microtransactions which in my opinion is absolutely absurd for a triple A title game from ubisoft especially for the complete edition of the game which in my opinion should be by defintion complete I don't expect everything to just be unlocked by any means I love playing the game and unlocking stuff progresively but having a option to pay real money in your game for things that aren't even dlc is just silly.  One other complaint that I have with this game is the frame rate being locked at 30 this may be something that can be changed in the setting I really haven't looked or it could be my pc can only run it at 30 fps I'm not sure but if this is locked that is a huge mistake by ubisoft to lock the frame rate on a game as beautiful as this one I enjoy pushing my pc to see how good I can make the game look and at 30 fps I just don't feel like that cuts it to me those are console limitations that shoudn't be on pc to begin with.  Anyway to state how I feel about this game is it's a fun driving/racing game if you like that kind of stuff and want a huge map to just drive around in however due to the poinless microtransactions and locked frame rate that ubisoft has on this game I just recommend it fully. If stuff like that doesn't bother you and you just want a really fun driving game this game is perfect for you just don't give in to the greedy microtransactions that ubisoft tries to impose for a game that you most likely just paid for price for or if you are lucky got on sale.
10723	Edit: As it turns out, it was a driver issue. Nvidia 368.39 drivers break the game, and you will have to rollback to a previous version to make it run.  First game I've ever been so upset with that I write a review about it.  This game is unplayable. Literally. It crashes as soon as you launch it. Now, other reviewers have said this. But, if you're like me, you're probably thinking 'Pfff, whatever, if I have the problem I'll just google it and have it working in five minutes.'  Yeah, no. There is no single solution to this problem. So many things can cause this game to crash on startup, that there are hundreds of different solutions to the problem. I still haven't found one that works.  If you still decide to buy this game, good luck. You'll need it.
10724	After the latest patch I was very satisfied with the amount of space I regained on my hard drive after deleting the entire thing.
10725	There you goo.... THE CREW BY UBIShit.  Bought The Crew Gold Edition. With Season Pass of course.  The Crew Wild Run DLC came out! Get excited. Realise its not in the season pass.  Well â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ubishit! I want my season pass refund! o0o
10726	If you own a Thrustmasters ferrari challenge wheel don't buy this because it isn't compatible with this game, even though I told Ubisoft about this problem when the game was in beta they didn't do anything to fix it...
10727	I bought this game 3 days ago. Downloaded in 2 hours, deleted in 2 hours. Because this lovely game not opening! The issue is 'The Crew Game Stopped Working.' I never see intro too. Tried everything but still 'The Crew Game Stopped Working.'. Don't buy this game because its ubi's game! (PM me if you have solution please.)
10728	UNOPTIMIZED SERVERS FOR ASIAN PLAYERS (specifically SEA).  Buying to play with your friends is f*cking ironic.
10729	Alright, I bought the complete edition of the game, don't have any of the cars, what gives....
10730	I have had this game for about a year and am now doing a review for some odd reason. I first wanted this game to play with lots of other people online and have fun. but the only major fun part in this game is the story which you can beat so quickly its not even funny.The game is fantastic but short and exspensive. Plus Noone ever realy gets online to play anymore. I got the game not long after it came out just so i could make friends and play together and nobody was online usualy except for me.So i do not recomend this game if you thought about buying it go use that money to buy Mad Max.
10731	having some issues. game crashes very 2 min.
10732	The Crew is possibly the worst racing game ive ever played.  Pros: - Looks very nice - Wide range of vehicles - Large map to explore - Overall good story  Cons - Limited vehicle customization - Potatoe servers - Terrible payout system (you're not getting any money unless you grind PvP races all day) - Poor leveling system - Slightly better police than NFS 2015 (nothing to be proud of) - Crashes on windows 10 - If you plug in a controller it will most likey not work or crash your game instantly - Major pay to play aspect - Glitches and bugs - Physics/10  Conclusion/TLDR Just buy Something like Need For Speed Or Burnout Paradise instead

10738	last update broke the game. works for 2 minutes and then crashes to desktop every single time.
10739	Nothing like it was originally advertised to be. If you have any interest in driving for pleasure, look elsewhere.  Cons: -Map feels small, due to constant scenery changes -Cars handle like ice skates -Framerate is heavily dependent on where you're driving -Crashes from time to time -If you crash your car in a race, you are respawned near the other AI drivers -In-game purchases everywhere -Racing is bland  Pros: -Gets you back into playing Test Drive Unlimited 2 again  The conclusion: Considering I could have bought both TDU2 and Euro Truck Simulator 2 for less than I originally paid for this, it was in no way worth it for me. Even if this was on sale for 80% off, I wouldn't recommend it.
10740	This game is awesome, but gets boring afterwards :(
10741	The Crew serves a great concept for a Simulator, Racing and Open World MMO at the same time. But, that's only it - a great concept. Good graphics. Not as resource efficient as other games. Amazing map. What went wrong though? Well, the game itself is enjoyable.. in the first 10 missions. After a point, the feeling gets too repetitive, up to a point where the player, me at least, isn't motivated to keep on playing. The game is a little bit pay2win, in my opinion. Bugs still exist. Verdict: Meh. I mean mind you, if you like open world games and racing, etc, you can try it for yourself, but unfortunately, for me it's a no go. 4/10. And yes, the story and feel plays a big role.
10742	No.  Cons: -Time wasted to download this 20GB game. -Third party uplay â¥â¥â¥â¥. -Windows updating relating problems. -Can't start the game. ('The Crew has stoppped working') -Hours of searching for solution- failed.  Pros: -Refunded within 24 hours.  There are strong reasons this game gets mixed reviews. Don't buy it. Trust the reviews.  
10743	This game.. sucks ! I am so disappointed. The NFS series are waaay more better than this one.  The visuals are ok, but the sound, yuck.  A game combination of Test Drive Unlimited 2 and NFS, wich is a big fail.
10744	horrible mouse issues, freezes up like crazy, buggy as hell!!! don't waste your money on PC!!!  BTW I have 2 titan black video cards on a dual 8core Xeon 3.5 ghz... so no my system is not slow and this trying to run it just on one monitor at normal HD settings.. WTF!!!! mouse keeps scrolling up at 10000 miles per hr, I can't stop it, so I can't choose anything, I can't select anything from the map cause again 'mouse goes haywire.' BTW mouse works just fine when in mini menus but not in full map nor racing menus.. not worth it, did every upgrade for graphics, mouse, and sound drivers, still same problem, all other games run just fine.. UPLAY is a joke right now!!!
10745	Currently The Crews multiplayer function is broken for a lot of people, so do not purchase it if you are going to play it because of multiplayer function. However if youre fine with a NFS underground/most wanted single player player game, go ahead!
10746	**DO NOT BUY THIS GAME** Once again, as usual, Ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it all up...  I had some fun with it, but actually the best thing is large and detailed map, and everything else sucks.. Car physics are bad, you will rarely spin out or crash into oncoming traffic, car details are bad(scratches, bumps etc.), cutscenes are buggy as hell, car chases are way too hard, even on lowest difficulty, it's rare to find someone to play co-op, besides your friends... This game was over-hyped as every Ubisoft's game.. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you ubisoft .i.
10747	last update broke the game. works for 2 minutes and then crashes to desktop every single time.
10748	having some issues. game crashes very 2 min.
10749	Nothing like it was originally advertised to be. If you have any interest in driving for pleasure, look elsewhere.  Cons: -Map feels small, due to constant scenery changes -Cars handle like ice skates -Framerate is heavily dependent on where you're driving -Crashes from time to time -If you crash your car in a race, you are respawned near the other AI drivers -In-game purchases everywhere -Racing is bland  Pros: -Gets you back into playing Test Drive Unlimited 2 again  The conclusion: Considering I could have bought both TDU2 and Euro Truck Simulator 2 for less than I originally paid for this, it was in no way worth it for me. Even if this was on sale for 80% off, I wouldn't recommend it.
10750	If you're looking for a good driving game...just wait for GTA V
10751	For an RPG/Driving game this is a decent game. In terms of execution... oh dear.  Beefeing up your ride to twice that of the AI one would think you'd win easily, yeah, not so much. You can ONLY win if you wait for the script to let you win. Don't even think of overtaking cars with pure skill. You can drive like an asshat and win since the AI slows down and lets you win... right before the end. Or, you could drive like you're paid to do it... and loose since you had to break in the last curve. Lets get one thing straight, your skill as a driver has 0 impact wether or not you win races. All you have to do is to wait for the script to let you win. And that is even before the AI starts to cheat. Then there's the police... Going from 0 to 300 in one second - CHECK Breaking suddenyl in front of you at 300 kmh and taking no dmg nor moving whatsoever - CHECK Taking turns at breakneck speed without braking - CHECK doing a 360 at full speed and then just continue in the opposite direction - CHECK Being able to send you into a spin just by nudging your car - CHECK Being able to do precise manouvers EVERY time without fail - CHECK Being able to catch up to you when you drive the fastest most badass car in the game, and they sit in a 'normal' car - CHECK Being able to pass through other cars with nothing happening - CHECK  In short, the police in this game is not bothered with physics. It has potential, but without fixing a cheating AI and a godmode police... no, not worth getting
10752	im pretty sure this could be a great game but only if i could actually makes it not crash right at the beggining of the launching of the game itself that would be great. You know to actually have a game that starts. And Ubisoft said The Crew was going to be nothing like AC Unity well at least that game could start
10753	this game was only made for money  no efforts was put in it at all filled with glitches and incoherence (example: non-modified cop car can drive faster than a street modified car, apperently cop car can brake a more than 600hp car from 200km/h to 0km/h plus themselves without their car breaking) repetitive gameplay and boring missions  the multiplayer of this game is empty unrealistic map of the us tons of raging moments 1 question i still cannot find the answer to: Was this game made to be fun? to make this short dont buy this game you will regret it even the worst need for speed are better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ how come out of 3 games (assassins creed unity, far cry 3 and the crew) no of them was truly good
10754	That's it Ubi, i am not buing one more game from you again. Ever. STOP RELEASING UNFINISHED GAMES!  And anyone who states that this  game  pile of crap is feature complete (or the least fun to play) must be on some powerful narcotic or something.
10755	well... the (s)crew, what can you say  'mmo' ....... max 8 players (they seem to have misinterpreted the 'massively' there) 'coop' ....... only possible to play as a 'crew' of 2. no more than that. we've tried (again misinterpreting 'cooperative') 'racing' ..... yep racing. bad racing. impossible to get the enemies of your tail, they seem to be attached to you somehow. and escaping cops? lol only happens out of pure luck. gamepad doesn't work properly and don't even ask about the steering wheel... they did everything wrong there imho  and the most annoying part is, that they fixed nothing since beta. nothing. they just released half a game... and that half's broken. glitching through cars or animals (which all seem to chirp... even the deer), invisible other players (if there are any that is), getting kicked out of the game or just a nice freeze...  also up to this day no answer from ubisoft about all of the above. they don't even care. you bought it, now it's your problem. well thanks, we will remember that.  don't buy it... just don't
10756	The Crew has terrible driving mechanics, and cheap ways to extend the 'story' missions as much as possible. The cars severely overcorrect, there is way too much drift even when driving at lower speeds, the acceleration and braking in every car is terrible, even with extensive upgrades, and it is impossible to make small adjustments when driving. Basically, everything that can go wrong in a driving game's mechanics has in The Crew. Add that to the frequent server down time, DRM, requirement of Uplay, and other cars in races being boosted even when you have much better parts than them, and this game is worth maybe $20, but even that's a stretch. The open world is nice, but when it's this hard to get around it, it makes an extensive map like this much less impressive. This is something I would expect from a new indie games company, not a large company like Ubisoft. Maybe they'll learn from having 3 large releases being terrible this year. If you're going to buy The Crew, wait until it's on sale for less than $20, and don't expect to get much out of the story missions, it's really only good for the open world exploration, and even then it's a stretch.
10757	Fully release a beta game? Thanks ubgay. Be warned this is not what it appears max number of people online in your session is 7 and the session is random and does not put you with friends most/any of the time.  DO NOT BUY AT THIS TIME! 
10758	this game keeps crashing i tried everything and nothing works and i heard great things about it too, sad thing is i bought the game for $80 bucks thinking it would work on my freaking machine that i bought for this game
10759	Game feels unfinished and gets old very quickly . Story bland and nothing we haven't seen 100 times before. Fun to crusie around and listen to music (your own music, in game music sucks) pick up this game if you are a car lover and enjoy long drives but only when it is on sale. Like 75% off sale or more.
10760	So, The Crew, by Ubisoft. It's a very nice idea, join friends and complete missions in high preformance cars. Sounds like The Fast and the Furious right? Joining a crew for sertain missions and for PvP is realy easy, leaving said crew is aswell. The missions in PvE are easy, even Solo. The game has a short storyline by which at the end you are the Boss (V8) of a street racing gang that has gone international criminal orginasation. You achive so by means of driving missions using various vehicles like street cars, high preformance sport cars, dirt cars, trophy trucks and circuit speed demons. You can free ride unrestricted trough the USA freely switching between cars and explore a lot of sites, the game gives in game curency as a reward for visiting sight seeing area's and provides one or two lines of background info. Also you can get involved in police chases, and hamper other players that are being prosued.  The gameplay gives of a friendly arcade style feeling. The cars look real good and tons of costumization is available. The world you dive in is done quite good and I especially like how the road surface affects your grip. Rain and snow don't do your grip any good and the various type of vehicle will respond differently to it. Unfortunatly the road does need work, small bumbs and missalignments in road surfaces cause unecpected bumbs and jumps, or crashes if using a circuit car, and cause grip loss, sliding and other automotive mayhem. Something your computer controlled opponents don't seem to be bothered by. Doing the faction missions, which only help with cashflow or so it seems, the opponents are of about the same level as you are, making for an intresting challange, if not for the unfair behaviour of the game favouring against you. Which i found frustrating and annoying at times. The game as purely a racing game gets boring quite quickly after you have maxed out your personnal level and some cars you like to use. Doing the same 'test', a mini challange, can get you rewarded with the best possible parts for your ride. The lvl 50 parts have 4 different bonusses so again, costumize and find the best setting. Making sure that cars that have maxed out still have a bit of difference in them. All sounds good right? Yes, the game in istelf is quite good, be it short, and your reasons for playing it will mostly be becouse of your friends list. Gamers are friendly mostly but crews in PvP can realy ruin your day by having one or two members take out the competions and having their friends win easy. Well within the rules but not fair play.  The game has promise, and loads of DLC is indeed promised, including more cars and area's to explore. Most will have found the Mexican border crossing by now. But at the time of this writing, is not open yet.   Conclusion, If I make the game sound in general not bad at all, why not reccomend it? Well, there's this one thing in the way of hours of fun gameing with your friends. Crashes, not in game car crashes but gamecrashes, computer crashes, network crashes, server connection interruptions, explained errors, unexplained errors, known errors that will give you a code and ask you to submit them. (the location the game suggest is the Ubi website but i couldn't figure out where to put them in.) In 60 hours of gameplay I calculated an interruption would take place on average every 3 hours of gameplay. Fairly annoying and other than the occasional lagg not very accepteble in this day and age. I don't think my PC has ever crashed on any other game besides The Crew. Save for windows update butting in but no-one can blame any game or develloper for that right? I won't at least. So The Crew might seem as a must-have, but it isn't. So even if you still want to buy it, refrain from buying it together with the Seasons Pass untill you are satisfied with the game.   So, end of rant and pardon my English! (Yes, it's meant to be English)
10761	horrible mouse issues, freezes up like crazy, buggy as hell!!! don't waste your money on PC!!!  BTW I have 2 titan black video cards on a dual 8core Xeon 3.5 ghz... so no my system is not slow and this trying to run it just on one monitor at normal HD settings.. WTF!!!! mouse keeps scrolling up at 10000 miles per hr, I can't stop it, so I can't choose anything, I can't select anything from the map cause again 'mouse goes haywire.' BTW mouse works just fine when in mini menus but not in full map nor racing menus.. not worth it, did every upgrade for graphics, mouse, and sound drivers, still same problem, all other games run just fine.. UPLAY is a joke right now!!!
10762	Currently The Crews multiplayer function is broken for a lot of people, so do not purchase it if you are going to play it because of multiplayer function. However if youre fine with a NFS underground/most wanted single player player game, go ahead!
10763	Was looking forward to this game. After playing it i would not suggest it to anyone else  Waste of potential Lack of cars Lack of customization options  Map is huge, about all it has going for it.
10764	Do not buy this game, Ubisoft scam money from player and doing nothing if you need help or having an issue in game, guarantee regret if you buy!!!
10765	Fully release a beta game? Thanks ubgay. Be warned this is not what it appears max number of people online in your session is 7 and the session is random and does not put you with friends most/any of the time.  DO NOT BUY AT THIS TIME!

10770	Currently The Crews multiplayer function is broken for a lot of people, so do not purchase it if you are going to play it because of multiplayer function. However if youre fine with a NFS underground/most wanted single player player game, go ahead!
10771	The game is a pretty cool concept, and there's a lot of stuff in the open, very neat world to do.  It also has somewhat of a Need For Speed Underground 2 feel to it, too, which I like.  My only big problem is that, like pretty much every other racing game out there, it is far better played with a controller of some sort. Driving with your keyboard isn't a particularly easy task, especially with an automatic transmission from the nineties (their automatic transmission is pretty crap).
10772	F@^%^&amp;^*%*&amp;^T%R$$#@# ubisoft in the â¥â¥â¥â¥...pay 65 bucks for a turd that wont even load, no issues at launch my fuggin â¥â¥â¥....save your money until there is a singleplayer mode...
10773	It is such a halfassed game.
10774	Not worth the money: it's riddled with bugs, the campaign sucks â¥â¥â¥ (you still have to do it), the gameplay isn't that enjoyable, and u-play is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ launcher.
10775	This is the stupidest game ive ever played npc = god
10776	Rubber-banding in 2014, who would've thought we could sink so low? I was super hyped about this game but I just can't play it. It has huge potential but some critical design flaws transformed it from a 'must-play' to a 'uninstall in 3h'.  Somtimes I want to pick it up again but I drive for 20 minutes and become too frustrated. Not worth it as it is.
10777	THIS GAME IS BORING AND ITS VERY HARD TO GET MONEY TO BUY STUFF THATS COOL SO THIS GAME SUX
10778	meet hundreds of players they said go aginst other crews they said lol all bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ lies is what they said oh and if you enjoy just driving the country well it wont be all that great cus of all the challenges they stuck in the middle of the roads making it a pain to just drive around while going fast and exploring the roads no u cant do that you must do challenges there is no option to turn them off and besides ull never see more than 6-8 ppl at a time and ull normally be with AFK or random far off players not in the direction u need to go anyway dont waste ur coin on this crap
10779	Not worth the NZ$131. Good open world but very repeditive.  Very Arcade. Could have been alot better for the money. Can't really customize/personalise your cars, only follow the next upgrade, same as everyone else. Actual 'Crew' part of the game where you join a crew and race the streets as a crew never works. Very disappointing after all the hype...
10780	Not like the game
10781	No.  Cons: -Time wasted to download this 20GB game. -Third party uplay â¥â¥â¥â¥. -Windows updating relating problems. -Can't start the game. ('The Crew has stoppped working') -Hours of searching for solution- failed.  Pros: -Refunded within 24 hours.  There are strong reasons this game gets mixed reviews. Don't buy it. Trust the reviews.  
10782	This game.. sucks ! I am so disappointed. The NFS series are waaay more better than this one.  The visuals are ok, but the sound, yuck.  A game combination of Test Drive Unlimited 2 and NFS, wich is a big fail.
10783	It regularly crashes and the (XB1 controller) controls feel wrong. Steering is way too arcadelike, isnt much fun.
10784	The new loot system in wildrun sucks... the grind is 100x as long.
10785	After the latest patch I was very satisfied with the amount of space I regained on my hard drive after deleting the entire thing.
10786	Steam refunds are revolutionary.
10787	You thought MK X was an app? At least the proceeds went into a pot for a tournament. The Crew on the other hand? As soon as they introduced the dlc the main game stopped working. Turned buggy and a feature you paid for with the main game you had to pay for again. Probably not the only one who noticed or maybe harping an old toon about Ubisoft. This post isnt funny because the price of this game is not funny, ESO might be expensive, at least that expense is real content rather than reskined maps and vehicles. Do yourself a favor find better game to waste money on.
10788	The Game itself isnt bad or ugly just the AI is Cheating, if you hit something then youre out of the race, if the AI Crash they in 10 seconds behind you and fighting for the pole position. Second what rly bad is, is the randomnes. You are fighting with youre friends for the scoreboard competitions, no chance until you are happy and the traffic plays well for you or you dont have bad luck and a cop is spawn near you or, or, or! This is a nogo if luck is more importent then skill... its a racing game.  So if you wanna a Racing game you shouldnt buy this but if you want some Fast and Furios like Story 'Shiiiiiiiiet' then this is something for you.  Why did i give the game a bad review? Because i had hope they would fix many problems with the Wild Run 'Addon/Patch' but they just add some non needed stuff and weet streets all over the country.
10789	Honestly right now i regret buying this, this is chopped version of TDU2. There is only 58 induvidual cars in game most of them are muscle cars and 14 of them dlc cars. You can beat entire game with just one car. World is empty, car physics ugly. Should have bought Dying Light
10790	I warn anyone thinking about buying this game to pass on it for at least now until and even if they fix the crash problems that most people, myself too, have problems with. You will totally waste your time and money on this game. And if you exceed 2 hours of playtime and the days after purchase, trying to fix the problem for you which wont work 99,99% of the time, then you wont be able to refound your game in any way!
10791	This game is unplayable on current Nvidia cards updated past 369 and up. Consistantly crashes after 5-10minutes of gameplay regardless if you're in the map or at the main menu.   
10792	Biggest fail of 2014 for me. And`ve seen some bad games , trust me. They wasted 70% of budget for avdertisement and 30% on actual game. It could`ve been and good one IF THEY BOTHERED TO PUT AN EFFORT IN IT
10793	Found the game was played well, aside from crashing and the servers being down on launch, the game sometimes would work, i decided to reinstall and that fixed the running issues but there is not a thing on this planet that can fix the hatred i have for ubisoft now, they continue to release dlcs that cost 40$+. Tbh i had fun by myself because my brother could never run the game for more than 10 mins at a time and although they had a great idea with this game ubisoft should have released a working product, if chevrolet releases a car that wont steer after 10 mins of continuous driving is that right?  utterly disapointing
10794	Bought it, returned it, got a free copy.   Still won't play it.  Really don't know how anyone can defend this garbage.
10795	Works for a while, then decides to stop working for no reason all of a sudden, and you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.
10796	Wont even run...But the uninstall works flawlessly :D Spectacular
10797	Cons  Overhyped, A waste of money.   If you are looking for a game that you can modify your car with different parts and feel unique in your own creation look elsewhere.   Story is lame and uninteresting.  Physics purely geared towards arcade.  MMO? maybe there are 3-4 people in the city you are in, meet up and smash into eachother because thats all you can do.   I Can't find a reason to like this game. Better off getting GTAV because this game is a basically a stripped down to just the driving.
10798	The game didnt work until i backed up my driver, I dont recommend it.
10799	I really wanted to like this game...   it was literally the same thing over and over again.   i think this game would have been mucho better if it was more of a mix of gta5/NFS and the world of 'the crew'   id love to see a racing game like this make an even larger map this one was impressive but you could still really feel the scaling back of the map.  6/10
10800	The physics is outragouse. You spent so much on your cars for one spec then the mission asks you to use a vehicle provided, which has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ stats and wonky handling, with brakes that can't even stop a stroller. The frustration is real.
10801	Wow. Just wow.  This game is worse than racing games from 2010. When you slam into a car, said car does not even get damaged in any way. No glass breaking, no anything. Burnout Paradise is like 10 times better. PLEASE I BEG OF YOU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! &gt;:(   2/10 graphics were okay  everything else sucked
10802	I am a wheel/pedal/shifter user and this game supports wheel hardware extremely well. I own and play a large array of driving games and racing simulators so I have high expectations for car handling fidelity. For example, in Dirt Rally every vehicle physically feels and handles very differently. From acceleration to the suspension, cornering, and the feel of terrain. This is true of R3E, Automobalista, iRacing, Project Cars, etc. These games incorporate a physics system that heavily influences the stimulus felt from the terrain and car, as well as damage physics from collision. This game is fairly devoid of a genuine physics system and most cars feel very similar. The handling is bland as are collisions. Terrain types have little impact on how the car feels when considering these other games as standards.  I would really enjoy driving some of the cars from Dirt Rally in this gameâs world because it is the one feature that is outstanding. Weather, size, detail, and terrain. But, unfortunately the beauty this world has to offer will render no climax because youâre behind the wheel of a thick condom.  
10803	buy this game on sale  BAD: car AI  Good: openworld 
10804	This is a clear example that ubisoft needs to polish there games better before they put it out. This is what i would have expeted in the beta of this game. I went through numorous crashes and problems mainly online issues, I waited about 20 min for a lobby then there was a connection error. The race started and the camera was faced towards the bottom of the bumper the whole time. Not a great first impression.  This game needs to be refined and fixed before i can recomend this to someone.
10805	shi.ttiest driving mechanics ever
10806	Pick this game up if you want a terrible physics engine, apalling car control, no real custimization, and an orgy of bugs and errors that the Q&amp;A team missed. Way to go Ubisoft, you've made another terrible game and you will never get my money again.
10807	Bought game for Â£25, 'please buy full game', 2/10  Ubisoft are money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s  Dont buy this rip off
10808	***WARNING USES CRAP UBISOFT DRM UPLAY***  This game is just a big disapointment, idea was good but execution was terrible.  This is a driving game and driving should be the fun part of it right?  Wrong all the cars have the same bland feel to them and don't have any remote realistic feel to them at all.  The game made me waste like an hour in the prologe before I could even do any thing I can tell you after that hour I was already done with this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. There is no multiplayer race menu to find races.. which brings me to. MENU NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE.. like remember those bad 90s game menus? This game is on par with that. Game feels like a play4free game they decided to charge money for.  Also there was a lot of false advertising about The Wild Run DLC, People who bought the season pass DID NOT GET THE LAST DLC.. TOTAL SCAM BY UBISOFT!!!  Speaking of Wild Run this dlc seemed to break this game compared to what it was before.  Speaking of TERRIBLE.. This game has SERIOUS STUTTER AND VIDEO CHOPPINESS. before you accuse me of having a bad computer I'm getting 100+ fps maxed out with a ssd and 144hz monitor. This game has that â¥â¥â¥â¥ console port feel to it in everything you do. FEELS LIKE A TERRIBLE CONSOLE PORT! UNOPTIMIZED GARBAGE!!!   To put the icing on the game this game uses CRAP UBISOFT UPLAY DRM!!!  SCREW YOU UBISOFT! STEAM IS DRM IN OF ITSELF!!!!!  YES I AM REQUESTING A REFUND ON THIS CRAP GAME!!!   0/10 FAIL  ***WARNING USES CRAP DRM UBISOFT UPLAY***  âââââââââââââââââââââââ âââââââââââââââââââââââ âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââââââââââââââââââ  âââââââuPLAY-âââââââââââ âââââââââââââââââââââââ
10809	This is a clear example that ubisoft needs to polish there games better before they put it out. This is what i would have expeted in the beta of this game. I went through numorous crashes and problems mainly online issues, I waited about 20 min for a lobby then there was a connection error. The race started and the camera was faced towards the bottom of the bumper the whole time. Not a great first impression.  This game needs to be refined and fixed before i can recomend this to someone.
10810	Worst racing game experience I've had since the old need for speeds, which is what this feels like, except not as fun. Low quality graphics that remind me of early 360 games, and absolutely god awful car handling. The cars don't ever feel like they are going fast or you are pushing the limits like in other games like forza, the 'drifting' is unrealistic and feels like an attempt at the need for speed style of drifting, but its not as refined or fun. You touch one corner, wall, or car and you lose control and the race. This is my least favorite type of racing game because the entire goal of the game is not to crash, not to actually race. There is no skill at all envolved in the racing like finding a line or going as fast as possible, the only objective when playing this game is to avoid the crashing AI morons in front of you, the traffic that doesn't avoid the massive amount of cars heading down the road, or the trees that come up fast because of the terrible handling. This game was Ubisoft's attempt to make a Need for Speed style game for the next gens, and it is a failure. I know I sound like a NFS fanboy, but I hate that series and the best way to describe this is as an outdated, terrible version of need for speed.
10811	I want to like this game, but i cant say that I do. The gameplay is awful. It should be called cut scene sumulator. If you are willing to deal with bad driving physics, annoying cut scenes at the beginning of every race, and just a bad overall experience, this might be the game for you. 2/10
10812	Every damn car handles like butter on a hot stove. Unlike other ubisoft games which natively support sony controllers, this game does not, so unless you want to hunt down some worm ridden software to hack drivers, you will need an xbox controller. Playing this game with a keyboard is impossible.
10813	Welp, another dissapointing waste of a preorder. The handling in this game is some of the worst Ive ever seen. Every single car handles like a forklift dragging a boat anchor. The handbrake, instead of locking the rear wheels like a real racing game, turns your rear wheels into frictionless blocks of ice on a hot plate. Seriously. Drive 20mhp and hit the handbrake in real life or most racing games, you stop pretty harshly. In this game youll slide for 100 feet before stopping. The multiplayer was about as useful as a single player game, because outside of the tutorial area, I didnt see another player for a solid hour, despite playing on launch day in the first city. The destruction was pretty much nonexistant, and was something like I remember from need for speed games from the PS2. The story was lame and dry, and the map menu was about as useful as a see-n-say. Even though there were different options for handling, including 'hardcore', none of them changed the terrible handing at all. The map was the only thing about this game that didnt blow quite a lot of ween, and was decent to explore, but lacked polish in quite a few areas. I really really wanted this game to be good, because the trailers were awesome and the infrastructure seemed like a super awesome idea, but after playing the beta and the full game, thinking 'maybe it will get better after this', it never did. Its just plain boring and unenjoyable. Do not buy this game. Ubisoft has sunk pretty low if they think this will pass as a triple a racing mmo, or even a racing game at all.  Also â¥â¥â¥â¥ you for limiting this game at 60fps. I am a pc gamer with a big powerful graphics card and a 144hz monitor, I wanna use them.

10815	Servers down = no play, anything to do with connection = no play.... the trailer is real misleading to the actual playing of the game, same with the lackluster police chases trying to feel like hot pursuit.... Real sick of your sht ubisoft.
10816	buy this game on sale  BAD: car AI  Good: openworld 
10817	Can we all rally together and sue Ubisoft for false advertising?
10818	The game didnt work until i backed up my driver, I dont recommend it.
10819	I really wanted to like this game...   it was literally the same thing over and over again.   i think this game would have been mucho better if it was more of a mix of gta5/NFS and the world of 'the crew'   id love to see a racing game like this make an even larger map this one was impressive but you could still really feel the scaling back of the map.  6/10
10820	Problems with nvidia!!!
10821	Piece of crap.
10822	shi.ttiest driving mechanics ever
10823	Bought game for Â£25, 'please buy full game', 2/10  Ubisoft are money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s  Dont buy this rip off
10824	shi.ttiest driving mechanics ever
10825	Looks good on paper. Poor execution. My 4 year old loves it though. So...yea.
10826	broken. spent 80 hours opening the game at first. then spent 19 hours on support. the rest is mostly idle after the story was over. 3/10 story 7/10 driving 10/10 race griding simulator
10827	So... this game has been out for over 2 yrs now and Ubisoft has a bug that causes the game to stop rendering the open world and stops players in their tracks that try to drive through these unrendered spots. Ive contacted Ubisoft talked with Claire and another tech to find out Claire is the boss lady and after 2 yrs of a known issue nobody at Ubisoft can figure out how to solve this problem. If you wanna play the crew i would suggest stay away from the PC version and suffer with the console versions only cuz Ubisoft doesnt know how to fix their own problems in the PC world.
10828	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this im â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i cant play bcuz it crashes in the first loading screen i have tried everything for months and still cant play i want my money back â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ game  
10829	Ubishit at it's best, can't even launch a game. whenever i try to play game, it just keeps crushing, just don't waste your money on this when there are lots of better racing games out there.
10830	The game keeps crashing. Do something about it. I have been asking for past four days.
10831	Getting it refunded &lt;3 Game doesnt work well with a steering wheel and if you mess around with the index files and settings to get it working well the game is too arcade like to bother. The map of the USA though big is empty and I didnt want to explore it and the story line was too edgy to handle, 'Ohh my brothere died now I must race...'

10833	NO ONE ELSE APPEARS ONLINE AND UBISOFT IS 'NOT ALLOWING ME THE PERMISSIONS' TO READ THE SINGLE FORUM POST ON IT. DONT BUY THIS GAME FOR ATLEAST A MONTH, ITS PATHETIC AT THIS POINT
10834	The size and beauty of the world is fantastic, and easily bests Forza Horizons. But that's really the only positive thing I can find about this game.  The driving controls are beyond awful. The controls feel like pushing around a bar of wet soap at the end of a 6 foot long Pool noodle.  Have you ever wanted story missions, and assinine cutscenes in your racing game? Yea me either, but this game is full of them! Good luck ranking up or earning money without playing through the nonsensical story mode.  You better like American cars, cause that's 80%+ of the vehicles available.  Also why is UPlay still mandatory for a STEAM game. No one cares about your crappy publisher specific game launcher. Take a hint from Games for Windows Live and just abandon it already.  Lastly, I can't take a racing game seriously if it has a dedicated 'Nitrous' button.  4/10  
10835	Don,t buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. im hate it
10836	Not worth your time, its VERY VERY BOOOORRRIIIINNNGG! â¥â¥â¥â¥ driving mechanics, a â¥â¥â¥â¥ story mode, and there is NO OFFLINE
10837	For the love of god, don't buy this game for even 15$, this game has absolute horrible mechanics and playing with a wheel is the worst thing ever.
10838	Bought and downloaded this game...  I tried everyday for two weeks to play it. Never once did I find a Ubisoft server. I've played other Ubisoft games like Trials Fusion, and I've played it consistently for about a year now, I've connected to the servers twice.  I'm convinced the servers are a potato with dial-up. Get a refund. The game has no option to play offline.
10839	Since the update and the new expansion, you will not longer be able to play this game if you have windows 10.
10840	For the love of god, don't buy this game for even 15$, this game has absolute horrible mechanics and playing with a wheel is the worst thing ever.
10841	Could have been good, isn't. Crappy physics, crappy engine, half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ map, meh graphics, abysmal dmg modeling, uplay, no concept of velocity, relative performance is so wrong it's difficult even choose vehicles, oh and it went down $20 the week I bought it :(
10842	I feel like the game is fun for the first couple of hours. Missions aren't really anything new or special. The games lacks character and just forces you into a role whether you like it or not. It get terribly boring after a while. The missions just basically repeat themselves.   It's more of a grind than I had hoped it would be. If I wanted to grind to get to max level, a car game isn't where I'd do it. Can't exactly customize the car as much as I would have liked. Colors are also lacking. Just feels like they only tried halfway and said, 'Good Enough'.

10845	Got the game and season pass, would not let me play becayse of invalid CD key, spent weeks trying to find a solution, didnt work.    0/10 would not recommend
10846	Quite a disappointment.  I'll keep it simple, don't buy it. The physics are worse then what you can find available for the iPad, and the graphics are pretty measily. Overhyped, and looks way nicer on the outside then on the inside.   If you on a budget, don't waste $30 on this, or $15, or $5 for that matter. Please, PLEASE, take this review into consideration when thinking about buying this game.
10847	DO NOT BUY  you pay 29,99 euro and only get a trail version , steam doesnt tell you your buying a trail version
10848	Syncing with UPLAY SUCKS!!!!! I have to re-buy the game to play it. Launches as trial version and says buy now or exit game. Very disappointing!
10849	This game blows. Half of the missions are stupid car chases and police chases that are impossible and are no fun. They â¥â¥â¥â¥ing suck so much and are so broke that you cant even beat them. DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE GARBAGE GAME.
10850	Do not buy this game! All the missions are repetitive just with a different car, the story line is stupid, and the game is nowhere close to being realistic This game is absolutely pathetic  The cars and modifying are cool but thatâs about it. I waited from beta till the release for a great game and I was let down, i still canât join a crew WTF!  I would only recommend this game to someone if they donât want a good story line but just to modify a cars colours because thatâs about all you can do yourself because all you have to do is press next to make your car perform better.  4/10 WASTE OF MONEY! 
10851	A racing game with new and interesting ideas and great potential, some of the best handling mechanics in a racing game. Absolutely horrible multiplayer with tons of bugs, unfair glitches and overpowered cars.
10852	Soo my Review I think the Game could be pretty good but i bought it to form a Crew with my Friends and guess what doesn't work? Yes! I can't form a Crew I can play with Random players though. But do I want that? No not really! Ubisoft wrote that they predict a smooth start for The Crew now we only have problems and I don't even mentioned the Server problems and stuff...
10853	what's the point of buying a game when theres only like 2000 people playing it? -_-
10854	Why I will never buy a Ubisoft game again. My story cut short..  The first time I noticed there was something badly gone wrong with this company was when they ruined Splinter Cell online by making it 1 vs 1 .. An insult to fans of the game back in the day.  Skip forward some time and we have games that are all the same eg. far cry / creed / etc.. running on stupid Uplay that everyone hates but they dont listen just carry on making it harder to run games.  Then we have all the E3 shows running graphics that are not even on the game at release..wow  Then we have the crew.. it will NEVER run smooth the Required specs are frankly a lie.. So So badly optimised and now the game wont even boot.. what do Ubi say???  ... Ubi say 'Roll back your GPU driver..' ..???   How arrogant is that?? I mean yeah im gonna roll back my driver just for ONE game so my others dont run right when they already do?  This is my chance to express my self to Ubi soft and Id just liike to say, from the bottom of my heart - F*** you Ubisoft.
10855	This game is pure â¥â¥â¥â¥. Another Ubisoft turd. Do not buy this game.  No rear view mirrors. No remapping of controllers or keyboard. Default mappings are unintuitive. This has to be the worst driving game I have ever played. The simulation of driving is unrealistic. Want to downshift like a real car? Too bad because this game is far from what you would expect of a driving game. All of the controls are reversed. So if you want to turn left you need to steer to the right. Ubisoft has idiots for developers. Stay away from their products.  It is 2015 and hardcoding the mapping of keys or buttons is a sign of poor quality. Stay away from this game. Spend your money elsewhere.
10856	THIS GAME DOESN'T WORK FOR 70% OF THE USERS! IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!
10857	Do  NOT  buy this game. Its a flawed piece of crap.
10858	'I DON'T CARE IF ITS 59$, 49$, 39$ OR 39 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CENTS, I DON'T WANT IT, IT WON'T HAPPEN, ITS NOT COMING ON MY TV AGAIN, IT WON'T BE ALLOWED IN THIS HOUSE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?' ~The Annoyed Wife From John Cena's Prank Call
10859	crashes often
10860	The crew is one of the best open world racing games that exist. The story is good, and the soundtrack is okay. The graphics are amazing, and the car customization is good enough. Vinyls and paintjobs should have been done better though. Now it sounds like this is nearly a flwaless game right?  But no, there is one big problem WILD RUN DLC.  The game was so good before this DLC. Wild Run costs more than the game itself. I bought the season pass and still didn't recieve this DLC. You are forced to download it and every now and then you get pop-ups asking to buy this DLC. It's really fâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸king annoying and it should be free/removed/an entirely new game. After this DLC I pretty much don't trust Ubisoft at all anymore.. GREAT JOB UBISOFT!
10861	literrally sucks  gets stuck everytime i launch it and it literally sucks
10862	So i used to play it a bit but didnt get very far. Now i installed it again and wanted to play it. After i start it and play for about 1-5 minutes it just crashes :( I tried evrything to fix it but nothing helps.
10863	It's an overpriced, bad game, uplay is horriblw but this game is not worth its price, go buy a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of other more fun games for the same, or less the price.
10864	I feel that this game is a waste of money at the price it is currently running. Sixty dollars for a game with very VERY poorly executed physics is not worth anyone's time. This is especially true when the game in question is a game that revolves around driving. The controls are incredibly difficult to tune and even more infuriating to attempt to execute in-game. The game has several settings which the player can change at any given point in time while playing. These settings do about as much to help the player regain control of their vehicle as a map would do to help Helen Keller navigate Detroit. From what I can tell after well over an hour of simply tearing about experimenting with the different settings and looking of their 'descriptions' on various forums I reached a simple conclusion. This conclusion is that you can adjust your settings so that it feels as though you are flinging a brick across either a frozen pond or a recently thawed puddle of mud. From what I can tell the settings allow you to either get your car to steer straight at high speeds or be able to make it around corners at high speeds, but never both. I would not recommend this game to anyone, even a person that has sixty dollars of blood money they stole from the Mafia and were attempting to get rid of it somehow. I would instead recommend to that person that they buy literally any other sixty dollar game, period.
10865	This game could be so great, but unfortunately I can't recommend this game in its current state.  - They still haven't fixed performance problems that many systems have since the Wild Run update (it included some major graphical changes), despite those systems fulfilling more than the recommended specs. Sudden FPS drops for no apparent reason make it impossible to stay on the road sometimes. Really frustrating. - PVP is not fun anymore for me personally. So there are the 5 different specs in the base game, which drive completely different. For example I love the circuit spec, which drives much like a real racing car would (even though it's far from realistic). You used to be able to select, which spec you prefer and play that one. Now they let people vote before the start of the race. Most people enjoy the street spec, which is much more arcade style. So if you like any of the other specs, you have to join a lot of races you don't really like, just to maybe win the vote one time and have a race you can enjoy. - The previous point gets amplified by the fact that there really is no endgame content besides PVP unless you buy the Wild Run DLC. Though, I'm refusing to put more money into the game until they fix what I described in my first point. - Thousands of players play this game. Yet the world feels completely empty, because of the their bad phasing system, where you see just a hand full of players at any give time, which are usually 5-20km away from you, meaning you basically never meet someone else just randomly on the street. - The game world is definately very pretty and detailed, there's no arguing that. The USA are just not very racer-friendly in my opinion. In free play mode you spend a lot of time on highways that are not really interesting to drive on. You have to actively search for roads that are fun to drive on. Even though the world is huge, this makes it seem like there are only a few 'good' roads that get boring after a while. - Too many micro-transactions for a (former) full-price title. They are not mandatory, but it still bothers me when you paid for a game and have to pay extra for more content.  I had so much fun with this game, especially right after release. But it keeps getting worse and worse, because the developers don't seem to understand what is good for the game. Instead they try to milk as much cash out of the customers before the title completely dies out. It's really sad, because it could have been a long-term successful title, with just some minor adjustments and bug fixes..
10866	I'm still wondering which is worse, Ubisoft or this game. Unable to even start this piece of hyped up crap. I'd rather buy some Dota 2 and delete them ffs.
10867	crap. the game is pretty fun but uplay, all of the errors i got while trying to setup the game and link my account with uplay,and all of the dlc made this game no fun. i also got an error where inshelper.exe wasnot installing. i did some research and this error was in the beta.
10868	cant even launch the game, tried everything, didnt work, would rather shove my thumb in a light socket for fun.
10869	1) for multiplayer u need VPN !! thats biggest mistake in this game 2)not much upgrades 4 cars  3)rearview mirror is fake
10870	This game really makes me wish there was a 'mixed' rating for Steam reviews. So I'll just vote no to publish this.  Pros : -Nice graphics -Drive through the whole USA. Very large map to explore -Cockpit view, with each car having their own, heavily detailed interiors -Decent customization -You play as Gordon Freeman  Cons : -Uplay -Rubberband AI, some people will actually defend this -Lots of griefers who will ram you off the road all the time -Uplay -Poor soundtrack. This game SCREAMS for a custom radio option -Boring storyline. You're likely to end up skipping cutscenes -Uplay -Annoying challenge placement, sitting right in the middle of the road. Hard to avoid. Will cover your vision with badly placed UI stuff -Online only, even though most of the game content can be done solo. You cannot play if you don't have an internet connection or if the servers go down. This â¥â¥â¥â¥ means the game will eventually die off like all other always-online games. -Uplay  This could've been a pretty solid game but it has many frustrating flaws that will make your blood boil, the always-online thing being the worst. I say buy it when it's on sale.
10871	I expected so much more out of this game. Ubisoft should not make racing games. Graphics are 9/10 which is nice but the game play is terrible. Yes its open world semi-sandbox style but the player to player interaction is 0 if even that. What to play with someone cool they can be in your crew, want to play solo? your screwed. And everytime I'm at a world event or a challange you do on the open road (summit event etc.) people spawn over and over and over right in front you, beside you behind you, pretty much everywhere you dont want them when trying to get good stats in an event at 120+ MPH. Just Smh, im more or less frustrated they didnt work on the development more and think of things like this.
10872	PS4 was so much fun so I decided to buy iy on PC... It keeps saying that I am playing the trail version.... Very dissapointing U Play...
10873	rubbish game , always { the crew game is stop working} dont buy it!!!!!
10874	Cant run properly with Uplay and it lags your PC so bad that its almost imposible to do simple tasks and tyhe open world takes forever to load all the textures
10875	The Crew is overall an Okay game, take okay lightly though. The pros of the game are: Vast open world, Good story line, and it looks great. Cons: Micro-Transactions(Pretty much ruins the game in my view), Glitches, Horrible cut scenes(very jumpy) I was very excited for this game as soon as it was announced, but unfortunately it didn't even scratch my expectations for it. overall, I would give this game a 3/10. Would not recommend buying if you hate micro-transactions.
10876	Worst racing game ever
10877	Game does not launch. Thanks Ubisoft.
10878	No matter how much I try, the game refuses to run and crashes on startup.
10879	It will crash on you after hours of the game and usslay not let you play till you get the wild run edition so dont do it.
10880	this game not that good
10881	Most of the cars are being sold RL money and the others are too expensive so you just have to use stock cars.
10882	(PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!) Day 1 Bought it Downloaded Wasnt downloaded on uplay Uninstalled Day 2 Installed Missed up again Found out my driver was TOO new to play the game Downgraded driver Launched game Didn't crash Played for a while and lost replay ability...   
10883	â¥â¥â¥â¥! Just â¥â¥â¥â¥. Im sorry but it is. Not worth a penny.
10884	this game not that good
10885	Most of the cars are being sold RL money and the others are too expensive so you just have to use stock cars.
10886	If you like your cars drivability to be unrealistic and really crappy, here's your game.
10887	This game sucks, the only â¥â¥â¥â¥ you will get for the money you spent is a demoversion of the game. So don't buy this game.
10888	Between graphical glitches, unintuitive menu controls, and a literal inability to restart, my hype from the game faded to a cold, icy nothing. the game had potential... but the cars jumping around like they were on crack was a sign of things to come. in game, the play was smooth enough, sure. But then came the issue of trying to figure out the menus. Maybe it's because I wasn't paying strict attention to the tutorials and trying to get though to the main game at a LAN party, but I was having issues navigating the menus.   The greatest flaw, however, was not letting the customer restart the campaign. Yes, I can go back and redo missions. Yes, I can customize a different starter car... BUT IT'S NOT THE FRAGGIN SAME! If you put a game down for months, and decide you wanna come back to it with a fresh start, that's the use of LETTING YOUR CUSTOMER RESET THE GAME! If they want to play though the game a second time from scratch, THATS THE USE OF LETTING YOUR CUSOMTER RESET THE GAME! I've seen a couple of workarounds that kinda work, sure... But this is basic functionality that was left out! Do yourself a favor and pass on this. Go with a Need for Speed game, go with Asetto Corsa... Don't go with this. This is not worth your money.
10889	i just got this game (the crew) and it dos not work. it loads up abit then stop with program stop working. help

10891	Right now, as of today, I'm not reccomending The Crew to anyone The game ist bloody unplayable right now, can't even get proppelled by a fart wiht out the game freezing for a second, it's almost like I'm watching a powerpoint presentation. Unless Ubisoft gets their head out of their asses und fix their damn games, It's not worth your money
10892	i just got this game (the crew) and it dos not work. it loads up abit then stop with program stop working. help 
10893	Oh boy do I have a review for Ubisoft. I was told by an Ubi representitive that if I bought the season pass the 'Wild Run' DLC would be given to me (as you would expect) but instead all I got was access to the beta, But let's not let that little lie ruin my review of this game!  Pros  - It's in the US. The major checkpoints and cities at least. That hasn't been done too much before. - They try to make Detroit look like a city that's worth a damn  Neutralities  - The update made the game look a little more next gen  cons  - Season Pass didn't get me the one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DLC Ubi made for this game - At least 1/4 of the missions of this game is you hitting boxes - 'You're either first or you're last' ~ Ricky Bobby - the update did little to nothing to fix the ice-skating driving (at least in the BETA. I haven't touched this game since then) - The dwindling player base - The max lobby size (I think it's 8) - Uplay - Microtransactions
10894	The game can be good if u can fix the 'CREW' joining !!!
10895	The Game was not worth 60 dollars......
10896	GUYS DONT BUY THIS ONE ITS 30$ BUTS ITS A DEMO LIKE U HAVE TO BUY THE WILDRUM EXPANSION GUY I BROUGHT THIS GAME AND IT SAID IT WAS LIMITED TIME 30$ FOR A DEMO
10897	how is this possible! I bought full pack with dlc and wild run, after 2 hours i cant play more cause i have to buy wild run! it says it is in my library and the cd-key is activated!!
10898	This game was something that I had been looking forward to since it was first announced. I bought it thinking it would be as good as they hyped it up to be. No, there is a very limited amount of everything, the scenery looks good but that's about it. The story is generic as it could possibly be, none of the characters hold any value and the gameplay is frustrating. The only think I hear is some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ screaming in my ear constantly yelling 'HEY ALEX ALEX ALEX WATCH OUT ALEX'. I give this game 1/19 wouldn't even throw up on it.
10899	THIS IS JUST TRIAL VERSION! THATS NOT FEAR!!!
10900	Did i pay for this game? why i need to pay again? I want to drift, but why i need paying more?
10901	It just doesn't appeal to me. I had several problems starting with installing inshelper.exe, which wouldn't install. Finally after I got that out of the way, I had to restart my damn PC because Steam was saying the game was running when it even wasn't. After that I noticed something that didn't make sence at all. I have a 960M graphics card for my laptop, while I have a 760 in my desktop. Frame rate wise, the game ran better on my laptop than on my desktop. I even changed the settings and the game was still giving me 30 FPS on my desktop. It's also just boring to me and I don't really like Ubisoft, or UbSHIT as people say. They let me down with Watch_Dogs and this game. Screw you guys. Terrible excuse for a game company.   I requested a refund for both the game and a DLC I bought.  gg UbiSHIT  0/10
10902	i brought the game when it was still new and it was around 80$ i buy and start playing it to find it was just a trial version
10903	not even the game don't buy!!!!!!!! 
10904	I want a Refund now! Or else !   Hello, I wanted to start The Crew that i recently bought but to all my avail when it comes to ' Wont launch the game ' Verifying Cache, Run as Admin , Put some XML or DLL Whatever. I hear this very VERY same words from other users ....  Don't tell me to post the ' TECH SUPPORT ' . Because I dont have the patience to wait for your reply... SO to make things straight,   Its Either fix my problem , OR REFUND Me my money back. Otherwise , i had no choice but to write on How poor the Ubisoft service is .   I spend on this because I LIKED the game. Now please The crew Developers, If you listen this you know what to do.  NOTE :  IF I MANAGED TO FIX THE PROBLEMS YOU GAVE ME AND IT WORKS,  I'll RETURN A FAVOR BY SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE CREW.  DONT DISAPPOINT ME! I MEAN IT! BECAUSE TO BE HONEST, I SPEND THIS GAME JUST TO PLAY MORE RACE!
10905	Wow ubisoft.... you never learn
10906	Its Ok not worth the money
10907	The storyline is garbage. Absolute garbage. However I found myself enjoying exploring the map in various cars. If you are looking for realism this is not your game, if you are looking for story or races, again, this is not your game. But if you want to cruise around a bit it's okay. Not worth the price in my opinion.
10908	would rather have 9/11 2 than play the crew
10909	this is not the actual game buy the crew wild run the crew is just a trial of the crew wild run
10910	Bot game  Purchased and downloaded twice!!!!  Still, the game wont work and crashes on start!!!  Highly disappointing and annoying =[ Dont but this â¥â¥â¥â¥^
10911	this game took me â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 3 dasy to download in the first place and then when it finally finshied the game is slower than internet explorer. do not by this game on pc. and other platform is great. if the game wasnt so slow... this game would be great
10912	Do not buy this game from steam, there is some stupid bug on the steam download that makes it crash minutes intoplaying on some pc's. Buying it directly from Ubisoft will give a much better chance of it working in its entirety.  How to fix the 'The Crew has stopped working' issue:   https://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/343786746009854134/   Note: At the time of this post, the full game is free from the Ubi30 event
10913	This is a good game with some issues. It constantly crashes has frequent glicthes and the ins. heper makes it unplayable for some people. You can t play for more than 30 mins -1 hour without it crashing. I gave this game a chance and bought it. Dont make the same mistake I did, save your money and spend it on something that works. Or you can buy the game and fix the problems.
10914	Logitech G27 loses FFB randomly. It's very difficult and annoying to play the game like that.
10915	Great game, can't even launch it!
10916	Play 2 hours, and you have to buy DLC, Waste of 30â¬, So its not worth to buy..
10917	if u like playing a very unrealistic racing game with no drifting and locked controls go â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kill yourself and take the developing team of this game with you. No Story Released half the game as dlc and u cant use a wheel because nobody plays racing games with â¥â¥â¥â¥ing automatic gears . Worst racing game ive ever played the only thing i can say that was good was the way they make it look good and trick you into giving them your money...â¥â¥â¥â¥ you ubisoft and your crybaby â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ locked controls
10918	i can only say 'What The **** ' but before that allow me to explain that this game is probably really great. and i emphasize on the 'probably' because it locked me out after 2 hours of gameplay and told me that my trail run was over... which is weird because i paid for the entire game and now it wants me to buy Wild Run DLC or i cannot continue playing. Hope that it's a techical error or else this game is so not worth the money!! I find it ridicilous to have to pay for a trail run...
10919	
10920	NEVER GET THE GAME
10921	This was a waste of my money, won't even run on my PC, yet other games can. I may be doing something wrong though.
10922	I've tried everything under the sun to try and get this to work, I even sent an email to Customer Support, but they never responded. It's been I don't even know how many months now and they still haven't fixed this broken game. Good bye Ubisoft, I'll never buy one of your games again. To anyone who hasn't bought the game yet and is wondering if they should, just go buy TDU2 if you want a big map to play with. At least you can play it offline.....
10923	i know its kinda late after the game came out but when ever i lanch the game it lanches the demo which i had already finished with. But i had already bought it on steam and now i have the product code but no place to put it because after the demo all it gives you to do is to quit the game.
10924	The storyline is garbage. Absolute garbage. However I found myself enjoying exploring the map in various cars. If you are looking for realism this is not your game, if you are looking for story or races, again, this is not your game. But if you want to cruise around a bit it's okay. Not worth the price in my opinion.
10925	I like racing games,but this one is not good at all,at the start u buy game,and then you need to pay for cars inside games,this is pure crime! And you will '' UPLAY '' software with it,and you can't uninstall it,i hate this game,I would ask for refound if there is any way for it,and I would love to sue Ubisoft for extra money in the game,but i dont have time,or will for that ...  And u can't customize you car,you need to collect ''card parts'' and get level for that parts,so its better to play NFS WORLD for free then this game. It like in real life you car need to get lvl 10 to get a part. Stupid ... Dont download this,if u like racing games this isnt for you.
10926	most horrible game.THE CREW SIPPORT DOESNT EVEN CARE.IVE WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS GAME AND IM VERY DISSAPOINTED.PLEASE BY MISTAKE ALSO DO NOT TRY BUYING THIS HORRIBLE GAME. THE CREW SUPPORT STAFF ARE NOT EVEN REFUNDING THIS GAME. HUGE DISSAPOINTED.
10927	By far the worst purchace I have ever made. I paid 60 dollars for nothing. The game does not work at all it freezes my whole pc. From the very start the game never worked. The game does not load in certain races, causing the whole game t be unplayable. The game was gifted to me through puchace from a friends account, as I do not own a credit card. I do not know if that has nything to do with it , but i highly doubt it. I love the game itself but through steam it does not work. No offence to steam. They are great as well. It seems like no matter what I do I just can not get this game to work. I would not recommend it.

10944	Very laggy, poorly optimized, and couldnt handle more than 20 minutes. I have a GTX 970, i7 4770k, 16gb 1600mhz ram, and 10k rpm hdd. Would not recommend. Refund necessary.

10947	I was able to beat a Ford GT which is a supercar in a classic mustang. I understand this is an 'arcade racer' and all, but cmon, thats just BS. I drove around in one of the 3 cars available and oh my God. GTA V driving physics feel more polished. Need For Speed Prostreet feels more polished. The physics felt terrible. Maybe sometime in the future I'll give this game another chance..  Decided to give it another chance. Couldnt go anywhere without a stupid challenge popping up. Just cruising and suddenly 'Swerve in and out of the bars!' Or some stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that. CONSTANTLY. NO. LEAVE ME ALONE.

10952	game is impossible to play, plus you have to buy two things inorder to actually play.
10953	It's a good game, but really not worth the cost (I paid $60 for the game + season pass). Its fun but after just 21 hours I have beaten the entire story and many of the other races. Unless you want to spend a fortune for the multiplayer, do not buy. The multiplayer is the only thing left to really do in game after the main story other than monotonous races, and the multiplayer is basically dominated by the players who have spent countless hours on said monotonous races to unlock parts that are better than yours. Not to mention that the game has quite a few bugs, most of the bugs I encounter seem to be related to loading the world (freezes, infinite loading screens, falling through the world, etc.) however in just 21 hours of gameplay I have encountered bugs that require restarting the game at least ten times and restarting this game takes some time. Very long loading even on a powerful computer. The world is huge, driving is fun, I really did enjoy the time I spent on this game, but for the short length and little amount of fun things to do it's really not worth the price tag. If you can get it for less than $30 WITH SEASON PASS, maybe go for it. Do not buy without season pass. Do not buy at all if it's full price. The game just feels like a huge cash grabbing attempt, you can only get so much out of it's mediocrity even if you have every DLC. Not to mention, the season pass doesn't even allow you to get everything. There are numerous other cars/customization/etc. that you have to buy even if you bought the game and every DLC. Very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, Ubisoft. I imagine this game was probably alright before it was turned into a marketing scam.
10954	The only good thing about this game is the big map...
10955	Blew $60 on a dlc/glitch-riddled piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ I couldn't even run  01/10
10956	Well ... just no, 'Massively Multiplayer' games stands for 8! playes at the same time says Ubisoft
10957	Pay to win
10958	Preordered the game Got hyped for the game Downloaded the game Played the game Saw all the great graphics and great Cars and then..... Gameplay started to suck Story started to suck Story made no sense Gamneplay Started to REALLY suck Controls started to suck Started to lag Got lost and confused Tried mulitplayer( this was supposed to the best part of the game anyways right :D ) No friends bought the game (cuz it suckS) Had nothing to do Promptly uninstalled   Overhyped game, not worth the money 5/10  
10959	Don't spend your 30 dollars on it it is just a trial i purchased it and it was a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trail  Len Mertens
10960	i bought the gold edition and it only gives me the trial and it ends in thirty minutes what do i do to fix this 
10961	Do not buy the game because the devs are greedy.
10962	Joined only 1 AFK player or Emptly server should not buy it while saw it offer 50%  #ForeverDriveAlone
10963	No...Just Don't.
10964	not been able to play this game since i brought it back in march of this year :(
10965	Don't buy the game lots of people are saying its crashing and it is mine will not  run ive tried everything under the sun you can do to fix it if ubisoft does not fix  it soon don't waste your money.

10968	Ubisoft are scammers! Do not buy any DLC becuse when the next one comes out you are screwed
10969	No...Just Don't.

10973	No...Just Don't.
10974	A massive let down. The most untalented producers never again I will by any game from the same studio. Physics are super unrealistic and just simply rubbish. Shame on Ubisoft to let this game to be realeased.
10975	Two words Hilariously Awful. One, a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pickup truck should NOT be able to out drive a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fully customized sportscar. Two, the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing AI. Third, the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ graphics of what, 2010 at ultra. The only redeeming aspect is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free roam which is still â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I could not recommend this even to my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worste enemy.
10976	â¥â¥â¥â¥ racing game no physics no fun and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ay grahpics not worth your time for how much it costs this is a 15$ game at best.
10977	There are many good racing games out there, but this ain't one of them..
10978	This game had huge potential and was fun at first when you dive into the aspects of just driving around a huge country and exploring. It's pretty satisfying when a good song comes on the radio and you just blast away full speed through a curvy mountain/forest road or something...  But it ENDS THERE. It quickly gets boring, landscapes just don't feel open (there's always very little open scenery visible no matter where you are, and the wonky camera controls and insanely low field of view makes it even worse).  Performance is awful, barely jsut BARELY getting 60 FPS with two GTX 980's in SLI, and visuals are decent at best. Not to mention the FPS caps at 60, which is a huge turn-off if you have a 120/144hz monitor. SLI scaling IS good, but with only decent looking visuals that somehow are very demanding, it doesn't matter. There's also issues with stuttering, every 10-30 seconds or so the entire image 'shakes' for about 5 seconds or so. I've confirmed this is NOT an SLI issue as it happens with SLI disabled aswell (and then it's just not playable either). Not only the graphical aspects are wonky, but the controls are so clumsy and lack freedom. You can never properly stop and look around without the automatic camera rotation jerking the immersion right out of the game, and cockpit view is like using a pair of binoculars to look through a keyhole.  The story is boring, the missions are extremely repetitive and have no meaning. Online interaction is a joke, as I've yet to be able to see one of my friends ingame. My router NAT is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING OPEN, yet I can never join/invite a friend or see them in freeroam. As for other players I DO see, trying any coop is almost impossible.  And don't get me started on Uplay. It's just an abomination that shouldn't exist, and needs to go. Surprisingly this is one of Ubisoft's less bug and problem ridden games, but it's far away from being a proper finished and polished game, like the trend has been in the past years.  It had it's fun moments, but ultimately it's a waste of money buying. If you get to opportunity to try the game from someone who already has it, it's worth playing for a bit, but paying the full price for something like this is just stupid.  Ubisoft needs to seriously start improving on their quality, and people.. STOP PRE-ORDERING GAMES. #nopreorder2015
10979	Well i bought this game because i saw a streamer on twitch playing it and it looked fun so i got the game and i was looking for it everywhere and i found it on steam. Well i got the game and i started to play it and i have been trying to get passed the intro mission and i cant get passed it. I am seriously fustrated and i dont want to play it anymore. It costed me $60 and i could have bought another game for that money like OMSI 2. I dont know why the Devs decided to do a hard mission like that and i dont want to play it again. I want my money back beacuse it was a waste of $60!!! Don't waste your money!!!
10980	We were going a race 100minutes we finished it then my game crashed cause of any error of network please fix it and give me my money ...
10981	All I can say that was good about this game is the map is nice, large, and detailed but that is all I can really say about the good. I don't even know where to begin to explain how bad this game is. The default controls are so bad that I had to drastically change the settings to have a half decent control over my car. The races are beyond frustrating with the AI being able to easily catch up within a seconds mistake you make . The AI also can go from 0-200mph in seconds just so the game can have them pass you, oh sorry I mean 'scale' to your level. I really wanted to like this game I really did and even grinding and ignoring most of the games thousands of flaws I hit my limit. I tried to like it and tried to ignore them but there is only so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ one person can put up with before realizing that you aren't having any fun and all you are doing is putting up with a cheap game that feels incredibly rushed and not a lot of care(or any) has gone into it. If you are looking into getting this game then please take my advice and wait for patches, fixes, etc. so you don't have to go through the same problems as others and myself have already.
10982	No the first mission was almost imposible to pass cuz lag and now im stuck on the third mission that you have to drive Dayton to the bridge it gives you 1 minute to get there and whenever i try to make a good turn the car is to hard to hanle
10983	why i cant play online?
10984	You need an Ubisoft account to play this game and you need to have Ubisoft-client running in the background while you play..
10985	Absolutely terrible griphics and I still can't run it smoothly, at lowest settings and with an upgraded video card and ram. Waste of money! Wish I could be refunded
10986	this game cant run 3 monitors well, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ af
10987	I would like to get my money back...Server is offline all the time, from the first day when i got that game...Just sad...
10988	I love racing, this game isnt, the trailers were so good, the graphics are good, but there are like 40 cars, sh!ty cars, why the f*ck do we have an Scalade SUV but not the GT-R35? Thats stupid as f*ck!  I recently bought a Subaru WRX, I wanted to feel like im driving my own car in a game, guess what, there is not a single Subaru in this game, none, not even a f*cking Evo!  A new big DLC in the way, with some motorcycles and monster trucks, maybe some other sh!t, I own the Season Pass so I got a little happy, but... NO f*cking Wild Run for me! Because this f*ckers money hoarders want me to pay another $30 for it even if I have the Season Pass, so... What was the Season Pass for? 10 sh!ty cars?  If they want to charge $30 or $40 or whatever the f*ck they want for a big expansion, fine, but first give the entire game you promised! Lots of cars, like lots and lots of cars and lots of different missions and track styles.
10989	Very good game however crashes a lot on my 780TI and has done since I bought the game back last year...
10990	I this game is good but, The CDkey is â¥â¥â¥â¥up it did that i can't play the game.
10991	WHY! is the key bindings for xbox 360 controler for shifting up and down locked after the patch !????
10992	this game is super different form the trailer so dont buy dis game !!!
10993	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. I bought it with MY MONEY and it says I've only played the demo. Now I have to buy it AGAIN!! Don't buy this game.
10994	game had potential, developers and ubisoft classically ruined it by releasing an unfinshed game with no end game content then making us pay for it in an 'expansion'. As well as paying real $$ for cars in game, huge money grab scheme.
10995	When I began playing this game i saw potential as a great pc raceing game and theres not may that where that good but as latly with the changes to Wild Run and even main game it seems more and more that ivory tower and ubisof dont have a clue.  After Wild Run was launched I lost level 50 plats that where on some of my cars like my paticular favorite the 69 Charger R/T HEMI a car I put 50 plats into with all speed boost to loose these parts some i bought from the tuners with ingame cash and others i grinded for to have them taken froim me with no compensation is a slap in the face and them saying F*** you  And more dissapointing is the lack of retro musscle in the drag extreme spec and the use of imported cars more than the native cars [im not saying that imports should be kept out of that spec]. In the cutscene for bonnivile drag race in the sumit there is seen a 69 ss impalla as a drag car but not availble for player use just as a prop to â¥â¥â¥â¥ us off.  I had high hopes for this game when it first came out and durring the beta for WIld Run I regained that hope but all i see now is the domminace of imported sportscars and super cars in specs that eiter they are not usualy in nor are realistic.  Vizually speaking and as far as basic controlls and stability yes it is great the world abit small and not scaled right is beutiful to be in and the controlles with wheel support and controller support is fantastic i get great steady 60 frames  but as i said for me the deal breaker is the constant buffing of euro cars in specs that you dont typicaly see them in and what feels like is the holdin back of american cars more than needed. dont get me wrong i like sticking it to the LaFerrari in a Muira but the euro cars are getting all the focus and tuning to make better and the american cars seem to be getting worse.  Im holding out for my retro musscle drag cars but I feel as if its pointless now  no i dont recomend this game any further and perhaps if they fix what has been broken then perhaps thers is still hope  but as far as i see no its not
10996	Fix your god damn game it won't launch or give me a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing refund.
10997	micro transactions in a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 50 dollar game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. i would just play asphalt 8 if i didnt know about these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing micro transactions. and most of the cars you get are alot worse than the micro transactions car. No controller support, or atleast doesnt work on my xb360 controller. Glad i got a refund.
10998	Game is not bad at all .... yes i could be alot better but it does what u would excpect when u buy a car game plus some ..... the driveing in the game takes alot of getting use to ive played alot of raceing in my life and this is the only raceing game ive played where i cant get ahold of the vehicel most games u pick it up this game i never did but thats fine i enjoy just driveing and enjoying the sceniery personnalyi wouldnt recomend the game wait for nfs to drop price on pc
10999	I downloaded the crew and it only lets me play the trial version of the game iI need help
11000	This game on-road gameplay isn't bad if you don't count the stupidly placed npc's. The off-road is just awful, it's even worse than the off-road in gtaV. You should expect that a special modified vehicle would be able to handle little bumps and rocks. Not the case. The off-road missions and skills are terribly frustrating en make sure the game gets an overall negative score. If you are going to make off-road a core element of your game, make sure it's at least doable. The skills part of this game feels like a frustrating version of the Trials games, were you have to try over and over and over and over again to get a decent score.  Long story short: Lots of dumb placed NPC's, bumps, rocks, and way too difficult skill missions. Wich is bad, real bad.  Sorry for the hateful review, but this needed to be said I can't be the only one out there who experienced this. I played the game a lot because i thought i was inexperienced, but now with a playtime of over 10 hours, i started to see it different.  Sorry Ubisoft but i won't be buying the wild run update. Just doesn't seem worth it after all this.
11001	The game is awesome, but it lacks of having multiple saves. or even a restart progress. I would like that so I could experience the game again (Now with a wheel controller). Also because I want wildrun in a fresh new career. And lastly, because I would like to show this game to my father and that he could experience it from the start.
11002	I have only done one other review and it was for TF2 because I love that game so much. This review is the exact opposite I hate this game so much I must tell you to please don't waste your money on this. The problem is I play and at some point during some mission the game stops loading the map and you drive into nothingness then it freezes if you try to reset your car it is glitched out. I know its not my PC I can play GTA 5 maxed out for hours no problem and other graphic extensive games. This program is unfinished. Soooooooo ANGRY!!!!!
11003	What the hell I bought some of the game played for a bit then it said no you can't play no more
11004	when you get through the main story theres not a whole lot you can do. if you bbuy the wildrun dlc which is more than the game in the first place, you dont really get allot of stuff because you have to buy monster trucks and bikes(with real money). over all its a waist to buy this unless you buy the complete edition which is $80. DO NOT BUY
11005	I give this 1 star. I had trouble recieving the actual game because it kept saying I didi not own it when I bought the full game. Th Wild Run pass did not work in general. It said that was in season pass so I bought it and that did not work eather. The gameplay is good, but they need to cut the price and not send out as many confusing dlc.
11006	Maybe this game would be better with some kind of controller. Playing with the keyboard makes this game impossible to enjoy.
11007	This game is not what I had in mind. You spend all this time building up cars that you never seem to able to ever race with (most races have cars they make you use). Really disappoiniting on all fronts for me.
11008	Garbage Garbage this is so bad. the fysics in the game are crap i bounce off of everything i touch, i for some reason just spin out of control for no reason and it feels supper restricting i cant drift or do sharp turns at slow or top speed, and it makes u need to play with other players to get better faster or u pay money to do so. such a waist of money i want my money back.
11009	To start off the concept of this game really had me but the MMO aspect isnt there The crews are broken, hell this whole game is broken  NPC's are way to hard. Example I have a 2011 mustang rated at 330 and im facing NPCs that rank 80 and i barely win they tend to copy your every move but with more speed and better handling  Physics- Cars feel like youre driving a boat  Graphics- Not next gen quality  Cars- To many domestics  Customization- Not that great.... You cant customize raid spec cars and you can choose what colour you want some things like rims  Cops-Would rather die then have you escape.   Multiplayer- When multiplayer actually works other players jump across the road in a fury of lag as a bunch of things randomly spawn...  IN summary this is not the next car game everyone seems to be talking about. Far from it 4/10
11010	Its overall a good game but it keeps freezing on me after a minute of playing
11011	not really worth 60 bucks the physics in this game are awful and the cop chases are not really chases since it takes about 10 seconds to just speed off away from them and there is no point in trying to take out the cop cars because the are pretty much tanks that are uneffected by smashing into them at 200 miles an hour..... and then there is uplay which is annoying af
11012	First of all awesome game runs good on my med-end pc but crashed at random points and can close unless useing task manager
11013	wtf buy now full games ???
11014	the crew more like the poo
11015	PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!  Ok to start the handling suck if you are going t like 40 mph or 65kph and turn you will spin off badly the second thing is that the map is insanely huge you can travel for literally an hour if you have not been to that area before and even the story sucks. I begged my mother to get me this game and now I really wish I got NFS so please for your own good get NFS Hot Pursuit dont waste all your savings on this stupid game. The selection of Cars is very limited and the trailers and screenshots are nothing like this game. Environment SUCKS please I beg of you DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Despite all the bad reviews I still downloaded this game because I looked at the screenshots and the trailers and I thought that it was the coolest racing game I have ever seen. IT IS THE WORST racing game for any console 
11016	The game is fun but alot of bugs.
11017	Bought this game, added the code to uplay [i do own the crew along with this wild run], launch it, everything is fine until i hit the contuine button, after that i get a black screen but it gets better i still have chat so please someone help me
11018	okay.. so for right now i rate it 0 STARS because i cant even play it when its downloading it goes to first time setup and then it says ins.helper.exe and it is stuck there i have reset my pc done everything and even put it on another pc but it wont work so can anyone help with this problem......?
11019	just dont wan to work on my pc............
11020	loved this game.Had so many cars,after wild run,lost all my progress =(
11021	I was hoping for excellent graphics quality. I was dissapointed. I played The Crew: Coast to Coast, which did a great job, and had assumed this game would meet or surpass that. Especially with the flashyness of their video commercial here on steam. This feels reminiscent of PS1 video games.  I was hoping for to get started. It took me almost an hour, and I still wasn't ready. I lost the first time, because I wasn't even sure where I was supposed to go. I was trying to find bridges to get across the water and ran out of time. After I found out you can drive through rivers... But then a story ode starts, assuming to help you learn the game. It says go do this 1 thing. When you start driving, your map is covered with targets. It took me another 25 minutes to figure out which target was the right one. They really need to work on UI/UX. I may use this in my game dev classes as an example of poor UI/UX. I.e. they designed against the capabilities of the game, and not for the player. Perhaps depending on the racing games you came from, this will make more sense.  The racing itself kind of sucked. It wasn't bad, but again, this was more like racing in a PS1 quality racing game. Maybe I'm spoiled by Forza 6, but it feels like they could have done a better job.    If you are willing to put a couple hours into learning what to do (not the driving part. Driving is easy), I assume that game might be a lot of fun. But as is, its like Minecraft. the new user experience was an after thought, and I don't think this game has the pull value of MineCraft. I got a refund. I would recommend not makign the same mistake I did.  
11022	Best non-working game ever. Bought this to have fun with friends. (Rampaging Nvidia driver incoming) Nope â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. We â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up your game so now go and cry how you spent 50 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bucks on game so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. I mean seriously, the support didnt even answer on their forums... Well G â¥â¥â¥â¥ing G Ubisoft. You've tricked me for second time. Not buying anything from you. Ever.
11023	Well after playing this game a while I was missing some things in the game. like real drift cars and a more active pvp system. I had big hopes that the wild run edition would add all this to the game. It did but the physics of the new classes like the monster trucks, drift cars and drag cars are even worse then the normal classes. I bought a rx7 with a lv 40 drift upgrade and it wont even drift properly on normal roads. Also this game is just full of bugs. I've never seen a game with this many bugs. Example: I was just playing 10 minutes after not playing a while and I wanted to get parts for the hidden car. The first i found was parked in a parking lot that players can't reach because there is an non-passable border all around it... Driving off-road is the worst in this game. The car models and enviorement are really good looking. The game is good for just cruising around a bit and enjoying the open world. But when you are looking for a racing game this is not what your looking for.
11024	Don't ever think about buying this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ , don't even think about doing it , i am serious
11025	Game didnt launch, downloaded via steam. logged in everywhere. ubisoft asks for the same key i already used to register the crew again and then blocks me from launnching the game saying i already have the game. Looks like a fun game just wish i could have played it!!! RAWR.
11026	Game is fun. Refuse to buy Wild Run because I purchased the season pass when the game came out and I'm not paying for it twice.
11027	60 fps cap. Why?
11028	Best physics ever
11029	Terrible! don't waste your time.
11030	i like this game but now i can't play ! it's stay in test version ! i bought the game and nothing've changed! in steam and uplay it's tell me the game is been activated but i can't play ! it's a real shiiiITt ! but the game was really fun !
11031	Simply the worst car game i have ever played. Stupid level design, moronic glitches and odd behavior, very bad sense of depth (if there is one or whatsoever), stupid physics implementation (specially on drifting). I feel like i've wasted money buying this piece of crap. It's an attempt to recreate Burnout Paradise, but apparently they failed miserably.  After Assassin's Creed Black Flag and Shadows of Mordor, i'm even considering to never buy a Ubisoft game ever again. Such a waste of money.
11032	I am so tired of this, I have owned this game for over a year and I have never been able to play it. It says I have played over 5 hours and I never been able to play even 1 minute. Everytime I push play it prompts me with a message saying failed to start. It looks like an awesome game and I would love to play it, so if anyone could help that would be awesome.
11033	this game wont work on my pc is there a way to get a refund?
11034	Ubi please fix the microstutters :/ Every single Ubisoft game has those uncountable glitches, it's just not fair to pay 60 bucks
11035	good with a controller and probs good on a console but its such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc port! if you're looking to use a wheel don't even bother. i've spent so much time trying to get my wheel to work well with this game and its still shocking bad. even if i get the wheel set up well the second you change car or from road to dirt etc, its all for nothing. OH and the force feed back is even worse and thats with adding extraconfig.xml file
11036	0/10 They want to turn this game to League so they can make money but they are far away from it. Also, as a dota 2 player, I hate people do things like league. It seems like the game only need 20 bucks but Ubishit want far more than that.   Back to tech part, the only thing i want to mention is my desktop has 750 Ti card, 16 GB memory and core i7 processor, just barely run this game with only medium display setting, FPS still not stable at some missions. IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!  To make thing worse, if you are a rookie, it is very difficult to complete mission in the late game if you just spend the first 20 bucks, in order to complete the main story mission, you need to do extra works, it needs TIME, and you waste time in the game so you will BUY and BUY. For the game like this, I usually check the director of this game and I will never buy any game from his/her team again.   They treat us like animal. we will give them NOTHING!!!!  Buy NFS or dirt or even grid, they are all much more better than this game.
11037	Well the game is awesome the people who run it aka Ubisoft sucks totally.  The game I was enjoying it until I needed a dlc to do some part of the story went to buy it 2 weeks ago and I never got it.  Ive bought several DLC's in steam (same place I bought the game) and never got them, went to the UBISOFT forums and made a Thread asking for help no reply from them so went to their customer service page and wrote a ticket polite one actually asking for help and explaining pretty much my problem and after 1 whole week im still waiting for reply.  Its absolutely unacceptable from a company like Ubisoft to have this behaviour towards their clients.  DONT BUY ANY GAME FROM THIS GUYS!
11038	i loved the game untill i had to buy the dlc to play on line
11039	the story is cringe worthy, the handling in the rain is extremely sloppy and alot of the challenges feel forced and unfinished
11040	why the f that i can not play this game? not even in Gtx980M?
11041	I had this game for about 6 mins after download adn tried it so many times but everytime i tried to start it, it would just say error game crashed so i couldnt play the luckly i got my money back i would nt but this game
11042	Game does not load, and the Ubisoft support is absolutely horrible I contacted them multiple times, and none of their attempted fixes helped. Windows 10 64 Bit
11043	you cant even play or download it
11044	The game doesnât feel like what it was advertised for. For sure itâs definitely an open world game but bogged down by the constant mission notifications and the lousy campaign. The graphics are all pretty decent but in no ways does the game actually feel realistic in terms of the maneuverability of the vehicle. Also, the game has to be run in online mode at all times can be quite annoying. The map, as I had previously heard was going to be a large real life map of the U.S., concentrates on solely large cities in the U.S. and fills up the surrounding areas with generic scenery. Refunded,
11045	bought this game played for a month or so, now it wont launch.. just keeps crashing.
11046	The game isnt working. but i like the game
11047	This game has much trouble running on my pc, I have better than recommended specs. I have to use a very low res that make it look like a ps2 game. If not the game lags too much.  Also the map too often glitches out and I have to restart the game, and somethimes that doesn't even work, I attempted to use the train/plane to cross the map but that just says 'loading' forever. I only bought this to play with friends but I can barely do so.  
11048	No family sharing, but a good game. I wasted 30 on this
11049	Um... It's alright if you're rockin a supercomputer... Tried to visit hometown Anacortes, didn't have it. Not America. Entered some very thick bushes in a Ford Raptor doing 100 mph, left the bushes doing 125(the truck weighs 6000 pounds, with 310 horsepower...) Landed jumps barely on rear bumper in a Ford Raptor, apparently the truck couldn't carry on. More importantly... With a 56/44 weight balance... It is very unlikely to land on the rear bumper... Not to mention the cops landing these 100 foot jumps and the Raptor can't... It's not really MMO as I've noticed... Best part, hit 135 in water in the Raptor, if you know anything about science, or cars, you know that won't happen, no matter what you drive. In total... I'd give it... 13/10
11050	This game is so BAD even tho pictures make it look so awesome but when u enter the game makes me feel so dissapointed  the drivability is just full â¥â¥â¥â¥ and its almost impossible to drive in high speed when the car starts to wabble so much you cant even control it  Wasted 50 euros for a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the cities aren't even accurate and New York feels like a little town compared to its real size  This just makes me really sad
11051	A lot of fun... when it works!!!! Half the time I do PvP Races i get left behind by over 500 to 1000 meters!!!! and this is before the race starts!!! needs to be fixed.... cant have a fair race when the other participants get a huge head start!!!!
11052	Laggy mess that forces you to download uPlay to attempt to play. Physics were horrible, MP was horrible, and that's on the rare occasions you CAN play! Think Need For Speed: Rivals, but worse.
11053	*Sigh* An MMO driving game. I like the sound of that. I bougt the game and... just no. Now I will preface by saying that it could be my comp or internet but I don't think it's either. The cars feel sluggish, not all that fast and are horribly unwieldy and the AI has completely unfair rubberbanding and speed hacks.   As for multiplayer I've yet to crew with more than a single person. And after doing a mission with someone whose car level was half mine. He was twice as fast as me and the AI all rubberbanded to him leaving me in the dust. The game was worse playing with someone else than it was playing alone. I feel like I would enjoy this more as an offline game.  I will say that I like to play it... but not anything in the game. I unlocked dirt spec and now just set way points and drive through fields and go off roading and it's fun. I like this game just to go off roading in. I will still play it just to drive and have fun and offroad in. But I can't beat the challenges to get the better parts so I really can't do much more and I'm not that far in the game....  I feel like their is the potential for two good games here. A scaled down street racer with a more in depth customization system set in detroit or new york or all of the cities in the game just linked by portals. That with a better physics engine and the pvp stuff in the game would be fun I think.  Or the game I play this as of a fun off roading exploration driving game. I got it for half off on steam, If you can get it for that it's about 16 gigs and just work through until your level ten, go to new york for the dirt spec. and just drive. Enjoy the open world, screw roads have fun tearin' it up. But for the full price. I can't recomend buying it. It's not a bad game but It's not nearly as good as It could have been.
11054	-no players online -i did get stuck -SUCKS whit wheel !   I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!
11055	I have not played this game for very long yet, but I wanted to type in a quick review anyway because the game is on sale now. Simply put, I'm loving this game so far. It feels to me a lot like the original 2005 NFS Most Wanted and considering that was my favorite racing game ever, that's a very good thing if you ask me. It's not quite as heavy on the police chases as that game, for one, police doesn't seem to care much how fast you go, just if you crash into things. And for another, so far I've been able to pull to my top speed and they can't keep up. I've seen others complain that regular patrol cars could keep up with their supercars, but my Mustang had no issues... Maybe it gets harder later in the game, maybe those that complain simply can't drive, I don't know yet but so far I see no problem.  The game is also very big, with different types of country and lots of recognisable landmarks. I spent 2 to 3 hours driving from Detroit to Seattle, LA, then Miami (so about 3/4 around the USA). In Most wanted I used to run a race that went around the entire game area that took I believe 20 or 30 minutes.  Another thing that I think is absolutely awesome is the support for my G27 steering wheel. The game recognises the wheel on its own and all the buttons it tells you to press make sense (although it took me a little while to realise that it used the shape of the buttons to indicate which ones it meant). The force feedback is decent, but gets a lot better with some tweaking (google for the xml file you can make). The game also fully supports the clutch and H shifter. I left it on autoclutch myself because I found that when I use the clutch myself I tend to get too wild at times and my wheelstand pro will not stay in its place (has nothing to do with the game), but I really love using the H shifter.   All in all, to anyone who's looking for a fun arcade racer that still has enough sim-like qualities to enjoy it with a wheel (unlike all recent NFS games), especially if like me you keep hoping that EA will steer the NFS series back to how it played in the NFSU2/MW/C era, I can definitely recommend giving this game a try. And you can download the demo first if you want, it's completely identical to the game, it just limits you to trying it for two hours, so you can safely test it out :)  update july 2016: Just felt I should update this... The game was really fun at first, but then, it just... fizzled out? It was cool to drive around the USA, but when I actually started doing more races, it just felt boring. I tried getting back into it and I'm just not even sure what to do. There is also NO way to restart your playthrough and Ubi defends this by saying you can replay all events... Yeah, NO! That doesn't help at all when you haven't played the game in a year and want to give it another go. It just drops you right into the middle of things having no clue anymore about what's going on. And with the individual races being so bland, well, I'm permanently abandoning this game and changing my recommendation.
11056	So far I like the game, its fun, but I don't find myself teaming up with people very often. I wish there was more motivation in wanting to coop with others. Otherwise, I love racing around in my car and building it up, the grind doesn't feel like a chore when I get parts. The only issue I have with this game is that it doesn't seem to be very optimized for the controller when you choose to drive manually. I would really love to play this game with my Scuf One controller with the paddles on the back but even with the paddles its hard to shift up and shift down appropriately, especially when I need to reverse on the fly without having to switch layout of the controls...in other words the manual system seems to be too much for fingers to operate on a controller.  *edit   i got bored pretty quick.
11057	CONS:  -In any type of building, the inside is so bright, I cannot see what I'm doing -Crashes -With every update the performance gets worse -After nplaying PV the servers will get an error -Endless loading screens -Parts of the map will not load, you are forced to drive there instead of using the handy dandy fast travel -Crew Credits -Cars that used to be purchaseable with Credits are now only purchaseable with real money -Invisible walls -Rain does not hinder driving but hinder your FPS -Can't paint rims -Can't paint decals -Some body kits are un-customizable -Un-Restartable -Worst game when it comes to choice of cars  Pros:  -Free fast travel -Great map -Nice story    2/10  Even on sale, I wouldnt recommend it, I wasted 60 dollars on a HORRIBLE game, that had great potential.
11058	The game relies on uPlay, as Always-On DRM, since it's touted as an 'MMO' racing game (sessions max out at around 8 other people on the world map). This means that even in solo races in story-mode, you can be kicked from the game completely due to a bad connection or the uPlay servers having their semi-regular freakouts.
11059	If you don't have an unlimited broadband connection I would not recomment this game. There is no offline mode and when I tried to play this game the screen kept flickering like it was trying to be on my desktop and running the game at the same time.
11060	How to fix the ERROR #0_1 ?
11061	Doing faction mission (more than 1 hour) but halfway through decided to disconect, Progress is gone and needed to redo the mission all over again. Have a continue mission progress function god dammit!
11062	Have not been able to connect to friends online in this game, despite going through every process that was recommended by the support team. This game is far from being MMO, and I cannot recommend this title knowing what you'll have to go through to eventually be told nothing helpful.
11063	25 pounds for a trial version of the game scam do not buy
11064	I bought this game for myself and have enjoyed it. However, it is EXTREMELY buggy. I bought the wild ride package and only recieved one key. I can't do anything now and am frustrated I had to pay full price for a fraction of the game. Wouldn't recommend to thise that don't have patience.
11065	i just play it for a few days and after a few month i redownload it and try to play again but it end up saying my play time is over T.T
11066	The Crew was a great idea that in my opinion is quite poorly executed, after all it is Ubisoft and we all know their work ethic. With that said I believe there is still fun to be had in this game, especially with some friends, otherwise it might turn into a boring grind of about 10 hours to get to the highest rank, at which point your motivation for playing the game won't live much longer.  Get it at a sale if you feel like you do want to give it a shot, but be advised that to really be able to enjoy it you'll need a couple of friends to 'grind' through the game with.
11067	I will be 100% completely honest with you. I loved this game, the only thing i want to do is play this game for days on end.But i cant, because it doesnt start and when i manage to somehow fix it, it breaks again a day later.Thanks ubishit
11068	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UB soft product, crashs at startup. speechless.
11069	The game is oversaturated with menu systems that detract from the main idea- to Drive. Even with graphics settings maxed, the game feels lackluster and unappealing, appearing quite dated. Blurry textures and lack of detail are prominent throughout the game. The experience feels more like a p2w racer.
11070	the story is cringe worthy, the handling in the rain is extremely sloppy and alot of the challenges feel forced and unfinished
11071	Crashes on startup after every attempt. Only recouse that I've found would be to disable all background programs on my computer (not going to happen just to play a game I paid for) or install Windows 7 SP1 with a random KB update that this game apparently hinges on.... Too bad I'm running Windows 10. 0/10. Lame Duck.
11072	I cant not play it it crashes all the time when I start up the crew it crashes i have never played it
11073	Before I Started the game I already had problems.  1. Some file called InsHelper.exe refused to install. 2. The game had white graphics after working fine then I restarted the game. 3. Trial Version? So your telling me I have to enter some other key after I purchase the game? 4. The DLC ads are crazy. Please dont shove that in my face. I havent even played the game.  Spent 1 hour fixing the 1 and I cant even find a solution for 2.  Ubi why do you have to make life hard?
11074	This game is not even close to done... sure its a neat idea but the game is glitchy as â¥â¥â¥â¥
11075	Almost all the online features ar not included in the base game! You must buy the Wildrun DLC for the full experience, for me this game is a scam..
11076	I don't know why I found the game in the simulation section, anyway I wouldn't recommend it to simracers. Physics, well I don't know what to call them in this case, because the definition of physics aren't what Ubisoft used to develop the game. It is ultimately arcadey. The game's characteristic fit the NFS series. You could call it a follow-up to Need For Speed. It is still better than Need For Speed with the customization and the free roaming mode but by far not the best racing game. Assetto Corsa and Project CARS still stand on the podium for the best racing games in my opinion. The only thing I enjoyed in The Crew was the free roaming mode. I would add the large map too, even though TDU 2 had larger maps.
11077	I will write this review in order to prevent people from wasting their money on this game. It will be 80% rant because I played so many racing games and this is not a racing MMO, so here we go.  1) The way the driving mechanics work are ridiculous. The car will slide on the side and keep sliding even if you apply handbrake which is unreal. Even after so many upgrades (car level 306 and mine 24) the car will slide and corrode of road or in an incoming car. On the other hand the 'opponents' (when they are not actual players) they drive perfectly on a pre-configured line on the road whatever car they driving making the game frastrating for the uptinth time you re-play the same 'mission' because you put either too much brake or too much throttle.  2) The story is the most generic, vengeance bonner driven story that I encounter in many years. You know nothing about your 'character' Freeman Mac' Hipster except that his brother died before his eyes (boo hoo) and was framed from a crooked F.B.I agent (oh my ...) and after that he just get's out of jail and tries to kill the most generic 'evil' Russian/Boulgarian wanabe puff boy they can design, that happens to work with the F.B.I agent that framed you (what a twist ?) Donutbelly Do*uchebag. You know nothing about yourself or your 'bro' or even the enemy, to even give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the shoehorned story and prologe the game forces you to follow through out the entire game. Also the way the story and the 'Crew' mechanic work just battle each other which brings to the surface that the story was forced in the game way late in the development just to justify the release date and not to push it even farther later in order to BE an MMO.  3) If you got excited about the MMO and racing marriage this game promised so many times, had dreams of making a strong 30ish Crew with your buddies and start winning races against other players in 10 missions at the same time (3-4 in one against other crews), 3 others try to take down an armored car for the extra cash and some others gaining reputation for your Crew, then you got ricked rolled from Ubisoft so hard that the actuall game would be just Ubi CEOs come to your home and burn your money right in front of you while dancing. This game is not an MMO, doesn't qualify as an MMO, will never be an MMO or worth the effort to be an MMO like Just Cause 3 got from modders. MMO means that I can play up to (lets put an actual number, not dreams) 20 people, hell even 12 would be better than what we got in the end. 4 player missions that you can only play either with your Crew or with some random guy again up to 4, never both at the same time. You want to invite your friend to play with you while you are playing with other guys in order to help you? â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU SIR! how dare you expecting that ?! That needs time, money and effort to make and we don't have it! We just pass them out the door as long as they stable enough to cash before the rants start flowing outside the said door. We will 'fix' them later.  4) Also an MMO means that I come across other players on the same map and battle either with them or with their crew at that point on that road if I want, no missions, no story, just pure adrenaline while racing against other people in the free with only one point in the map which is the finish line with whatever reward you choose with your opponent. You can't do that here, you MUST play the pre-configured missions with the same type of reward every time, in which never explaines how to win either of the parts, you just ... win it, thats all and nothing else. As for the PVP lobbys they are almost every time empty because we got tired of the broken net-code that was released with the game so everyone just tries to finish it solo in order to justify the money they paid. Also 8 player sessions are not MMO, that's multiplayer territory for every acpect and angle.  5) The 'Run for your life' missions against the police or other opponents are a complete joke. They can catch up to a fully upgraded, Perf Spec Ferrari (364 level) with absolutly no problem and when you try to ram them they just turn with you. If you manage to ram them they took 10 points damage, if they ram you' you go flying on the side of the road with no hope stopping. You have a Dirt car and try to lose them in the forest ? Why they will immediately find you in the most thick forest because they either have portable, nuclear powered, xray machines installed in their car or they have a six sence that makes them spot you in a 100 meter radius. Also they can manoeuvre like ballarinas in the said forest even if they running with 200kh/m until the game thinks that is OP and just sents them on the opposite direction because ... â¥â¥â¥â¥ I don't know, maube they found a new donut joint and want to take some.  6) The customization on the game is also a big joke. Customizing a car means that I put turbo from Holla or HKS, breaks from Brembo and tires from Yokohama, not engine level 10 gold with grip boost. As for the body customization ... the same and even worse, so worse that in some cars the only visual 'change' is a better finish on the lights for the triple amount of money the cheaper version has. For actual good customization go to Forza 3 and later, at least there you can customize a car and put it on auction in the community.  7) Microtransactions. In a retail priced game, this is a problem self expenatory.  8) In a game called 'The Crew' there's actually to be a problem to create one. Your 'Crew' will be formed from the first guy that will accept your invitantion on a race and thats all you need. Why waste SOOOO much time to inform your friends to join you and form a crew, seperate the jobs and races according to each player strengths and weaknesess and taste in cars when you can form a 4 only member crew with the randomest guy you race for the first time. Also why race with others when you can compete with you 'Crew' only in FRICKIN MMO ?!!!! Just race either solo like singleplayer or only with your crew OR random guys, never all of them at the same time because F****k YOU that's why.  I would write more but my betrayal levels are over 9000 and I need to go to work tomorrow in order to gain the wasted money on this game.
11078	WORST GAME OF 2014. IVORY TOWER AND UBISOFT SUCK.
11079	Awesome racing game ermagerd
11080	Waste of money game ... $80 rip off
11081	This is a tough one for me.   I like the open world driving this game offers. Cruising the world, racing around cities and through high mountains. Seeing the sights. And the sites. Its very good stuff.  Unfortunately, its literally the only positive the game offers.  The missions are uniformly awful. Win a race against rubberbanding AI on the street. On dirt. Off road. Ram a car to 'take it down' within an arbitrary time limit, offroad, where you cant even drive straight for more than a second at a time. Missions are boring, detract from the fun of the open world and extremely repetitive.   And they are still better than the story. Its Fast and Furious with barely enough changes to avoid plagiarism. Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly paced, especially with most missions requiring several tries to beat the rubber banding. Ruins the pacing of the story completely - which is doubly bad since it was never well paced to begin.  Basically The Crew is just another tired, formulaic Ubi game. Same map unlocks. Same icons. Same boring missions littered across a large open world that would be more fun without them. Terrible writing. Mediocre characters. Coupled with loose, flighty car handling, lack of the ability to import your own songs and the always online nature, and as much as I still enjoy the cruising the world now and then...  Just avoid this game.
11082	realy tried to like it but...  1)the opponents are not following any of the normal physics rules and they seem to turn on a dime even when driving a muscle car.  2) Police is massivly overpowered and can crash you off the road without contest. And if you try to defend against them its like crashing into a brick wall. 3) nitpicking but they didn't even get all the car sounds correct.  The only thing I realy like in this game is doing road trips.
11083	This game still in ALPHA  If you ever user nVidias DSR this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game will â¥â¥â¥â¥ with you.  1 - I have my monitor in its native resolution, 1080p, I can use 4k but I'm not using it right now. 2 - First run of the game, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ thinks: -Look I'm going to set your video option automaticly! -Wow you max resolution option is 4k, let me set on it!(NO YOU F.UCKER ITS NOT THE STANDARD DONT U F.UCKING DO IT!) 3 - Since I'm using a multi monitor setup, it starts windowed borderless, can't see crap. 4 - Close the game. 5 - Open GForce experience, found the game, set the right resolution, nice, time to try again! 6 - The game: - Look, still first run! Let me set your vidoe option again!  - Wow 4k? Nice let me set to it, now in fullscreen 7 - Windows goes nuts trying to resize everythin. 8 - ctrl+â¥â¥â¥â¥+esc Close the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. 9 - Go to my desktop setting, set it to 4k, open the trash game, gos to settiongs set to 1080p, SAVE COS IF NOT I'M F.UCKED, quit the game. 10 - Go to desktop, set it to 1080p, now I can f.ucking play the game.  And don't you dare to forget that this â¥â¥â¥â¥ uses uPlay (more like uDontPlay) and you have to activate things on it and bla bla bla, so, just half an hour so you can play this..   If you think they did right with the crew unlike with AC? YOU ARE F.UCKING WRONG!
11084	Horrible game! No heart was put into making this game. Cars feel just bad and the game looks dated. 
11085	â¥â¥â¥â¥ off, â¥â¥â¥â¥ DRM.  http://puu.sh/fbUvZ/4e0bd138ba.png  I'm stuck here. And if you are willing to play Online with your friends... GIVE UP. It's a complete lag mess full of disconnection. It doesn't matter if you are the host with A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FIBER CONNECTION. Doesn't matter. Ubisoft, â¥â¥â¥â¥ THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥. Glad I won as a gift, wouldn't buy that â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11086	I found there was quite a bit of network lag in the game and quite a few crashes. But almost as annoying is the trailer makes it look completely different than it is. Its extremely arcade(y), not like need for speed arcade but like actually in an arcade playing those poorly made games for 50 cents a minute type deal. There doesn't appear to be any logic going on with regard to vehicle control or modifcations.   Not for me, but if you're into the arcade type race games with limited modifications and you're ok with the lag spikes then it may be worth it for you. But like I said, not for me.
11087	I wouldnt reccomend the game any more with the un fair UI and unfinished looks of the entire thing they physics are ok but if youv bought the season pass Good for you i didnt cause u was suckerd then if you dont like it cause u bought season pass then dont play casue u dont get the wild run in cluded by the company that made the crew. I got kinda discouraged and discusted with the game when i brought up a issue of having a fender opti0on to them on the game for all the vehicles. Response back was try other vehichles i mean WTF its for all cars and the only one u can change remotely is the hot rod hup one cars fenders wooo. I bought the crew wild run to see what was going on i mean its nice they added some other things and specs to it for people and racers around but sheezus Fix the god dam bugs an AI allong with the frikn physics
11088	I really enjoyed this game for the few days that the game acctually worked... When i click play the game just gets an error and crashes,  it does the same to my friend, and we both have pretty good pc's in my opinion.
11089	the game kept running in the background even after exiting from inside the game. Do not buy, not worth it.
11090	Can't start the game
11091	do not buy this game unless your willing to drop like 50$ on it plus the DLC... the main game is just a trial version to get u sucked in then end the game like 1 hour into it after u finish the story mission... if u want to continue u have to buy wild ride dlc... if you dont they kick u out of the game... how shamefull is this â¥â¥â¥â¥? shame on you people seriously... if ur gonna make us buy a game... make it the full game not a secret trial... or demo... â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. im done with this company forever. peace game is â¥â¥â¥â¥... cant even crash head onto cars it slides u to the side... lmao
11092	The Crew should be great, it's not because the game designers were complete morons. What could no one think of missions more exciting than run over 80 boxes? or the legendary run over 80 boxes part 2? Apparently to be a crime boss in America you dont need guns or drugs you just need to win a series of street races against drivers so slow they should be driving Miss Daisy. Multiplayer is unbalanced so you can be chucked in with any skill level, game type is chosen at random with each player chosing a game type and the computer then selecting one at random so you have no real control over what type of game. Which is unfortunate when you really want to race your new sports car but you get stuck in permanent games of king or one of the other game types.  Customisation of cars is good and fun, multiplayer when you have a group of you who all know each other and can race clean is fun, collecting cars is fun there are some other neat ideas. Shame the main game is so hoplessly broken by poor execution.   The PC is badly in need of a middle ground driving game Asseto Corsa is good but not very user friendly, they badly need to port Forza accross to PC.  Its an ok game I enjoyed it to a point but now its back at full price I cant recommend it, buy for Â£12 and under you'll have a fun few hours in The Crew but all to soon it's limitations become apparent. Fun...for a while 2/5
11093	glitchy and full of bugs uninstalled guess i'll just play the superior console version.
11094	it has been installing inshelper for the last 3 hours  i also thought i was finally playing the game but for some reason it dident load the game it loadded the demo and i was far into the game it is a grate game but i havent played the real game yet ;( and i love the game its amazing and one of my new fav game if i could play it i probs would like it more
11095	One of the very few disappointing purchases I've made on steam this year...  I'd avoid it unless you plan to purchase Wild Run with it.
11096	Well after playing this game a while I was missing some things in the game. like real drift cars and a more active pvp system. I had big hopes that the wild run edition would add all this to the game. It did but the physics of the new classes like the monster trucks, drift cars and drag cars are even worse then the normal classes. I bought a rx7 with a lv 40 drift upgrade and it wont even drift properly on normal roads. Also this game is just full of bugs. I've never seen a game with this many bugs. Example: I was just playing 10 minutes after not playing a while and I wanted to get parts for the hidden car. The first i found was parked in a parking lot that players can't reach because there is an non-passable border all around it... Driving off-road is the worst in this game. The car models and enviorement are really good looking. The game is good for just cruising around a bit and enjoying the open world. But when you are looking for a racing game this is not what your looking for.
11097	The Crew has its ups and downs. I can't quite recommend it, but it's worth picking up when on a deep sale.  First off, the main character is an utter and complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Normally this isn't a big deal, but the combination of hipster look (thick rim glasses and babyface beard to start with), juvenile 'badass' nature, and above and beyond white knight philosphy make him a character that's a huge cringe to follow. And as is the case with a game like this, there's no meaningful characters or plot to really make it redeemable. I wouldn't even bother mentioning this if he wasn't constantly thrust in front of you before every mission, whining about something.  The physics of a racing game are paramount to whether the game will be enjoyable or not. And The Crew bounces around in this area. Going off road feels slightly slippery in some car classes, along with a large amount of speed lost. In fact it feels like you get a speed cap when you go offroad more than the terrain is actually factoring into the slow down. Being on road seems to have a similar cap. Turning and other physics can be best described as semi-arcade. This isn't Need For Speed and you won't be drifting around turns, at least not quickly. But this also isn't demanding like Forza. It's a nice design that makes a fun time for an evening where you just want some lazy racing.  You've got a few classes of cars to use, where each car can be in a couple of those classes. It sounds like a nice variety, but you become deeply conservative about car choice because you'll be extremely limited on funds the whole game. The cars themselves are pretty standard fare and licensed. It is interesting to see a Mustang go from a street mod racer to an offroad rally car to a monster truck (for DLC The Run), but that novelty will either be rare or you will have grinded or purchased premium currency to make it worthwhile to play with.  Plot and story are shallow. Main character's brother gets shot. Main character gets accused and put away for years. FBI wants him to bust another agent and has him get on the good side of his old gang, which no longer recognizes him even though his own brother built it up and ran it. You do some racing, move up in the ranks, half the time getting threatened to be killed, and seek revenge for a death that you pretty much don't care about with a character you just can't sympathize with. Other characters you meet are equally shallow. Basic, generic characters that have specif talents and knowledge that you use them for.  There's a lot of content to explore in the game. It takes a long time to drive one coast to the other, which isn't quite the route the game takes you. More of a clockwise path from the midwest. And along the way there's a range of activities to follow. Skill gates that have you do various activies such as slolam between markers or try to stay on a given path that gradually thins as you succeed are dotted all across the map. Hidden cars can be found once you have all the parts of a specific one in each region. Radar stations allow you to see locations you haven't spotted. And many, many events to take part in between story and a few smatterings of missions that need to be done to 'gain enough rep' to move on.  You primarily move on by gaining levels, getting better parts for your cars which also run based on levels, and progressing the story.   Even with that, something about the game feels so empty. A lobby of people that can be anywhere on the map has been, in my experience, lacking any objective. Police activity is rare. In fact trying to hunt down a chase is a pretty fruitless endeavor, and the chases are standard fare, leaning to the easier end. You'll move into a pattern of doing some mission, doing some events to get some better car parts, maybe a little exploring, then back to the grind. This isn't a bad thing usually, but there's something about The Crew that you just can't place why it feels so empty, even when its brimming with some interesting gameplay. There isn't any motivation to pursue the story in of itself and halfway through the game you already know what's coming.  It's not worth full price, but consider grabbing it on a Steam sale. Just watch out for the premium currency concerns as well. They're not needed if you are careful or don't mind grinding.
11098	i thought the game would be amazing and its not gameplay is bad all the things othe people are saying... and i have the worst thing to me is that i cant do campaign even!!! im on this one mission to steal a sports car and i have 7 sec to go five miles. no matter what i do i cannot make the time... i cant make first point on this mission... i was ready to punch my computer
11099	Absolutely terrible, a crime that Ubisoft was able to release such a half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ piece of garbage. The fact that I spent 80$ on this game makes me want to wash my face in a deep frier.
11100	i bought the package with all dlc, wasted money. the uplay activation is fiddly and still doesn't recognize that i own (AND already activated) wild run. not to mention the fact that the map and menus are disorganized and confusing, the game doesn't give much help figuring it all out, and it sometimes has trouble loading or crashes.  the gameplay itself isn't bad. i would probably play it if ubisoft hadn't sold me (and who knows how many others) a broken game.  moral of the story: don't buy anything from ubisoft. this is the 3rd time in a row i've purchased a ubisoft product that was unusable. lesson learned. if it's a franchise you truly love, and you really insist on playing it, just pirate. they truly don't deserve your money.
11101	Won't even launch. I just requested a refund and I'm hoping I get it. I tried every 'solution' provided by Ubisoft and nothing has helped. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, and Ubisoft.
11102	all i gotta say is ' Lets make an update where we remove 50% of the game features and put it in dlc! ' I mean wild run , where you can't play online anymore unless u have wild run!
11103	why the f that i can not play this game? not even in Gtx980M?
11104	Really a bad games, i thought everyone thumbs down just a haters of this game but after i bought this game and play it...this is a really bad game so many bugs. Every game ubisoft i bought always have so many bugs and the worst case the even didnt do anything about it to fix it. About gameplay so boring and this game dont have a concept, when i play it i really confuse about the point of this game if i compare to Need for Speed its far more good than The Crew. Well my recommendation just dont buy this game. The upgrade and race really didnt i expected to be u can't buy parts for ur car, u cant sell any car u dont want it anymore, u only can have parts for upgrade when u unlocked it from race. They miss the fun about the race when u can buy or sell cars and u can buy parts for upgrade. About the bugs that really suck is a road bug there is a bug when u cross that line of road and u cant move the only thing u can do is press B is mean back to road...it means u will lose the race coz u will start ur car again. Ubisoft this is a really bad bad bad game.
11105	Well It Suck, I Save My Money For This Game, And When I Finaly Get It Just Stuck At Inshellper.exe And When I Try To Solve It It Says The Crew Has Stop Working Windows Is Searching For Solution, This Game Is Bullcrap
11106	I had this game for about 6 mins after download adn tried it so many times but everytime i tried to start it, it would just say error game crashed so i couldnt play the luckly i got my money back i would nt but this game
11107	Game does not load, and the Ubisoft support is absolutely horrible I contacted them multiple times, and none of their attempted fixes helped. Windows 10 64 Bit
11108	you cant even play or download it
11109	The game doesnât feel like what it was advertised for. For sure itâs definitely an open world game but bogged down by the constant mission notifications and the lousy campaign. The graphics are all pretty decent but in no ways does the game actually feel realistic in terms of the maneuverability of the vehicle. Also, the game has to be run in online mode at all times can be quite annoying. The map, as I had previously heard was going to be a large real life map of the U.S., concentrates on solely large cities in the U.S. and fills up the surrounding areas with generic scenery. Refunded,
11110	Don't ever think about buying this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ , don't even think about doing it , i am serious
11111	Game didnt launch, downloaded via steam. logged in everywhere. ubisoft asks for the same key i already used to register the crew again and then blocks me from launnching the game saying i already have the game. Looks like a fun game just wish i could have played it!!! RAWR.
11112	Game is fun. Refuse to buy Wild Run because I purchased the season pass when the game came out and I'm not paying for it twice.
11113	Terrible! don't waste your time.
11114	60 fps cap. Why?
11115	Best physics ever
11116	i like this game but now i can't play ! it's stay in test version ! i bought the game and nothing've changed! in steam and uplay it's tell me the game is been activated but i can't play ! it's a real shiiiITt ! but the game was really fun !
11117	Why include an obligatory story mode in this game? It is a sandbox. Yet, you have to play for several hours just to unlock the ability to take part in offroad races.  Offroad handling is very strange. Not at all like an arcade racer, and not at all like a sim, or a Codemasters game. Basically, the offroad handling is most similar to a boat racing game, and the noise of the gravel and dirt is extremely disappointing or non existant.   The story is some of the worst garbage I have ever seen in a game, and the game is extremely lacking in polish. This is one of the most disappointing games, in my opinion, as the potential is so great, but the end product is ruined by the choice to lock the game behind a moronic, insulting, and unneccessary story. Did anyone think that was a good idea, besides the suits? 
11118	You know you have a bad game when the activation key doesn't work
11119	i got this game and it says your trial has come to a end what do i do i got this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game and it doesnt let me play
11120	I downloaded The Crew Complete Edition but Wild Run was only the trial game, and now my trial is over. can you fix this?
11121	bought this game played for a month or so, now it wont launch.. just keeps crashing.
11122	Very good game however crashes a lot on my 780TI and has done since I bought the game back last year...
11123	I this game is good but, The CDkey is â¥â¥â¥â¥up it did that i can't play the game.
11124	game had potential, developers and ubisoft classically ruined it by releasing an unfinshed game with no end game content then making us pay for it in an 'expansion'. As well as paying real $$ for cars in game, huge money grab scheme.
11125	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
11126	wtfuk is going on???? after update the wild run,it cant launch.... whats wrong????? i want my money back!!!
11127	can't start the game
11128	Spent the past 6 or 7 days with customer support trying to get a problem solved with being able to play this with friends online. In the 6-7 days that we've been trying to get this fixed, we've gotten nowhere. This game is advertised as an MMO, and there is absolutely 0 MMO aspects to it other than an open world with some things to do. I love the game, but I can't recommend this knowing what I've had to go through so far to play with friends, only to never find a solution to it. Whatever you do, don't buy this game. Or any Ubisoft products for that matter, considering they all have the same issues. I was eventually forwaded to my ISP because they said it was on my end. The ISP performed the tests that they needed to do, and they said it was indeed not on my end, but on the end of the game. I can't imagine it being legal to advertise your game as MMO when it's not even possible to play with one other friend after all these steps have been taken. The game is good if you are only into the single player aspect. If you want this game to play with people, do NOT get it.
11129	Not Impressed now. Used to love this game untill that stupid â¥â¥â¥ Wild Run came out and like an idiot i went and bought it and the rest of the content.. Now theres so many bugs its Stupid. there is a part of the map that never loads now north east of san francisco always the same area my car just stops/crashes into an invisible barrier and the game crashes. the area just doesnt even load. i even entered the area from the north west also and the same block of the map wont load no matter what vehicle I am in. Dont waste your money on this crap update unless they fix the problems. waste of 27 Quid , the game was much better before than it is now. Untill the bugs are fixed then Not Recommended. 
11130	Whelp I ignored the negative hype about Ubisoft and purchased it.   â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Needs to be online to play. Fine whatever, I go to load it up while online. Nope won't load. Long story short I haven't even been ABLE to play the game.

11136	Buy Need for Speed. Any of them, yes including NFS: Hot Pursuit for 0.99/box. Anything is better than this game. The AI Cheats, the cars act like a bad 1980's game at Chucky Cheeze, the community is a whopping 4 players on your map at any given time. Nothing like advertised on the box, if you buy this, expect to be returning it in 3 days. 
11137	I bought this game for 20 dollars (sale) and i wanted to make a crew with my friend. I can't.   4/10 'Bad'
11138	Great now another error the error says to metion this code #0_35 connection problem but my internet is fine ????
11139	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
11140	Waste Of Money, Extremely Buggy, Ubisoft Do Not Help When You Ask For It, Takes a Week or Two for Them to Reply. FPS Is Extremely Unstable, I cannot believe i wasted 54.99 on this game.
11141	Game was very fun when I was doing the story, but after that it gets very boring. Was played out to be an MMO racing game, but lobbies are limited to 8 people max, which you'd maybe stumble upon one of them since the map is so big. Or have all of them fast travel to you and start ramming you.  Anyways onto the main problems of the game! Vehicles tend to be very expensive and getting the funds for vehicles just, well takes awhile. Then once you get said vehicle you gotta grind for what feels like 7 years just to get all level 50 platinum parts, thanks to the new 'Smart loot' The new DLC 'The Crew Wild Run' seems pretty cool, I don't actually own it. But from what I've read all the new 'Extreme' specs for vehicles are pretty well useless outside of the actual DLC content. Cars aren't very accurate in this game either, and the customization isn't all that amazing. The exterior of cars you can do a bit of stuff to but the rest of the car not so much. The entire tuning system is just, lackluster. For example, you have a car you like, lets say its a circuit car and you max it out, but then you save up and eventually get a new circuit car, unless you want to pay 10x more than what your car was worth for parts you gotta go back to grinding for 7 hours since they made it so any parts earned on one vehicle cannot be used on another vehicle unless you want to pay an outrageous amount of money for just 1 part. More on the tuning system real quick though. I bought a Koenigsegg Agera R which only has perf spec, but I thought 'you know, this is a game all about cars right? so even though this car can only do a perf spec it should still be incredibly fast since its actual specs are amazing right?' Well in real life the car stock can do 273mph which is roughly 439kph right, but in this game with perf spec, AND fully upgraded with NOS and all that fun stuff, this car struggles to even get close to 400kph. I don't actually know what the stock car can do in this game, but im assuming it'll be close to like 200kph. Moral of the story, if you wanted a game all about cars, and thought 'wow I can take a stock Lamborghini and put NOS and do all this stuff to it, this is gonna be ammazing, it'll be so fast omg' it won't happen. My fully upgraded circuit lambo can do like 430kph while using NOS going down a really steep hill, even though the car should be able to do over 400 stock. Probably sounds like a rant, but for real, I bought the game to tune my badass cars to my liking, not have every vehicle cap out at the same speed based on what 'Spec' it is. Game is hella grindy, cars are slow. Just buy an xbox and play forza or wait for the new need for speed.
11142	Whenever I get a game I always play through the Story first, test the waters. I regret that with this game. After a few levels the AI gets to be nearly impossible to beat on some modes, especially chases where you have to hit them since they are consistantly faster and more agile. But, in a way this can prepare you for the PvP, where you can be matched with someone double your experiance with a vehicle multitudes above any of yours.And yet, I keep coming back. The game is actually fun when the AI doesnt go crazy. There are only a few types of missions that give the AI a huge edge, but most don't. There are a few times that you can be forced to play PvP to level up to continue the story. Oh right. The 'story'. Voice acting lacks emotion at critical moments, the story is hurt because of that as it doesn't feel that anything is at stake. BUT THE DRIVING IS SO TIGHT AND DRIFTING IS SO FUN OMG YAAAS.
11143	waste of money
11144	what â¥â¥â¥â¥ the gameplay is â¥â¥â¥â¥. it's a racing game.. the cars should feel HALFWAY decent to drive, at least. the world is big and all but that means they didnt focus on the looks of the world so it looks pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ for modern standards. buying the wild run dlc would be like buying the game twice. you cant even drive the specs on the open world except the bikes so it's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the end this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥
11145	Game is currently bugged and not launching properly
11146	Will likely be seeking a refund.  So many issues, beeng trying to just get started for over an hour now. Had to connect to ubisoft and register it on that site, now saying error code #0_1 (looked that up - server down) and that its the 'wild ride' version when I only want to play the based game that I bought. Is it required that you are connected online to even play? I just want to race for a hour occassionally, its becoming more of a hassle than its worth.
11147	Why i cant log in uplay ? there always keep connection lose try agains... How to i can log in ?
11148	saying my beta is over when i bought the game wtf does that mean
11149	Good game but all the bugs kill it
11150	Game Crashes Evreytime i try to start it up and not any of thesolutions that i tried help
11151	inshelper.exe wont download idownload it at 12:00 am and now is 4:52 am at my contrey
11152	Handling is horrible. Played for 2 hours and just could't get used to how bad it was. This feels like a bad arcade game and that's being generous. I have played better racing games on my cellphone. But it's an MMO... Not really
11153	after purchasing and installing this game for about 1 week, the game wont start any more ,no matter how i tried.
11154	I don't think I could ever recommend this game. Once again, like so many tragedies released by Ubisoft, we have an extremely weak game made worse by relatively obvious corporate greed.  For the game itself...  Does anyone actually enjoy driving on motorways? Play this game to find out...  In terms of what you'll be taking down those numerous freeways, there is a big selection of vehicles. Unfortunately, there is such little difference between cars, it doesn't really matter if you're in a Focus or a Charger. Every car is flat and souless, and unless you put the volumne knob to 'Deafening' on your sound system, the engines are quieter than a Nissan Leaf and about as much fun to drive.  To elaborate on the driving mechnics (and I use the term mechanics, like a child might with lego bricks), it's like driving a shopping trolley. It doesn't matter how fast you're going, (because you can put a 3 ton muscle car round a hairpin at 140mph apparently) if you crash there's no penalty, and even if you don't there's no excitement.  If you can get ovr the fact that you'll have more fun at your nans funeral than you will playing this game, this finl point may be just what you need:  If you want all the cars you'll need to shell out a lot of real work money. You can obviously earn money in game, but they've made it suffiiently difficult enough that eventually you'll buy credits out of sheer boredom (something that you WILL have plenty of).  Frankly, that's unacceptable.
11155	Well I bought this game including the season pass and Wild Run and as a racing fan this is an extremely fun game if you play with friends. I spent hours leveling up my cars so I could do story missions easier and aimed to reached level 50 (max level). Was so excited to get platinium loot ( onloy avaible to lvl 50) and was expecting something great. But guess what happened? A big slap to my face, I aced the race and got platinium but I got a part worse than I had. And this happened until I finished the story. While the gold part had a +48 boost on my car the platinium had a +1. Never have I seen a game which encourages you not to be that good, for everyone who thinks they are bad at a game, just buy this game and you will have the perfect package. I really like The Crew despite some connectivity issues which are normal, but this is a BIG F*CKING DESIGN FLAW! Why do I have to be good while I can be worse and actually get better loot? That is like the winner of the race getting a medal made of coal while the second placed guy gets a pure gold medal. I don't know what to say, not only it is illogical, but it is stupid. I will definitely play this game as I love to complete games, but having to lower my skill level so I can do better is just a major turn off.
11156	So far... its just... kinda okay? It um... okay, is trying to do what NFS is failing to do, but failing only slightly less in regards to the story, voice acting and plot. I saw some reviews that said that after the Wild Run patch, alot had changed and feels more like what Ubi intended to begin with.... so i gave it a shot. I really wish i'd gotten the complete edition in a way that'd saved me some cash... because its still just not worth it.  The plot is hohum and contrived; seen it before and you'll see everything coming a mile away with your eyes closed. The acting is better than some of the NFS series terrible videos.  The control are better than i expected, but still very wonky and imprecise.  Fortunately the graphics are decent and the cars look good. Customization is also pretty decent. Other than that... i'm kind of not enjoying it and there's nothing making me want to come back to it. I feel like i'm going to begrudgingly try to get through this one.
11157	Forces you to use UPlay, doesnt allow certain transactions to go through, full of bugs, unable to play without internet connection(From what I've seen so far). It was on sale for pretty cheap, so I guess its worth the 15 bucks I paid for it.
11158	Online only DRM for what could be a nice singleplayer game. Ubisoft and UPlay are at it again.
11159	I bought this game for myself and have enjoyed it. However, it is EXTREMELY buggy. I bought the wild ride package and only recieved one key. I can't do anything now and am frustrated I had to pay full price for a fraction of the game. Wouldn't recommend to thise that don't have patience.
11160	i just play it for a few days and after a few month i redownload it and try to play again but it end up saying my play time is over T.T
11161	I will be 100% completely honest with you. I loved this game, the only thing i want to do is play this game for days on end.But i cant, because it doesnt start and when i manage to somehow fix it, it breaks again a day later.Thanks ubishit
11162	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UB soft product, crashs at startup. speechless.
11163	I was hoping for excellent graphics quality. I was dissapointed. I played The Crew: Coast to Coast, which did a great job, and had assumed this game would meet or surpass that. Especially with the flashyness of their video commercial here on steam. This feels reminiscent of PS1 video games.  I was hoping for to get started. It took me almost an hour, and I still wasn't ready. I lost the first time, because I wasn't even sure where I was supposed to go. I was trying to find bridges to get across the water and ran out of time. After I found out you can drive through rivers... But then a story ode starts, assuming to help you learn the game. It says go do this 1 thing. When you start driving, your map is covered with targets. It took me another 25 minutes to figure out which target was the right one. They really need to work on UI/UX. I may use this in my game dev classes as an example of poor UI/UX. I.e. they designed against the capabilities of the game, and not for the player. Perhaps depending on the racing games you came from, this will make more sense.  The racing itself kind of sucked. It wasn't bad, but again, this was more like racing in a PS1 quality racing game. Maybe I'm spoiled by Forza 6, but it feels like they could have done a better job.    If you are willing to put a couple hours into learning what to do (not the driving part. Driving is easy), I assume that game might be a lot of fun. But as is, its like Minecraft. the new user experience was an after thought, and I don't think this game has the pull value of MineCraft. I got a refund. I would recommend not makign the same mistake I did.  
11164	Best non-working game ever. Bought this to have fun with friends. (Rampaging Nvidia driver incoming) Nope â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. We â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up your game so now go and cry how you spent 50 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bucks on game so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. I mean seriously, the support didnt even answer on their forums... Well G â¥â¥â¥â¥ing G Ubisoft. You've tricked me for second time. Not buying anything from you. Ever.
11165	would be a great game if i could play it. ive got friends that have the game. and they had talked me into getting it. seemed pretty good when i was watching them play it. so i went ahead and payed the 60 bucks and bought it, well, finished downloading and i kept getting the error 'could not connect to crew error #0_1' sent an email to UBIsoft and waited a month before giving up on hearing back from them. so i sent them another one and filled out a ticket request on their website again. looked all over the internet on how to fix the error to no avail. so if it is at all possible, try and get a demo version to see if it works.
11166	The rubber banding in this game is out of control. Driving a RUF 3400K completly spec'd out with top level parts... Get outrun by a F-ing bus. Take a hard pass on this one.
11167	Money Grubbing Jews &lt; Ubisoft  For dumb dumbs it's saying Ubisoft is worse.
11168	Season Pass doesn't include Wild Run  5/10
11169	This game was a complete waste of time and money. The story is uninteresting and has countless plot holes in it, and none of the characters are detailed or interesting. The so called next gen graphics pretty much only looked nice on the vehicle you are driving. I ran the game on a 4 GB AMD R9 290X, yet the game still stuttered and looked ugly. To top it off, the game is in forced constant multiplayer mode, which means that you can not run the game offline, which would be fine except for the fact that the servers are ridiculously slow, and that there is next to nothing you can do with other players. 4/10.
11170	not working after the last update not able to launch and ubisoft is not responding and didnt fix the problem
11171	I purchased The Crew thinking I would get what I paid for.  No, instead I got a 2 hour trail version of Wild Run.  Avoid unless your wallet is to heavy and you need to lose weight fast.
11172	I dislike it for one simple fact. It won't run on my system. No matter what settings I choose I can't get good FPS out of this game. Thats pretty pathetic seeing as I can play Project Cars, GRiD Autosport, DiRT 3, GTA IV, and Assetto Corsa with no problmes. Really!? Work on your rendering engine guys this is pathetic!!!
11173	Hello, i bought this game and i played, very fun game but after a few hours the game tell that your limited time has passed and you need to buy this game , but i bought it so i am very dissapointed from this game.
11174	I am so tired of this, I have owned this game for over a year and I have never been able to play it. It says I have played over 5 hours and I never been able to play even 1 minute. Everytime I push play it prompts me with a message saying failed to start. It looks like an awesome game and I would love to play it, so if anyone could help that would be awesome.
11175	Ubi please fix the microstutters :/ Every single Ubisoft game has those uncountable glitches, it's just not fair to pay 60 bucks
11176	good with a controller and probs good on a console but its such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc port! if you're looking to use a wheel don't even bother. i've spent so much time trying to get my wheel to work well with this game and its still shocking bad. even if i get the wheel set up well the second you change car or from road to dirt etc, its all for nothing. OH and the force feed back is even worse and thats with adding extraconfig.xml file
11177	0/10 They want to turn this game to League so they can make money but they are far away from it. Also, as a dota 2 player, I hate people do things like league. It seems like the game only need 20 bucks but Ubishit want far more than that.   Back to tech part, the only thing i want to mention is my desktop has 750 Ti card, 16 GB memory and core i7 processor, just barely run this game with only medium display setting, FPS still not stable at some missions. IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!  To make thing worse, if you are a rookie, it is very difficult to complete mission in the late game if you just spend the first 20 bucks, in order to complete the main story mission, you need to do extra works, it needs TIME, and you waste time in the game so you will BUY and BUY. For the game like this, I usually check the director of this game and I will never buy any game from his/her team again.   They treat us like animal. we will give them NOTHING!!!!  Buy NFS or dirt or even grid, they are all much more better than this game.
11178	Well the game is awesome the people who run it aka Ubisoft sucks totally.  The game I was enjoying it until I needed a dlc to do some part of the story went to buy it 2 weeks ago and I never got it.  Ive bought several DLC's in steam (same place I bought the game) and never got them, went to the UBISOFT forums and made a Thread asking for help no reply from them so went to their customer service page and wrote a ticket polite one actually asking for help and explaining pretty much my problem and after 1 whole week im still waiting for reply.  Its absolutely unacceptable from a company like Ubisoft to have this behaviour towards their clients.  DONT BUY ANY GAME FROM THIS GUYS!
11179	The game is not even half finish. Disappointed....
11180	driving physics is worse than cancer
11181	uhhh... well... i bought the full game, but when i launch the game, it says i only have the demo, and tells me to buy it again.. any help?
11182	It says that my trial is out
11183	Doesn't Load.....Only shows Playing The Crew in Green for upto 3 Secs then back to Blue Online...No Game No Play!!!  Will Not reccomend until Error is Corrected!!!
11184	why i cant play online?
11185	All I can say that was good about this game is the map is nice, large, and detailed but that is all I can really say about the good. I don't even know where to begin to explain how bad this game is. The default controls are so bad that I had to drastically change the settings to have a half decent control over my car. The races are beyond frustrating with the AI being able to easily catch up within a seconds mistake you make . The AI also can go from 0-200mph in seconds just so the game can have them pass you, oh sorry I mean 'scale' to your level. I really wanted to like this game I really did and even grinding and ignoring most of the games thousands of flaws I hit my limit. I tried to like it and tried to ignore them but there is only so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ one person can put up with before realizing that you aren't having any fun and all you are doing is putting up with a cheap game that feels incredibly rushed and not a lot of care(or any) has gone into it. If you are looking into getting this game then please take my advice and wait for patches, fixes, etc. so you don't have to go through the same problems as others and myself have already.
11186	One of the most stupid reacing Car I ever play â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥ Programmer â¥â¥â¥â¥ All Stuff â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Idiotioc
11187	This is a great racing game. The only flaws I see is the car selection. I am a avid Japan tuner who loves all this coming from Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Acura but sadly this game doesnt offer anything except a skyline and 370Z. Kinda disapointing because American cars are fugly with the exception of a few.  I wisht their were more low end cars instead of the high end cars... no one wants to drive cars they will never own. People need to make a game like Need for speed Underground 2 with this kind of driving.   Also, I wouldn't consider this a MMO its a single player game. Their is never anyone in the 'world' and no one ever wants to join a crew or even race together. Again, This is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME, do not suspect a ton of people online because this game does not offer a good MMO experience. I am instead sitting their playing by myself hoping to join or get invited to a crew but sadly this game is terrible on this aspect.  -Good driving game -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cars -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MMO experience -Terrible hidden cars -Not a great customization game either. This body kits hardly change when you cycle through them. Hardly any good customization options as well....  ugh can't believe i spent money on this game...
11188	To start off the concept of this game really had me but the MMO aspect isnt there The crews are broken, hell this whole game is broken  NPC's are way to hard. Example I have a 2011 mustang rated at 330 and im facing NPCs that rank 80 and i barely win they tend to copy your every move but with more speed and better handling  Physics- Cars feel like youre driving a boat  Graphics- Not next gen quality  Cars- To many domestics  Customization- Not that great.... You cant customize raid spec cars and you can choose what colour you want some things like rims  Cops-Would rather die then have you escape.   Multiplayer- When multiplayer actually works other players jump across the road in a fury of lag as a bunch of things randomly spawn...  IN summary this is not the next car game everyone seems to be talking about. Far from it 4/10
11189	Its overall a good game but it keeps freezing on me after a minute of playing
11190	Into a race for one full hour, lose connection. That â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me the hell off, I hate this need to stay connected bull. How about you fix this or come up with a solution so this crap doesn't happen. Why is this so hard to figure out? Oh gamers are getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because our games need to stay connected with the server, how about we don't make it mandatory so they can still play without getting kicked off how hard is this for a multimillion dollar company to figure out. Fix this crap and maybe i'll change my view on this game.
11191	what a piece of crap
11192	0/10 They want to turn this game to League so they can make money but they are far away from it. Also, as a dota 2 player, I hate people do things like league.

To make thing worse, if you are a rookie, it is very difficult to complete mission in the late game if you just spend the first 20 bucks, in order to complete the main story mission, you need to do extra works, it needs TIME, and you waste time in the game so you will BUY and BUY. For the game like this, I usually check the director of this game and I will never buy any game from his/her team again.   They treat us like animal. we will give them NOTHING!!!!  Buy NFS or dirt or even grid, they are all much more better than this game.
11193	Well the game is awesome the people who run it aka Ubisoft sucks totally.  The game I was enjoying it until I needed a dlc to do some part of the story went to buy it 2 weeks ago and I never got it.  Ive bought several DLC's in steam (same place I bought the game) and never got them, went to the UBISOFT forums and made a Thread asking for help no reply from them so went to their customer service page and wrote a ticket polite one actually asking for help and explaining pretty much my problem and after 1 whole week im still waiting for reply.  Its absolutely unacceptable from a company like Ubisoft to have this behaviour towards their clients.  DONT BUY ANY GAME FROM THIS GUYS!
11194	okay.. so for right now i rate it 0 STARS because i cant even play it when its downloading it goes to first time setup and then it says ins.helper.exe and it is stuck there i have reset my pc done everything and even put it on another pc but it wont work so can anyone help with this problem......?
11195	just dont wan to work on my pc............
11196	loved this game.Had so many cars,after wild run,lost all my progress =(
11197	purchased this game :: wish i hadn't.   First run: Crash on load. Second run: loaded played for about an hour.  Third - fifthteenth load: locked up on a black screen, locked up pc had to do a hard reboot. sixthteeth load: ran fine, played a while.  ever since the last successful load it has not loaded at all. just a black screen and forcing me to do hard reboots of PC.   So until these issues are fixed i would recommend everyone to save thier cash for something that can aat least be called a working game. Pitifull showing to the devs on this one. Very pitifull. Pathetic even.
11198	not fun. looks bland. generic gameplay 
11199	Probably one of the worst games I own in terms of playability. This game is riddled with server sync bugs that often prevent you from finishing races, changing cars, or loading the game from the menu's at all. I wanted an open world racer that was fun and instead I got this mess that Ubisoft seemed to somehow make worse when they introduced the first large DLC (it ran fine before that mostly).  There are also a good deal of hackers in this game and Ubisoft does not seem to be banning or removing them at all. When you try to leave and avoid matches with these hackers you end up hitting one of the sync bugs and have to exit (or task slam) the game and start over.
11200	dont get this game i only played for a day after i bought when i went back to it i couldnt play it again kept saying the servers are unavaible and my connection is well fine 3 weeks i tried getting to log on n 3 weeks i keep getting that error so now im stuck with a game i cant play
11201	Bought the game when it came out and i randomly would freeze so i quit for a while, came back to the game about a year later and still freezing so no i do not reccomend this game. Also i have a good pc i could run the game everything high on 60 FPS but for no reason it would just freeze.
11202	Garbage Garbage this is so bad. the fysics in the game are crap i bounce off of everything i touch, i for some reason just spin out of control for no reason and it feels supper restricting i cant drift or do sharp turns at slow or top speed, and it makes u need to play with other players to get better faster or u pay money to do so. such a waist of money i want my money back.
11203	You need an Ubisoft account to play this game and you need to have Ubisoft-client running in the background while you play..
11204	Well at the current state of the game i wouldnt recommend for 60$ atleast, if it were lowered down to 30$ or even 45$ it would definetly be a great price, but the bug crashes that crash you out of the game are pretty annoying, esspecially when you are doing an hour race and are is on the 34/35 checkpoints and you crash........  overall  8/10 Would Crew again   also this is my second review ever
11205	The Crew attempts to be another TDU 2 and as long as you stick to stree or performance cars and don't go off road it does an ok job of it. The first and largest issue by far is the surface textures. All the surfaces from roads to dirt to snow to desert and grass and so on are very low poly meaning that it often sends you careening out of control because of a very sharp bump. Most cars don't handle well enough to hold those kinds of irregularities, not even the raid specs, making any time sensitive mission or race a very challenging and very very frustratring endeavor. A 16.5 GB game with a very large map results in a very poorly detailed map.  Its second large issue is the AI. The chase ai (cops or other 'baddies') is extremely broken. Cars that apeear fullstock or large police trucks are able to out-perform your car in every single way as long as you are in visual range, which is very hard to drop out of without some very tight and frequent turns, and they will follow you even offroad with all the aforementioned capabiliities. The race ai is equally stupid. The second place and often third place cars will outperform their own specifications simply 'to provide a challenge'. Whatever the point of all those parts i grinded for is, it is lost on me because of this. They will also ram you without a second thought but when it comes to traffic they dodge it as if the traffic was christ himself.  Its third major issue is connectivity. Ubisoft has not yet fixed any of its server issues. My friend and I have crashed regularly at the end of races because of that and often times you will be driving around when everyone drops off mysteriously from your hud. This isn't as bad an issue except in co-op, which I highly encourage to tackle some of the missions to get the high ratings and therefore the great parts.  There are many other smaller issues. The traffic is horrid once you've spent even a few minutes on one road. Midnight highways resemble rush hour traffic and city roads are always crowded, which, combined with the low poli textures (especially felt in san fran, seattle and chicago) makes for a very difficult time to accomplish missions or skills. The mirrors in cockpit mode still do not work whereas they work fine in third person view. The wooden and weak metal fences seriously sap out your speed (though this is more a quality of life issue). The UI is very intrusive on occassion, especially when you're trying to escape cops and hit some skill challenge.   The small number of cars is rather dissapointing but the ones that are do add some substance. Unfortunately, for the cars I did drive and enjoyed, there never was a large difference once in the way they handled or overall 'felt'. TDU2 had about 2 to 3 times the number of cars, if not more. The challenges, while some are fun, especially the jumps, are very dissapointing in their variety and method of approach. Generally a high enough speed at the beginning of the challenge and at least half-way decent handling will get you gold/plat on nearly everything.  It does have some great things for it. Large map,, beautiful terrain (to look at) and pretty great sunsets and sunrises as well as overall good terrain variety. The story is pretty good if rather predictable with a terribly bland ending cut scene but a very satisying final mission. Mind the pre-rendered 30fps cutscenes and terrible stuttering. Some ocassional frame lag however takes from this though it has been rarer in its occurance. It is very very enjoyable to just take out a performace and drive the entire map (on road) and just see the sights and I found snow driving fun.  As the specs go, these are my thoughts: Street: Basic racing spec. Good on road but rather terrible off-road (as expected). Enjoyable until you get a performace spec. Dirt: The shiftiest early car spec you get. Terrible grip and acceleration unless specifically stocked for those. High level very enjoyable and a whole lot of fun to drift for a mile with. Performance: Likely your car spec of choice. Great turning with good acceleration, grip and speed. Spin out rather easily early because of the power to weight discrepancy but overally very very fun to drive. Raid: Roads? We don't need no roads. 'Nuff said Circuit: NO NO NO NO NO. Spins out more often than the drift car on road, turns like a thrown brick, the first two gears might as well be non-existent making for a very harrowing off-the-line. Very very high speed but few roads will let you attain those. Maybe the Boneville salt flats. Terrible braking meaning you have to do it early. Mind the ramming ai.  Good concept. Poor execution. Surprising since part of the Ivory Tower team worked on TDU2 but I think they recruited the frustrating part of that team instead of the logical one.
11206	i have this game, and it looks very awesome it clearly is awesome, but for some ocmputers CPU can be a problem. Like mine. Ubisoft, it would be a pleasure if you would let us play the game without having the uplay application up while playing the game. it goes slow and i cant get by mission 1. When i went to task manager and ended the uplay task, the CPU went down to 60% which is very stable for a game to be in (No applications running) but i went back to the crew application and it said it had to restart. The way a game is meant to be played is with no applications running at the same time to get the fullest speed. Ubisoft, Think about the CPU your spamming us with.
11207	A nice hot steaming pile of dissapointing â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11208	Concerning the Alienware this dowmload sucks. It will not let me enter a key code and game constantly crashes when trying to load. I am sure I would like it if I could play it. For the Alienware it is diffucult and I still can not play the game. I give it 2 thumbs down.
11209	This game has a lot of good ideas about an open world racing MMO RPG (deep breaths) unfortunately not really executed well. Taking into consideration that this is an MMO, getting into a multiplayer game kinda doesn't work. I've spent a lot of the time waiting for a match just for the game to tell me that no one is in the lobby, even though there clearly is, the same is true for Co-op. When you do end up in a Co-op match, you'll find out that the races were't even designed for Co-op.  The races themselves were boring with most of them consisiting of street races that are made up of mostly wide streets and right angle corners. The races do get get a bit more exciting out of the outskirts though. You race along mountain roads and offroad tracks that bring a bit of excitment to the racing. The handling model does help factor into fun and although its not Forza Horizon type handling, its still quite fun. All that and you can take in the scenery that usually an open world game can give you.  Speaking of open world, The Crew really is quite big. However, you don't really notice its largeness. You'd spend most of your time in Cities since thats where all the races happen. The cities really feel quite small as its very easy to find yourself at the outskirts by just driving about. You'd only notice the size when you are travelling to another city. Long monotonous roads cluttered by non interesting scenery and what seems like repeating landscapes (some trees- farm and repeat) for most of your journeys. No matter how fun the handling is, cross country trips are quite boring. Thankfully, mostly all of the terrain in the game are drivable so you can cut across the country if you feel that it brings some variety.   One of the biggest flaws of the game though is the graphics. It looks like an old game remade for IOS then remastered in HD for PC. If you don't run an NVidia GPU there would be some occassional lag and stutters if you run it at ultra with some Nvidia features that somehow only Nvidia GPUs can run ( although it is more forgiving than the Intel only Global Illumination features on Grid 2 and Autosport).  My conclusion, if you are excited for a open world racing game on the PC then you can give this a try but you won't really enjoy this for long. Other than that The Crew doesn't really offer anything much for a racing fan.
11210	I wouldn't recommend this game. just another racer. cops are op for the most part. mulitplayer is laggy. can't customize cars as much as need for speed underground. I'd rather be playing that to be honest. and if it had multiplayer that'd be amazing.
11211	I wan't my money back...
11212	I enjoyed playing this game when I got it. I don't even like racing games, but this one is fun...if you can play it. Since the 1st update I haven't been able to access a portion of the file b/c it is detected as a virus. As such, I played the game for less than a month and liked it. For over a month, I haven't been able to play it and it causes memory problems for games stored near it. I had to uninstall
11213	I'm not going to bother spending the time to write an official or an elequently worded review here. I am just going to tell you why to avoid this game.  It is a pay to win game.  I preordered the $99 Gold Edition and the $29.99 on the Season Pass.  Now, I 'have' to pay for more stuff to remain a competitor? Are you serious? I just spent that much on a game and now there are others who can just throw more money at the greedy devs to compete?   This is a joke. Don't waste your time.   If the devs wanted to use this model, the game should have followed the 'freemium' model. This is just a pathetic ploy for money.
11214	i was looking forward to this game and after playing it a can i say that it is disapointing. some of its main selling points are just not up to par. the map is huge but most of it is empty and the few citys that they added are bland. not a lot of cars. its a mmo but i never can seem to find anyone. play this with a friend and got bored fast as there is nothing to do in this game, its a racing game but the pvp is just who has the fastest car and pve is pointless as its just a bunch of ruberbanding. ubisoft is just 1 step forward 8 steps backwards. dont waste your money on this because if your looking for a racing game the racing in this game is just frustrating and if your looking for a driving game the driving is so clunky and the map it self is so boring.
11215	I want to like this game, but constant lag and coop errors that result in frequent disconnects having to re-do the entire mission really get to me. Hopefully they fix the issues for this DLC to death game because it really has potential.
11216	this game is great and all but..... it tends to crash/freeze alot on my PC and there are alot of problems with logging into Uplay and its only my third day playing it but it might just be me I'm not quit sure so I would say buy if you're really interested  EDIT: ok so its been months since I got this game, I bought the season pass and all AND I STILL CANT LOG INTO UPLAY!!! I have tried every solution I can find and non of them work and I am very dissapointed this was a very fun game despite the fact that you may not be able to use cars you want to use on certain missions because its not a high enough level the driving was great and the game was beautiful....what ruined the entire experience was Ubisoft's terrible distribution service as it would tell me I was not connected to the internet even though I could play other online games just fine or that the uplay servers are down so my final words are......DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR $60 TO GO RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN ONLY FOR UBISOFT TO PICK UP AND SAVE IN THEIR WALLET FOR A RAINY DAY oh and the season pass was completely useless as the dlc vehicles hardly had any customization and had terrible stats to begin with
11217	Whoever regulated the difficulty of the story missions needs to be fired. The first few missions of the game are ridiculously hard for being the first missions. The learning curve is extremely steep, only for you to be dropped off into missions that are extremely easy compared to them. The difficulty continues this pattern for, what I can assume, the entire game. Not to mention the ridiculously annoying missions where you have to take down another car. Some are extremely easy and are done in like a minute, others you have to play at least 5 times just to memorize where the car is going so you can ram into them, and that's if you actually manage to hit them. The slow down and speed up at the weirdest times and hard to intersect them.  The game is nice enough to give you a break every few minutes by crashing so you have to restart the game. New record: Crash after 5 minutes  Collision is really wierd on things that aren't the terrain like rocks and ramps and stuff.  For how not an MMO this game is, it did manage to get the grinding aspect of it down by having you do the same skill mission over and over until you can get the highest level part.  Driving around the overworld has it's charms, and I like that the lighting is more realistic than most, i.e. no fancy filters and stuff. I managed to get to level 50 without having to get too far into the main story, which is nice, and I'm sure playing with friends is a lot of fun, but in the end it's not worth breaking your keyboard or controller or whatevery you're using, in rage and the ridiculously difficult levels.
11218	The rubber banding in this game is out of control. Driving a RUF 3400K completly spec'd out with top level parts... Get outrun by a F-ing bus. Take a hard pass on this one.
11219	Here's imo a fair introduction to the game:  'Welcome to The Crew, the story is based of off The Fast and The Furious and every single street racing game in the history of mankind, so you easily can get into the game. To help people save money after the microtransactions and ridiculous price, we made your Force Feedback wheels useless, sell it and spend more money on Ubisoft instead! We have balanced our cars so well that your Ferrari can get beaten by a Mustang from the sixties! If you want to learn more about our fantastic game we recommend listening to the bribed professional reviewers and reading the positive reviews below. Bye, and thanks for your money! - Ubi$oft'
11220	UPDATED!  After fiddling with FFB and The Crew's own settings, I've actually managed to get the steering up to a level that is much more realistic, give a closer feel to actually driving. This will also make you a worse driver, competitively speaking, but that's just the nature of the beast. I'll take it, and switch controllers if I need to compete for something. Sometimes FFB turns off randomly. This seems to be a handshake problem between The Crew and the Logitech Profiler software. But it works sometimes and that's not nothing.   Still, the story, is a roadblock to your progress in the game. The rubber banding the cops have on you, the â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics (they can stop you by tapping your car), makes your success at a mission totally random. You have to luck out, and I didn't sign up for a game of russian roulette with ai. There's no tactics to the game and you feel cheated because the cops and other cars always spec up to whatever your car is. Dumb story, poor mechanics. Not recommended.  INITIAL REVIEW So here's my problem with The Crew -- I've been spoiled by Assetto Corsa. The sound, the force feedback, the realistic physics, and responsive handling of AC are phenomenal. The Crew? Falls flat in all of the above categories. The FFB is poorly integrated (no preset profiles for even the most popular wheels, such as the G27). I've fiddled around with the logitech profiler for my wheel and have successfully sobered up from Animal House wasted to Weekend at Bernies buzzed.   Visually, it's underwhelming with terrible aliasing even with TXAA at 4X. I know, it's an MMO, the servers can't handle XYZ. But damn, the cars look clunky. Where on a real car you'd see rounding in a hard edge, you just get one hard line. In short, the gist of the car is captured, but it still feels like it's a model that was made in 2008.  The cars sound like lawnmowers. There is no frequency range in the sounds -- no low frequency humming or higher frequency whining as the engine red-lines. Just a lawnmower, or perhaps a Vitamix powering up. Makes me sad.   The story, (why oh why?!) is something that should be skippable entirely. The most protracted tutorial I've been through, with most of the game kept under lock and key until you complete the story. /Spoiler/ Your brother is killed, you're framed, you're recruited by FBI. Revenge /End Spoiler/ Flat characters, not even an attempt at an original storyline. Which I'd be okay with but for the fact that my handler keeps calling me up all the time, telling me to go to the next mission. Can we just skip the story. Please?!  The HUD is somewhat cartoonish, but I understand where they're coming from. It's NFS meets...well it's NFS. But if I so much as drive half a mile, I get a pop up congratulating me at every checkpoint and asking if I'd like to re-do the past 30 seconds of gameplay. No I do not want time travel as a feature--so please stop breaking my immersion and taking up 1/2 the screen with popups. I'm drivin here!  And of course, when you buy anything from Ubisoft through steam, you have to use their absolute piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ bloatware Uplay. Almost makes buying any ubisoft game altogether unappealing. This is part of why Ubisoft is becoming more hated than EA. Origin is annoying, but at least it has become bearable to use. Uplay is like a horrible amalgamation of the Wii avatar system (why can't I upload my own profile picture?) and some bizzarro world version of steam, where everything is bright, white, and useless.  In short. If you're looking for a driving sim *SIM* placed in a huge open world environment, don't even consider this game. It's not what it was marketed as, and it's not what it is. It's an arcade game. Open world. Expansive. Lack-luster graphics and a bloated, disruptive interface. If you liked the Need For Speed series, by all means, go right ahead. It's NFS with total MMO integration, and it does that very well. What it comes down to is that this game isn't right for me -- a graphics stickler who likes racing that's more sim than arcade. If you don't identify similarly, disregard much of this review. The Crew might be a fun rehashing of Need For Speed. But it's also a souless exercise in making a game as middle of the road as possible.
11221	If you throw Need For Speed's physics and customizations, a couple of Test Drive Unlimited 2's map sizes , Firefall's grinding experence, and a open world lobby multiplayer into a blender, This is the result. Atleast it is what it feels like so far  This is an arcade racer, the cars will not handle nearly how you might expect at first  Looks pretty good on my r9 295x2, most settings maxed flawless 60fps. no crashes (5760 x 1080)  So far the best cars ive noticed are:  Mini couper for Street (small, 4 wheel drive, good handling. easily the best)   Lambo Aventador for Perf (Most Perf cars spin tires with noz unless its 4 wheel drive, plus good handling)  Ford Raptor for Dirt (havent used it but it seems to be the best)  Donno for raid, too frusterating to play sometimes. Also the buggy looses controll on bouncy tracks easily  Mclaren 12c from the season pass bonus car seems pretty solid for circuit, even though its 2 wheel drive  EDIT: You play it one time, beat the short story and its put on the shelf for a long time.
11222	If you like racing games where the physics arn't quite realistic or arcade style, and feel like just a jumbled pile of trash, Then this is the game for you!  For serious though. When turning, it feels like your tires are made of sponge or something. Or as if they are just all half flat. You can't drift worth **** with any car type, and the camera is just awful. It seems like they tried to make the camera look in the direct it thinks you want to drive toward, but always over shoots. So when ever you turn your always looking past where your wanting to turn towards. Especially when your moving more slowly, which makes getting out of a pile-up absolutly horrible.  I would honestly have GTA 4 Car physics over this. Also, tuning your car is nothing like you would expect. Its extreamly linear, with a menu that makes it look Open-ended.  One last note, you can't effectivly play this game if you have a life outside of your computer. It just takes too long to get/do anything.
11223	Neat idea, poorly executed. Long, frequent, game-breaking lag spikes. Vehicles appearing and dissappearing from the roads. Enemies doing things in races that your cars simply are not capable of(almost as if they are governed by a different set of physics). The controls are also very frustrating. In an attempt to make drifting more accessible they've made it extremely easy to lose control of the vehicle. This could have been a great game, but given these problems it is not worth it's asking price.
11224	Amazing story... Suposed to be MMO, but the pvp in the game is just awefull.. Sure you can do missions and stuff together, but after lvl 50, and the story is completed, then what? There is barely enough players online to do pvp. When i pvp i wait lik 10 min for a race. WTF!
11225	Ubershit!   Serves are most of the time down.
11226	EDIT: Has a good concept to it, portays it very poorly, crashes, and DLC up the â¥â¥â¥. It's an alright game but it just gets repetitive and boring. If you have the money and love downloading DLC, go for it. Other than that, go find another racing game.
11227	After 60Hours now, i think i cud say its a very interesting game, that I am going to play for a long time, it has a lot of potential and im curious about what the updates and incoming DLCs are going to offer.  Just play and never drive alone.    ----------------------------- After 100Hours im thinkin totally different..... I liked the mission tho, playin it co-op, but the endgame-content was rubbish to me. -------------------------------- thumbs down
11228	Bad graphics Bad car handling and phisycs Ridiculos missions   Don't waste yor money !
11229	Probably one of the worst games I own in terms of playability. This game is riddled with server sync bugs that often prevent you from finishing races, changing cars, or loading the game from the menu's at all. I wanted an open world racer that was fun and instead I got this mess that Ubisoft seemed to somehow make worse when they introduced the first large DLC (it ran fine before that mostly).  There are also a good deal of hackers in this game and Ubisoft does not seem to be banning or removing them at all. When you try to leave and avoid matches with these hackers you end up hitting one of the sync bugs and have to exit (or task slam) the game and start over.
11230	dont get this game i only played for a day after i bought when i went back to it i couldnt play it again kept saying the servers are unavaible and my connection is well fine 3 weeks i tried getting to log on n 3 weeks i keep getting that error so now im stuck with a game i cant play
11231	Game is currently bugged and not launching properly
11232	Will likely be seeking a refund.  So many issues, beeng trying to just get started for over an hour now. Had to connect to ubisoft and register it on that site, now saying error code #0_1 (looked that up - server down) and that its the 'wild ride' version when I only want to play the based game that I bought. Is it required that you are connected online to even play? I just want to race for a hour occassionally, its becoming more of a hassle than its worth.
11233	Why i cant log in uplay ? there always keep connection lose try agains... How to i can log in ?
11234	saying my beta is over when i bought the game wtf does that mean
11235	Good game but all the bugs kill it
11236	Game Crashes Evreytime i try to start it up and not any of thesolutions that i tried help
11237	'OK. You have more than 150 hours onm record and you donÂ´t recommend it?'  Well, first of all, I pre-ordere this game and started to play the day it was released. When you are a NFS fan, you expected this game to be the same, like, a mere copy. But when I saw they have Off road specs, i decided i would give it a change, i mean 'A NFS thatÂ´s ON and OFF road? That must be fun.' It is, but not as much as i expected. As many other racing games, you always want the best car, the best spec, etc. So, I bought the Agera... It was so dissapointing... The Fullstock car is amazing, itÂ´s behavior is quite impressive, but when i bought the Perf spec for it... BAAAM! It ruined the car... Could you imagined that tuned up car would be slower, inferior, on any aspect, comparing to itÂ´s stock version? Well, neither did I...  I stop playing this game for a wile after this and, when I saw 'The Wild Run' i came back to play, to make some money for the bikes and the other carÂ´s specs. ItÂ´s been a long time, for me, since thye last time I played a racing game with both cars and bike (last one was Midnight Club 3) and i was really anxious for that. Bikes are good, fun to ride but they are not match for cars. I mean, They do have a great performance, but to compete with cars, they are not as good as they should be.   They have improved physics, grafics, but to me, itÂ´s more of the same thing. The game is unbalanced, catchup ruins the game, bikes are way underpowered, extreme specs are way too expensive and hypersports car can loose to a 370z easily.   In other words, this game had anything to be great, different, but in conclusion, itÂ´s just another failed copy of the great franchises we see these days, like, NFS, Grid, etc.
11238	Handling is horrible. Played for 2 hours and just could't get used to how bad it was. This feels like a bad arcade game and that's being generous. I have played better racing games on my cellphone. But it's an MMO... Not really
11239	Waste of money game ... $80 rip off
11240	This is a tough one for me.   I like the open world driving this game offers. Cruising the world, racing around cities and through high mountains. Seeing the sights. And the sites. Its very good stuff.  Unfortunately, its literally the only positive the game offers.  The missions are uniformly awful. Win a race against rubberbanding AI on the street. On dirt. Off road. Ram a car to 'take it down' within an arbitrary time limit, offroad, where you cant even drive straight for more than a second at a time. Missions are boring, detract from the fun of the open world and extremely repetitive.   And they are still better than the story. Its Fast and Furious with barely enough changes to avoid plagiarism. Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly paced, especially with most missions requiring several tries to beat the rubber banding. Ruins the pacing of the story completely - which is doubly bad since it was never well paced to begin.  Basically The Crew is just another tired, formulaic Ubi game. Same map unlocks. Same icons. Same boring missions littered across a large open world that would be more fun without them. Terrible writing. Mediocre characters. Coupled with loose, flighty car handling, lack of the ability to import your own songs and the always online nature, and as much as I still enjoy the cruising the world now and then...  Just avoid this game.
11241	realy tried to like it but...  1)the opponents are not following any of the normal physics rules and they seem to turn on a dime even when driving a muscle car.  2) Police is massivly overpowered and can crash you off the road without contest. And if you try to defend against them its like crashing into a brick wall. 3) nitpicking but they didn't even get all the car sounds correct.  The only thing I realy like in this game is doing road trips.
11242	This game still in ALPHA  If you ever user nVidias DSR this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game will â¥â¥â¥â¥ with you.  1 - I have my monitor in its native resolution, 1080p, I can use 4k but I'm not using it right now. 2 - First run of the game, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ thinks: -Look I'm going to set your video option automaticly! -Wow you max resolution option is 4k, let me set on it!(NO YOU F.UCKER ITS NOT THE STANDARD DONT U F.UCKING DO IT!) 3 - Since I'm using a multi monitor setup, it starts windowed borderless, can't see crap. 4 - Close the game. 5 - Open GForce experience, found the game, set the right resolution, nice, time to try again! 6 - The game: - Look, still first run! Let me set your vidoe option again!  - Wow 4k? Nice let me set to it, now in fullscreen 7 - Windows goes nuts trying to resize everythin. 8 - ctrl+â¥â¥â¥â¥+esc Close the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. 9 - Go to my desktop setting, set it to 4k, open the trash game, gos to settiongs set to 1080p, SAVE COS IF NOT I'M F.UCKED, quit the game. 10 - Go to desktop, set it to 1080p, now I can f.ucking play the game.  And don't you dare to forget that this â¥â¥â¥â¥ uses uPlay (more like uDontPlay) and you have to activate things on it and bla bla bla, so, just half an hour so you can play this..   If you think they did right with the crew unlike with AC? YOU ARE F.UCKING WRONG!
11243	Disappointing. It has a few nice features, looks good, and has a cockpit view(no trackir). I like the customization features.   But the races are annoying, full of bugs, for a multiplayer title I have yet to race with a human, and the AI seems to ignore the physics.   If they patch it, and add TrackIr, then maybe it will be a good title. My biggest regret was for paying full price on this.   Mental Note: Only buy UBISOFT titles after a month or two, after reviews have come through, and players have voiced their opinion to avoid problems like this and Assassin's Creed Unity.
11244	The story line missions suck and the game has no depth. Don't recommend at all.
11245	EDIT: The Wild Run update basically made the game pay-to-win. I've changed my recommendation to 'No'.  This is the best racing game I have ever played. It is the perfect balance of missions and open-world free-riding. It's got a bit of car customization but not so much as to be overwhelming. The cars are pretty arcade-y but don't completely lack distinction. The game's mission is very long with hours and hours of non-story content. I have played about 30 hours and am less than half way done. The UI is incredibly intuitive and the game is easy to play on a keyboard. It has been a long time since I've played a racing game this engrossing, and it will be a while until I play another racing game.
11246	I think the racing part of the game is fine. Racing is fun and the cars handle well. Other than that, the game misses the mark, for me. I think those who have a solid group of friends, already in the game, will have more fun. But this game is not easy to make new friends in. The map idea where we can see other players is very cool, but the actual social connection with those players is lacking.  I wish someone would recreate Motor City Online, or a new version of it..
11247	I feel I should get my money back for this game.
11248	This is literally the only game I've ever played that I sincerely want my money back for, it was the biggest waste of time I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in, and I was never even able to get past the first mission. The police and AI system is total garbage, the FPS was horendous at best, graphics were alright, as well as detail, the controls were not even ideal, everything seemed to never really leave you with any hint that you were actually driving and more the environment throwing you around while you desperately tried to make it to the next checkpoint in the pitiful amount of time they gave you. I wasn't able to experience anything past the extreme wall of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that they forced upon me with this game, the codes I was given for Gold (I can't believe I wasted this much money on this) only worked when I tried the codes about several times. Normally, I really really love racing games, especially open world driving games, but this was by far the worst experience I've ever had with the genre, it makes sense that it was Ubisoft's doing. One of, if not the worst most anticipated game of 2014 in my opinion, would never buy this for any amount of money. 3/10 and I still feel like I'm being pitiful, but I still love the look of it, but only just.
11249	when you get through the main story theres not a whole lot you can do. if you bbuy the wildrun dlc which is more than the game in the first place, you dont really get allot of stuff because you have to buy monster trucks and bikes(with real money). over all its a waist to buy this unless you buy the complete edition which is $80. DO NOT BUY
11250	The game is awesome, but it lacks of having multiple saves. or even a restart progress. I would like that so I could experience the game again (Now with a wheel controller). Also because I want wildrun in a fresh new career. And lastly, because I would like to show this game to my father and that he could experience it from the start.
11251	I have only done one other review and it was for TF2 because I love that game so much. This review is the exact opposite I hate this game so much I must tell you to please don't waste your money on this. The problem is I play and at some point during some mission the game stops loading the map and you drive into nothingness then it freezes if you try to reset your car it is glitched out. I know its not my PC I can play GTA 5 maxed out for hours no problem and other graphic extensive games. This program is unfinished. Soooooooo ANGRY!!!!!
11252	What the hell I bought some of the game played for a bit then it said no you can't play no more
11253	The steering is awful and the car physics are crap. It wobbles and the cars slides. Why wont the tires grip naturally? Just look at NFS Underground 2 and look at how the cars behave. No arcade style drift when you turn regularly, only when you make use of the handbrake you get a drift. I mean the developers of NFSUG2 got the basic steering done right as early as 2004. Why not in 2014 when the game was released? Why can't the developers sort out something as simple as the steering before making the entire world in which to drive in? In addition you are faced with DLC paywall events everywere. Thats when i got my refund just in time. Im not spending my money on a half arsed game when I already bought the game.
11254	As a game, I thoroughly enjoyed what the (base) game has to offer. I only have the base game so I will write my review based on that.  PROS :  + Fast paced, arcade racing  + Enormous map to travel around (If you love driving around for hours on end for no apparent reason like me)  + Off-road racing  + Graphics are pretty good. Dirt, snow, rain effects are present on top of car scratching and crumpling due to impacts.  + Day/night cycle  HOWEVER the many things preventing me from recommending this game to anyone are as follows :  CONS :  - Multiplayer PvP is not balanced (i.e. Going into a Perf spec race with a Lvl 680 BMW M3 facing off against a Lamborghini and two other hyper cars beyond Lvl 1000)  - Physics engine is not good at handling bumps and jumps, making most Dirt and Raid spec related events frustrating.  - Wild Run advertisment EVERYWHERE. Main menu, Wild Run. Look for crew, Wild Run. Summit events on map, Wild Run. Don't want it, don't need it, don't intend to get it. (Get a hint from Dying Light developers, please.)  - Locked to Uplay. The bloody Uplay.   - Free roam doesn't allow me to race other players at will. (Even GTA:O has this feature and it isn't even a racing game.)  - The game instantly forces you back into the main menu when you lose connection to the servers, even when you're playing a Solo mission. I was doing a 100KM faction race and got forced back to the main menu when I just passed the 55KM mark. COME ON. At least put me on a temporary offline mode and reattempt connection while I continue my race you lazy twa ts.  And the last point which angers me the most :  - - - EULA Restrictions. I am currently studying in Sarawak, Malaysia and a friend helped me buy this game while it was on discount, but I can't even access the game in my home in Brunei just 2 hours drive away from where I am? Asia region my as s.  TL;DR = Great game, even greater flaws. If you would really like to try this game I'd suggest getting it on a 60% or above sale.
11255	You know you have a bad game when the activation key doesn't work
11256	i got this game and it says your trial has come to a end what do i do i got this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game and it doesnt let me play
11257	I downloaded The Crew Complete Edition but Wild Run was only the trial game, and now my trial is over. can you fix this?
11258	Why include an obligatory story mode in this game? It is a sandbox. Yet, you have to play for several hours just to unlock the ability to take part in offroad races.  Offroad handling is very strange. Not at all like an arcade racer, and not at all like a sim, or a Codemasters game. Basically, the offroad handling is most similar to a boat racing game, and the noise of the gravel and dirt is extremely disappointing or non existant.   The story is some of the worst garbage I have ever seen in a game, and the game is extremely lacking in polish. This is one of the most disappointing games, in my opinion, as the potential is so great, but the end product is ruined by the choice to lock the game behind a moronic, insulting, and unneccessary story. Did anyone think that was a good idea, besides the suits? 
11259	EDIT: Has a good concept to it, portays it very poorly, crashes, and DLC up the â¥â¥â¥. It's an alright game but it just gets repetitive and boring. If you have the money and love downloading DLC, go for it. Other than that, go find another racing game.
11260	After 60Hours now, i think i cud say its a very interesting game, that I am going to play for a long time, it has a lot of potential and im curious about what the updates and incoming DLCs are going to offer.  Just play and never drive alone.    ----------------------------- After 100Hours im thinkin totally different..... I liked the mission tho, playin it co-op, but the endgame-content was rubbish to me. -------------------------------- thumbs down
11261	Bad graphics Bad car handling and phisycs Ridiculos missions   Don't waste yor money !
11262	The Aventador has 700hp in real life, in this game it has 394hp.. wtf. The graphics are on par with some of the first need for speed games, also the frame rate for the graphics is terrible. 60 fps cap. little feedback from the car, feels fake.
11263	been playing racing games for over 15 years and can clearly say that this game is rather disappionting, pc lunch is always hard but i have had non sto[ crash issiuse with that game, it takes about 5 mins to re open and be playable after a crash, ( i exceed recommended requirements ) when the game does run the AI is about the worst i have ever seen in a game, they will run you right off the road just cause they can, the parts are awarded on a horrible system, almost imposible to tune your car down to help a friend, the recommended car lvl for races is utterly stupid cause the ai does not base it on that but rather the fastest person in the group, and even in solo missions the car lvl lies, i have issiues finishing some of the story line races ( i.e. game says the race should be easy, car lvl 420, my car lvl 559 and yet still running out of time between check points (even on clean runs without hitting anything) HORRIBLE GAME UNISTALLED AFTER BEING RELEASED FOR 4 DAYS WISH I COULD GET A REFUND
11264	The Crew = PTW noob town.
11265	One of the worst racing games ive ever enountered it is by far in the top three most diaâ¥â¥â¥â¥ingbolical pieces of wank â¥â¥â¥â¥ under the face of the sun and should only be recommended for mental torture or if you like diaâ¥â¥â¥â¥ingbolical wank â¥â¥â¥â¥ games please i beg of you to who ever will belive me it is absolutley in no way shape or form worth buying at full retail price of $75 its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke im so over the â¥â¥â¥â¥ titles that Ubislop have pumped out this year excluding fc4 its worth about $15 and no more at â¥â¥â¥â¥ing all btw i never swear but seriously this game pisses me off more than a mosquito in my room at night that keeps whining and i think id prefer as mozzie right now as thats just $60 (beta backer) i just â¥â¥â¥â¥ out to some scummy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who is going to continually fall short of creating a game worth playing because UBI ceo's and mangers just want enough money to fill their greedy endless loose â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s with a massive wad of cash to shove right up in there and make their prostates stimulated whilst they sit back and dream up their next big venture to make their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s fit even more cash up their â¥â¥â¥ to get even more stimultaion  â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics Test drive unlimited 2 was better WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY........WAY hyped up just like watchdogs, ACU, ACR, and FC4 was also glicthy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ FC3 was good what happened to making interesting characters or being able to put any weapon in any spot holder and please stop with the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boring usless time wasting radio/control/regional unlocable towers that enable the region to be revealed or have extra missions and side quests its just so 2012 and its been done in like every game its just â¥â¥â¥â¥  BORING and generic singleplayer campain  the mutiplayer is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and i found 3 people in 17 hours of gameplay and you cant even race them  there is only 40 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cars but don't you worry your little wee â¥â¥â¥â¥in booties because you will be able to buy DLC for $10 or more a pop at some wankarific cars for you too spunk all over  UBISOFT i now speak to you directly stop making unplayable and 60% finished games or â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shut down  The Crew is it worth a buy? N â¥â¥â¥â¥ing O
11266	The driving itself can be fun, the racing is not fun at all. The 'story' they have tried to integrate into this game is pointless. Why is there even a story in a racing game?  The online stuf really doesn't do all that much.  Driving across the United States is kind of fun, but that's kinda it.
11267	I was quite excited when I saw the trailers of the crew. After a few hours of gameplay this feeling changed and so I have yet another game in my Steam list, waiting to catch some dust.  Although the graphics are outstanding, I do not like the story mode. It seems almost a thin copy paste from Need for Speed Underground. You start from nothing, want revenge and have to get to the top. Oops, sorry â¦ I have told you the end of the story now ;-) If you want a good story mode, pick Driver San Francisco instead for a couple of bucks on the Steam store.  Small interlude missions such as slalom, precision tests, â¦ are draining the fun of free driving mode. Big problem is that they start automatically, even if your car is not ideal for the test. If you want to just cruise without being interrupted, choose Test Drive Unlimited instead or Forza Horizon if you are lucky to have an Xbox.  Also the start of the races are ridiculous. Only a noob would start a race flat out, wheels spinning. Each descent racer knows that finding the right amount of traction at the start can give you a head start. Not in this game, you are doomed to start like an amateurâ¦  
11268	A pretty decent game,  Amazing story Nice graphics A little bit buggy but works (if you play with a m8 you need to switch your car on start menu to see them etc)  It's like playing need for speed underground 2
11269	Cars handle like â¥â¥â¥â¥, The story is â¥â¥â¥â¥ (the premise of the story is fine but its told like â¥â¥â¥â¥). Do a jump land and your car randomly spins out of conrol EVERY TIME! Car custimization is â¥â¥â¥â¥! grand theft auto has more customization options. The game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. Music is mostly â¥â¥â¥â¥ feels like 5 songs on each radio station and most are â¥â¥â¥â¥ songs.  Such good idea behind the game but a â¥â¥â¥â¥ POOR execution. I wish I had my 60 dollars back.
11270	UPlay doesnt even let you play it sometimes, and crashes at startup to most of the people. Don't buy.
11271	This is the worst driving game I have ever played, it is consistently disappointing the game crshes so often that I can`t get through races so I can`t progress in the game had I known how bad it was going to be I wouldn`t have wasted my money. The first and most annoying thing is that the servers keep dropping the connection and you have to quit the game and restart it make an offline mode you idiots. The second thing is that no matter how much you tune your vehicles the AI opponents are still faster. Third there are not enough vehicles and it takes forever to get enough cash together to buy new ones. Fourth the game is just confusing there are too many things to list here but it is just confused and clumsily built.I guess I`ll just have to dust off my old copy of Test Drive Unlimted 2 if I want a good open world driving gaming experience because this game is a total fail.  It has been over a year and the game is even worse now I can`t even get it to launch at all, I am so very sick of this game and ubisoft for releasing suck a piece of garbage that if I could I would get a refund. I have now reinstalled Test Drive Unlimited and it works like a charm and its over a decade old but it works and I can drive in an open world in single player.
11272	Might change my recommendation later. Main flaws are already noted by other people.  But unfortunately I've only played the game for an hour. Even bought the season pass after the first half hour.  I'd love to play more of it. But... the game has to be connected to the servers if you want to play.. And the servers seem to be... in suboptimal condition...   By that I mean their servers are â¥â¥â¥â¥. â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers = never connected = never play. Ty Ubisoft.
11273	'Ryouichi - Not the same customization i've seen in trailers.' 'Nicksandalis - most overhyped piece of garbage I have ever laid hands on.'  sounds fimilyar, lol hmmm, JUST LIKE WATCH_DOGS, which was a over priced and overhyped Piece OF S**T same as the crew,, i feel like i was ripped off too, engines are not true to each car, remides me of AUTOMATION - a car builder simulator, except the crew has real cars, but engine are fake, and the game automation was only 25-35 bucks USD, and aint bad and was cheap, this game, not so much, i mean $85 bucks in US dollars is alot of f**king money for me, and i feel like i was robbed again by ubisoft, the graphics are alot better than Watch_dogs, id like to see the modders that did the graphics enhancements for Watch_Dogs to copy or extract the REAL CARS from the crew,as the crew uses almost the same identical (SOMEWHAT) *.DAT &amp; *.FAT FILES as WATCH_DOGS DOES! and add them to Watch_dogs, then id be happier to have spent all the money i did on both garbage games,,, i also better see Ubicrapsoft add ALOT F**iNG MORE TO THE CREW AND WATCH_DOGS OR I AM DONE BUYING THIR GAMES, AND THAT INCLUDES ANY SPLINTER CELL GAME, FUTURE â¥â¥â¥â¥ WITH WATCH_DOGS LIKE WATCH_DOGS 2, OR MORE DLC FOR CURRENT GAME, or any other game by them ever again, im not getting screwed a f**king again, oh &amp; UBI, F**CK UR UPLAY BULLs**t,  i wanted to pirate the crew to see if the game was even worth the 85 USD i ended up spending on it, because i got a beta cd key, but it expired and I NEVER EVEN GOT TO USE THE KEY, WHEN I finally got the email with the beta key? i activated the cd key on uplay and it was already expired :( , (F**k U Ubisoft/UPLAY.. and it was for some reason, in my junk folder in my email which is why i didnt get it intime&gt;&gt;&gt; 
11274	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. I played one mission for hour and what? Just Alt+F4
11275	pretty interesting game, but calling it an mmo is a joke, you drive alone the majority of the time to see people for a couple seconds before they change instance's right in front of you. and the error, cannot join crew is kind of a joke lol... and i dont think it helped that they led people on with the 'Crew' idea.... a crew is a party of 4 nothing else lol
11276	Ahahaha. Paid $80 for the awful original game and now they want another $25 for DLC that should have been included? Never buying from Ubisoft or Ivory Tower again. Go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself.
11277	would be a great game if i could play it. ive got friends that have the game. and they had talked me into getting it. seemed pretty good when i was watching them play it. so i went ahead and payed the 60 bucks and bought it, well, finished downloading and i kept getting the error 'could not connect to crew error #0_1' sent an email to UBIsoft and waited a month before giving up on hearing back from them. so i sent them another one and filled out a ticket request on their website again. looked all over the internet on how to fix the error to no avail. so if it is at all possible, try and get a demo version to see if it works.
11278	Very dissapointed to see my season pass was a crock of â¥â¥â¥â¥
11279	The Crew has its ups and downs. I can't quite recommend it, but it's worth picking up when on a deep sale.  First off, the main character is an utter and complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Normally this isn't a big deal, but the combination of hipster look (thick rim glasses and babyface beard to start with), juvenile 'badass' nature, and above and beyond white knight philosphy make him a character that's a huge cringe to follow. And as is the case with a game like this, there's no meaningful characters or plot to really make it redeemable. I wouldn't even bother mentioning this if he wasn't constantly thrust in front of you before every mission, whining about something.  The physics of a racing game are paramount to whether the game will be enjoyable or not. And The Crew bounces around in this area. Going off road feels slightly slippery in some car classes, along with a large amount of speed lost. In fact it feels like you get a speed cap when you go offroad more than the terrain is actually factoring into the slow down. Being on road seems to have a similar cap. Turning and other physics can be best described as semi-arcade. This isn't Need For Speed and you won't be drifting around turns, at least not quickly. But this also isn't demanding like Forza. It's a nice design that makes a fun time for an evening where you just want some lazy racing.  You've got a few classes of cars to use, where each car can be in a couple of those classes. It sounds like a nice variety, but you become deeply conservative about car choice because you'll be extremely limited on funds the whole game. The cars themselves are pretty standard fare and licensed. It is interesting to see a Mustang go from a street mod racer to an offroad rally car to a monster truck (for DLC The Run), but that novelty will either be rare or you will have grinded or purchased premium currency to make it worthwhile to play with.  Plot and story are shallow. Main character's brother gets shot. Main character gets accused and put away for years. FBI wants him to bust another agent and has him get on the good side of his old gang, which no longer recognizes him even though his own brother built it up and ran it. You do some racing, move up in the ranks, half the time getting threatened to be killed, and seek revenge for a death that you pretty much don't care about with a character you just can't sympathize with. Other characters you meet are equally shallow. Basic, generic characters that have specif talents and knowledge that you use them for.  There's a lot of content to explore in the game. It takes a long time to drive one coast to the other, which isn't quite the route the game takes you. More of a clockwise path from the midwest. And along the way there's a range of activities to follow. Skill gates that have you do various activies such as slolam between markers or try to stay on a given path that gradually thins as you succeed are dotted all across the map. Hidden cars can be found once you have all the parts of a specific one in each region. Radar stations allow you to see locations you haven't spotted. And many, many events to take part in between story and a few smatterings of missions that need to be done to 'gain enough rep' to move on.  You primarily move on by gaining levels, getting better parts for your cars which also run based on levels, and progressing the story.   Even with that, something about the game feels so empty. A lobby of people that can be anywhere on the map has been, in my experience, lacking any objective. Police activity is rare. In fact trying to hunt down a chase is a pretty fruitless endeavor, and the chases are standard fare, leaning to the easier end. You'll move into a pattern of doing some mission, doing some events to get some better car parts, maybe a little exploring, then back to the grind. This isn't a bad thing usually, but there's something about The Crew that you just can't place why it feels so empty, even when its brimming with some interesting gameplay. There isn't any motivation to pursue the story in of itself and halfway through the game you already know what's coming.  It's not worth full price, but consider grabbing it on a Steam sale. Just watch out for the premium currency concerns as well. They're not needed if you are careful or don't mind grinding.
11280	70 hours into the game, I can say two things about the crew. One, pray to god you don't get any game breaking bugs, because more often than not, you will have to resort to community help rather than Ubisoft actually trying to mend their own mess. Two, play with friends. This game gets tiresome and tremendously boring if you are on your own.     The campaign is generic at best, really forgetable. Not much to say about it.    The physics tend to make no sense at times, especially in PvP.   Not a big choice in cars either, to add to that, most cars have two to tree specs available and that's it. Higher end cars such as the Agera R and LaFerrari only get performence specs.    Map size is good for an online multiplayer racing game. But most cities will feel very small aside from maybe NY and LA.    And finally, the bugs. In the last month or so, I have been experiencing game crashes at random. I have tried various different solutions (most submitted by the community), as Ubisoft tech support doesn't seem to care, which can ruin the entire experience.      Overall it is avarage at best, it's fun at first if you are alone and just want to finish the story missions. However if you play for longer and have no one to share in the experience with, the is a high probability that you will get tired of it in a short while.    EDIT   Following different Nvidia driver updates, the game can surprize you in many different ways. For me, it doesn't even want to start up anymore, right after I set the new drivers. Goes to show how much thought process was put in the optimization and support of this ''game''.    In all honesty, it is a waste of money and time. Ubisoft don't care about your experience, so why should you buy their product.   I regret buying this game.
11281	Have not been able to connect to friends online in this game, despite going through every process that was recommended by the support team. This game is far from being MMO, and I cannot recommend this title knowing what you'll have to go through to eventually be told nothing helpful.
11282	25 pounds for a trial version of the game scam do not buy
11283	I purchased The Crew thinking I would get what I paid for.  No, instead I got a 2 hour trail version of Wild Run.  Avoid unless your wallet is to heavy and you need to lose weight fast.
11284	AI is bad Cop car is like a tank Each sessions can only hold 8 players NOT an MMO Get bored in few hours  = waste of money
11285	This game does not run!
11286	another bad driving game with terrible ubisoft-grade optimization
11287	i bought it and will monly let me play the trail version like what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
11288	Ubisoft, even being a multibillion-dollar company with thousands of developers, CAN NOT ADD DECENT SUPPORT TO JOYSTICKS, I have a USB PS2/PS3 joystick-style, but him gets EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, you move a little to the side and the car turns too much, it seems that you are playing GTA. Should have control of the sensitivity also for joysticks, not just for steering wheels, etc., it seems made in the Unity engine.  And the audio, the game auto-detects the audio 5.1 but places it as surround, I think, so the volume gets very low, and the mid and bass dissapear completely, so you have an idea, I have to put my music player, Winamp, at 10 volume, 10 of maximum 100, so I can hear the game. Thus it should be more settings for the audio, as stereo, 5.1 without surround, etc.  The graphics are weak, dull and lifeless, just have a good textures, the Need For Speed The Run and The Rivals are MUCH nicer.  Another hyped game from Ubisoft, boring and bland, treated as revolutionary by the sold media that alienating the gamers. As a guy out there said, Ubisoft is the new EA, but at least in my opinion, EA did and still does a great job with the series Need for Speed.  And I said.  ************************************************************************ I forgot to mention in the first cinematics when your friend gets shot in the back, watch your character, the guy who dubbed him is VERY BAD, I gave a lot of laughter in this scene, not to mention his appearance, it seems these fagot hipsters that is around, nothing to do with the game. What a joke.
11289	another bad driving game with terrible ubisoft-grade optimization
11290	This game does not run!
11291	The game becomes boring after a while, very repetitive
11292	Game deserves 0/10 For having MAJOR issues with running. But ubisoft got us used to that. I can't say nothing 'bout the gameplay or mechanics or anything because i've spent last two days trying to launch it. And I'm still trying. Got nothing better to do while waiting for a refund :( Sad thing is that it is not a fresh game, it should be fixed long time ago, before realease probably. Ubi took another warm â¥â¥â¥â¥ at their customers.
11293	i bought it and will monly let me play the trail version like what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
11294	No matter how much you enjoy racing games, this game is not worth it's full price. The same can be said for the new Calling All Units DLC.
11295	ive bought the crew wild run edition but in game it says i have to buy the wildrun dlc. how can i solve this? its a awesome game and i recommend it to everyone if the dlc stuff is fixed
11296	Horrid car reactions
11297	make you force buy DLCs since 2016 
11298	simple way to say this the game is a piece of crap
11299	launches game, rips hair out getting steering wheel to 'work' figured it out to be greated with a car that wont slide but washes out in every turn if you try to slide at high speed. closes game, launches grid, smiles from ear to ear. game has promise but ubi locked it away. more than likely wont play unless they update the handling. its sad that a 'next gen game' has worse handling than a 2008 game
11300	It's quite good.  BUT when I gonna level up to 25. connection lost and never get back to the game again.  Thanks .
11301	easily the worst arcade racer i've played. I usually have a tolerance for racing games, but the only and i mean ONLY redeeming quality of this game is map size.
11302	The final disappointing Ubisoft game for 2014. Had money ready to go from the moment I first heard of The Crew and have been eagerly awaiting its' release since.  *Review updated slightly on 12/07/2014 as I finished the game, Level 50, 36 hours play-time, ~$11,000 in the bank.*  PROS: + Incredible environment. One of the best in any game. + Awesome exploration opportunities with friends. + Cars look amazing.  CONS: - Customisation is nowhere as good as it was made out to be. Virtually no customisation for Raid or Circuit cars. No custom colour wheel, nor matte colours, and you can't change rim or sticker colours. - Money is a grind to lean you towards microtransactions. After 36 hours and only purchasing 4 cars, I have ~$11,000 to my name. The final Mission of the game rewards you with under $4,000. Most cars cost $200,000 to $1,000,000. - Awful catch-up/rubberbanding that can't be turned off. - Extremely repetitive races/Missions. Even the final Missions were exactly the same as every other Mission in the game, just with the usual different book-ended cinematics. - Missed opportunity for an amazing soundtrack.  NEEDS: = All cars need to be customisable for every Class, with fleshed out customisation options. = A Custom Paint Editor like the Forza games. = To have been made by Reflections. Buy Driver: San Francisco instead.
11303	Ubisoft gave me a hard kick in the balls for thinking i could play with my friends.  Best 49,99eur i've ever spent...
11304	The game has a number of pros and cons, but it should be clear that this game is not in any way a MMO. It is really a solo game with small opportunities to interact with other players if you choose to, but all in all it's a single player game.  Also, the selection of cars is small and of the cars that do exist, many have only a couple of spec options. For example, the only truck in the game has only two specs, dirt and full stock. Despite being the best suited vehicle for a raid spec, it has no raid spec. So you can't really drive the car you want in most cases unless you happen to need to use one of its limited specs. The starter cars all come with every spec, but every other vehicle seems to be far more limited.
11305	Its fun ill give it that, idk what i expected but from playing for about 3 hours i feel meh. ill play it some more then ill post a more in depth review
11306	Welcome to the worst game of all times!!!  There cars can fly, spawn and despawn in front of you! There cops can ram you but you can't even nudge them!  Quests that takes about 1h and then you dc before you've even hit the finishing line.  waste of money and waste of time.. thanks...
11307	*NOTE* This game is an awesome game. I reccomend it once this issue is fixed  I started playing it yesterday and I loved it. But, when I tried today, I got stuck on 'Loading Save Data' indefinately. So if you are gonna buy it, which I reccomend you do, buy it once this issue is fixed. Otherwise you will play it once and wait for Ubisoft to fix their â¥â¥â¥â¥
11308	Lied about the WHOLE MMO thing seriously it feels like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing singleplayer game. There is hardly anyone driving in the damn map  They mask AI BOTS to look like real people playing the game â¥â¥â¥â¥ car controls it swerves too much if you make a little turn you literally will crash into something LOL! Bad american cars Bad cars overall TOTALLY LIED ABOUT HOW YOU CAN JOIN A CREW AND RACE WITH THEM HAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT WORTH 60 DOLLARS ANOTHER UBISOFT FAIL!  5/26/2015 Updated  Still no changes Worst racing game ever impossible missions god mode AI cars
11309	ok lets see, this review is my own opinion and i dont care what others say.  game is nice, aspects are good, the choices makes it pretty lovely and the idea is nice  now for the downsides. 1- mechanics is bad 2- the car handling sucks 3- the over in everything they do  example: i know the cars are very strong and like that but whats the point in making the car spin while its accelerating at 120?!!!!!  also the car starts to donut before the wheel starts spinning?! CMON?  im not saying its a total bad game but 60% is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing too much. my advice?  buy need for speed hot persuit or rivals , i know it has way much less options than this game but atleast its fun to play.
11310	Don't Buy this game, you will just regret it, This Game is Pure Bad, i wish i didn't waste my money on the Gold edition, I mean Jesus the graphics are super outdated to current standards and there is no steam achivements, instead you are forced to creat a Uplay Account in order to play the game and the achivements are there which makes no sense,   Cons:  - only 40 cars &amp; Half of the cars are american - Really Bad Typical Story -Sluggish and Bad car phyics handling - rubberband Cops - there is Bronze, Silver and Gold parts upgrades which make it sometimes impossible to get the Gold upgrade unless you retry the Event about more than 15 times at least - Uplay account is required to play - No Offline mode, you can't play this game when the servers are down - No weather effect  - Limited customizations - Micro Transiction  Pros:  - Large Map - alot of Challenges despite the fact alot can be hard to get the gold upgrade though - You can play with friends, but that's if you are lucky you got one, it's fun cruising around the map with them  All in All Avoid at all Costs if you are going to buy it at full price, especially with the Gold Edition, it's price not worth what it has, it's up to you if you want to though, but you might regret it, trust me, Forza Horizon 2 Beats this game Miles ahead Out of the Water, and i bought Horizon 2 at Full price which i didn't mind because it was a Perfect Arcade racer for me and has alot of things that the crew didn't have (whicvh i think that the crew should've included some of these features)     
11311	This is horrible if you use key board and mouse. The missions are almost impossible because the car is hard to control and spins out randomly. So if you're like me, don't buy this game because it will be a huge blow. :(
11312	The last ubisoft game i will ever buy. I will not support a company that releases consistent crap.
11313	You have to buy the Wild Run in order to unlock the Drag racing Spec which is needed for Long Jumps skills. Therefore you cannot 100% with only the base game.   Pathetic.
11314	Not going to review the game as such, but I am going to say its unplayable because it crashes every 5 minutes.
11315	Tried a race where the car lays rubber in 4th gear at 130mph, cant keep the shiit on the road. Haven't these people drivin a car before. No car lays rubber in 4th gear in a straight line at 130mph on dry pavement. Forget getting on the gas out of a corner, cause it's gonna spin for about a mile and a half slip sliding all over the road. Try pedaling it to maintain control and the f ing AI blows by like your standing still... Got a G27 Racing wheel? Go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself! You'll have better control with a gd key pad! Its worth $30 not 60... and F**K UPlay.
11316	Great game, fun to play I really enjoy it. To bad I can not play it cause something is wrong with Uplay. Please for the love of god if you sell your games on steam keep them on steam. Do make me have to open your crap program, Ubisoft. Almost a week that I can not play because Uplay will not work
11317	Doesn't start up/crashes often.
11318	You can't drive to Canada very dissapointed
11319	You can't drive to Canada very dissapointed
11320	Look at my hours of gameplay.  2 of them were fun. Maybe. Ubisoft is horrible at making their online games make any sense. I often wondered if they tried to play their own game - seriously. The concept was amazing, but they dropped the bar. They did a bad job. I wouldn't buy this game for 5$ if I had to. It is that horrible. Just trust me - and all those other negative reviews.
11321	ERROR #0_35, Seems like 3/4 of the buyers get this problem. Can't even play the freaking game because everything is Online. And I can't connect to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥oft. Ubisoft should stop making games and stealing money. They never fix bugs. I've had the assassin creed unity Multiplayer bug for like sinds it came out. I swear to god I'm so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.   DON'T BUY THIS GAME You'l REGRET IT!
11322	Never buying a ubisoft game ever again. i can log in to uplay on google but when i start the game my password is incorrect when it is dam well correct, steam wont even refund it, i only played 4 hours. if a game is unplayable because of the company that created it and its nothing on my end they should have to refund. its not steams fault.... anyway f*** ubisoft
11323	This has to be the worst 'racing' game I have ever played. It has a large yet unexciting map, physics worse than Need for Speed, and an extremely random and pointless storyline. And when I say a pointless storyline, I mean it, as the entire story is about taking over the U.S. (It's a good game for North Korea). I cannot say much else about this game except that I despise of it and that I feel scammed, as the game is really worth about 20 dollars. 0/10 Would never want to whine over this game again!
11324	Don't buy this game, it is utter trash and a waste of the time it took to download and the space it used on my HDD, I would rather have bamboo shoots shoved underneath my fingernails than ever play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
11325	Worst piece of bullcrap i've ever seen. It's not even worth a potatoe.  Ubisoft, disappointing everyone as always.
11326	3 major problems they need to fix, which without them makes the game unless  1) Xbox 360 controller support is â¥â¥â¥â¥   I had to custom map all of the buttons on my wired xbox 360 controller to be able to use it, since it doesnt recognize the controler itself.. and since it doesnt recognize it, the steering is VERY touchy. very close to being unplayable  2) Uplay connectivity â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t   Feel like playing for more than a 30 minute session? to bad! you will lose connection to the Uplay server every 30 minutes, if you are lucky to survive a 15 minute session  3) Game crash galore   Did you accidently pull the cord on your controller, then bye bye The Crew, because it causes the came to crash. which makes complete sense (sarcasm)    If they fix the bugs, then sure. its a nice game. Until then, i want my $60 back.
11327	While this game was very much antisipated by myself and my friends alike we were all severely disapointed. This game is rated as a 'simulator' and while you can run a triple monitor surround with a stearing wheel (mine is the G27) with flawless rotation and actuation time from the game to the wheel there were several, and I mean several issues that I had hoped Ubisoft could have fixed because its not very difficult to fix but they are again just being lazy.   First off it doesn't seem to matter however you tilt my wheel to barely make a turn while letting off the gas the game refuses to understand basic physics, if I tap a car that I am passing you have a chance to get randomly thrown about 50ft and turned around or flipped in a wreck setting you back about 6seconds if you get the wreck cut screen, or depending on how bad it throws you 3-10 seconds.   Second, if you are driving a Raid vehicle (one designed for extensive offroad use) you can tap a small rock and while in real life even a four wheeler could easily go over this rock without any problems your high performance off road beast gets thrown around like a piece of paper in a air cannon.   Third, the game itself isn't consistant with what it tells you that your getting upgrades on. On my Zr1 Corvette set up for circuit I can be running 220+ miles per hour and turn my wheel and start drifting into a wall which then flings me 50ft (as stated before). I go out and find a mini game get a tire upgrade and kept playing until I got a tire upgrade with a grip upgrade in a gold metal (so I should have better grip with better tires now right?) Wrong. So very wrong. While I had the chance to go to Daytona Beach and drive a NASCAR through their training course you can pay for a day of training and drive with a co-driver, I was driving at 150mph. While driving my Corvette (after my tire upgrade) I hit the circuit and couldn't seem to keep a measely 200 mph when before I was easily holding 200 consitantly.   Fourth, this is a very minor gripe but a gripe none the less, while playing this game Ubisoft has put 'Gold Metal Cars' in during the mini game challenges while driving along the road. While I can be in front of this so called 'Gold Metal Car' and have a perfect score when time runs out I will complete it with a silver metal. What the f**k?   Though there is a few good points in the game, most of the stats for the cars (stock anyway) are pretty close to accurate in real life, and while the game doesn't give you a good perspective of how fast you are driving the acceleration is almost on point with most of the real life cars as well. Given that some cars are way off on their acceleration... (for a game that says its a simulation...)   This game could have been perfect... but then agian so could most of Ubisofts games that they refuse to do because every game that comes out has to be 'cenimamatic' and 60fps 'you cant see with your eyes anyway' yet you talk to anyone who messes with computers enough and they can tell you that they cant go any lower than 30fps even on just looking at the internet. I myself cant hardly watch movies in 30fps because it bugs my eyes. So everyone do yourself a favor and don't buy this. Get yourself a Xbox immulator download (yes you can get those) and buy forza horizon if our looking for a racing game.
11328	I really want to like this game. Seeing as I paid $59.99 for it. /sigh  There seems to be an empty feeling to this game. I've been playing everything solo and it's alright I guess. Was looking forward to 'running' into other drivers.  I was hoping I could actually 'tune' my car somewhat like nfs u2.   In this game all the parts you unlock simply get installed after beating a mission/race. I was hoping to take the car to shop and maybe purchase the parts myself.   Eh, it's not what I thought it would be but I'll still stick around. The races are fun even if it's just with the freaking AI.  Not worth the 59.99 imo.
11329	Don't buy this game, it is utter trash and a waste of the time it took to download and the space it used on my HDD, I would rather have bamboo shoots shoved underneath my fingernails than ever play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
11330	This has to be the worst 'racing' game I have ever played. It has a large yet unexciting map, physics worse than Need for Speed, and an extremely random and pointless storyline. And when I say a pointless storyline, I mean it, as the entire story is about taking over the U.S. (It's a good game for North Korea). I cannot say much else about this game except that I despise of it and that I feel scammed, as the game is really worth about 20 dollars. 0/10 Would never want to whine over this game again!
11331	updated review. having the season pass does not even get you their DLC the wild run, which is kinda bs seeing how it is just a slight reskin that adds really nothing that would not be suported in the game.
11332	Nice game but the cars Physix is totally fail
11333	I don't understand how the sale of this game isn't considered fraud.   If you buy the base game, you will lose $15 and after 2 hours of playing you will be FORCED to purchase 'The Run' expansion pack. You literally can't play anymore unless you spend more money. It's absolute horsesh**. Highway robbery. I payed for a racing game, and you didn't give me that.
11334	-Fix fps=game stuttering. With and without v-sync. In 30 and 60 fps. -Ubisoft optimization= 0  -Bad car physic, funny collision model.  -Bad Xbox 360 controller gameplay  +Ultra and high detail is not ugly. (To High settings: minimum i5, 8GB RAM, SSD -there will be problems and fps drops) +Big map  DONT BUY!!! Wasted Money!
11335	i cannot play the crew game. Its stopped working. Please help me.
11336	Do not spend your money in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t of game, the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, I can t even pass de 2nd mission because they want you to cross the hole city in 1.20 minutes and thats impossible and also they give you a car that is a COMPLETE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T to pass that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission you need a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing airplane the time they give you to complete the mission is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ i prefer not to play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T game if it would be a way to recover my money i ll recover it but no i buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T of game, so if you don t wanna burn your money do not buy this STUPID game i doesn t worth it
11337	This game sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11338	Over-hyped, over-priced, over-rated.  Customization is disappointing, game is repetative, radio stations have only a few songs, story is unimaginative.  Way to go Ubisoft
11339	easily could have been much better. the story felt recycled like every other racing game, the only saving grace of the game is the huge map i think more open world games should take off of this. the handling in game is terrible and pvp lobbys are unbalanced. another thing is missions depend on your car level if your car isnt the proper level no matter how good you race your gonna lose. and theres microtransactions overall i give it a 5.5/10
11340	is a epic â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, graphics like ps2, online? ye ye what ever u say bro
11341	-Fix fps=game stuttering. With and without v-sync. In 30 and 60 fps. -Ubisoft optimization= 0  -Bad car physic, funny collision model.  -Bad Xbox 360 controller gameplay  +Ultra and high detail is not ugly. (To High settings: minimum i5, 8GB RAM, SSD -there will be problems and fps drops) +Big map  DONT BUY!!! Wasted Money!
11342	Damn I failed to read the comment on this game everything about this game s mmo you start with low class stuff but who want to drive into walls and deal with OP boss car battles just for a better part, hell at least make the cars drive stock, there is no way a car now a days has bad tracktion or horrible handling, I dont think ill get a refund for this title. wasted time and money. Racing dreams crushed.
11343	Awful story, which does not really revolve around having a close crew, or cars themselves. It is a stupid revenge story with terrible dialogue.
11344	this game sucks â¥â¥â¥ 
11345	Awful. Cannot even connect to my friends which was the sole purpose. Trying everything i can to get a refund.
11346	So lets get this straight, this game is your average ''drive wherever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you want'', Don't misunderstand me, this game is entertaining, you have the whole U.S.A to run around, can drive into nice places, and if you want to chill out is a nice option to just get a car and make a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing road trip trough the route 66, BUT, as an AAA game this is not good, at all, pros and cons should be enough to demostrate you.  PROs:  -As I said, the ''whole'' USA as map. -You can set your cars to different settings (Off-road, Circuit, street...) and change it whenever you want, kinda original. -Hot hacker girl in your crew later in the game.  CONs:  -â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Uplay. -Microtransactions. -The hot hacker girl acts like a â¥â¥â¥â¥. -The campaign presents no challenge at all. (At least for me.) -Come the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on this is a game about driving why didn't you bother on programming pedestrians and animals to be runned over? Everytime you hit one they just warp/slide to the side of your car. -The crash system, holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ is it bad, it's a nice idea the regenerating thing, but it makes me feel that programmers just didn't feel like doing this propperly and slapped regeneration to your car. -The skill test things in the middle of the road, they begin to get annoying after you have accidentaly ran into one for the 400th time. -Not a big number of cars. -Dissapointing places. (Go to time's square and i think you'll feel me) -This game makes a ridiculous effort to look like an action movie. In every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission there's a plane or helicopter or something explosive that flies over you or adds a ''hollywood'' touch to it. It's nice to see it once. ONCE, not EVERY TIME. -Your car won't notice tearing a traffic light apart, but don't you dare hit some wooden fences. -PvP isn't really crowded i would say. -ALL the cars sound the same, just a different pitch. -Uplay. -I'm spanish, and the translation sometimes is awful. -The controls do really extrange things (turning more/less than what you'd expect and other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ts) -I almost forget about this one. The story. An undercover cop, HOW ORIGINAL.  There are a lot of othr things that somehow piuss me off but i won't spend my night writing this. I maintain this is an entertaining game, mostly for chilling out with a nice road trip, but as you can see, not anything else to offer.
11347	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game product keys dont work wasnt aware it was a ubisoft game there support tickets take forever to work and they dont even anwser questions
11348	This game is NOT enjoyable, the driving is terrible, the camera makes it worse.
11349	stupid story, ugly cities. runs for me only in demo mode
11350	The Game is a tipical example for pay to win games.  you have to pa money for 'buck' and new cars. this is not okay.  for 29.99$ i can buy bettery games loike drivers club, tdu or what erver. the second thing is taht the game is soooooooo dificult to dificult for normal players. i need 50 houers for one mission. the game is very bad. you need ervery time aa internet conection    the positive things are  that the map are very big and the graphi ia okay     Please DONT BUY THIS GAME
11351	The support for ubisoft was very useless when my game was bugged out
11352	not what i expected. wish i could have my money back.boring game.graphics not as good as expected either.save your money.
11353	The support for ubisoft was very useless when my game was bugged out
11354	server error server unavailable you can't play the game ubisoft service is poor
11355	This game is made to steal your money . the cars handling &amp; physics make straight line driving exstreamly challenging and crashing into A.I. traffic magnet car reactions! hitting anything causes you to spin uncontrollably! rubber banding A.I. racers and lack of cars to drive with out buying DLC is a joke.! if your looking for anything close to real life Cars / Driveing / racing - steer Clear of this Ripoff !
11356	i got this along time ago i tried starting it it said it has stopped working. i very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off right now.
11357	This game is okay, but if you have the same problem as me......DONT SUE ME
11358	cant get out of the trial version...bought the complete edition
11359	Fee to pay, nothing else needs to be said. Grinding multiplayer for money is no fun, and there is no way to redo the career story which was actually kind of fun in parts. Not recommended at all.
11360	They promised car customizing like no other game has ever seen. I buy a car and there are no options to change. One car had many options, however they all pretty much looked the exact same.  Racing is fun, however like others have said, the AI is crazy hard.  Pretty much all I did after finding out that the game has barely any customizing options, and racing was to crazy, I just free roamed and did the jump challenges.  I've got 10 hours on this game... That's how fast this game got annoying and boring.
11361	so the new dlc came out and i dont have it even tho i have the seaason pass they didnt give me the dlc thanks crew  
11362	THIS GAME, TOOK MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING 20â¬ WORTH DLC AWAY FROM ME AND WANTS ME TO BUY 'CALLING ALL UNITS' FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥ING 25â¬ TO GET WILD RUN DLC STUFF, WHICH I HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT!  Otherwise, unrealistic â¥â¥â¥â¥, if you want realistic open world street racing, buy Forza Horizon 3, it doesn't have motorcycles, but that's only thing this game is good.
11363	cant get out of the trial version...bought the complete edition
11364	I did not pay $40 for a waiting simulator. Fix the problems Ubisoft. I don't recommend this at all, you might be able to play for awhile but eventually the game will just stop loading/take forever and you will get stuck in unloaded parts of the map in the middle of races. I have tried everything and nothing works to fix these issues. I have never written a review, simply because I have never cared enough to do so. However, I am so angry and upset with Ubisoft because I have essentially 'donated' them $40. The issues are due to the coding of the game, and is in no way, shape, or form my computer or my internet. Look up 'map not loading on the crew' in google and browse the Ubisoft forums. This is a huge issue.  In short; if you want a 'Loading...' simulator, go right ahead and buy this game.
11365	the crew is a great game, honestly. but it fallwos the lack of hacing an actual crew and it simply plays and is a game just like burnout paradise city ect. It reallly isnt anything special just another racing game where there was way to much hype for. if your looking to buy a game for racing dont buy this one it wont make you happy expecially what you pay for.
11366	Fun game but ubisoft's â¥â¥â¥â¥ support makes it cancer and playing with a DS4 controller is cancer
11367	the crew is a great game, honestly. but it fallwos the lack of hacing an actual crew and it simply plays and is a game just like burnout paradise city ect. It reallly isnt anything special just another racing game where there was way to much hype for. if your looking to buy a game for racing dont buy this one it wont make you happy expecially what you pay for.
11368	Was a 3/5 game, now that you get performance parts minutely better than what is on your vehicle, i give it a 2/5. It makes pvp miserable because it now takes around a millenium to get your car fast enough to even compete with other people online.
11369	just bought it and after downloading I stared at the loading screen for 30 min and still nothing happened.
11370	After 157 hours they 'updated the game', which makes it unplayable for me.... Camera angle and what not....  The game itself 'Was' pretty fun and good... Before the patch i would recommend it, now don't bother.
11371	First, Off not been able to play it cause im lagging way to much on 30fps max Second,It wont let me change the buttons for each thing so thats sucks Third,I hear no one plays it anymore due to all the bugs so Please fix any bugs or I would Love a nice refund which i wont get due to the terms and conditions.Nice going fml
11372	I love'Racing' Games....but this game, to me,is Very Repetitive and Boring.
11373	UPDATE TO ADD VIDEOS UPDATE 5/6/15 now I get cops chasing me when I have no wanted level and cant seem to get a wanted level anymore. see in the videos below. Got this for the MMO factor expecting to see many other people and join there races but was dissapointed to only ever see 4 other people around me at one time and no one joining each others races. I finnished the story mode and had 1 race with other people. That race was a bust due to the high level troll that would wreck us so we would not finish first. This is the first 'MMO' I have ever been on where the chat box would have nothing said in it in the 28 hours I played.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8EVftHuRbU    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlxoKWC4NwE   Now I can surf my cars!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6SzXjOkouA   Adding hackers video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90856K3zqdc 
11374	Does not even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing load period.
11375	I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE FOR NOT LISTENING TO THE REVIEWS  I spent $60 on bulls**t. I couldn't even pass the first mission. It is nearly impossible. No matter how low the settings I put, the game starts to lag a lot. I was so excited, but turned out to be a bad experience. THANK YOU UBISOFT FOR MAKING ME WASTE $60 ON CRAP.
11376	compare this game to 2 old games, 'EURO TRUCK SIM 2' , &amp; 'just cuase 2' &amp; this game falls to shame. The plate # says 'THE CREW'. Side veiw mirrors from 1st person veiw is blanked out, &amp; 4 some reson 3rd person veiw it isnt. When u hit a stone, ur car over reacts &amp; jumps high in to the air, &amp; even that reaction is fake, (no physics). As u aproch objects (cars, buildings, ect.) details start poping in. Only reason i still play is beaucase i love racing and theres no other games on steam thats new. Overall for 2015 game 4/10
11377	What a joke. Good luck getting this game to play with all the crap you have to go through. After you do get it running you can't quit the game. I'll be getting a refund for this trash.
11378	Overall 6/10:  If you are looking for a game like Forza, this isn't it.  This game got boring pretty quick. THERE ARE ONLY LIKE 6 CARS TO CHOOSE FROM. I requested to get a refund so I could get a different racing game which doesnt have that. It was hard for me to get into this game and i'm glad steam incorperated the refund policy. The physics are pretty awful and there isn't a way to change your field of view which was kind of a let down. I also have a racing wheel that I used to use on my Xbox 360 but the controls were all messed up and I wasn't able to change the controls because it was showing up as an Xbox controller. I couldn't remap the gamepad controls which sucks because I couldn't use my racing wheel. Get the trial on UPlay so you can try it out and see if you like it before you buy it. This game wasn's an exception to Ubisoft's bad games they've been coming out with recently.
11379	ABSOUTLE TRASH AND IT FREEZES DONT GET IT 
11380	Uplay, ubisoft, all that. Yep.
11381	i played this game for 3 weeks. started to get into got some cars i really wanted. then it stoped working at all cant even open it waste of money. dont even bother. wait for the new need for speed
11382	Before writing my review, I have to mention that I got the game free with AC:U during their free giveaway program. I have also played several games from the NFS series among others and I am pretty good at driving games.   Regarding The Crew, the game visuals are good but I thought the dynamics were bad and the gameplay was also equally bad. The way you get your upgrades isn't very entertaining. I also don't enjoy the idea of micro transactions on a PC game forcing you to purchase stuff.  I was very tempted by the trailer and the concept of the game but had enough after trying the game twice.

11384	Worst game I have ever played so far
11385	*Buy the game for 30$* 'This is a trial version!' I wanna â¥â¥â¥â¥ing end you Ubisoft.
11386	THIS GAME.. i dont even know what to say. i spend a fortune on the pre-order. only game ive ever Pre-ordered and it will be my last. such high hope and promises given by Ubisoft. Without going into the numbers. i can easily say that i paid 4 times the price the crew is going for now. before the game was even released. to this day. ive never resieved any of my pre-order content and my DLC purchases were not complete. ive voiced my concernes and have had no success. not only am i dissapointed in the game. i cant even play it because of its incompatability with my Nvidia GTX 1080p Graphics card.
11387	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME! SEASON PASS NOT INCLUDED WILDRUN
11388	Online Play Could of Been Better.
11389	is anybody can help us? Ä± seen a offer 40 TL almost 15 Dolar for THE CREW original game. and Ä± bought it. but when Ä± enter the game it says need a activision code. Ä± only can play ''the crew wild'' run please somebody help me about that!  Ä± totaly confused.
11390	you cant escape the cops and the cars have the worst handeling ever
11391	Before writing my review, I have to mention that I got the game free with AC:U during their free giveaway program.

11392	Cannot run on window 10
11393	I bought The Crew, because it was the most appealing racing game to my personal tastes, from what I saw in pictures and videos. But I was kinda dissapointed after I played it, and discovered it better.  PRO: -huge open world. -nice graphics in general, even thou not the greatest ones in racing games.  CONS: -I know it's just an arcade game, not simulation, but the game has zero physics, it reacts very unrealistic to collisions / crashes, the car barely damages. -Bad and slow matchmaking system. -Very short and childish single player story. -Hard to understand all those car specs stuff. -Bad Weather system, you can barely see / hear the rain, and the road it's not totaly wet, only a few water puddles, here and there, no thunders. -AI annoying scripts, you have to replay a few times some races, because the computer cars will go killometers away from you, even thou you drive with no mistakes. -Bad car costumization system, compared to NFS Underground / Carbon series, you can't even buy performance parts, you have to obtain them via a stupid loot system. -vanilla The Crew, and Wild Run DLC, are in essence the same games, with a few additions to the latter one, but it doesn't worth the difference, should have been a tottaly free update, for those who bought the original game, it's not normally to buy The Crew with 30 euro, and then pay another 50 for a few additions.  and the list could continue...  I still recomand this game, in the hope that it will be improved in feature updates. If you are rich and don't have on what to waste money, buy it. If you are poor, save the money, and do anything else.
11394	I had fun for a little bit, for only about 3 hours.  Races are the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ thing I've ever experienced. A â¥â¥â¥â¥ing yellow pickup truck is driving 10x faster than a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Camaro. I like to listen to my own music in the background, but I can't. I start playing music then all of the sudden â¥â¥â¥â¥ing The Crew's volume blasts all the way up, nearly blowing my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing headset. Then there is this annoying ticking sound in the background and I can't get it to go away.  Also, the 'movies' are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying. Everytime I exit, or start a mission, I see these stupid cutscenes that I really don't care about.  I heard good things about this game from friends. I even bought the season pass. But I made the wrong choice in buying this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. I'll try to never play this game again.
11395	i paid 30 dollars for a demo. This game isnt even worth 30 dollars.
11396	compare this game to 2 old games, 'EURO TRUCK SIM 2' , &amp; 'just cuase 2' &amp; this game falls to shame. The plate # says 'THE CREW'.

11402	Worst game I have ever played so far
11403	the Graphics are beautiful and driving across the country to see different landmarks is awesome, but I would not recommend this game to many ppl because the game quickly gets frustrating due to the difficulty of some of the missions that you are forced to do. I don't like the xfinity speed challenges in the game either the speed challenge is alright but ubisoft should have left comcast out of the game. such advertising has no place in a video game. If I wanted to see an advertisment for them I'll turn the tv on and watch that all day.
11404	Worse than Assetto Corsa for driving physics and the AI is clearly f u c king broken. The fences that you can run over that bring you to nearly a halt? NOPE AI JUST KEEPS ON MAINTAINING SPEED. The races are a bit stupid as well. Your opponents... they do not act with anything resembling intelligence or honour.. The catch up system (if there is one) does not seem to work very well. In MATCHED CARS. ALL THE CARS ARE THE SAME. Off the line, they all disappear.. couple seconds later you go flying passed them all like they're standing still. wtf. Trying to knock someone out? Good f u c king luck. You'll miss, or think you t-boned them... but the collision registers as them hitting you, thus doing no damage. Only time the AI acts smart is on the ones when you have to chase or be chased. F u c king stupid waste of money. Also, CUT SCENES. OH MY F U C KING GOD CUTSCENES. Acting so bad @_@ I do not need a cut scene to bring my car in and out of a shop EVERY F U C KING TIME. I do not need to act like an unsafe d o u c h ecanoe by doing a burn out in every shop. I CANNOT do a rear wheel burn out in a FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CAR. My Skyline does NOT have a V-6 or V-8, it's a straight six you stupid auto-illiterate f u c kwits. please unrelease this game, do more homework, and rerelease it as something better than very pretty turbo garbage with a very â¥â¥â¥â¥ story. Take a note out of TDU2's book. Yeah no you aren't censoring this review, my language reflects just how poorly I think of this game after playing some thousands of hours in both real world racing and in games.   Beat the story (if you want to call it that) It doesn't get any better. Next up: GRIND MONEY AND PARTS TILL ALL CARS OWNED. Same skills over and over again to get car parts and money. Faction missions take upwards of an hour, and pay out about 75k.
11405	TLDR Dont buy this garbage of a game... wait for NFS to come to PC  This game is garbage.... How you gonna promise vast multiplayer and deliver jack â¥â¥â¥â¥. Plus you sold season passes and didnt put out with any worthwhile DLC, now that there is a game changing DLC you're charging us???????? â¥â¥â¥ you mean bruh?  If I didnt have a virtual copy of this game i woulda sent you this â¥â¥â¥â¥ back wrapped in dog â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11406	This game was very good But it no longer seems to work for alot of people and its BS i want my money back or someone fix this bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ i cant even launch the game ffs
11407	I used to have a positive thumbs up review on this game, but this was all before the Wild Run update.  The so-called 'next gen' update to the game's graphics engine is a horrible decision. The game has not been updated in any meaningful way, it simply had its color saturation toned down, brightness turned way up and a few 'wet surface' effects were added, much like a cheap, terrible-looking ENB preset.  The new visuals simply look washed out and suffer from immense color burn from the overbright settings and dull color toning.  I am sorry but the game is essentially ruined for me as I primarily enjoyed cruising around for the sights.
11408	How to fix my game from crashing? 
11409	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF U DONT HAVE 100000000000$ Cost Computer..!
11410	I loved this game, but one day I got on and saw all the motorcycles that I had bought were gone, they just up and walked away. Honestly a waste of money, but don't let me tell you how to live your life.
11411	Why i can't launch The Crew?? My PC can support it but still can't open it
11412	Bought this game at launch and put about 20 minutes into it before I moved on but decided to retry recently and within my 40 minutes of gameplay the game has crashed 5 times. Internet search says newer GPUs have this issue and dev has not (cared enough to?) patched. Can't recommend until a fix is in place. Can't give proper input until I can actually play the game.
11413	PVP is broken... nobody sticks to the track pointless

11419	How to fix the the crew stopping working problem!?
11420	Great game if it didn't crash everytime you played it with in 5 to 10 minutes. Also no technical assistance via the phone. And after working with customer assistance and trying to trouble shoot it on my own still the game will not play without crashing. Hopefully I can get a refund and they don't hold the time I spent trying to trouble shoot against me...
11421	the game is so bad u keep lossing connection with the sever   u can't play the game u can't find some 1 to run with  it suck 
11422	i bought the full Crew Wild Run game and it gives me the demo i want the real game
11423	This game sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I spent $60+ on it, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing waste of cash.

11429	Unfortunately I had to change my review.. In the beta I thought this game was amazing, but after release and many hours of frustration I have to say it's not worth the money..      Here's a short list of issues I've found with the game:  â¢ Disconnects â¢ Crashes(the program kind) â¢ Multiplayer issues â¢ Robo Cops â¢ Game Isn't Optimized â¢ Broken Fast Travel System â¢ Terrible Traffic AI â¢ Customization    And this isn't just me either. If you look at the support forums you'll see dozens of posts all about the same stuff.  â¢ Disconnects: Periodically you will complete a mission or objective and will be disconnected from server and will not get credit for the mission. Especially annoying when partied with someone since it's a pain you have to do it over but also cause its a pain to even party with others in the first place.  â¢ Crashes: Occasionally while in certain menus (mainly the car collection board) or even just driving the game will crash and freeze. It won't kick you out of the game, and you can't alt tab so you'll have to hit ctrl alt delete and force it to shut down.  â¢ Multiplayer issues: The main part of the hype of this is it's multiplayer, but it's garbage.. Most of the time you try to team up with your buddies it won't work and you'll both end up restarting the game half a dozen times just to get connected and THEN it will crash or freeze and you'll both be back at it again. There can also ONLY be a small handful of people in YOUR instance of the game at a time. Making it very frustrating to find people to actually play with. It's not like you'll see 100s of people all over the map. You'll only ever see like 6ish. I waited in queue for 4hrs to do a pvp mission and the most that ever joined was 5/8 so that never happened.. On a side note I saw a funny signature on this one guy in the support forums. It said: 'Never play alone! Unless you're playing The Crew...'  â¢ Robo Cops: Missions that require you to escape from cop swarms or misc swarms of other cars are incredibly frustrating sometimes and others are just ridiculous cause the AI is ******ed.. They move around like insects instantly turning and accelerating all together like they're literally a swarm of insects.. It's more like escaping the hive mind and right when you think you're going to get away another cop will spawn right in front of you..  â¢ Game isn't optimized: Alt tab while the game is running and you'll understand.. Even though my cpu is only at 15% and memory is at 55%, if I'm alt tabbed while this is running just surfing the web is like running at 1 frame a sec, and my rig (not to brag) is very good. When I tested it after putting it together I ran Crysis3, Borderlands2, 20 tabs on Chrome, Avatar in 1080P, WHILE running Prime 95 to max out the cpu and I was STILL able to use any one of those previous mentioned programs with no issues.. Let alone 1 frame a sec web browser like I get with this..  â¢ Broken Fast Travel: Welcome to The Crew!! One of the largest racing worlds you'll have the pleasure of NOT driving.. If you've played Skyrim or other similar games you know what fast travel is.. Basically lets you teleport to landmarks you've previously discovered.. Very handy feature. IN THIS THOUGH; You can do the same, but you can also teleport to any inch of the map where the fog has been removed, not just landmarks. You can actually use this to continuously teleport to the edge of your view range over and over to travel even to places you haven't been yet which defeats the whole purpose of having this beautiful world to explore.. So unlocking hidden items in the world isn't about explorations, it's just about how quickly you can keep hitting select, click bout a mile away(your view range is bout 1 mile), click fast travel, hit select, clicked 1 mile away, click fast travel.. You can unlock pretty much every hidden item or location in the game in the matter of an hour or two.. Not only does it ruin the experience for yourself but if the masses are doing this too they'll also be ruining it for themselves too, get bored, and move on to something else too.. The fact that they make cheating an option is just going to hurt the game in the long run. Lowering the player base (If all the other issues don't tick everyone off enough to quit first.. ).  â¢ Terrible Traffic AI: You can actually SEE the traffic just randomly spawning in front of you.. It's so disgusting to watch.. You could drive down a road that is completely empty then turn around and drive the other way and all of a sudden its just packed on both sides with dozens of cars.. Or in once instance of a race that had laps on a set course had like maybe 2 cars driving down the road and then on the next lap not only where there dozens of cars in the road but both sides of the street were packed with parked cars too! It was like 30 second laps for christ sake.. The game has no memory of traffic. It literally just throws random crap in front of you while you're driving.. The worst part is you can actually see them popping into existence. Not fading, not growing.. Just POP there's a car..   â¢ Customization: There's hardly any.. One of the big hypes of this game is customization to feel original or stand out (like it would even matter if you could stand out cause most likely you won't be seen by anyone else anyways cause the multi is so limited. I think they said only 8 people per server? I maybe wrong though. It might be like 12.. ) If you played Most Wanted and expect this game to have that much customization you'll be very upset, and if you liked Forza's customization you'll think this game is garbage. There's hardly any decals, you cant change the color of them, can't resize, and can't move them. Of the decals you have you'll only use the half a dozen that actually look good. NOT all cars can be all specs. You've probably seen how there's all these specs like: street, dirt, performance, etc.. Of the bout 50 cars, there's probably only 5-10 cars that can be each spec, and some of the specs you can't change the body at all, and others maybe have like 1 or 2 alternate pieces you can change out. It's just overall really disappointing..   I really tried to like this game. I even bought the more expensive package and put a good amount of time into it during beta and release, but I finally asked myself.. WTF am I playing this for.. And just moved on to a differ game.   Also, any feedback or arguments on any of these issues is welcome.
11430	TRASH TRASH TRASH TRASH, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing online dont work, could not play a single PVP yet and i finished the game. I just bought to play with friends and they cant connect.  Thank you for existing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, Hamachi, Tunngle. Here we go, bye bye ubifkers
11431	This game is laughably pathetic and ment of kids who have never driven a vehicle in their ENTIRE life. Wish I could get a refund from Ubisoft. Just awful 3/10
11432	Its not an MMO at all. Car handling is not good, the AI is always in the god mode, like the police cars are the fastest in game and they have the weight of a truck when it comes to crushes. Its stupid. They even dont need the customization for dirt, they are just best in every situation except some long, straight asphalt roads which they magically stop unrealisticly, making you win the mission or run away freely without any hard tries. Soooo unbalanced.  And seriously, its not a MMO at all. You have to be online all the time -btw servers are not stable especially when it comes to pvp- but all you see is another person driving 45 km ahead, or you see 2-3 people on the map but thats all. You rarely get pass anyone, if you want to race with other people you have to wait at least 15 min and if someone have a bad upload speed the race will be laggy as hell. Oh, did I mention there are soooo little variety of cars? All the things in the trailer is a lie. Don't get me wrong, its not an awful game, but its not they told us to be. Not at all.  Its just not worth the money.
11433	Waited a while for this game. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥. Example. $88,000 for a car, yet you only get like $200 if you win a race/event? lol. This will take forever. I figured I could launch the game, basically pick from more than 4 standard cars, and be able to completely customize it.. but nope, gotta unlock all that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t too... Not to mention you can only choose from like 6 different color cars? Hell. Need for speed world is free, and is a lot more customizable. I also hate the fact that it seems hardly anybody is playing this game even though it's only a couple days old. I've found 1 match against other players. The rest of the time, there is never a co-op found.
11434	Very broken, yet to be able to play it
11435	i cant even play the game. i never write reviews but this has to be the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest release ever. 2 days after release and still cant play.
11436	-Beatiful game with breathtaking scenery.  -Nice looking cars, though not many (surely to be more as lolDLC or the incoming cash shop).  -The Writing/Story, while you wouldn't expect much from a racing game, is some of the worst I've ever experienced in a video game. It's on par with NFS: The Run level of bad.  -Handling is terrible at first, but gets better as you level (noticed it getting better at around level 15 or 20). The game is painful to play until that point.  -SERIOUS AI rubberbanding issues. You can pull ahead by 5 seconds no problem, only to be passed shortly after, and the AI proceeds to pull 800 yards away and stays there.  -Players and the AI dont play by the same rules. AI can either come to a near complete stop around turns you're nearby, or can fly through a 1-lane right angle turn at 80 MPH when you're 200 yards away or more. Meanwhile, every car you drive drives like it's on ice, losing traction at every single concievable possibility of a change in momentum, no matter how small, until you level up and hit that 15-20 mark.  -NoS is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. it breaks traction no matter how high your grip or level is, making it impossible to handle the car, and you dont get traction back till you let off the NoS. It's also handled in a dumb way, as it refills NFS:MW (original) style, in that it just magically refills over time.  -Cops have near infinite mass and can send you spinning like a helicopter with a simple love tap. You, however, can t-bone a cop at 180 MPH, and be completely stopped in the span of about 10 feet. You have only 1 second (not an exaggeration) to pull away once stopped, which is extremely difficult because you cant just slam on reverse and then slam on the gas. you have to slam on reverse, lose traction (no choice, no way to keep it from happening), pray you're not on dirt (even in dirt spec), and hit 30 MPH all in a single second. Then you have to spin around, and wait a second while the game takes it's time shifting from reverse to first.  -AI in races also have infinite mass. They are unaffected by street lights and fence posts, but hitting 2 fence posts brings you from 180mph to 150mph  -The devs dont know how to make race tracks for â¥â¥â¥â¥. They have all of the U.S. to work with, and they wanna throw you through dirt in a performance spec, or put you on asphalt for a while in raid spec. Random turns out of nowhere you cant anticipate all over the place. Understandable on street spec and raid specs where races are slower, but to throw a right angle turn at you in perf spec at 170mph is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid.  -Ubisoft totes it as CaRPG/Racing MMO, but just feels like an always-online single player racing game. Server size/player-region density is agonizingly small. The U.S. is split into 5 regions, and each region has maybe 6 people including yourself at any one time.   All the negatives pile on into one big pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. 4/10    UPDATE  Has city of Nashville, TN, but no batman building  0/10. Do not buy.    ***UPDATE 2***  Stopped playing on Dec 16th 2014, tried playing again on Jan 31st 2015. Game had an update but none of the issues I mentioned were fixed or changed. It's clear the DLC was created when the game was made, and stripped out to sell later. Ubi never intended for this to be a decent game. They just wanted to release it, stagger the DLC, and leave it to die. Stay far away from this game.
11437	Great game until you complete the main story. After the story, the game runs dry with fun content. It turns into farming money and doing the same skill races to buy and upgrade cars. Although, the graphics are great, I have had some problems with connectivity. After finishing a mission in coop we sometimes get kicked and have to redo the entire race.
11438	This is really awesome game BUT TILL THEY FIX THEIR STUPID â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UPLAY SERVERS OR JUST MAKE IT OFFLINE GOD DAMN IT.  + Awesome Game - You can only play it online which is suck.  MAKE IT OFFLINE MODE FFFFUUUUUUUU UPLAY ****** **** **** **** **** ***** **** *****
11439	I would like it if it would launch.
11440	who ever designed the diffuclty for police, is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Police cars are so fkn stupidly over powered.   fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ networking issues that you have with connectivity of sessions and players not being about to join crews... We paid so much for the game atleast make the damn effort to sort the issues. Your First update was 'addressing' those issues but its still having problems
11441	Can't form a crew in The Crew.  10/10
11442	Should be $19.99 not $59.99.  Idiotic missions, rediculously bad characters, and car handling that feels more like a jetski than a vehicle with four tires attached to the ground. It's a twenty dollar game.
11443	this game is great. have have played this game for many hours but now i cant even open the game it just stays that the crew game has stopped working. plzzzzz help if somone knows how plzzzzzzz  
11444	Has so much potential as an open world racing game experience but is ruined by game breaking bugs and developers that just dont seem to care.   Buy if you like open world racing games but be prepared for some infuriating glitches
11445	Crashes, server issues, lack of vehicles, confusion, glitches, broken fast travel... terrible game
11446	Ridiculous how Ubisoft attempts to make ends meet in terms of capital making it's new DLC directly unavailable even for those who trusted in the company and bought the Season Pass long time ago. Ubisoft, you just lost countless consumers with this petty maneuver.  RidÃ­culo como Ubisoft tenta fazer as contas baterem tornando a nova DLC diretamente indisponÃ­vel atÃ© mesmo para aqueles que confiaram na empresa e compraram o Season Pass hÃ¡ muito tempo. Ubisoft, vocÃª apenas perdeu inÃºmeros consumidores com esta manobra mesquinha.
11447	If you like racing games where the physics arn't quite realistic or arcade style, and feel like just a jumbled pile of trash, Then this is the game for you!  For serious though. When turning, it feels like your tires are made of sponge or something. Or as if they are just all half flat. You can't drift worth **** with any car type, and the camera is just awful. It seems like they tried to make the camera look in the direct it thinks you want to drive toward, but always over shoots. So when ever you turn your always looking past where your wanting to turn towards. Especially when your moving more slowly, which makes getting out of a pile-up absolutly horrible.  I would honestly have GTA 4 Car physics over this. Also, tuning your car is nothing like you would expect. Its extreamly linear, with a menu that makes it look Open-ended.  One last note, you can't effectivly play this game if you have a life outside of your computer. It just takes too long to get/do anything.
11448	Can't join crews, invisible walls, police cars are like brick walls. Would like my $80 back tbh.
11449	Don't buy this game.  Why?  1. Its Ubisoft so the game was not ready in the first place. 2. Most cars handle like hoverboats. 3. Its not an MMO. 4. Instable servers.
11450	Game crashes, bad physics, using a wheel is bad and the full map looks unfinished. The whole game looks unfinished. It is fun and engaging but it looks only paritally finished. Not worth the money or effort.
11451	what an awful game, ubisoft is why people pirate stuff 0/10
11452	PLEASE NO MORE RECHARGING NITRO... I get the feeling the public wanted something more realistic... Like Gran Turismo... but Free Roam... Deep customizable cars, Hard Core tuning. You have to buy parts instead of being given them... Mountain drifts... pink slip racing... drags... and NO MORE RECHARGING NITRO....   Make us go to the shop and refill it... hell... make us go to the shop and get more fuel  The crew is.... a fun game... i enjoy it... but it is not what I am looking for. I still want something to fill the void since NFS: Underground 2  the game is Acrade at best and might as well change its name to 'Ridge racer'
11453	Can't join crews, invisible walls, police cars are like brick walls. Would like my $80 back tbh.
11454	Don't buy this game.  Why?  1. Its Ubisoft so the game was not ready in the first place. 2. Most cars handle like hoverboats. 3. Its not an MMO. 4. Instable servers.
11455	Nothing better than finally winning a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ race and ubisoft telling you it has lost connection somewhere during it and you have to do the race again
11456	It's clearly not a perfect game, but I do like a lot of what if offers..  My problems so far is a couple hard crashes Many ( MANY ) loss of connections right after winning a race, thus losing the progress ( F that! ) Several times where my mates are invisible ( just see the name moving around ) and we had to enter race for them to become visible ( they couldn't see me either ) Cops tends to stop and just stay idle ( ??? ) And a couple of times the world have just frosen, so all civilian cars doesn't move, heck even windmill stands still ( but birds still fly around )  So once more an unfinished Ubisoft game ( no surprise when they don't dare send out review copies ) - but still not a terrible game - just don't expect more than mediocracy!  The best parts IMO is the large world and the fun coop campaign..  The worst is the tech issues and the lacking graphics ( looks like a PS3 game most of the time )  All in all a 7/10 and that is IMO not a game worth recommending in the current state despite it's positive sides!
11457	Full of bugs 
11458	The game has potential... however Ubisoft is so terrible its laughable. Expect the dumbest things to happen at THE WORST TIME POSSIBLE. Just finished a one hour long.... ONE HOUR LONG faction race only to have the game tell me there is a problem with the ubisoft servers AFTER I FINISH the race. Guess what? Ubisoft is so f****** s**t that I didnt get any progress or money for the race. 1 hour wasted doing an extremely repetitive, menial task only to have NOTHING GAINED. (i did win the race so i should i got a prize). Microtransactions are also BS... #PayToWin
11459	If you like racing games where the physics arn't quite realistic or arcade style, and feel like just a jumbled pile of trash, Then this is the game for you!  For serious though.

11460	The setup was awful, it kept insisting that I was running a trial version. Plus the lack of controller support is just another piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to added to the pile.
11461	Not worth full price, controls are clunky, speed is blown out of proportion. Essentially a cash grab by Ubisoft.
11462	Good potential.
11463	Do not support this rippoff business:  The Crew meanwhile comes in several editions.  Normally Season Pass gives you all, here season pass did not give you wild run, complete gives you base/season pass content and wild run in the wild run or complete edition?  Does not mind as whatever you got with all content there, nov 2016, new dlc is upcoming, whoever owns 'all' content will not own 'all' then. )  Crap shady business.
11464	The map shown when you first enter the game looks like about 90 or so players are on, then you get in and there is 1 player per each city.   gg
11465	bugs. no physic. few cars
11466	i canot keep control off the cars, ther spin out off control for no reason!!  I spant 3 hovers to try set the staring control!! :( I a fan off Need for Speed ,but this is not much fun! I olso spant the $90 on the Gold adition ,nawer going to pree order!! Now is only $40 for the same Gold adition!!!!  What a vast of monny! and is dosont run on Steam!!! is runs on Uplay! :(
11467	You know you've made a good game when the players receive more frustration than entertainment. 11/10
11468	this game is dead , nice visuals but boring story and 0 online and cooperative not very interesting
11469	Unplayable. Can not change FOV, slider is greyed out. View seems to be optimized for 2'-Screens...

11471	Unplayable. Can not change FOV, slider is greyed out. View seems to be optimized for 2'-Screens...
11472	Great game. The only issue that I have is that some of the missions are literally impossible because they do not give you enough time, or the car that is given to you (for the missions where you are forced to use a car) are too slow to reach the checkpoint, to catch up to the NPC car you are supposed to wreck, or to evade the cops. I literally cannot advance in the story mission because the Ironclad Dash mission doesn't give you enough time or the car is not fast enough at the start to get you through the checkpoint fast enough. It is literally impossible to complete that mission as it stands. If they fix this, I will change my review and recommend it.
11473	Too quick of a game to beat and I guess it was meant to be played with PvP mainly. This is WHEN Uplay is up and running for the game. If it isn't up you aren't playing. Just too much money for what it is worth.
11474	Game is very short lvl 50 cap not much to do after also the microtransactions ruin trying to get money legit
11475	You know you've made a good game when the players receive more frustration than entertainment. 11/10
11476	bugs. no physic. few cars
11477	when it will be 5â¬ i will get it, 30 and 15â¬ its too expensive for a game by UbiCr@p
11478	wtf is tis â¥â¥â¥â¥?
11479	The Crew? More like The Lonely
11480	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥... 
11481	This is actually a good game, what i love from this game mostly because the game world that is very huge and i really enjoy exploring the game world, however, this game has a lot of problems - This game is always crash to desktop every 10-30 minutes when play. - The AI is extremly dumb but i think Ubisoft encounter this by making the AI somewhat overpowered. - Very weird and bad physic, for example the vehicle handling is really bad and most of the time the handling makes the car want to drift and when you jump your car from a cliff you gonna feel that there is a 10 ton car is falling from the sky ( i mean the car fall down really fast and for me, that's strange), and the damage model is somewhat fixed. - This game for me doesn't encouraging to making a crew and even i wanna make a crew with my friend, i can't join my friend for no ****ing reason. That's what i think what's bad about this game, but the multiplayer is fun, and as describe above, the open world is fun to explore, but i don't really recommended to play this game even to people who loves racing games.
11482	worse driving game ever dont buy its a waste of money

11485	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, the game crashed and you can't restart your profile!!
11486	ITS GOOD BUT I HAVE BUY IT BUT IT SAYS EVERY WHERE BUY FULL VERSION 
11487	itz â¥â¥â¥â¥ there are no horses
11488	Yup... big map... but don't even think about getting some kind of simulation... the cars behave like ****...  Couldn't play more than 3 hours ... I think it's clear enough... Story just is boring right from the beginning...   DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE... :(
11489	1. Multiplayer is not working. 2. Takes 1 min inorder to lunch the game 3. The game is not smooth 4. The trialer is something and when you play is something else 5. I dont recommend this game as it is expensive it is just woth $10
11490	itz â¥â¥â¥â¥ there are no horses
11491	False alarm...after another idiot on here was kind enough to mention, it isnt the games fault. it was however an nvidia driver issue and i had to roll my gpu driver back. then it fired right up, idk if it was fixed from nzxt but the hue+ cam software also made this game crash...thnx M4rk...now dont turn blue on all that â¥â¥â¥â¥ your choking on okay buddy?
11492	ITS GOOD BUT I HAVE BUY IT BUT IT SAYS EVERY WHERE BUY FULL VERSION 
11493	This game might me good but i would never know because it crashes on startup.
11494	WOW!  Controller does not work on this game.  I ain't using my keyboard for driving.
11495	DONT BUY THIS GAME IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!
11496	This game worked fine on my laptop. but now I just play it on my computer. it crashes every 10 minutes and in the middle of missions. It makes the game almost unplayabe. I'm not changing my rating for this game until this gets fixed. other than that its a good game.
11497	Game crashes on lauch and no way to fix it So i refund ;]
11498	False alarm...after another idiot on here was kind enough to mention, it isnt the games fault. it was however an nvidia driver issue and i had to roll my gpu driver back. then it fired right up, idk if it was fixed from nzxt but the hue+ cam software also made this game crash...thnx M4rk...now dont turn blue on all that â¥â¥â¥â¥ your choking on okay buddy?

11500	Pretty bad... It's a trial version and not evend told about it... Sucks.
11501	Yup... big map... but don't even think about getting some kind of simulation... the cars behave like ****...  Couldn't play more than 3 hours ... I think it's clear enough... Story just is boring right from the beginning...   DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE... :(

11503	the game wont even start up
11504	This game did not provide anything worthwhile, it was a lackluster in the MMO dept, as well as making a series of very boring 'experience gaining' missions, [drive left, right left right left right] finish. That's this entire game, a lackluster of multiplayer and was not enjoyable, not to mention very poor customer service.
11505	i would like for it to work
11506	False alarm...after another idiot on here was kind enough to mention, it isnt the games fault. it was however an nvidia driver issue and i had to roll my gpu driver back. then it fired right up, idk if it was fixed from nzxt but the hue+ cam software also made this game crash...thnx M4rk...now dont turn blue on all that â¥â¥â¥â¥ your choking on okay buddy?
11507	The only reason I'm rating this down is because of the dlc they are overly expensive ððð
11508	WORST CRAB IVE'D EVER SEEN, THE GAME CAN'T EVEN START WITHOUT CRASHING
11509	the game wont even start up
11510	WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  Otherwise your buying ERROR Fliping #0_13 just got conned Â£12.49 by them :/
11511	I got this game expecting it to run on my high end gaming laptopwhich it does.... for about 5 minutes then crashes i have gone through tech support through ubisoft and they just said it was never optimised for gaming laptop hardware. I see a big issue with this because I can run every other game on highest detail max cpu usage everything and have yet to have issues with them but this onehas dropped the ball hard on they're hardware support. I love this game i play it all the time at my brothers, so thats why i got it for pc, I have a gaming laptop built for high detail games i should not be having these kind of issues. But in short It is a great game just Ubisoft has just got to work on thier hardware support Because its ridicilous.
11512	Game is good, but you cant play multiplayer, im see players only when i start game and at LVL 0!  Now when i got 7 LVL i cant see any player at server and map, and i cant invite my friend to Crew, its alawys say 'You are not in Crew' or '???? is already in Crew'   What the â¥â¥â¥â¥?  Stealing money for stupid singleplayer on big map.....
11513	I would give a really good review if i could, but as it stands i can not, the game spasms a lot when driving, there is never anyone in my sessions, i dont have any steam friends who even own the game, so i cant even form a crew, some of the missions i cant do without others help, especialy the cop ones, i also have trouble with the steering wheel, and i use a fanatec wheel, it jerks out of my hands when forcefeedback isnt even high and it hurts my wrists really bad, i also hate the fact the adjustments hardly do anything to make using a steering wheel better, Also the clutch system does not work, i can shift the cars without using the clutch and i have auto clutch disabled, so thats a big major problem.. soo unrealistic that way.. wish the game was better than it currently is, i expected much more, But ill still play it if i can find more players that will play with me, add me Crew Players! ~Maibu~
11514	  You NEED either a driving wheel or some super rad timing skills to manuver the cars in this game because most of the activities are time trials where if you make one misteak you get NOTHING. I couldnt even complete the storyline. I will admit i sucked at this game, but its the only game ive ever played where driving was the sole purpose. Because its online, there is no difficulty settings and so you get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked by the bots.  If you are good at driving games then you will enjoy this game, but if you have never played a racing game with a keyboard before- prepare to spend alot of time gettings good at the driving and then suck the next day because you forgot the milliseconds of responce and patience you need to play this game. The Graphics are not what i expected... Not bad but hard to run.
11515	Car handling is terrible. Your opponents turn with full speed perfectly but if you try to slow down and take a turn you still go into the walls... Overpowered opponents everywhere.
11516	My game has crashed multiple times. Game runs like garbage. Amazing car list and the map are the only positives.
11517	Still having problems. Every time i try and start the game it sends me to uplay, than a message pops up saying uplay is having conection isuess, and thats as far as i get. Any ideas would help.

11520	its made by and runned by u play which â¥â¥â¥â¥s up do not buy
11521	This has to be the worst game ever.  Bought it, installed it, started it, played for maybe 2 minutes ... crash. Tried reinstalling and updating graphics drivers ... crash. Tried reinstalling the game .. crash. Bought a new computer, installed it, tried to start it ... won't even launch.
11522	I KNOW I DID NOT HAVE TO PAY $30 JUST FOR A TRAILER I WANT MY $30 ON MY STEAM ACCOUNT!
11523	MOST â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CONTROLS . can't even use my controller so I'm stuck using the keyboard. Doesn't have an 'OPTION' for controllers/gamepads and such. waste of money, waste of time blah blah blah blah blah . â¥â¥â¥â¥ the person who made this pice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and plz DON'T BUY THIS GAME. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME
11524	the driving in this game is terrible, if youre looking for forza, this isnt it.
11525	game sucks you make 20 min missions with your crew and after than one of 2 get a message, you have a problem with your network blabla bla.. give my money back **** this game! &gt;:(
11526	Worst 60 dollers i ever spent on a game. and i bought the gold edition wich was 80. to be honest I really wanted to like this game. But its complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ the driving feels AWFUL and npc and just everything about this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ except the map wich is why i bought it. the campaign its painful to play through and i still cannot find the strength to finish it. But the driving in this game is what really pisses me off. ITS SO BAD and the whole game is about â¥â¥â¥â¥ing driving. Save your money on this one guys I shure wish I had. Also i played it on ps4 also and its not much better. Now that im done ranting about how bad the main mechanics of the freaking game are. The map is honestly incredible the always online thing i dont really care that much about but if gta 5 was built around this map It would probably be the best open world game ever. If they had planes and like a freaking gta but with this map. and if the world looked alitlle better it would be amazing. just a big island of america. But back to the game the final verduct is dont buy it. The map can be fun to explore but the driving mechanics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ npc's and â¥â¥â¥â¥ and glitchy and ive also come arcross abunch of other random glitches from falling through the map from the race not counting my laps from being throne across the map because i colided with another raceing npc while in campaign. OH and one more burn on the gameplay if you dont come in first in every race in the campaign u cannot even finish the race enless you come in first. And just abunch of other dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this game. Just dont buy it k it really sucks â¥â¥â¥. like senpie  have a good day.  dont buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  senpie suck my â¥â¥â¥
11527	This has to be the worst game ever.  Bought it, installed it, started it, played for maybe 2 minutes ... crash. Tried reinstalling and updating graphics drivers ... crash. Tried reinstalling the game .. crash. Bought a new computer, installed it, tried to start it ... won't even launch.
11528	â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11529	Absolute garbage, unplayable with all these crashes, otherwise nice game.
11530	plz help im stuck on this preforming first time setup .... (step 1 of 1 ) how do i play the game
11531	I cannot launch the game due to the Uplay account activation being unavailable
11532	I paid $60 for a game that has trouble loading 80% of the time...not my computer either, I've read about other people having the same issue. I wouldn't buy this game over again, and I can't say I'd recommend it.
11533	I Pre-Ordered this game (complete with DLC Season Pass), thinking it would be the 'killer app' for NFS. I also had the opportunity to get access to a weeklong beta preview (which I did a few videos on). The first three days of its release, I streamed all my gameplay on Twitch - that later got ported over to Youtube. I thought this game was awesome, the sh!t, the bomb, whatever.  I was wrong.  Three days of gaming, and I had already beaten the campaign, made it to Level 50 (which is the maximum level you can reach), and complained like a motherf*cker about how bad it was. Police chases were impossible (they used to be easy in the beta, they turned into brick walls in the release), the handling was so off that you're forced to use AWD vehicles to win (looking at you, mountain missions!), and so many classes for cars were missing (back then, the Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R just had Street, Dirt and Performance specs), and the rubberbanding was stupidly ridiculous. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that Perf-Spec Hummers could wipe the floor with most other cars.  And then...Wild Run came out.  And made everything worse.  Getting Platinum no longer meant that you had a random chance of getting parts from Lv. 40-50, but now you had a chance to get visuals from Platinum wins, too. This means bumpers, spoilers, car colours, vinyls, stickers, rims, and more - all battling against a performance part that's just 1 level above what you currently have.  Car physics went even more awry than before - I used to be able to drift on the mountains fine with my Perf-Spec R34, but now I can do it with my Circuit-Spec R34, instead.  Wild Run brought specs to vehicles that have no right for them - I mean, who even wants a Monster Truck version of a Skyline R34? Or any sedan/coupe? Isn't that spec supposed to be for, y'know, trucks?  And then the Bikes - basically everyone uses them in PvP. And with smaller hitboxes and more torque than even supercars, they're guaranteed to win every match. It's not fun anymore.  I don't hop on the game anymore, and I wonder why I keep it installed. I guess some part of me holds a small bit of hope that the right people will come along, and make the game what it was meant to be, instead of this crazy clusterf*ck that it currently is.  All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone, regardless of sale price. Just don't bother.   EDIT: I would also like to add, that since Wild Run's release, there have been game-breaking bugs that Ubisoft has refused to take responsibility for, and has only gotten worse in recent months.
11534	Hi I have purchased the game 'The Crew' and it was not what I expected I am truly dissapointed. I would like to return my game for a refund. For I do not see it fit for me to play if I am unsatisfied with the game.
11535	don't waste your money on this game. Unfortunately not nearly as good as i thought i would be. i was hoping for a very fun game but the crew let me down. I would rather have a actual good and fun game to play   0/10  just bad and have nothing else to say     goat simulator is a lot better than this     bottom line #The worst. wasted money even when it was on sale

11537	Some of the missions need more than one person so if no one is online you will have a hard time progressing through the story line.
11538	This game was heading in the right direction, but not quite there. they should have released a couple of beta before putting out this game, it got to many bugs, and crashed too much. Dont get me wrong, i love racing and going fast, and enjoy the beautiful view blurrying past, but to be honnest, i would pay $60 for it, and i didnt! I paid $30! and it still wasnt worth it. The best part of this game was requesting a refund, unistalling, and returning to Burnout pardise a real racing game.
11539	won't start. although grate game on xbox otherwise.
11540	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. you turn a little going at 40mph and then you lose control of your whole car. and the servers go down so much its stupid
11541	Like all games that involve uPlay it has more problems than a L.A. Hooker, you would consider yourself lucky if the game even starts up, although it is a fun game to play i recommend not buying the game untill ubisoft get their SH** together. do not buy it
11542	Welcome to 'The Crew' a game that honestly looks like Chewbacca and Sasquatch had a baby and that baby was blinded in a knife fight minutes before crapping out this game. Honestly if I had Hitler, Bin Laden and 'The Crew' in one room and a gun with three bullets I would shoot 'The Crew' three times and not even lose a bit of sleep.
11543	Im simply gonna summarize the game :  -Great map -Great concept -Stupid AI -Awkward Controlls -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Season Pass with only a few cars which they should have named it premium car pack or something BUT NOT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ SEASON PASS -Wild Run DLC is not included in S.Pass and is almost as expansive as the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ base game -Wild Run removes basic game funcutions and adding them to itself so that you can only use them when u buy Wild Run -Ubisoft's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Marketing Strategies(the 3 above) -Ouuhh did you hear ? We are getting a Cops vs Criminals and guess what ?  ITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ SEASON PASS  This game's concept of season pass simply ruined the game.  You can sipmly try for 2hrs for free and see if you liked it.  At this point just wait since there is gonna be an ultimate edition so just buy that since that will include everything and u wont feel scrwed over like me.
11544	Uplay PlayU Never make it to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing install the inshelper
11545	-AND YES ALL OTHER GAMES WORK FINE AT ALL SETTINGS  I will rewrite this when it's fixed but for now it's pretty clear that I spent a lot of money on my PC and buying games intead of copying them to have them crash 10 - 40 times a day, but only this game can manage that! GJ  I almost ruined my entire win install by tweaking so much that I ended up tagging everything in my startup and services in MSconfig because I lost stuff like sound and LAN etc even after a reboot. Now I'm running way too many services that I don't need but will sort it out later. Installed so many different NVidia drivers from old up to latest, uninstalled all the Visual C++ and installed them in the right following order. I've downgraded up to every setting that's possible in the game running it on low now with only geometry high and 30fps while my monitor is 120Hz this game can only synch 60fps(?!), playing it borderless seems to sustain the playtime because in fullscreen it crashes faster.  I've even clocked my PC different because I thought it was a calculation error from OC, turned all my fans max to see if the problem was there, everytime I run this game I reboot my computer with no startup programs and then kill all the unecessary programs one by one from the task manager, I even kill my keyboard drivers from Logitech, NVidia experience, tried linking and unlinking accounts. For a week I have been trying also with the helpdesk but this game just KEEPS CRASHING!   I hope this stupid GTX 1070 will be cheaper soon so that's the very last chance for me to spend more money on making this game work!  (Windows 10 Asus Maximus VIII Formula Intel 6700 Skylake Corsair watercooled 32GB Corsair Samsung 850 EVO SSD Corsair 125GB SSD NVidia GTX 770 BenQ 2420XT 120Hz monitor Logitech G19s keyboard Xbox wireless controller G700 wireless mouse G930 wireless headset NZXT Phantom 820 casing)
11546	Multiplayer is dead, servers are bad, driving is bad, game randomly crashes. Its so sad that Ubisoft had to ruin such a promising game, but on the bright side, there are steam refunds :)
11547	I cant start this game :(
11548	Worst racing game ever
11549	FIX THE GAME!  Doesn't work anymore. Now it crashes on start.  
11550	This games AI is so â¥â¥â¥â¥, cant believe how â¥â¥â¥â¥ they are. just â¥â¥â¥â¥
11551	Its a really good game but i can`t recmmend it at its currenty state.    Pros. -Good Graphics (If you have a beast GPU) -Cool story -Nice Cars   Cons -Gliches -Makes you repay for the 'Crew Wild Run' -Pay to win -Need a good GPU to run -Can`t do enything without crew Wild Run -Bad money making game -DLCs sometimes don`t work -Can`t play with your friends most of the time
11552	Graphics are outdated (really outdated). Environments are borderline empty. Cars behave like you're riding on soap. Collisions are just random (car bounces off invisible walls etc.)   Congratulations Ubisoft, you killed another game with great potential.   After WatchDogs, Assassin's Creed and this maybe you will ruin The DIvision next? Or perhaps the newest Ghost recon. I bet you guys are exited to destroy those too.
11553	this game sucks really bad
11554	Absolutely ridiculous. Spent hours downloading and installing the game. Then found out that not only do I need a seperate client to play the game like Steam, but I also have to download Ubisofts client to open the game. And make a sepeate account with ubisoft. So now when I want to play the game, i have to open steam, then push pay and open U-play and push play again, which opens up a pop window in steam. WTF are you F**ing serious? And after 4 hours, and this stupid process the game finally loads up and the servers are down. Another game f***ed at launch. Will never buy another Ubisoft product again.
11555	(My experiences in the 30 minutes I've played this game...)  *Me looking on steam store for new games for a christmas present to myself*  OH BOY! An open world sort of game like Forza Horizon?! *click* BOUGHT!  *Waiting for download, like a kid on christmas eve*  *Get up early on a school day just to play this game*  Wow, 5:30 AM? Whatever, I still wanna play my game.  *Loads up game*  UPLAY?! Aw **** it! Why this! Stop trying to take over steam! This is just as bad a Origin!  You mean I can't play singleplayer without an internet connection nor a UPlay account? What kind of bull crap is this?!  What do you mean I already have an account? C'mon! I wanna play this game! I only have 1 hour left!  *call customer support. At least the lady was kind enough to help me out! Good on her!*  *Loading up game FINALLY*  Cmon! I've got 15 minutes left before I've got to shower! Let me see what I've been waiting for for 3 months!  *Driving*  Wait what?! A Ford F-150 Raptor can't do this! Why is it doing 100 MPH in a swamp?  Why is it jumping like a short course truck?! I know these Raptors can jump, but they most certainly can't land!  These police cars are worthless. They cannot stop you. The driving physics feel nothing like my truck IRL! (Profle pic at the time of 12/12/14...)  *tries to find barn*  WHAT DO I DO?! WHERE DO I GO?! WHY AM I SO CALM ABOUT THIS WITH THE 5-0 CHASIN' ME?!  *finds barn and gets cool car*  Ok, maybe this will redeem it. Legend of Zelda Orcarina of Time had the water temple... Maybe this is what I've been waiting for...  *Drives car*  Ok, you know what? These wheels don't even fit under the fenders! They said this was Race Spec! Bull Crap! Where's the customization?! Is this the tutorial? I opted out of it! Why am I still being taught how to drive?!  I've raced cars IRL! This DOES NOT handle right! I've been Offroading IRL! I know how cars handle! This is suuuuuuper unrealistic. Forza Horizon isn't realistic at all but at least they had a foot in reality!  You know what screw it... I wanted to play an arcade-like simulation. I got a lousy game that would work better on my IPhone 4... THE ORIGINAL 4!!!!  *closes game, deletes game, cannot remove it from steam library, Balls.*  FOR REAL! I've got a daily driver to maintain as well as a race car I'm building IRL! I could have used the money for spark plugs, oil, filters, windshield wipers, or save it towards wheels and tires!  I can't get a **** refund. Not through steam. Not through ubisoft. I want my money back. I want my 2 hours of sleep I lost back.  Now I gotta take a test tired today. I hate you all.  -Brenracer, your friendly neighborhood racing driver.
11556	â¥â¥â¥â¥ cars, â¥â¥â¥â¥ mechanics, â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics, â¥â¥â¥â¥ customization, â¥â¥â¥â¥ driving. 10/10 will never play gain
11557	i bought this game and its not working DONT BUY IT!!! 
11558	its ubisoft I regret buying this so much the game is fun but ubisoft the cocain snorting money hoarders wont give me the dlc's even if I bought em thanks UBIOSFT I didnt need money anyway
11559	do not buy this
11560	The game has its problems, its a ubisoft game. The main function that allows you to play with your friends is so broken that it makes this game literally go MMO to Singleplayer. You try to invite your friends to join your crew so you can play together. It kicks you and says you can't join his/hers crew. That main function is completly broken and ubisoft haven't responded to it. Probably fixing the mess that Assassins Creed Unity is. I would suggest waiting till they fix this bug, If you're planning to play with a friend, If you don't play with any friends, then its a good game.   Cons -  - Core 'MMO' function broken (can't join anyones crews) - Can't see your friends in the game ( only in map and can teleport to them, but can't physically see them) - Invisible walls causing your car to fly like a rocket once you hit them - Bridge walls causing your car to flip on the side - 30 fps lock - Random FPS drops  Pros -  - Good graphics - Good Gameplay - Fun side mission - Storyline is plausable - Nice vareity of cars (even though they have a lot of Fords)  Last comment -  I already purchased the game, but if you're planning to, I suggest buying it on â¥â¥â¥ so you can get it for cheaper. At its current state. Its not worth the price their asking for.
11561	Ever since day one I have found this game to be plagued with stability issues which that are unique to this game alone. It's the only game I own that crashes regularly and without warning, during missions or otherwise, on average about once per hour played. That combined with the pay to play aspects, uninspired storyline and the generally unintuitive interface make this game, IMO, not worth playing.   I write this after coming to the game after a year of not playing. Truly it's just not worth the price, which really is a shame, considering how much I would've played this game had it been done properly.
11562	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
11563	It's like Skyrim, overhyped and not worth the price on release.  I bought The Crew under the suspicion that there would be lots of fun missions, cars would be relatively accurate to their real-life counterparts, and there would be good music.   None of this is true.   I hate everything about this game, it's not fun, accurate or immersive. All the time I've played of this game I've spent glaring at my monitor in distaste and anguish. This is a hollowed out shell of a good game, filled with season passes and paywalls. After the Wild Run update, my game lags while I'm in cities and everywhere else is microstutter.   I hate this game.
11564	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ developer, â¥â¥â¥â¥ no, don't buy it you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, why are you even looking at the store page for it?
11565	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ developer, â¥â¥â¥â¥ no, don't buy it you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, why are you even looking at the store page for it?
11566	when i saw the trailer i was like YES this is the game for me got disappointed like hell ! worst experience ever!
11567	please dont make the mistake i made... i forgot that it doesnt take intel graphic cards and i wasted 50 bucks on the complete edition
11568	its laggy for me its prob my pc but i cant change it and i cant get into free roam and you have to drive milions of miles
11569	worst racing game ive ever played
11570	the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, as spected from ubisoft, the resolution is terrible, which shows that this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port made whitout effort, bugs everywhere, cars fusing whit each others since minute one, terrible, just terrible, im getting a refund
11571	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring and it's worse than TDU 2.
11572	I cant find the CD-Key Link i need to get it to uplay... Someone please help!
11573	  Hi When i starte the crew it yust sais'The crew have stopped working.' how can i fix it?
11574	Game crashes at start often.I dont advise to spend money on this.  Game itself is waste of time
11575	well it honestly sucks a big â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cause it doesnt work anymore 
11576	The game was quite boring but if you would be forced to say no to this game was the worst game gaming
11577	Letâs Say this a UBISOFT it has the issues of it clearly do not trust the Positive reviews below. This game is buggy as hell doesn't support Nvidia surround at the current time causes lockup (have to alt ctrl Del) to force shut down program as alt-f4 does not work. Servers are horrible at the current time. It doesn't feel or flow right I mean the forums here are flooding with issues people are having.  Save your money this is another let down.  
11578	do NOT purchase, even on sale!   Pros Fun at times Graphics are nice  Cons Horrible physics 'Rubberbanding' AI (just like you'd find in a cart racer) Low amounts of customization Low amount of vehicles Virtually NO performance options available except for the ones you unlock from races. Horrible main stream music with no variety. It is NOT a simulator as it is tagged. it is NOT a MMO.(about 10 people per session does not make it an MMO) The little multiplayer they have is badly done. The story, while decent, is a massive heap of plot holes, just forget about them it makes it better. Roads are made of what seems like ice. the speed indicated seems like its way faster than the speed you seem to be going. Wants to show me random pointless cutscenes every 30 seconds. Cities are not ever close to accuratly represented to scale or appearance. Free roam would be nice, except its useless. you are forced to enter the map to start missions anyway. Micro transactions for in-game currency, are you kidding me? On a $60 game!? (now 30)
11579	Turned on the crew and played it in big picture in my living room. My Dad walks in. Dad: what are you playing? Me: the crew. Dad: what is that? Me: a racing game, where you can drive anywhere in the US Dad: oh.... So it's like google maps. 10/10 would confuse Dad again when you think about it, all this game is a glorified google maps streetview
11580	Its ubisoft, FPS cap at 60, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls, and crashes.
11581	Super fun! however kind of a pay to play.. cars are so expensive and money is so hard to get it kind of requires you to pay to get good vehicles.
11582	  when i started this game i had no monster trucks no bikes no drag cars no drift cars... what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game and no dlc cars.... never buy a game from Ubisoft
11583	Its ubisoft, FPS cap at 60, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls, and crashes.
11584	Very POOR graphic. Colors are also ugly. I regret i spent my money on this game. Game looks like 5 years old, nothing new. NFS RIVAL is a lot better choice. Don't Recommend.
11585	I will say dont ever think of buying this game in your life even if they give this piece of garbage for free  probably this is the worst racing game I have ever player  after 6years since I last bought a racing game with high hope that it might actually be a top class racing game to play but no thanks to Ubiâ¥â¥â¥â¥  points to be noted :   1. Disgracefull awful graphics for this gen I have ever seen, totally shame 2. Full of bugs such as cars going to houses and other cars 3. Open world but going through trees is a bit more funny thing 4. Car Parts are not available 5. Player is gay 6. Overpriced,unpolished game  Again I will say dont ever think of buying this game in your life even if they give this piece of garbage for free
11586	Bad launcher and doesn't handle well with bad computers.
11587	Crashes a lot
11588	Not that fun...
11589	keeps crashing â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fix it.
11590	Another game that fails to even display its intro video. Do not buy unless you like troubleshooting your games more than playing them.
11591	Steam refund works!
11592	server - unstable other things in my youtube  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBk0aLZEoxcMr9sXY6l6s0aalO00sP-Iz 
11593	Ubisoft delivers again. REFUND. LOW FRAMERATE. TERRIBLE WHEEL SUPPORT (the most disgusting in the industry). Even at $14.99 the game isn't worth it.
11594	Cons The game getting worse now.  Pros The Game is Free NOW! *until October 14th.
11595	Horrendous lag even above recommended requirements on the lowest settings. Cannot manage to go over 10 FPS. Got a refund on the game, but still going to write this review because I was very disappointed by this game.
11596	Simply just not a fun game to play
11597	meh...  Not worh it.
11598	this game is a piece of crap due to not having evos....
11599	if u buy the game u will happy but game isn't playable. when u want to play just click play on steam or uplay wait and get cancer. this game isnt working until 9 months ago. please fix the game !! 
11600	Be$$$t (after EA ofc.) dlc In 2014 was really good with new features,graphics,etc vs NFS MW,Rivals. But now,better buying GTA:V,NFS 2015. And yeah it was free some time to take...
11601	I am really dissapointed in game graphics. Gmeplay is arcade style. It could be ok. But graphics... It is 2015 but game looks like 1995.
11602	played 53 minutes
11603	it dosnt even work so u shouldnt sell it
11604	Pure Cancer
11605	It runs Like s**t! I have a NVIDIA Geforce 720 and the game itself recommended me to play on the Medium preset, which ran at about 11fps. I reduced it to the lowest preset and it ran at about 25fps with many textures just popping in.
11606	Error Code #1_0. My Region is not being serviced for this product etc etc... 0/10 so far -_-
11607	I hate forced internet games
11608	Very bad game i keep getting black screened in certain areas and after 29 hours in i just got bored really quick, it was very fun on xbox one but i tried to get the same amount of fun on pc but it wasn't the same just wish i had cool friends on pc to play with.this game is very laggy at times it will hit below 30 fps sometimes no matter what card you have even on a titan x that i have and you will notice it alot.Overall i recommend to pick this up on sale and have atleast have one friend to play with or want a time wasteing game. 4/10 on pc but on xbox i give it 10/10 i have over 300 hours on there before me and my friends moved on to destiny and cunter stroke globally choked.If you have friends to play with and have a good system then pick this up ,i didn't have anyone to play with i played it alone so thats why it got boreing for me so good luck future buyers.
11609	  Just car and map
11610	I loved test drive but this game flatout sucks it dont even run well on a gtx 1070 dont buy 4/10
11611	the only thing which works fine in this game is the uninstall button..
11612	This Game! lol this is not a game this is rubbish! I bought this game with full price just for the broken multiplayer! and the best part? It will be free to play from 14th Septermber such ubishit much wow. Cant even invite my friends in this sad â¥â¥â¥â¥!
11613	TROUBLE FREE LAUNCH they said!!!! Well the GAME WONT START GRRR!!!! Click play icon in steam and Nothing!.... ub soft.... UB â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!!! more like!!
11614	The beta's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucked. IDK about the full game
11615	DO NOT BUY!!!!!! WORST â¥â¥â¥â¥ EVER! LOST 49â¬ ON THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥. IF IT CRASHES ONCE WHILE LAUNCHING ITS DONE. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO ITS RIP. IF YOU WANT A GOOD WORKING GAME THAT IS LIKE THIS ONE. YOU SHOULD BUY NFSÂ´15 ( Need For Speed 2015 )
11616	Ubisoft is the worst thing known to man, Yes worse then the Xbox One. No I am not lieing.   If you want AIDS or and type of HIV or STD's All you have to do is download this game.   You will be pleased to find that it does not work on Windows 10. You will the try and fix it by contacting Ubisoft livechat. At this time you will receive your AIDS. Then you will spend 4 hours talking to them only to find out that a sack of potatoes could have helped you better the them. At that point the HIV will come in.   Later on, you will request a refund on AIDS. That is when all the known STD's will enter your body.   I would rather have talked to hitler for 4 hours about how great jews are then talked to the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at Ubisoft.   I swear the average 4 year old has more knowledge then all the people at Ubisoft COMBINED. So please what ever you do dont buy this game. and if you do, well RIP.
11617	i love this game so much but now it crashes please please please fix it then i will be playing constantly
11618	Can't run over j3wsh people 0/10
11619	This game is fun but theres one problem i bought this to play with a friend on the PS4 and xbox one and the servers arnt merged so if you would please do that I will be greatfull
11620	 UPlay sucks A*S, racing games suck more A*S! This game takes the WORST of both worlds!  Whether it's the wanna-be Samuel Jackson 'typical black guy'... or the 'white wanna-be DEAD Paul Walker' We don't give a F*CK! F*CK PAUL DIC*ER AND HIS FAMILY! A sh*tty storyline for a sh*tty racing game. Blends well mixed into an overall SH*TTY MOTHERF*CKING PIECE OF SH*T!  Watch Dogs is better, 'nuff said.  1/10
11621	waste a monay!
11622	Cannot cover driver's ugly face.
11623	This is a review of the FIRST BETA.  Bad gearbox support for racing wheels (I used the G27) - you will constantly find yourself popping the clutch and trying to change into a gear 3 or 4 times before the game finally registers it because their gearbox detection doesn't work at all until the clutch is COMPLETELY down.   They also start every race with a cutscene of you speeding off into the race, which means when they finally give you control of the car you don't know what gear to put it in! You have to guess! Sometimes it's third, sometimes its fourth, sometimes its second, and you will lose every race where you don't guess the gear correctly because there is no margin for error in the races.
11624	Single player isnt too bad. Story is bland and we have seen it a million times. Cars are good, level of customisation isnt too bad either.  Where it really fails is gameplay. Horrible steering system, NPC vehicles spawn right infront of you causing you to lose the race most times, invisible objects/ objects way harder/softer then they are supposed to be (crash into a bus and it goes flying but crash into a mini cooper and you hit a brick wall), no catchup system so its really just a matter of who crashes the most = no skill needed.   If this was f2p i would probably play it. But for $75 i want a refund.  Imagine need for speed but randomly cars spawning in front of you, you cant steer well and you might hit an invisible wall.

11626	I was excited about this game when the first trailer came out. And then i played the beta, i was completly disapointed, it has the worst handling i ever expierenced in a racing game. Feels like you controlling boxes, that dont want to turn. Just feels like crap, the graphics are last gen and damage model sucks. Its nothing what it looked like in the trailers, also it wouldnt let me change my button layouts on my controller wich i wasnt happy about. I know its still beta but ill doubt they will change anything by the time the game comes out. Its a shame the game has a lot of potential but the handling just kills the whole game for me.
11627	the idiots of ubisoft had since beta to fix the things that matter the most it feels like they havent done anything to it at all. game keeps on crashing, memory leaks, freezes your computer for fun. ( i have a high end gaming rig ) would i recommend this game to anyone? nope.
11628	Ok so my whole time playing this game was signing up for uplay then getting in some gay car chase and then my other time is trying to get to the first god dang checkpoint. This game is aids im done.
11629	the game has glitched so the toturial with the ford raptor svt drt edition wont let me drive to the checkpoint i do not reccomend this game before they fix this. if anyone kow how to fix this please tell me. i know the controlls and i have lowered the graphics
11630	I followed this games since E3 2 years ago... I was super hyped and bought the early access version to try out the beta - could NOT join any of my friends -&gt; zero teamplay 'I mean cmon! THE CREW! without having a crew! f this - sucky handling too much arcade  - old graphics   I am more than dissapointed... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------02.12.2014 EDIT: graphics improved a lot BUT: could not join the fing crew ! seriously!? What did you guys do after the beta release with this major issue not being able to play together?  very very very dissapointed! I want my god damn money back! /:  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------11.12.2014  EDIT: still not working...   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------27.12.2014  EDIT: Still NOT working for us! 3 of us are still not able to join a freaking crew! Still sitting here waiting for an update... but NO!
11631	Bought the game before the deadline for the beta start, i got the beta key after i bought it, but steam failed to download the whole game and also gave me a faulty beta key after i got it fully downloaded. Steam 'guaranteed access to the PC Closed Beta' The game looks like a lot of fun and i have read up on it and wouldve really liked to try it out since i payed $60 for it. But you know nothing can ever be perfect, Just hope i will be able to play the game when it comes out since the key is not working and there is no support team to talk too.
11632	i bought this game now just for the closed beta and i can't play. When there isn't infinite actualizations,the server is unavailable...so i can't play this fu*** game!!!
11633	failed to connect to proxy
11634	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's defective like most recent UbiSoft games seem to be. In this specific one it's impossible to play multi-player if your players exist on the same LAN. Much like a spotty issue from splinter cell. (you can grab a VPN to route to to let you in but come on Ubi!!)  If you happen to be content with a single player game, congrats you get to listen to a whiny story in between races that are totally based upon arbitrary numbers and noting about real parts. A '900' spec Mac can get run down by a cop in a crown vic. It's utter garbage  AC:Unity also happens to be a catastrophe.   Valve, please DROP UbiSoft as a publisher. They clearly have lost their magic.
11635	DO NOT BUY.  Game is currently broken in a multitude of different ways. Missions are highly unbalanced and some are damn near impossible in solo (even with 'the right car'). With three betas, you would assume a polished, flawless product out of the gates - but this is not the case.  I was a TDU1 junkie, and poured 140+ hours into TDU2 in an attempt to force myself to like it. The Crew was meant to be the next big thing in this MMO car genre - but despite my repeated attempts to enjoy what it had to offer, it is a steaming mess of broken elements. There is a lot of potential, but I would advise you to avoid this game.
11636	The AI Cheats - sometimes the Opponents Boost like crazy just to keep things interesting ,Policecars must have some secret Race Engine - they are able to keep Track with your Mc Laren Mercedes - just because the script for that Mission required it . Overall the Game feels really unbalanced - Beginning with the Design of the Missions which is basicly repeat ,fail ,repeat until you memorised Track and Traffic and then finaly win it. Then the Cars - The Handling is really awkward ,a Mini Cooper that steers like a Pickup ? Not really plausible ,just to name one of them  Lets hope Ubi spend some Time for patching out the biggest Kinks ,until then i wont reccoment buying it.
11637	Game crush at checkpoint 80/110.... 45 minutes waste for NOTHING!!!!! FxxK!!!! Good game but bad UBISOFT!!! Poor Server...
11638	i bought this car at the warehouse it was a posche RUF and when i started to this time trial and i went on a striaght away line and out of nowhere i spin out and im not even useing NOS the cars grip is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and im not even flooring it when im at top speeds like 170mph and then i use nos and i just loose control like i got a flat tire its just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t 
11639	Its the gameplay/physics alone that make me not enjoy this. Driving a car in this game is literally like driving a boat on water. Sluggish. I keep wanting to like this game, but it so hard to enjoy it when you have to drive a vehicle like it is as big and weighs as much as a skyscraper. If I could get a refund right now I would.
11640	crash crash super trash
11641	Got it for free and I still feel ripped off. This game is a mess from top to bottom. Just awful with not a single redeeming aspect. Terrible optimization, ugly graphics, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ story, every character is terrible, bad music, crazy moon physics, bad sfx, overall horrid design... Never left a bad review for something but this is a remarkably â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
11642	So, I've clocked in FORTY* hours in The Crew, and I figure I'll give my review in the wake of everyone else's. I'm a fan of racing games; From Daytona USA to Nascar (bleh) to Blur to Forza, so I generally know what to expect from racing games. I got exactly what I expected from The Crew. It's a open-world semi-arcade (Simcade is the term, right?) racer with a story and a buttload of missions and challenges to take on. And you know what? It's fun. I enjoyed my first couple of hours. Despite what people say... I never encountered any noticeable bugs, and what the game offers is *perfectly fine.*  -----------------------------------  'Sub par car selection.' 'There's nothing iconic in this!' 'Not even fifty cars?! Lame!'  If you're looking for a game that has hundreds of iconic cars, go play Forza or Gran Turismo. The Crew was meant to be a game that you could pick up and play without having to think too much about a vast array of choices. That's fine. If I wanted car porn, I'll boot up Forza Motorsports 4 and play around in the Autovista feature.  -----------------------------------  'The customization sucks!'  Again; Go play Forza Motorsports or Gran Turismo.  -----------------------------------  'The handling is terrible!' 'I can never keep my car straight!' 'I slide all the time!'  I'm not going to weigh in my opinion on this, because I'm currently playing The Crew with a keyboard. It's generally known that keyboards are poorly suited for driving games, and for good reason. A keyboard doesn't allow you to 'ease' into your turns, brakes, and throttles. It's 0% or 100%, never in between. So yes, at higher speeds, I would expect a slippy sensation when I do more than tap the keys.  Despite this, I'm completely satisfied with how they did the physics, and it reminds me of the GRID series. You can't round corners at 80, 90, 100 miles per hour. You're going to crush into the wall, but I can also feel a great sense of power in the steering (Again, probably due to the keyboard). Just like circuit racing: Bad entrances and extreme speeds will send you careening off the track and simply ruin your day. So I advise two things for those complaining about the handling.  A) Grab a controller. It's... $20 for a simple one, and if it has sensitivity flaws, you can adjust the dead zones for the sticks in the game settings. You'll have a significant level of control that the keyboard can't give you.  B) For God's sakes, learn your apexes and limits. A car can only do so much before it gives, even if it's made to drift. If you can't stay within the limits of your car, then you'll fail. This is no excuse to blame the handling and physics. They're fine.  -----------------------------------  'Bad navigation' 'Nav sucks.'  Maybe it's because I got the game after the initial tweaks, but I don't know what you're talking about. The nav system acts very much like the nav system in my car and phone. It doesn't send me in circles, and while there's a bit of a delay, it's unnoticeable if you also use the mini-map and common sense.  -----------------------------------  'AI is cheap!' 'AI cheats!' 'AI is unfair!'  If you talk about the 5-0, then definitely. I'm not a fan of how they're able to clip and phase through traffic, and I realy don't like how they can send you from 150mph to 0 in under a second. But most of all... They're always on your heels. I have watched them go from 600 yards behind me at my speed up to my bumper in a couple seconds, even though there's no logical way for them to do so.  If you're talking about the missions... Nope. Again, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no 'slingshot AI,' if the AI gets the gain on you, it's because you took a turn in a horrible fashion or they made use of nitro (Which is something you too can use.) The only issue I see is that you can never knock the AI out of commission. I've rammed many into walls and threw out their back end, but they somehow stick with the pack.  Car level... I'm running around in missions with a L. 165+ Camaro against AI with car levels of 70-80. It was *heavily* implied that car levels do upgrade a car's performance, and despite having a level twice my AI opponents (And even 100+ levels than some newbies), I can't leave them in the dust. Maybe it's so everyone is on an 'even' playing field, so that you can't grind challenges before the story and so you can't troll new players, but I don't feel the sense of progression or power. And that sucks.  -----------------------------------  'Pay 2 win!'  ...What kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥ are you smoking here? If you're saying that you can buy a couple of cars with Crew Credits, then maybe... Until you realize that the only way to progress and develop new kits is to actually play. The only way to get tuning parts to improve your ride is to actually play. The only way to increase your car level and it's general power is to actually play. I don't like microtransactions as much as the next guy, but microtransactions don't equal 'PAY TO WIN' unless they give a significant advantage. I got a McLaren MP4-12C, but until I get 30 more levels, I can't play with it or get anything out of it beyond showing it off in free roam. I still have to work and play to be able to tune it and use it in missions. There's no pay to win. Knock if off with this slander.  -----------------------------------  'MMO was just a marketing term to get more sales.'  I agree 150%. With the size of the map, and with the attitude and concept the advertisements touted around... I expected at least 64 drivers on the whole map. I say 'at least' because it's totally possible to have 64 drivers in an instance radius that follows you while having a map filled with 200-300 players. instead, I get to drive around with seven others. In total. That was... Disappointing, to say the least. I was told that I could race in quick co-ops, develop a crew that I could ease into, then break it off when necessary and find another crew to hop into with absolute ease. Essentially: A highly social experience that changes with the people I drive the nation with. What I got was Criterion's 'Most Wanted' with a metric â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of map to drive. Not impressed.  -----------------------------------  Is the game good? Yes, without a doubt. I had a decent time playing The Crew so far, and I plan on continuing later down the road, when I have some time to kill. Would I recommend it? No. The game plays a lot like GRID, and from what some say, TDU. Which is fine. I have no problem with these games, and I find the former enjoyable on its own. But Ubisoft's main selling point that supposedly made The Crew different was the 'MMO-like gameplay.' Ubisoft did not deliver this. 7 players around me does not constitude as 'MMO-like gameplay.' You have better interaction and a denser playercount in Euro Truck Simulator. I am *not* joking here.  The Crew just feels... Empty, and if my opinion means anything, I would recommend getting GRID (For PC), Forza (For Xbox), or Gran Turismo (For Playstation) in place of this game. You'll save a bit more money, and you'll have everything The Crew offers and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton more.
11643	Garbage game. Don't buy it unless it's at least 50% off. This could have been a really great and fun game but it's sold in a beta state and Ubi/Ivory Tower are releasing patches that doesn't fix anything.  If you liked TDU, you could like this game.  Pros: - gigantic map, different landscapes, a pleasure to visit and cruise - quite great lifespan, there's no real 'end' even if you can quite quickly complete main story - nice personal XP and car level to improve performance and tuning - little but great panel of cars (american, european, asian) - quite good panel of races (even if some types of races are quite similar) - music choice  Cons: - 100% online - Playing alone or w/ friends is just the same since the missions aren't designed differently alone or with 3 friends - While in a crew, nearly 50% of the time you will not be rewarded for finishing some races because you got randomly 'disconnected' from the server - nice after an hour of driving - Sometimes you will see your friend offline ingame and you won't be able to play w/ them, even during some races. You have to quit and relaunch the game - Statistics and awards reseting randomly each two days - means you get less money per day - FF/FR/4WD : no feeling difference between them, they all act like some old FR - Engine sounds could be way better - Awful physics engine (bad management of crashes, collision bugs) - Sometimes cars are just randomly breaking, nice during a 1 hour race to lose just because it looks like your controller is stuck on the brake button - Good driving non rewarded b/c of the IA getting some kind of unlimited nitro so you can't escape them and get more than +0:02 - Bad driving non punished b/c of the IA waiting for you during a race if you're behind - Police cars : 80s Ford able to chase in straight line w/o difficulty a 900 BHP BMW M5 cruising @ 250+mph - Some DLC are unavailable - Ubisoft/Ivory Tower fixes that doesn't fix anything   This could have been a really great game if the IA wasn't so stupid and killing all the fun in the game w/ the bugs you encounter while playing in group. Wait for a 50% discount or some serious fixes, or go if you were a great fan of the TDU series and you wish to only play alone.
11644	In the beginning, I was pumped about The Crew. It was my opportunity to drive fast cars across America. In the first couple hours, I was exploring new areas, leveling up my car like crazy. I was having one hell of a time. Then, the fun turned into frustration as missions turned into long, difficult checkpoint runs, with tough corners everywhere to mess you up. Whenever I needed to execute a corner with a fast car, a Ford Explorer would usually be there to mess it up. There are times where I accidentally crashed into a cop and somehow ended up in a 5-star chase. Add wonky collision mechanics and impossible missions that no one would want to do co-op for, and you get pure rage. Now Ubisoft had the nerve to release an unannounced update that adds a virus to the game, making it impossible to actually run. GG, Ubisoft. You are the next EA.
11645	Story is crap and there are so few races..for such a big map well a map that looks big is actually tiny just filled with silly side quests like stay on the racing line or smash the gates is so lame there are so many possibilities with this game but it seems like it was rushed and no real effort was put into gameplay.it honestly needed more races and less lets see how far you can jump for a silly medal..You have to spend real money just to get more cars or expect to do the same race about 200 times because a race only gives you max 2000 dollars which is ridiculous..the customizing is so limited and lame the cars look better stock..honestly i wish i could get a refund its a really boring game,the only good thing is the graphics are stunning..if only the gameplay was as good.i hhad more fun playing need for speed most wanted than this silly game
11646	this game is so trash
11647	Telling you right now, do not waste your money on this game. Bought this game on release for $59.99 and damn that was such a waste of money. This is one of those racing games that just feel so slow and boring. The customization is awesome though. Overall save your money and dont buy this game.
11648	Game crush at checkpoint 80/110.... 45 minutes waste for NOTHING!!!!! FxxK!!!! Good game but bad UBISOFT!!! Poor Server...
11649	This game is rubbish.   just to get it to work i had to go edit the xml file to make it windowed, and then use the windows 7 application preview (yes the little preview that pops up when you hover over the icon) and a youtube video to try to edit the graphics settings so that i could see what was going on.  the physics are atrocious which suprises me because of the nature of some of the missions (ie jumping). apparently everyone in the continental united states ran out of gas at the same time. no one moves unless you hit them. they just sit there with their brake lights on. graphics even on ultra with maxed out AA are pretty thouroughly disappointing. i think they were like 'lets just make the cutscenes look really good and the game wont matter'  +it was on sale +i can do mad drifts  -Uplay -subpar graphics -atrocious physics -car selection -difficulty launching -pointless missions  Would not pay $10 for. Should not have paid $40.
11650	Really boring and ran bad on my decent computer. Too bad.
11651	Not worth more than 19.99. The visuals and driving are just like saints row 3-4.
11652	Terrible game not worth the money at all..
11653	Nothing special, physics are not realistic, NFSU2 was more realistic than this, graphics are nice and engine sounds are close to real, but not worth it, even on special its not worth it, try again Uplay and ivory tower, this could have been a forza beater if you found proper physics, but this is miles away fromthe cake.
11654	ive made a $85 mistake 85$ game still has microtransactions multiplayer sucks and extremely limited max 8 players i believe not much to do besides racing compared to forza 4 the crew loses in everything
11655	Boring, the same throughout, grindfest, awkward controls, okay optimization, horrible servers. This game was either rushed or needed to be made by someone else. All you do is side missions, then some boring story missions happen, then some side missions. Bla bla bla...
11656	ive played in 0.3 hours its the woorst game it requerd ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ubihard â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11657	this game is great and fun to play but there is one tiny problem the game crashes everytime i try to quit.this is unacceptable for a triple a title.when this bug gets fixed(if it does) i will write a full review
11658	Purchases and Payment category.
11659	Ubisoft has certainly made some good titles, sadly this is not one of them. I waited too long to have my heart broken by this game.
11660	I am so glad i didn't have to pay for this game, only reason i have it is because AC Unity was a flop on release, and several games were offered as compensation. i played this when it was in beta, driving physics were horrible then, and still bad now, it feels like you're driving on ice. i can't stand playing these racing games where the developer can't get the driving even close to right.
11661	this game had so much potential, but even more bugs and downfalls. from graphical bugs, menu issues, poor placement of objects in the world which ruins seamless racing, which makes the game just not fun, Pay to win... and UPLAY SUCKS.
11662	Absolute disgrace... Call yourselves a development team, this is the best example of amateurs at work. Not only does this game look like crap, but chugs along at such pathetic frames per second when my PC should be able to max it out without my graphics card even getting hot... One of the most appallingly optimized and downright lazy ports I've ever come across, and it's just gotten worse and worse, I can't even play in lowest settings anymore, just more of the usual from Ubisoft... And software developers wonder why we download pirate games, here's a damn good example of why... So we don't waste our hard earned money on s##t like this. You should be ashamed, this was the last game I'll ever buy from Ubisoft.
11663	Great game, if you didnt buy it from steam. The game continues to crash every couple of minutes even with the latest updates to windows and my drivers. Ubisoft needs to fix these issues via updates. Very frustrating when you spend $60 on a game to have these probelms.
11664	They claim this game MMORPG,but in fact I only play with other player once. Tasks only have one difficulty. If the primay too hard for you,even if you have a better car than the task recommend and you still unable to pass it, only two ways you can solve it. Got even better car parts from the challenge that  you might had pass by using others car(you have to pass the challenge with the corresponding car type to get each car pats). The other way is playing it for maybe hunderds of times,and after an hour you might pass the mission,might not. Maybe I am not really skillful driver, but it is ridiculous that I use a car LV600 ,seldom make msitakes,play a lots of time,and still unable to pass a mission recommend LV400 or higher.
11665	The game is fun. I like the arcade feel to it.  However, I had so much difficulty to play the game because of the servers that are so often down that I just don't care to play it anymore.  It's either I can't connect to the servers, or I am allowed in only to be deconnected after an event...  So not recommended because of the connection (can't play a game you wanna play = BAD)
11666	Barely works... Can't even finish the story mode 4 month after release.. another great job ubisoft... I Won't buy anything from you again nice customer support btw... LOL
11667	Drove to Miami, too much water. 0/10 would play again.
11668	Just finished a 20 minutes singleplayer race. Were leading til half distance, then got passed by one of the racers. For awhile he were ca 1 km ahead of me, and ca. 5 minutes later i managed to catch up with him again. Then near the finish i managed to take a wrong turn and had to drive some extra distance, but still managed to catch up to them and finish second. Is there rubberband in this game? No doubt about it. Is it scripted. No doubt about it:P  The best thing about this game is the massive open world, and it feels pretty realistic to cruise around in cockpit view. Missions are usually normal races, wreck another racer, timetrails, collect crates or escape from either cops or other villains, and most of'em aint much fund.   + Huge open world + Cruising in cockpit view + Since there's no Forza Horison 1&amp;2, this games works as a replacement for me  - Boring - Think they could have done more to make races more exiting. - Music. Hate the radiochannels, so it didn't take me long to replace the music.
11669	No. Just... no. tl;dr 'Imagine the worst parts of 'Need for Speed World', 'RaceRoom' and 'Pole Position', slap it onto a total misunderstanding of what 'MMO' means, and then shoe-horn in a sloppy, poorly written, MANDITORY single-player mode and you get a taste of 'The Crew'. The reality is that the game is much, much worse than that.  I stopped playing at the mission 'Ironclad Dash'. This mission is still in the 'new player' area, and from my casual research is the choke-point that keeps all the 'dirty entitled casuals' out of the game. After 3 hours of trying to beat this manditory single-player mission, I finally found a help video which recomended I should try to pass the mission after beating the game and getting all the necessary perks.  This is only ONE problem with the game. It's advertized as an MMO, but they don't talk about the manditory single-player missions you need to do to level up and open races. You CAN just drive around, but since nothing is available to do it's just nice scenery.  The single-player is.... bad. Better stories have been told by 4th graders who are off their Ritalin. When I can predict everything that happens live on a livestream before it happens? Yeah, that's just bad. The story is bad, the voice acting is bad, the writing is bad, I would go as far as to call it borderline RACIST in some cases.  The driving is horrid. Cars fishtail on dry pavement at low speeds, dog help you if you want to make turns at speed. Races against computer cars has some pretty awful rubber-banding, unless you're losing in which you have to use shortcuts to keep up. And since I never leveled up far enoguh to race with my friends, I'll never know if that's fair or not.  Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME. At BEST it's ain incomplete product that they will sell fixes in DLC for. At worst, it's a message that game companies will read as 'they'll spend $60 on anything!'
11670	Crashes after evry difficult race that you can never win again and you end up trowing your controller across the room
11671	Hmm... how do I put this.  3 years ago, I was still a naiive little boy. I went online, browsed the web, and bought every game that had a rating of 8 or above on ign. Then, I came across watch dogs.   HOLY F*CKING GABEN  WOW! THAT GRAPHICZ THO WOW! THAT GAMEPLAY THO WOW! THAT STORY IS DA SCHITZ! THERE'S NO WAY IT WILL BE â¥â¥â¥â¥!  And so I waited. And waited. And waited a bit longer. Built my survival fort in minecraft, beat FTL for the the first time (with unlimited scraps).  And then the game had a graphical downgrade. No matter, still looked cool enough. I was still praying in front of my Watch Dogs poster every day.   Preorders came to steam around a month later. Being the kind of person who literally hailed Aiden as their Senpai, I bought the most expensive edition of the game.   And so I waited. And waited. And waited a bit longer. Built a rollarcoaster in minecraft, beat FTL for the first time without cheats. Finished Bioshock Infinite.  Waited.   When the game finished downloading, I was basically high. Jumping around all over the place. Probably broke my bed in the process.   And I played the game. Finished it in a single playthrough.  GOOD GAME!  but...  Wait did I play the right game? THAT was watch dogs?   ...  ...  ...  .  A few months later, The Crew was released.  HOLY CRAP! LOOK AT ZAT WORLD SIZE! HOLY CRAPZ!!! LOOK AT ZE GAMEPLAY HYPE! HOLY CREAPZEWARL! LOOK AT THOSE CARZ!  ...  So I waited.  And I waited. Got 100% completion in watch dogs. Built a redstone computer in minecraft.   And I waited.  Of course, being the dumbf*ck that I was, at this point, I bought the crew.  Most expensive edition.  And this time, it wasn't a watch dogs. It was worse.  You see, I tolerated watch dogs. It was overhyped, but it was good.  The Crew however, was overhyped, and it's â¥â¥â¥â¥. And now with the expensive DLC known as 'wild run', it's doing more damage to itself than it ever has done.   I'm done with preordering ubisoft games.   Just... don't. Your money will be better spent on Project Cars or something.
11672	Nop no more dlcs ubishit
11673	This game has shoddy controls a F-ed up tutorial (prologue) and if you buy the gold edition feel free to stare at the awesome cars they give you in return because that's all you can do with them since all the story missions require you to have a street racing tune whatever. It's so stupid. I can't figure out what most of the controls do and you can't even buy performance parts like literally every other racing game. You have to earn them, which is a good idea but is so wrongly executed i find myself groaning as my tires spin out but can't finish a certain event. The physics is terrible and in general this game really has nothing going for it except the exciting new phone thing on the side that shows an actual character.  As for storyline, jeez! It as about as much storyline as the Need For Speed movie. You have a brother, who get's shot by the way, so called it. You get put in prison, let out because you're apparently the best driver and only driver who can take down a crime syndicate run by the FBI!!!!!! And of course the person who lets you out is a hot chick police officer who pretty much hooks you up despite saying she can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ without the main bad guys knowing something is up. You then proceed to suck the **** of the cronies who 'run' the town so you can join their club and run up the ranks. Oh and did i mention that your brother STARTED this club and was top dawg, until he got shot and now that guy is top dog.  Need For Speed Most Wanted anyone? Awesome driver gets cheated out of a race so now he needs to get on this 'blacklist' and work his way up to beat the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who stole his car. Yup this game is SOOO original.  Oh and out of al that, i was HARRASSED by this guy in game, he sent me friend requests and crew requests every 5 seconds and followed me EVERYWHERE!   Oh wait, did i ruin the game for you? Well i just saved you 1-2 hours an 30-60$ You're welcome  Thank God for steam refunds.
11674	Once you beat the campaign, which is intergrated into your online experience, it's just a driving game with bugs.
11675	[UPDATED REVIEW] 6.2/10  So its been roughly 7 months since the game has released, and to be honest, the game is dying. Ubisoft has been changing things within the game and making balance tweaks, but there are some overlying problems that prevent this game from reaching its full potential, outside of what I mentioned in my first review below. One of the main problems is the lacking of the 'team' or 'crew' based racing. Each time you explore the map and get 7-8 other players in your session, there is no incentive to actually race or interact with them. The fact that you can only get 7-8 players in your session is another downside, although technology is probably to blame for that The car roster is still fairly weak, even after the four DLC packs as part of the season pass and the newest cars added. There are still only a few Japanese cars in the game, and now the count is at 4 different Corvetes (Which I don't mind, but not many people are huge Corvette fans). Once you've upgraded your cars to the maximum level, there is basically no end-game other than PvP, which is also boring as almost everyone competitive uses the same cars.  This game had so much potential, but it fell flat. As much as i hate to say it, I can't reccomend this game anymore.  --------------------------OLD REVIEW------------------------  8/10. No Lotus cars and too many Mustangs  But seriously, this game is getting a lot of flak for little reason in my opinion. Yes it is not a groundbreaking achievement of gamer kind, and Yes, Ubisoft has a crap reputation for its 2014 games, but The Crew is pretty awesome (at least in my eyes, Racing games and MMOs are my thing).  Pros: HUGE map. Seriously, it takes ~40 minutes to drive coast to coast in the highest performance cars (assuming you don't crash at all which is near impossible) Each car feels different. They mentioned this in one of the trailers, but driving the different cars (even the starter cars) feels fairly different from others on the roster. From the zippy and nimble Abarth 500 and Mini cooper to the powerhouse Corvette and Viper to the juggernaut-like strength of the Hunner H1 Alpha and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. No mandatroy drift events. Not everyone likes drifting (i don't), and aside from the challenges, it doesn't force you to drift at any point during the story or in the challenges.  Cons: The Story is bland. Gang member kills your brother who was the leader of the gang, you get framed for it. You then team up with cops and slowly work your way up until you beat that gang member and take over the gang. Sure there is more along the way, but the story is more of an afterthought. Microtransactions. While the most expensive cars aren't the best (The Laferrari, The Hummer and the Agera), the cars are priced it a way that makes it difficult to earn more cars just by playing the story. You either have to play PVP, do faction missions (both are unlocked at level 10), or grind skills endlessly to earn money, or buy cars/unlocked upgrades with real world money. PvP. Speaking of the PvP, it is difficult for new players to get into it and stand a chance. When the game was first released, it was possible to enter events with low ranked cars and still stand a chance, but now that its a month and a half after release, a lot of PvP players have max performance cars that will completely stomp any new PvP racers.  Overall I still reccomend this to racing game fans. If you were looking for a true MMO though, you may find yourself fairly dissapointed.
11676	Forget everything i said, once you get to 50 and do all the missions and stuff, there is not alot to do... wait for all the dlc to come out, wait for season pass and game discount, wait for price drop? maybe i'll recommend it :/  at full price i dont recommend it sadly :S    July 17 edit: it has/had a 50% discount!, im at 'meh' levels for this game, it's not good but it isn't bad either...also havent played it since i first posted this review, i'll re-edit this when the expansion comes out (wild run i think), looking forward to drift and drag spec (?)  would i recommend this game? personally no...but this is based on when the game was first launched and doesnt include the DLC thats been released since launch...i might revisit this game one day (especially since they announced that new expansion pack!)
11677	Instead of writing an essay on how good or bad this game is here's my conclusion for it:  POSITIVES: -Very large map (basically a mini scale U.S.). Takes about 2 hours in real time to make a loop all the way around it. -Very long campaign story. -PVP lobbies (Best way to earn money and XP). Alot of people farm these events for XP and cash -Nice graphics if you're running game on ultra. - Landmarks that you can visit and earn money from when you visit one for the first time. -Cockpit view although side and rearview mirrors don't have a reflection. Just there for looks. -Works great with XBOX controller. That's about it though so I've heard - Some faction races that last 2 hours in real time. It's cool if you like endurance races. Although they are not really worth it since they should have a much higher payout. It's the next best thing besides PVP lobbies though. -Pretty in-depth car customization  NEGATIVES -Freaking Ushit -Rubberbanding of other players. -Overpowered AI where if you mess up they jump like a mile ahead of you in a couple seconds and it's hard to catch back up to them.  -Cops just ram you and that's it.  -Microtransactions in a game that you pay $60 for. -Missions and challenges that don't give you enough cash. -Steering is unrealistic. All the cars in the game handle like they are on butter instead of asphault. - A pretty run of the mill story with no originality. Very forgettable.  Overall it's not worth it and the fact that they just ditched the Crew Credits altogether and just made you pay real money upfront is just pathetic. This is my last Ubisoft game I'll ever purchase unless they show me something spectacular. Don't waste your time with this. It's not really worth it in the end. This game will probably be dead in a while anyway.
11678	Changing my review of this, I orginally favoured it but Ihave bately played this since launch, the economy is all kinds of jacked up making earning money for new cars a total grindfest. Drives ok missions are ok.  But felt like it was going to take ages to ever move off my starter car. Maybe thats diffrent today mind you but when I last played that wasnt the case.
11679	ive played in 0.3 hours its the woorst game it requerd ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ubihard â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11680	Intel Core i5 4690k @4.7 GHZ Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 16GB DDR3 RAM MSI Z97 Gaming 3 Motherboard 1920x1080 resolution  Tried playing in ultra and got really bad frames whereas in more demanding games I got solid 60's... Wtf?
11681	1. Sentence, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! It sucks so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard. It's unbelievable. Not even talking about the bugs. It's worse than DayZ
11682	BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME NOTE THAT THE AI CHEATS HEAVILY IN MISSIONS!   http://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/535151589886387618/   For that I do NOT recommend this game. The game has a lot of potential but the forced leveling to unlock stuff for your shiny car (you CANNOT customize base cars, you HAVE to mod them in some way before you can earn parts or upgrade them at all!) is really lame. The game would be a thousand times better without the terrible leveling system.   Ubisoft really fu'cked up this game.
11683	It says that i have to buy the full vearsion I DID, i paid my money for it on the weekend sale, My hard earnd money. Please help me get the full game steam I paid the money WHY???????????!!!!!! 
11684	Cant even play this trash, dont even come with a activation code. Worst game ever.
11685	Very lousy server. Always connection issue.

11687	1. Sentence, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! It sucks so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard. It's unbelievable. Not even talking about the bugs. It's worse than DayZ
11688	The open world is cool, but not cool enough to make up for the poor physics and mediocre storyline.
11689	Cant even play this trash, dont even come with a activation code. Worst game ever.
11690	Very lousy server. Always connection issue.
11691	Drove to Miami, too much water. 0/10 would play again.
11692	The game is fun. I like the arcade feel to it.  However, I had so much difficulty to play the game because of the servers that are so often down that I just don't care to play it anymore.  It's either I can't connect to the servers, or I am allowed in only to be deconnected after an event...  So not recommended because of the connection (can't play a game you wanna play = BAD)
11693	Barely works... Can't even finish the story mode 4 month after release.. another great job ubisoft... I Won't buy anything from you again nice customer support btw... LOL
11694	Nowhere on this store page does it say the game requires to be online at all times. I assumed there would be a single player mode of some description as listed along the side, so I didn't have to deal with laggy servers or anything like that. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Unless you live in America or Europe you're going to lag horribly. And I don't mean other people rubber banding everywhere in multiplayer races or anything isolated like that. I mean the game's handling model is directly linked to your connection to the server. So that 300ms ping means there's 300ms before any of your inputs register on screen. Not only that, but I had to spend several hours troubleshooting to get this game to even run at all, only to find out this always online mode renders the game entirely unplayable to me. Thanks Ubisoft.  Note: The error I was receiving was essentially that 'The Crew has stopped working', after looking up all of the fixes online, the only thing that worked was completely removing all traces of my original up to date graphics driver, including going into the registry to remove files, then reinstalling it. The game doesn't crash or anything for me now but it's something to consider if you have trouble getting the game to run. It's only configured for purely default drivers.
11695	Terrible game not worth the money at all..
11696	Nothing special, physics are not realistic, NFSU2 was more realistic than this, graphics are nice and engine sounds are close to real, but not worth it, even on special its not worth it, try again Uplay and ivory tower, this could have been a forza beater if you found proper physics, but this is miles away fromthe cake.
11697	ive made a $85 mistake 85$ game still has microtransactions multiplayer sucks and extremely limited max 8 players i believe not much to do besides racing compared to forza 4 the crew loses in everything
11698	Missing car to buy and money to buy them. Love the free roaming and some challenge. Mission are all the same and those that are not race, are not really good. I dislike the destroy the other car mission. Got Stock often in you cant go out zone because we didn't think you will go there. The police go way too fast. Making the escape no fun. The other car on the road doesn't have the quality I would love to see. The car you can painfully make after finding all the piece is not really good. You will have stat for your car.... yes you will have 6754 brake level..... and 6785 engine level.... in a car game , I would have love to see max speed 150 - after upgrade 164. not +3 on the already no meaning big number. With a couple of big update and change in the design, the game can be save. But for me I don't think I will have more time to but on that game.
11699	Telling you right now, do not waste your money on this game. Bought this game on release for $59.99 and damn that was such a waste of money. This is one of those racing games that just feel so slow and boring. The customization is awesome though. Overall save your money and dont buy this game.
11700	Game crush at checkpoint 80/110.... 45 minutes waste for NOTHING!!!!! FxxK!!!! Good game but bad UBISOFT!!! Poor Server...
11701	ive played in 0.3 hours its the woorst game it requerd ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ubihard â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11702	good game... nice graphic... not much for customization even though they give you the option but its just for show and most of the things like bumpers are all alike some difference are only extra lights most people playing inside are mostly toxic especially in PVP events (in my experience) NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH! mostly russians or some other languages car performance not accurate...i mean come on how is koenigsegg agera with the top speed of 440km/h lose to laferrari with the top speed of 350km/h?! and koenigsegg doesn't reach that top speed...but McLaren 12C when u change it to circuit spec and full car lvl of 1299 u can reach to speeds of 407km max (if anyone knws what cars can break 400km please tell me) doesn't really live up to the name as the crew when u can only have 4 people in a 'crew' and they might say its mmo when the fact is its not when the most people in one session is less than 10 people....i would say buy if u are interested in playing racing games and free roaming just to past time or wanna play ur own cross country races with your friends but seriously...buy when there is sales AI DRIVES FASTER THAN 420km/h and puts a distances of 20km between u and them everything changed ever since wild run came out. PERF CARS CAN DRIFT EASILY (aren't they suppose to stick to the ground?), CIRCUIT CARS CANNOT TURN AS SHARP AS IT DID (previously the turns u can tackle at high speeds now u cant...circuit cars might stick to the ground as much as perf but not so much till it cant turn at all....I HAVE TO MAKE A WIDE TURN AT THE 2ND GEAR!) SCRATCH THAT IF U INTERESTED IN CAR GAMES THIS IS AN ABOMINATION! WAIT TILL LIKE ITS UNDER $10 IF NOT U ARE GONNA REGRET IT! IF THE ADMINS OF THE GAME ARE READING THIS...MAKING GRAN TURISMO/FORZA HAVE SEX WITH NEED FOR SPEED AND MAKE A BABY CALLED THE CREW U ARE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME! YOU ALREADY GOT THE CAR SPECS WRONG DUN TRY TO MAKE THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE REAL LIKE THOSE GOD LIKE GAMES LIKE GRAN TURISMO / FORZA! EARNING MONEY IS WAY OUT OF REACH... i dun mind driving 1hr+ to earn 160000 but when the rubber band effect comes into play and crush u like an ant everytime that sucks so bad! i have no choice because i put my faith into ubisoft I BOUGHT THE CREW GOLD EDITION AT 120SGD BUT THOSE THAT HAVE NOT PURCHASE THE GAME DO NOT DO IT! UNTIL IT IS AT THE BELOW 10 DOLLAR PRICE RANGE...THE IN GAME PURCHASES SUCK SO BADLY...PPL FROM UBISOFT AND IVORY TOWERS! LEARN FROM OTHER GAMES! IF I PURCHASE CREW CREDITS IM SUPPOSED TO GET A TON OF CAR AND MOD THEM ACCORDINGLY NOT HALF FINISHED CARS.....FELLOW GAMERS DUN BUY THIS GAME IF IT IS NOT UNDER $10!!
11703	hands off that game  unplayable scam â¥â¥â¥â¥  started pretty solid ended unbalanced, micro stutter, $$$$$ ubi$oft, pay for immortal bikes and â¥â¥â¥â¥  â¥â¥â¥â¥ UBI SOFT
11704	massiv Multiplayer... â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t! you cant play whit your frinds at all and they dont even try to fix it.. just telling pep to Open ports to be abel to play whit frinds, Sulden have to open port to play online.. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and its not even working to open ports. Fix the Game FFS..
11705	Not worth more than 19.99. The visuals and driving are just like saints row 3-4.
11706	At first i had a posative review of this game but i cant keep fooling myself anymore. i really wanted to love this game but the more i play it the more i see how little effort was put into the details. There arent any weather effects. Many of the cars use the same engine noise with just little tweaks. You can only drive with 7 other people at a time. theres not as much car customization as Id like. Many cars have hardly any customization options such as the aston martins and the ferraris. I paid a lot of money for the gold edition of this game and to see it on sale already really annoys me. If you want to explore America this is the game for you. If you want anything more than that get something else.
11707	A lot of proplem in connecting with friends, I can't meet up with a friend in this game, Most people get frustrated trying to connect with a friend, if you wanna play this game alone, then go ahead it's a nice game, online then you gonna have a hard time.
11708	SAVE MONEY - DON'T BUY - SCREENSHOTS BELOW  I bought this game two years ago and I had hope that this game will be much better than TDU2, but I was wrong. To be onest playing TDU2 offline gives me more fun. TDU2 and lot of any older games have even better graphis and optimalization.  And also thank you Ubisoft for â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up this game with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t DLC - I bought bike that comes with Wild Run DLC but now I need to buy Calling All Units DLC to get that bike back! WTF?! And of course there's a lot of glitches. I can't save changes in options becouse of 'try again later' so every time I run the game I have to change it (why? there's screenshot below). Also the game is crashing sometimes while loading races or garage.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785947569   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=815530331   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563514373   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=677410786   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658696737   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599935792 
11709	Another edit after new dlc release:  Those greedy motherf*s want 20 bucks for wild run dlc + another 25 for season pass + another 25 for calling all units dlc, and game have microtransactions... are you f* kidding me. I am pis*ed off and I will not buy any more Ubisoft games until this â¥â¥â¥â¥ ends.   I like the crew, but I dislike their greedy policy. Buy the Crew but do not buy dlcs if you have any dignity, buy something else, wait until new NFS comes out or simply go and play old classics again.
11710	I crashed into an invisible wall in my first hour of playing the game. I was trying to make a jump from a ramp, and the car completely bugged out. Basically it kept flying up about 5 feet in the air and insta killing my character, and then respawning me to only do the same thing the minute I accelerated. I wish I took screenshots, but the moment was entrancing to say the least. 10/10.
11711	I like the base game, and i like wild run but caling all units has a lot of bugs, not all cars that were presented in the patchnote and is completely unfair for the police. the story missions are a joke. 25$ are way to much for this little Add-On
11712	The Crew was a completely different game when it was released. For all the cheap gamers, and free UBi 30 people getting the game, here is a breakdown you may want to read up on before investing hours in this game. The Crew of today is a broken mess.  On paper, The Crew is a fantastic game that gives you the freedom to drive how you like. On road, or off road, in performance vehicles and off road buggies. The RPG element assures you keep playing to level up your car to max tune, while finding which part will give you the extra edge in PVP races. Speaking of PVP races, that element is completely broken. You are not able to play online the way you want, and are forced into a voting system of both map and car spec. The physics are either too heavy or light as a feather, with car control being changed on vehicles every singe update. The amount of grinding needed to max a car to its full potential is unreal and not very rewarding.   I am going to break this down into points, and remember I say all this because I loved the game, I had very high hopes for the game and in the end it let me down.   I have over 500 hours invested. It was THE game I was hoping would fill my racing void, and for a long time, it did. However, a day 1 vet of The Crew has some words for you devs. Here is what they DON'T want you to know about...   1- Your internal network for people to connect to and play together has always been broken. We cant find people to race with, connectivity issues, lag issues, being dropped and unable to see others in the world has always been there. You had the opportunity to make a rock solid online experience, but you never did complete it.   2- Due to your unfinished and broken internal online network, people couldn't connect and play online in PVP. Once the numbers dropped to 200-500 people worldwide played at any given time, there wasn't enough people to connect to specific regions in PVP. Personally I enjoy C spec in West Coast maps, but S or R or D specs you may sit for 20 minutes and not find a match and connect to a lobby. So, your solution: merge ALL PVP together and opt into a voting system for the map and spec. This breaks online, not allowing us to play how we want online. Due to your game loosing popularity, we the players now get to suffer by not being able to play the game the way it was intended.   3- Wild Run. Why did you force us ALL to update to the wild run infrastructure? I didn't pre order it, or buy it day 1, but when I launch my game the day Wild Run went public, my game had the splash screen, the D pad challenges and all the landmarks and spots in freedrive. I have content that I DO NOT have access too, but it is there for me to drive too. Once you engage or visit Wild Run content, is asks you to go buy the DLC. What a cheap low ball approach to DLC. There should be 1 main game (how it was originally) and Wild Run separate with all the DLC content. If I dont have the new DLC, DON'T SHOW IT TO ME. Don't force me into DLC, its just a greasy cash grab approach.  4- Vehicle handling and rubber banding. Sure, you give many options to fine tune your cars handling, and we appreciate that. But overall, you tweaked the games handling on all the cars so much that once you get used to a cars handling, its modified in the next update. The physics are horrible, and have always been the weak point of the game. Sloppy, laggy and unresponsive, or too responsive controls. The weight of the cars, and balance is something I do not enjoy. Then when Wild Run came out, you re did the whole physics engine to allow jumping. Well, how can you allow jumping when the physics engine doesn't comprehend that type of behavior to begin with? Its a total mess driving cars at this point. Its like a air mattress, that was bad to begin with, but you keep patching the holes every time it gets punctured. It's still crappy, looks worse and will never be the same.   Should I go on? I only say all this, not as a hater, but as someone who fought the battle side by side with you. When NFS, and other racers came out, I sat here and defended you, pushed all my friends your way, and had long road trips day and night, streaming and private with friends. Now, seeing you want to force spoon feed us another DLC at $60 just blows me away. Go look at the stats, at any given time 100-300 people play this game worldwide. It's time to lay The Crew down to rest, I won't be surprised when you announce servers will be shut down in a year. RIP Crew, it really has been a 'Wild Run'  Trust me, you will find something to love in The Crew, for me, it was to stop playing it..
11713	This game delivers what it promises. It's a Huge open world to explore, the customization is very diverse, though, lacking from car to car (This Raid Spec Car drives just like this Raid Spec Car I wanted to replace, which fells like a horrible Dirt Spec car, ETCâ¦), and the multiplayer is questionable, but playable.  The open world is just that. An open world. Literally, if you start in New York with your fastest, corner carving monster at the end of the game and drive West, you might hit water in 30 minutes if you haul serious â¥â¥â¥. Enough said about thatâ¦  Customization is great, until you hit Raid Spec and, to a lesser extent, Circuit Spec. No Body modifications, which though it is not a horrible feature, it does take a little away from the game when you get into Multiplayer, and everyone's car looks exactly the sameâ¦ And the Raid Spec is, by far, the worse handling rendition I have ever seen. If there was not a Dirt Spec, it wouldn't be that bad, but when my R34 Skyline (With a ride Height of about, say 4-5 inches) can take a good 8 foot jump without breaking a sweat at 140 MPH, yet a Silverado looking like a Baja competitor (With a ride Height of 1-1.5 FT) takes the same jump around 100 MPH and spins, contorts, rolls, and loses an insane amount of speed is not balanced in the right way. Another bit of Customization that I like and dislike is that the car (Or truck) that you start with makes little to know difference. In fact, the best Performance Spec car is a Ford Focus, if you take the time to grind and get maximum level parts with the best bonuses. You take an Aventador against the Focus, and in Full Stock Spec, the Lamborghini wins, hands down. But as soon as you drop the Aventador into a 'Specialty', it drives as if it is running on 4 cylinders with 3 of its tires slashedâ¦  The Multiplayer is worthy of Next Car Game: Wreckfestâ¦ All of my experience with the Random Lobbies have been people driving SUV's either careening all over the road, or driving the wrong way just for the sake of making people rage. Bear in mind what was said in the previous paragraphâ¦ It doesn't matter if they're in a Silverado and you're in an Aventador: They are both potentially equal.  â¦ That's my opinion. Not saying you should buy it or pass on it, but hopefully this review gave you a little insight into what to expect should you buy it.  Honestly, i was excited for this game... But that excitement faded really quick... You buy it, but then it begs you to use the 'premium currency'. Yes, you can buy in game money for the game you already paid for. And what's worse, it's 'economy' is far worse than Need For Speed Carbon. If you win a race for the first time, you get $5,000. The next time you win it, you get $500. The only exception to this is the 'crew' oriented faction races, which the cheapest you can do is for 12,000, but it also takes a good 20-30 minutes to complete... 10 minutes of you've already done it 1,000 times and have a hawkeye for traffic... And, bear in mind, the Cars are not cheap here.  The gameplay at it's core is decent enough... I suppose it would have to be for a game with 1, 2 hours tops worth of story... Like most Ubisoft, or MP focused games, this ones Huge downside is it's community, and it's META...  Overall, i wouldn't recommend it if your looking for a good racing game... A driving game, maybe?...
11714	Changing my review of this, I orginally favoured it but Ihave bately played this since launch, the economy is all kinds of jacked up making earning money for new cars a total grindfest. Drives ok missions are ok.  But felt like it was going to take ages to ever move off my starter car. Maybe thats diffrent today mind you but when I last played that wasnt the case.
11715	  Dont forget to visit the police shop, You have a free police car waiting.. YEAH thanks ZOE, free by paying RM95 for it.. After the update Calling All Units, the game is crappy now.. thanks UBISOFT for ruining the game
11716	I can no longer play the game. I get a message saying that it stooped working every time I try to play it now. I would be more upset about it if it was a game that is worthwhile, but the little bit of it that I have played was not that fun anyway. I don't think I will be buying any more games from Ubisoft.
11717	I bought this game because i wanted to drive around in usa but instead i have to do missions.
11718	Bought this game on steam for 12.50 as it was on offer. After reading all the reviews I was a bit worried about the issues but I thought 'eh why not it's Â£12.50' .   After 20 mins of playing, the game managed to crash 5 times. I have looked for tested fixes or word from Ubisoft, however like many others here advised, nothing has been done apart from blaming Nvidia and advising to download an old driver which may or may not fix it, which is not an option as some of my games require the newset drivers and ALL of my games work with them just fine. Another thing they tend to do is ask players to log support tickets with the error logs, however I am yet to see a solution to the 'The Crew has stopped responding' issue.  I'm running an overkill setup with 32GB ram, 980Ti (6GB), i7-6700k , I've never encountered these kinds of issues with any of the newest games on the market.  It's a real shame as this game has a great potential, it looks great and I REALLY wanted to play a good racing game with a lot of customisation options now that NFS has gone down the drain, but instead I got a pile of crashes and disappointment.  I've already refunded the game as I could not be bothered to carry on looking for stupid 'fixes' while being backhanded by Ubisoft.
11719	I like the base game, and i like wild run but caling all units has a lot of bugs, not all cars that were presented in the patchnote and is completely unfair for the police. the story missions are a joke. 25$ are way to much for this little Add-On
11720	SAVE MONEY - DON'T BUY - SCREENSHOTS BELOW  I bought this game two years ago and I had hope that this game will be much better than TDU2, but I was wrong. To be onest playing TDU2 offline gives me more fun. TDU2 and lot of any older games have even better graphis and optimalization.  And also thank you Ubisoft for â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up this game with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t DLC - I bought bike that comes with Wild Run DLC but now I need to buy Calling All Units DLC to get that bike back! WTF?! And of course there's a lot of glitches. I can't save changes in options becouse of 'try again later' so every time I run the game I have to change it (why? there's screenshot below). Also the game is crashing sometimes while loading races or garage.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785947569   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=815530331   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563514373   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=677410786   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658696737   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599935792 
11721	Another edit after new dlc release:  Those greedy motherf*s want 20 bucks for wild run dlc + another 25 for season pass + another 25 for calling all units dlc, and game have microtransactions... are you f* kidding me. I am pis*ed off and I will not buy any more Ubisoft games until this â¥â¥â¥â¥ ends.   I like the crew, but I dislike their greedy policy. Buy the Crew but do not buy dlcs if you have any dignity, buy something else, wait until new NFS comes out or simply go and play old classics again.
11722	I crashed into an invisible wall in my first hour of playing the game. I was trying to make a jump from a ramp, and the car completely bugged out. Basically it kept flying up about 5 feet in the air and insta killing my character, and then respawning me to only do the same thing the minute I accelerated. I wish I took screenshots, but the moment was entrancing to say the least. 10/10.
11723	Bought this game on steam for 12.50 as it was on offer. After reading all the reviews I was a bit worried about the issues but I thought 'eh why not it's Â£12.50' .   After 20 mins of playing, the game managed to crash 5 times. I have looked for tested fixes or word from Ubisoft, however like many others here advised, nothing has been done apart from blaming Nvidia and advising to download an old driver which may or may not fix it, which is not an option as some of my games require the newset drivers and ALL of my games work with them just fine. Another thing they tend to do is ask players to log support tickets with the error logs, however I am yet to see a solution to the 'The Crew has stopped responding' issue.  I'm running an overkill setup with 32GB ram, 980Ti (6GB), i7-6700k , I've never encountered these kinds of issues with any of the newest games on the market.  It's a real shame as this game has a great potential, it looks great and I REALLY wanted to play a good racing game with a lot of customisation options now that NFS has gone down the drain, but instead I got a pile of crashes and disappointment.  I've already refunded the game as I could not be bothered to carry on looking for stupid 'fixes' while being backhanded by Ubisoft.

11725	SAVE MONEY - DON'T BUY - SCREENSHOTS BELOW  I bought this game two years ago and I had hope that this game will be much better than TDU2, but I was wrong. To be onest playing TDU2 offline gives me more fun. TDU2 and lot of any older games have even better graphis and optimalization.  And also thank you Ubisoft for â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up this game with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t DLC - I bought bike that comes with Wild Run DLC but now I need to buy Calling All Units DLC to get that bike back!

11726	Car game has story. What is this Cars 2?
11727	  Dont forget to visit the police shop, You have a free police car waiting.. YEAH thanks ZOE, free by paying RM95 for it.. After the update Calling All Units, the game is crappy now.. thanks UBISOFT for ruining the game
11728	Poorly Optimized for PC. Even if you drop your settings and your game looks like mush. You'll get below 30 frames
11729	I enjoyed Wild Run, played it a lot. There wasn't much in the way of Car performance customization but there was some.   Calling all Units... I got it for Christmas, what a waste. The DLC adds a lot of bugs including but not limited to disappearing waypoints/guidelines, physics going bananas and randomly hitting nothing. Like others have said the game is not well optimized but that is not new to this DLC. They have removed the limited car performance customization options they had for max level parts (lvl60), now all parts you get have a 'Acceleration boost' bonus. This bonus doesn't apply to many cars as they come with max acceleration. I have found that the cars all feel the same at max level now and have a very hard time power sliding or drifting( With Non-drift spec). They added a 'find parts to get a car' feature... this is a BAD feature as money is now useless.  I would not recommend this game to anyone anymore. Even if they fixed all the bugs, which is doubtful as pre-Calling all Units bugs are still there... I would not recommend it as there is just not enough to do anymore. I use to enjoy finding the right stat boost that fit my style of driving for the car I was currently using.
11730	I purchased this game thinking I would have access to the whole game - it turns out to complete certain missions you have to buy the DLC, 2 games worth at Â£20 each.   I had to get a refund for this game as there is definitely much better driving games out there and did not think it was worth buying the 2 DLC's to stop the constant notifications.  Very disappointed.
11731	The game itself is awesome. By that i mean that the car physics, the customizing, the open world (and how large and vast it is), the different terains and eviroments, the graphics even the story isnt too bad, but when it comes down to it annoying 'challenges' on the road you cant really avoid, the annoying pop ups to get the cop dlc, the poor optimazation of the button layout for controllers where x is for drift but also if youve just finished a challenge or anything that would bring up a sort of prompt and you go to drift and accidently press x ( my case xbox controller) and then oh dear f****** me ive restarted a challenge 6 kms back -_- All this to conclude that the games idea is amazing and id love to see it redone with a little more optimazation and less cash grab tactics. I will be refunding this for sure.
11732	Hi!  At first I downloaded The Crew Demo, after playing it for couple of hours I decided to buy the Steam version of The Crew Ultimate Edition. My steam libraray shows all packages as bought. But now, when I want to play The Crew it is still the Trial Version (Test Version) which doesnÂ´t start anymore.  I also received 2 Uplay Activation Codes (Season Pass and WW Gold) after buying the game, but there is no way to activate these two parts of The Crew since only the test version starts ebery time a try the play the game ...  What a start! I should have sticked to the Demo instead of buying the game, now nothing works!  Robin
11733	I hat this  uplay.com  wont late me play the game. I play this on my xbox1.  The game is not that bad but if they have the game on steam why dose it not run on steam  Not worth the money wont work on my pc
11734	This game is not bad. It feels like ExciteBike at times, and in good, good ways. The controls are good (keyboard at least) and the feel of controlling is pretty much right-on. The style, graphics, and general components of making a game come alive are all there.  But there's one big no-go for me, which is the presentation. The concept is fine. A bit dull, but fine. However, there are insufferable cut scenes that are neither helpful nor entertaining, that cannot be skipped. These go on for far, far longer than they need to. This is a game about riding a vehicle, jumping or ducking, and trying to spin as much as possible before you hit the ground again. The story (really, not much going on in that department) is such a thin, forgettable thing, that there is no need for a single cutscene, let alone several.  There are tips and tricks screens and bubbles throughout the game, but they are often shown at the tail-end of a cutscene when you are already either frustrated or have tuned out, and after several minutes of irrelevant blather, the useful information is displayed just long enough to recognize what's happening. But before you can read the part about playing the game that could end up helping you, it is gone. It's the Keyser Soze of a hint-screen.  When I finally reach the gameplay, there is a fun, balanced, entertaining game underneath. But the shiny, overdone, obnoxious, and person-who-invited-themself-over-and-hasn't-figured-out-it's-time-to-go-home-already atmosphere of all the parts of this game that are not actually the playing of it, really, really sour me on it.  I would heartily recommend this if you like the ExciteBike gameplay and don't mind making a sandwich while the cutscenes play. But instead of waiting for my game to let me play it, I'll probably just move on to something else.
11735	As a completionist, this game infuriates me. I feel like this game doesn't accommodate for the hardcore audience, even though the game has included 'Pro Medals' for players who strive to achieve every task in a level.    There is usually too much going on screen, making it difficult to comprehend what is relevant on most of the time. Some levels are crippled by this feature, because you must remember every part of the level in order to achieve the tasks. I don't see any possibility of a player completing some levels during their first try, regardless of skill, because there is no time to react appropriately.    Other levels task you to '100% combo', which entails performing consecutive tricks through the whole level with only a short period between each, or risk losing the combo and needing to restart. This poses a rather annoying problem, as the buttons for tricks need to be held for a particular amount of time, and in the case of the 360 controller, mapped to the very inconvenient bumpers; which is frustrating because you're typically trying to control your speeds with the triggers at the same time.    I also feel like the game doesn't teach you to play correctly; the are some moments within the early levels where there are collectibles just out of reach, I still don't know how to obtain them, and I've made it up to the final chapter of the game.    I'm not going to go into details about the messy UI, or the pathetic progression methods, or gameplay inconsistency, or this review will be far too long. There are not many redeeming qualities for this game, maybe some younger children will enjoy it, but I do not recommend this game. I obtained this game as part of a Humble Bundle pack; If I purchased it individually, I would be asking the Steam staff for a full refund.
11736	This game had potential and great idea. Maybe it's just me, but I feel everything in it is too chaotic. Looks like developers wanted to distracts player at all cost... explosions and flying objects are everywhere! It should be possible to give neutral rating here on Steam because I am sure that some people will enjoy this title. Game is not so bad at all.
11737	This review is for the Mac port only.  While Joe Danger 2 seems to be an amazing game, the shortcomings of the Mac port ruin it for me. There are two major problems, both caused by the game's launcher overlay.  1. Inability to choose full screen mode. Why I'm only left with 'Windowed' mode is beyond me, as the game lists proper resolutions for my display to choose as window size.  2. The game recognizes my Logitech Rumblepad 2 controller, however the buttons simply don't work, just the X/Y controls. I'm sure this is something that could easily be fixed if the game had a control setup option. It does have one, in the launcher, ONLY for the keyboard. In the game itself you're only presented with a screen that 'explains' the controls with no option to re-bind them.  Some may argue that it's tricky to port games to a different OS, but with games like Rogue Legacy that handle controller support on Mac impeccably, there's just no room for excuse anymore. Full controller support? Not true.  All I can say is, I'm really glad I got this game as part of The Humble Indie Bundle X, because if I got this at full price I'd be furious right now.
11738	This game makes me wish Steam had a neutral rating. It's not bad, but it's not really good either. The screen is often too cluttered with explosions and various other moving parts, making it easy to lose track of your stuntman. Check out the original game first. It's the better of the two. If you like that one enough, then I suppose you'd probably get some enjoyment out of this one as well.
11739	 If you like repetitive gameplay, this is for you. The various reskins, lack of variety, and tedious gameplay (which is quite easy) will please you. Again, if you like dull gameplay, I can't recommend this enough.   EDIT: It does get harder, but it still lacks some variety. It just feels very basic. The presentation is also terrible. If it were a game where gameplay were the focus I can see this being a worthy title, as it is a good sidescrolling runner, but its presentation is disgusting.
11740	Not Support 2 Xbox Controller. Say byebye to Multiplayer Co-op.  I have 3 Xbox Controller and I can only play with 1 at the same time.
11741	Mac users should skip this unforunately unless you have a genuine Xbox controller and even then I am not sure if it works or not. It did not work with a Logitech F-510 Rumblepad which can be setup either as analog or Xinput so who knows. I do know this, there is no option to remap the buttons so there was no way to attempt setting it up. Controller setup is non-existent in this game. The launcher lets you set keyboard options and does not acknowlege controllers at all. This is pretty strange since who would want to play this with a keyboard? I guess maybe a few people but not the majority I wouldn't think. Checking ingame options just shows the controls on an Xbox controller which should have worked on the Rumblepad (normally I have no issues) but did not. It responded to some but no acceleration is a little tough to deal with in a racer. Anyway, I don't want to knock the game itself as I was not able to play it but just wanted to warn Mac users to be wary. If you do have a genuine Xbox controller you might want to verify in the forums that it works on Mac for somebody else before spending anything on this title. Easy come, easy go here since I got it in a Humble Bundle. Good thing!
11742	The support of the gamepad is buggy on linux. It starts well but after one ride and the first return to the menu, it's like the gamepad is going completely insanely crazy. It's a USB xbox 360 gamepad that always works. And it works without a problem on shank and shank 2 using steam for linux. So I'm sure it does not come from my system or the steam client.  This game has no interest at all played with the keyboard. If the devs fix that I would totally change my review for a positive one.  The game is actually fun and performs well on linux. The gamepad bug is killing it. ( I tried using both xpad and xboxdrv )  For windows users, no problem at all the gamepad works flawlessly.  Besides it's a quite funny game trying to get that japanese crazyness from arcade games. And they succeeded at it pretty well in my opinion. The graphics are nice and colourful. I am actually sad of that situation.
11743	This game is too chaotic for me. It feels like a mess. I think that Bit.Trip Runner is much better choice from that kind of games.
11744	'None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why they should.'  They shouldn't
11745	I did not like this game. The gaming mechanics that makes you do the same thing again and again. I bought the Humble Bundle X and started playing this game, but it was rally boring to do the same stuff. You might want to check it out, but I won't recommend it.
11746	Get the first Joe Danger, they ruined the whole gameplay mechanic in this one. This one feels too much on rails and there's less to do in the levels even though they are more flashy.
11747	Just don't, don't spend a dollar on it.  Why? - The game in the beginig is kind of fun, but get repetitive and boring.  - Online is not online(on internet), it is LAN. - They tried (I think) to adapt the game to PC, but controls, effects and the performance are in general a shi*t - Unskippable cutscenes - The game is using xbox control as hints ON PC!  Just make your wallet happy, go buy something that worth
11748	It really lacks quality, specially on the voice. I'm not even sure if a kid would be entertained with this for long, I got bored after playing three levels.
11749	There are many ways to convert a game for PC, but unfortunately the creators of this one chose the 'do nothing at all' one. It might be enjoyable after you've written down what all the console buttons in the game correspond to on your keybord and learn it by heart... but I'm probably not going to bother.
11750	This game feels like some kind of weird port. The controls are pretty sucky and the graphics pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not much fun at all.
11751	There's just too much going on. It's as if they combined every semi-decent platformer and made it as over saturated as they possibly could. I usually love these type of platform games but Joe Danger should have chosen a safer career.  I couldn't even play it long enough to unlock the steam cards.
11752	It's basically Uniracers, except with unskippable cutscenes that go on far too long (and even contain areas of absolutely no action whatsoever - a lot of them are like watching a highlight reel with a five second fade-out and five second fade-in in between each clip) and way, way, WAY too much activity going on on-screen. It seems to have been meant for larger displays, but even on a 50' LCD there's so much background activity and random details on the track that figuring out what needs to be jumped, what needs to be collected, and which route to take is a matter of constant trial-and-error.  Keyboard controls can't be rebound, but are generally acceptable (arrow keys + WASD, basically).  The core of this game (2D speed-running) is fun, and the internal physics/mechanics are good. But the annoying cutscenes and over-active race screens render this inferior to Uniracers - a game which came out twenty years ago. For under $3 or so, there's worse ways to spend your money, but full-price ($15 as of this review) is a hilarious joke - just not a very positive sort of 'hilarious'.

11754	Must be played with Xbox 360 controller. And it sucks.
11755	I feel this game would be better if there were snakes involved. Except the snakes are under my desk and giving me poisonous bites for which there is no anti venom. That would be more enjoyable than joe danger 2 the movie.
11756	  It's like a 'tarded, more colourful, gay brother of excite bike    You   CANNOT   skip cutscenes, and the footage in them isn't even from your gameplay, it's just a collage of pre-recorded scenes that the devs played.  The difficulty rises up so fast, and you are given such a short learning curve that you are just going to a) rage quit  b) leave it in the background for the trading cards and after that delete it and forget about it forever.   I did point b.   I understand that this is an xbox port and it should be played with a gamepad, but the devs were so lazy that they did not made a controller page for the keyboard, so you're going to have a hard time nailing the controls if you're playing with a keyboard.  They exagerrated a bit with the set animations and blings and whatnot, I mean, there's so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ going on around you on the screen that it gets completely distracting at times.  What about the checkpoints? There are a few levels that have checkpoints, but most of them you have to complete in one run, and this can surely get pretty annoying after a while, make one wrong move and *poof* back at the starting line with you.  It's fun at the beginning, but suddenly becomes this repetitive, clunky, tedious game that has an annoying redneck-ish narrator voice yelling just to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off more.
11757	This is one of those games that you just hold down the right key to progress to the right of the screen to win easily as you fall asleep, drooling all over the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing place, dreaming of a better time when you didn't waste your money on this boring â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11758	Not that fun, kind of confusing to get at first and isn't very fun from what I have played  5.2/10
11759	This game is awful. It looks like it wants to be similar to Trials HD, but clutters the screen with so much crap that it's impossible to tell what's going on. The camera angle also contributes to a lot of failures, due to not being able to see threats until you're about to hit them. It's beyond my understanding why anyone would play this.
11760	God forgotten port from consoles. Trash!
11761	This is most disappointing sequel i ever seen, i remember when i played demo version of first one and i loved, but when i got this game from humble bundle and startered to play this game, i really wanted to cry. This sequel doesn't have that awesome fell as first one and gameplay of that game is worse than first one. Hellogame, how dare you ruin my favourite motor bike racing game ;( i am going to cry now. Have nice day
11762	Gameplay is too dull and repetitive. I played with keyboard but the tutorial hints gave me keys for a game controller.
11763	Well, the game is a brutal port. The menus are confusing. The first level is impossible since they don't tell you how to play or what to do. It is just brutal.
11764	Super awkuard controls, inconsistent game play game balence, gets repetative after 2 levels, later levels rely on the player memorising the course rather than reacting to events. pretty boring unoriginal game. nothing I havn't seen on one of those side scrolling bike games where you do back flips and stuff, so definatly not worth spending any money on
11765	Kinda strange game. For me the actual gameplay was very blurry. I had the graphics setting on high and everything. Only during actual gameplay though.
11766	I like the music and the graphics are colorful and fit in perfectly with the music. So why the thumbs down? Gameplay and being stuck=no fun. The game needs to be a bit easier to play. Its frusterating to play a game and to be locked out of levels because of not grabbing enough stars. Grrrrr. The game is not as tough as the first one for sure. However I still think if the game play was lowered a little bit more the game would shine a lot more.  I can also point to examples of this already happening. Nintendo made a killing by lowering the difficulty in there games and then after completing the main game you would have a newgame+ that would be a lot harder and for experts only. Something Joe Dirt 3 should look at. Great graphics to be sure but hard as nails in the later levels make it less then fun. I would give it a 5/10
11767	OK game , Doesn't feel native to PC, default mapping and onscreen indicators based on xbox controller. requires a good graphic card to play.
11768	If you have an XBOX pad and you have configured it to work just like on XBOX, this might be a decent game..  For the rest of us, this game is a joke - a 'port' which wasn't edited in any single way from the XBOX version, so you're left wondering wtf you're supposed to be doing as all instructions during the game are XBOX keys.  Instead of making DLC for this joke of a game, the developers should spend a few minutes at least switching the XBOX commands to whatever is set on the PC. I mean, Steam games are supposed to work on the PC, no?
11769	seriously, first level is ridiculous...words cannot explain how frustratingly annoying this game is.
11770	I like the game but it is obviously a console port; I can ride my vehicle, do stunts, jump but they need to create a PC port to make it easier.
11771	Annoyingly loud announcer, poor PC controls, and just overall feels pointless. Stay away from this.
11772	The book was better
11773	It's Trials Evolution without any of the difficulty. I'm assuming this is for extremely young children?
11774	I really want to like this game, but the controls really SUCK!!! They are setup for an Xbox 360 controller in the description and I haven't found a way to change the mapping so I can play on the PC. If I ever get a better way to controll it I might give it a better review, but until then it sucks!
11775	I fell asleep. At least I've supported No Man's Sky. But meh..
11776	One of the absolute worst PC ports I've played. It is absolutely atrocious. The game itself is not very good either. Not sure what I was expecting.
11777	Don't buy this game... many people suffers from some strange blurry bug - HUD is fine but main scene is blurred and devs don't give a sht.  For example as you can see in this  discussion .
11778	This game is nowhere near as fun as it should be. It has lots of potential, but annoying issues made it no fun for me.  Graphics and sound are good. Controls are okay, but poorly explained. There appear to be hint screens displayed at the end of races, but they stay on the screen for 2 or 3 seconds and are replaced with something else before I can read them (they disappear even though no button is being pressed).  There is a help option listed in the poorly designed menu, but it literally provides no help at all.  I don't think many people are playing or enjoying this game much. I only made it through the first three or four levels. On the last level I got stuck on I couldn't make the target time and yet my time was faster than 65% of players.  I'm surprised this is the sequel to a game, these issues should have been corrected long ago.
11779	Just no
11780	The game was quite fun... for like 5 minutes. It is pretty annoying to start all over and over again because of missing one keystroke. The game is full of colours, animation, effects and sounds, and that makes it confusing and overcrowded with effects. I got it in a humble bundle, wouldn't have bought it for myself.
11781	I felt like this game was a waste of time. The controls feel clunky. The hints they give disapear so fast that you will be alittle confused about the controls at first. I feel like this is a game u play on your phone. I just felt like i could have spent my time on other more enjoyable games then this one.
11782	It's okay I guess
11783	there are to many games like this out there that do a better job. 5.10
11784	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ game. First level was impossible, why you would pay $15 for it is beyond me.
11785	Possibly the worst game I've ever played... and I've played some pretty bad games.
11786	This game is very bad, on my macbook pro retina 2012 top is very slow at 1024x768 O_O IT IS UNBELIVABLE! Gameplay ridiculus, sometimes I didn't explode when i touch the bomb! LOL
11787	Before getting this game i read some reviews and i was thinking this game would be a blast, this is the type of game that i love to play on my iPhone, but unfortunately i din't get too much. the first two Act was fun but after that keep getting very repetitive.   Two things i liked was the levels design and the OST. Also if you planing playing this on PC, for the love of god, buy some controller first, you won't be able to play this game right with keyboard and mouse.   Not a top priority to recommend to anyone.   ~ 5/10
11788	Fun, until it gets incredibly annoying and not fun at all!
11789	Yes, if you are 12 and under, buy this game.
11790	Crashes immediately; not good.
11791	THIS GAME SUCKS! PC PORT IS UNPLAYABLE!
11792	I don't like it, it makes me sad because his brother, Carlos Danger, sent me pictures of his weenie.
11793	Game keeps crashing. Can't get past first level.
11794	Pretty unrealistic, some of these stunts are far too dangerous to act out in real life. They would just be CGI'd in during post-production. would be 7/10 but I'm subtracting 3 for no realism and 5 for teaching our kids how to be unsafe. -1/10
11795	A pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥, What were they thinking?
11796	Nope, nothing to see here.
11797	.
11798	Bad game. Not worth any money.
11799	Joe Danger 2: The Movie is a game not a movie. I played few levels and lol'd how simple and messy this game is.
11800	white male protagonist
11801	Fun little game, poor interface, bit childish. 7/15
11802	dont buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'game'
11803	This dev can't be bothered to test their games for PC.  Avoid.
11804	This game doens't really offer much to me.
11805	Let me just say that I enjoy this game, however I have chosen to vote down as it's 'Full Controller Support' is misleading -- particularly so in the sort of game a family might buy to play together at home. The game does not feature controller support for more than one player without downloading a third party program--which we shouldn't need to do and is basically false advertising in my book--so I am unable to play this with my girlfriend and kid.  Assuming this is fixed which has yet to happen I will change my review as the game is a lot of fun.
11806	Not a game i would recommend. 4/10
11807	I enjoyed the first Joe Danger quite a bit but this one is not up to par. The theme and the graphics are nice and fit really well with the game. The gameplay is fast and fluid. There is a lot going on screen and it really looks like you are filming a movie. But the level design is where this game fails.   The levels just get repetitive and you encounter the same problems throughout the game. The game quickly gets to the point where you have to memorize when you have to duck and when to jump. To avoid the same three hazards (bombs, spikes, and instances where you have to duck). The later levels just reuse some parts of the earlier levels. It just gets frustrating. If you are a fan of Joe Danger maybe get this, otherwise look for something else.
11808	I'm sorry, but i tried this game for 30min and found it extremely boring and completely unmotivated to do anything particular. I really can't see how 14 euro is justifiable for this game that might look somewhat nice, but has nothing else.
11809	This game is a good idea, poorly implemented, which mean only completionist players will find some enjoyment out of it. There is at least 3 big flaws that undo it.  The first problem are the controls. They are so many buttons to use (on a Xbox360 controller : up, down, left, right, A, B, X, LT, LB, RT, RB are all used while ingame !) that your brain will melt under the load when you try to go for highscores and complicated stars challenges.  The second problem is that theses controls are poorly explained. They give you informations about the controls only one by one, while playing a level. Try reading a speech bubble when you're turboing. That would probably lead to something like : 'Ppppppppppppppprrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssss Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx toooooooooooooo juuuuuuuuuuuu...'  There is no proper tutorial level to learn all controls at the same time in an unstresseful environment. Worse, what they call advanced tricks is only explained in later levels, even though they aren't that complicated, and would be extremely useful right from the beginning. For example, the Double X = double Jump is only explained half way through, even though it's mandatory for a star in level 2 or 3.  Finally, after all this if you've kept to the game, you will understand the third, and final thing that completely undo this game : it lacks clear objectives. In each level, you can go for challenge stars, time attack, or score attack, but there is not really a goal to reach. Finishing a level is very easy, so only theses optional objectives make sense. However, theses 3 objectives clash with one another :  - going for time usually means just rushing the level without getting the collectibles or doing figures (which is the main part of the scoring) - going for score usually means going as slow as you can get away with, and do lot of figures on the same place, which obviously will give you an atrocious time. Since there is no time penalty, it's still the 'best' way to do it, even though it's slow and boring. - finally going for stars usually impact negatively both time and score.  To sum it up, you can try all of theses, but it will feel more like grinding than overcoming challenges.  So for me, the game feel rather shallow, you set your own meaningless achievements, and go through similar level after similar levels, which does sometimes provide fun but usually is just a boring grind.   That also seems like a common opinion because if you check either the online leaderboards or the achievements stats, you will see that most people gave up early on this game, and no one cares enough about the game to try to achieves records (it's very easy to enter the top 100 or even the top 10 in some later levels).  I've spent quite some time in the game because I'm a completionist, and i do think that completionists will try at least get all the stars (but probably not compete for leaderboards). That group of players are probably the ones most likely to enjoy the game.   So, in the end, even if Joe Danger 2 is not a bad game and has some moments of brillance, it's just not good enough for me to recommend it  PS : Though I haven't tried multiplayer yet (because it's local only), i don't think it would work either. Multiplayer games are fun when everyone can enjoy the game, regardless of skill and end result, and it's even better if there is a way to handicap good players or boost newbie players (think bonus in Mario Kart) Unfortunately in Joe Danger you can get eliminated by being thrown out of the screen, and the winner is the one getting the most points. So it's fairly obvious that the difference in skill among players will be too much of a problem. A good player will just eradicate all opposition before the end of the race, while scoring more than the others.
11810	somehow actually made me feel sick
11811	After launch the game for the first time, I find myself very exiting about the game that I hear very well review. And after that is just disappointment...  I didn't play the first one and there is no real tutorial for the game. Only some messages that you don't have time to read at first.  After you manage to control the game you find that he is very repetitive and not that funny. I know it's arcade game but for the price I didnât get what I expected...  I still think this game could be perfect for small session but it would be far better on mobile at lower price.  So, to conclude, I can understand that people like this game but I will not be surprised that lot of people don't particularly like it.
11812	This game failed to hold my attention for the first few levels. I just can't recommend it when you can get Trials Evolution instead, which is more challenging, more inventive, and just more fun
11813	I'm afraid to say that this game is just too boring to carry on with. It's a shame, but the repeitive actions and forgetable senarios just don't stick. When was anything at stake or make any sense? Never. Mario may be a game about an Italian plumber saving a Princess from a big monster, but at least there was something to hang in there for. This unfortunately has nothing.  I'd say this is a super casual game for people who are looking at games and whether they should try playing them as beginners. If you're looking for something nutritious to play I would look elsewhere, as this one only gives it out so much at the beginning, and very little afterwards.
11814	This game is so wrong: - it breaks alt-tab - it grabs the mouse pointer (so combined with no alt-tab means youâre stuck in the game and canât even position its window correctly on your screen) - if you remap the keyboard controls, the game still tells you to press the default keys and not the ones youâve configured, so good luck to understand what to do - the main menu is not a text menu but some 3D scene where you have to guess where youâre supposed to clickâ¦ again good luck because itâs not obvious at all - the first level Iâve managed to launch starts with an obstacle that is seemingly impossible to pass, and the game gives absolutely zero hint on how to proceed.  So yeah, donât buy this.
11815	The game allows for keyboard remaping but it doesn't show the right keys on screen later on but the defualt ones. Also the game lack for proper gamepad support for other than Xbox 360 gamepad. While the game itself is playable I find it unapealing and repetitive.
11816	If you ever thought to yourself 'Man, I wish I could play Excitebike again.' This is the game for you. Well done, just not much deeper than the NES classic.
11817	Unplayable, as gamepad controls cannot be configured. Default mapping is total garbage.  This seems to run fine on a lower than minimum spec linux machine.
11818	do not buy for local co-op: 5 boring levels for ten minutes :(
11819	Worse than hitler
11820	At least it didn't cost much in a humblebundle.
11821	Try the TRIALS game franchise instead.  ------ It Did have TF2 characters, thats cool. It fun to hear Soldier yell Medic when youre hit, ot Sniper yell his battle cries.
11822	I bought it for local coop, however it only supports a single xbox controller.
11823	The game itself is kinda like BIT.TRIP RUNNER. You progress to the right until you reach the end goal, do some jumps/ducks/boosts to manuever yourself around obstacles, and find collectables along the way. There is no real story, just more like a theme to tie the game together. At first the controls can seem overwhelming, but you can get used to it in time. Xbox controller is almost mandatory- keyboard may be usable but it's obvious that they desgined it for controller. Pretty good replay value when you have steam friends that play because their ghosts will show up during the game (so you can compare how good/bad you're doing to their run). People who like to score attack and get high scores will probably enjoy this, and one-button restart helps. People who aren't that into the genre will find it hard to keep up (no real tutorial and game throws different things at you quickly without explanation) and will probably be better off playing a simpler one instead before moving on to this.  I find it annoying that it secretly installed xvid separately and it doesn't ask to remove/remove it when uninstalled, so I can't recommend it.
11824	Alright game but lacking something
11825	It looks and runs great on Linux but I found the menu system to be way too annoying.
11826	The game is fun, but the user base is very small. And they keep dividing it even more with Stadium and Canyon. Better have a look at Nations Foreve, a free game. Edit: It freezes a lot too.
11827	the game is fun but the servers are dead, also its an over priced dlc. 
11828	 http://steamcommunity.com/app/232910/discussions/0/496881136921969874/ 
11829	game is fine .. but not as good as canyon .. car controls is very tight for the game as loosly controled like this one ..  graphics and surrondings are nice .. but some blocks in mud areas seems to be difficult to get that they will hit u or not ..  i will prefer to go with stadium or canyon than this one !!
11830	When compared to its predecessor 'TrackManiaÂ² Canyon' ... this game falls short for me on so many levels. The gameplay and handling are nowhere near as tight. The cars look like they were designed in lego land. The stunts and tracks do not have the same 'awe' factor. Environment visuals are pretty good. But the fun factor just isn't there for me.
11831	FFS, UBi. Really? So my acceleration bindings have mysteriously disappeared. No problem, right? Just reassign it. Oops. There's bug there. Trying to reassign a key causes the program to crash so hard that only hitting the case power button can get you out (which also obviously causes Windows to shut down).  Head to Steam forums. See a thread where somebody is having issues. Solution is don't rebind keys. There's a bug at the moment. That thread was from February. *Looks at calender* May 31st.  Gee whiz, thanks Ubi. This is why you're so beloved. Thanks for this worthless POS I now own.  Why am I thanking you? You say this wasn't a gift? I paid money for this? Damn, you're right. I guess that makes me an idiot then.
11832	Maybe my opinion is coloured by nostalgia but didn't the older trackmania games use to be a lot more fun? The key gameplay mechanic on these games is to retry the tracks repeatedly to find the perfect line through the course and beat set times. This is fun when the cars are easy to control but in this game when driving off road the handling is so twitchy you just have to fight to keep the car on the track and you can't think about improving your line. This increased difficulty means there is a significant number of tracks that I will never be able to play. Even despite that this just features race events and none of the other types of event from previous games. With that in mind the price tag is quite hefty for what you get. In my opinion the pinnacle of the series was Trackmania Sunrise eXtreme but good luck finding a copy of that and getting it to work on Windows 7 so my recommendation is to get Trackmania United, it is much better value. The only positive this has over United is that the graphics are better.
11833	  English:    I would prefer half a thumb up for TrackMania Â² Valley, as it is not worth it if you have already played another Trackmania Â² (as I Canyon). It differs only in the location (and that is even worse), so I think it's rude of Nadeo that they make it into three gameplay-equal cash investments (I'm obviously an idiot fell for it). However, for those who have still played no part of the series, it is recommended with 5 out of 10. Anyway, I would rather play Canyon: The reason is in the review of that game!     Deutsch:    Ich wÃ¼rde TrackmaniaÂ² Valley am liebsten einen halben Daumen geben, da es sich nicht lohnt wenn man schon ein anderes TrackmaniaÂ² (so wie ich Canyon) gespielt hat. Es unterscheidet sich eben nur in der Location (und die ist sogar noch schlechter) und daher finde ich es unverschÃ¤mt von Nadeo das sie daraus gleich drei vom Spielprinzip genau gleiche Geldanlagen machen (Ich Idiot bin natÃ¼rlich darauf reingefallen). FÃ¼r alle die allerdings noch keinen Teil der Reihe gespielt habe ist es mit 5/10 Punkten zu empfehlen. Ich jedoch wÃ¼rde eher Canyon spielen: Der Grund steht in der Review dazu!
11834	Ubisoft purchased Nadeo on the back of Trackmaniaâs steady success. And it was never the same since then. They just need to make a new Trackmania United-like game with many different environments (at least 3), ditch Maniaplanet altogether and release the thing as one game, it isn't that difficult ...
11835	I loved trackmania for many years, but with this new mania planet system they've had for a whie, it just frustrates the hell out of me. The amount of stuffing around just to get something done. I just want to join a quick match... gotta wait for mania planet to load.... wanna change my settings ... gotta pay planets, BUT my account isnt validated yet so I cant spend my planets. HOW THE HELL is it not validated?! I'm on steam, I bought it through steam and signed in with my mania planet login ages ago. How many gates of authentication do you bloody need!!!  Theres no quick easy way to get a validation code either, I gotta go digging through all my old emails to find it, OR gotta get a new one sent.  Stuff it. I should have never bought this game. Nadeo's current mania planet system is just added busy work when I just want to quickly and casually play their game. Won't be playing any more.
11836	Keeps restarting...
11837	 http://steamcommunity.com/app/232910/discussions/0/496881136921969874/ 
11838	Tried getting this to work with a controller connected and the menu did not work. Must play with keyboard which I won`t do.
11839	I miss the good old Trackmania Days...
11840	Unplayable. It's stuck in an infinite loop of updates where the update NEVER takes and the games (all the TrackMania games) are unable to ever be played.
11841	I dont enjoy this game based on my multiplayer experience , 20 second tracks played all the time i really wodu liek to see tracks that are like 3-5 minutes long not something banged up together in 5 minutes and it looks pretty much â¥â¥â¥â¥ 90% of time. I made my own tracks in singleplayer its ok bud meh when you create it , it doesnt feel same.
11842	This game is terrible. I can't see my friend's times, can't add them on my list, can't play online because of infinite update loop, I can't even get my money back because I bought the key from a different site, I wasted 6 euros for this terrible and broken experience. Everyone, please don't buy this bugged game.
11843	  Why should you care about my review?    I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the 'dream' of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.  edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself - see below.)    Pros    -- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.  -- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a 'playlist' for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.  -- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.  -- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.    Cons    -- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on 'Stadium' from Steam, then decide to play 'Canyon' in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.  -- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the 'Start Game' button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.  -- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit 'more blue' or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42' screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)  -- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use 'multiple profiles' but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say 'You must connect online to launch the game.' I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.  -- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.  -- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).  -- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)  -- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to 'take' as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.  -- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.  -- this Con is unique to Valley. In the other two games, we can begin a split screen game by selecting a playlist of tracks and the game starts, We can race each track until a player gets 30 points (3 wins) or whatever we set it to be. In Valley however, the playlists don't work - it dumps you into a script programming screen which is blank. I don't feel I need to spend time figuring how they screwed up programming the install of this game just so we can play multi-player playlists like the other two games. Frustrating.    Conclusion    There is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.  If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.  Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.
11844	A little disapointed with this game. Have been a fan of TM since way back in the day and this just feels like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reboot. Menu layout is annoying and driving mechanics/physics are terrible. The tracks designs dont feel as polished compared to earlier versions of this game. I cant recommend this game, although if you are looking for a mildy entertaining time killer go for it!
11845	The game never asked me a account to play i think, but now it asks me so i create. But, after creating a account with my email the game says that my serial is in use. If i already created one account i wouldnt let me create another one with my mail. WTF?????????????????????? HOW ???????????????????????
11846	the one that noone plays
11847	this sucks
11848	Awful piece of ..... And wasn't even able to make money back.
11849	Waste of money! Got bored after 5 minutes. Really silly physics take away from a good looking game. It is too arcade for my taste.
11850	Where are you TrackMania spirit ?
11851	Pros: - OK graphics - Good for a quick game when you have little time - Ability to customize bike before each race is cool  Cons: - Extremely short - Nothing to do besides the main stages and the challenges, which give you nothing in return - Bike customization is very limited - Cheaters topping the leaderboards for every track, devs seem to not care about it - Bike sounds are repetitive and out of place, it never feels like a true engine   Overall 4.5/10  Grab it if it's in the Humble Bundle, otherwise don't pour 10â¬ into it, wait for a sale.
11852	Not hard enough for seasoned trials players. You play every map in 5 - 7h and are left without any replayability. Customization doesn't do enough. You can pretty much play through the whole game with just buying the best engine. Was ok for 1$ in the humble bundle, but I can't recommend paying the full price. 
11853	Remember when Trails came out? It was super hard, yet entertaining in their use of physics with tight controls and well thought out maps and levels that were hard, but managable once you mastered the controls!   Urban Trail Freestyle is just like that, if it was the same game with ugly textures, floaty controls, damn near impossible obsticles and your roommate kicking you in the beans periodically through game play.   For $.99, I got 45 minutes to an hour of playtime out of it. It's not unplayable yet it's not really enjoyable either. They tried to spice it up with a half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ trick system that you have absolutely no control over. The controls are sloppy at best and will lead to much swearing and teeth gnashing. I would have played through it, except for a near impossible obsticle half way through world 4 (I think) and after 15 minutes of retrying that, it dawned on me I'd have more fun going to chew tinfoil  But hey, at least it's got cards!
11854	Controls could be better. Dont like that only need to opperate with arrows, could have added jump option too. Maybe need more outfits and upgrades to bike. Simple game, nothing uber cool.  Recommend only for low price of game or if you like trial type games.
11855	It's like playing those flash bike games. A really bad copy of Trials. Don't waste your money in this game. Only if you want to have another piece of rubbish on your library, but don't pay it full price, it doesn't worth it
11856	I can't believe it has so many positive reviews.  The game mechanics are so simplistic and unresponsive. The Trials: Fusion and others of that series are well constructed games, incredibly enjoyable and challenging.  This game feels like the old school In browser Flash games. It should never have the reduced price tag of $10 / Â£10. The effort that was put into creating this game should leave it at only costing a maximum of Â£3.99 like other games that have this much effort put into them.  Unless you get it for that price or below, do not bother with this game
11857	The game seems quite fun at first, but turns out to be completely and utterly boring. Each and every stage can be completed by pressing 'up' arrow constantly, game is repetitive and visually unimpressive. Oh, and the leaderboards are populated by cheaters, so you can't even compare your score to other players. Got it from Humble Bundle, paid $1 for the whole thing, I still think I wasted that money.
11858	I was torn whether or not to recommend this game. In the end the constant/random crashing put me over the edge.   Urban Trial Freestyle isn't too bad of a game. The core things are there. The physics, upgrading your bike and the tracks are all good.   I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit and the games stability was marginal at best. Sometimes it would crash once and then play fine for an indefinite amount of time. Other times it would crash at random over and over again and I just had to give up that day.  Not fun.   It also crashed every single time I got a Steam card for the game while playing.   I feel like the graphics engine wasn't optimized very well as I had to lower shadow settings and turn off AA. I have a GeForce GTX295. For the level of graphics in this game... it shouldn't be struggling at the max settings. I was able to get a constant 60FPS by lowering the shadow detail and turning off AA but i had to run it in 1920x1080.   Speaking of resolution. I have two 1440p monitors and i seemed to get slightly better stability when i set my resolution to match what Iâd launch the game at.   It took me 10 hours to beat all the tracks, get all the cash bags and beat all the challenges.    Pros  -Nice looking graphics -Good physics -Entertaining levels   Cons  -Poorly optimized -Random/Constant crashes -Listening to the same, UNSKIPPABLE intro every time you start the game  If you get this on sale for a dollar or two, it'll give you a bit of entertainment for your money. Anything higher than that I can't recommend due to stability/performance issues.   3/10  Poor
11859	Just like all the other angle and physics racing games. This one is a bit easier than others due to track layout, and you can take a beating without falling off the bike. Fun for a little bit then gets old fast. Not as fun as the other types of similar games.
11860	Poor man's Trials - Trials is love, Trials is life.  Urban Trials on the other hand is a cardboard cutout, lowest common denominator, hold on for dear life to my superhero cape, bathe in another man's excellence, Brain Aneurysm of a game.   The physics destroy it from the off and without that theres nothing left, easy to pickup / difficult to master is replaced by hold A / RT to win. Visuals ran maxed at 1080P are 1up on a PS2, main character looks like he plays COD Ghosts.  Buy Trials Evo Gold or even Trials Fusion.
11861	All the frustration of Trials HD, none of the fun, and with added shaky screen. Just no.
11862	Trials Evolution exists, Trials Fusion exists, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.  Yup, the Trials games (the real ones) are made by Evilsoft, but they are at least good games, this however is a mess that has you replaying (I'm taking a not so wild guess here after having played just over half of the game) 5-6 levels over and over again. Atrocious checkpoints on each one of those levels, and when you're racing a cpu ghost, which makes almost no mistakes, those checkpoints tend to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you the eff off when they send you back 30 seconds. If you have this game already, let it chill in your library looking all pretty and adding that +1 to your overall game count, because that's the only thing it's good for, or torture yourself like I am, and get some playfire money if you're reading this brilliant review within a week of me writing it.  Let me paint you a clear picture, if there were such a thing as an insult chart, 'go play Urban Trial Freestyle' would be rated just above 'eat s#!t and die'.
11863	This is just a souped up polished flash game. It doesn't even come close to the Trials series. I did get it on sale for $0.99, so I'm not too disappointed. More glad I didn't shell out the $14.99 or whatever it costs regularly...
11864	If you want fun this game is not for you then,i was expecting something alse my sugar lvls jump every time i play it.But i keep coming back,so if you are noob like i am stay away from this game...
11865	This is pretty much the worst racing game I've ever played. Most of the negative reviews I read focused on the game being a Trials clone, which wouldn't offend me in the least. In fact, I found it to be more reminiscent of Trackmania. The real issue is that the bike physics are garbage, the courses aren't well designed, doing well doesn't feel rewarding, and the player's character is a dope. I'd also ding it for having your character start off naked instead of having at least basic protective gear - having to win races before you can wear a helmet is nonsensical, like so much else in this game.
11866	I can't rate this game, since it doesn't run on my PC. My pc meets the minimum requirements, but it gives up and gives an error on startup.  I just wish luck to others. Don't buy it if you don't like trials games nor cheap bad games. It 'looks' fun, but I haven't got to play it.
11867	If you are going to play this game with a KEYBOARD, chances are you won't be able to. 5 minutes into the game and the keyboard stops responding. EVERY TIME. It's a known issue, and devs apparently haven't done anything about it. It seems it was designed with gamepad (consoles?) in mind, so PC controls and settings are a mess. I would have loved to write something about the content of the game but I haven't been able to play it.  In short: UNPLAYABLE with a keyboard due to technical issues. If you find it for free you might want to grab the cards and run away
11868	To those saying that this is Trials but without uPlay: How about you actually play a Trials game.
11869	Urban Trial Freestyle is a fun little game, but compared to Trials Evolution - which it is obvious that Freestyle tried to mimic - it simply does not hold a candle. Here you have no multiplayer mode or custom track creator, the amount of tracks is disappointing, the customization system feels borderline meaningless and the gameplay feels too simple and casual. Itâs not a terrible game, but it adds nothing new to the table to weigh up for its lackluster features. With better alternatives around that do everything better, Urban Trial Freestyle ends up being a pointless purchase at its current price.  2.5/5  Read more:  http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/urban-trial-freestyle/ 
11870	This is probley one of the worst games iv ever played!
11871	Where do I start with this game? I had purchased it during the Steam summer sale for only 99 cents. In my mind I thought 'Hmmmm how bad could this game actually be for only 99 cents?' and man, is this game bad. I loved Trials Evolution, that game was a masterpiece, but this game is nowhere near sharing the name Trials.  When launching the game and arriving at the title screen you see the hip rebelious biker dude and hear that the police are after him for tresspassing with his bike.(zZzZZZZzZZzZzz)  The gameplay of this game is not fun. Repetative levels and annyoing characters that say the same lines over and over during the levels. 'FREEZE POLICE' says the police officer as you cruise by the 10 different groups of them each level. But the funny thing is if you stop in front of the police, they dont do anything. They just roll around and act like they're going to do something as you are at a standstill.  While playing the single player, the goal is to collect the stars from each level and using them to unlock the next level. BUT, you have to play the same level 2 or 3 times playing the different 'modes' to gain the plentiful amount of stars needed.   The handling of the bike is way too easy. This game has no challenge what so ever.  I'm surprised that this game is being sold for $10 now (even at $15). If this game were still 99 cents, I would not recommend it to anyone.   In the end, this game screams of a iOS or Android game for your cellular device. How did this game make it to consoles and even steam?
11872	nope HELP ME GRAPHICS CARD NOT SUPPORTED AND I HAVE AN AMD RADEON 4200 AMD ATHOLON I MEET MINIUM SPECS HELP
11873	Won't start. Nothing to indicate that it wont work on x64 bit machines, unless I've missed something. Have tried running Steam as Admin, flushed Steam from browser, deleted the 'appcache' folder, verified integrity 100%, but none of these tasks make any difference. To add insult to injury, Steam reckons that I've played the game for 19minutes! Huh? How about 'Have tried running game for 19minutes, more like!!!  Damn, blast and a whole lot of booooooo's!!!!!!!!!
11874	Unless it you have a controller it is not gun to play. No mouse support. Graphics are horrible. Bad PC port.
11875	Doesn't even support XBOX360 Controlles.   Do not buy! Not recommended!
11876	Feels poorly ported from consoles with sluggish responses. No in-game video settings and it's going offscreen on my pretty standard resolution (1920x1080). Didn't really like the feel of the controls. Got the Humble Bundle just for this, normally like Trials. Oh well.
11877	So-so game. While i like leaderboard integrated into the track itself (you can see best results for special activities on each track, like longest jump will be shown as bar on the ground). All other aspects of game are not polished enough to enjoy it.  Gravity Defied is still the best for me (yes that old j2me game from era of phones with rows of buttons).
11878	Don't buy this game! The single player part is not in any way better than what you'll get in the Trials series (Trials evolution, Trials fusion, etc.). Also, the single player campaign in this game is monotounous and short - took me about 4 hours to complete. While the Trials series then let's you play thousands of user made tracks, for free, this game doesn't have that option. This means that you're basically spending your money on 4 hours of not very fun gameplay. Buy Trials fusion instead, it just came out, and it doesn't cost that much more.
11879	This game feels like a quick little cash grab when you compare it to Trails Evoultion Gold. It is was shorter the with no where near the same amount of levels. With no good difficulty curb for the levels as you unlock them they are all rather easy. Worst is you can tell they cut corners with repeating levels, you do a time run in a level then 2 levels later it is the exact same but with a different task. The contorl of the bikes also feels a lot less challenging making the experience less fun. No custom level maker (that i could see) shortening the life span even more so. If you're going to buy a Trails game your money will be better spent on Trails Evoultion Gold.
11880	Even though I got it knowing that it would be a very simple and very casual game, I still can't recommend it.  The gameplay is somewhat what I expected. I played the heck out of those free 2d bike trial browser games. And I expected the gameplay to be similar, and I wasn't wrong. But despite the graphics and fireworks, Urban Trial Freestyle manages to be more simpel and to dumb down the 2d free browser games.  One of the main problems, imho, are the levels. They are too simple, too short, too unchallenging. Yes the random challenges are cool (highest jump, longest jump, whatever), but truth still is that you spend most of the (very short) level pressing accelerator and watching the fireworks.   But the main problem for me was: It gave me massive motion sickness. I've made sure to have 60hz stable, vsync, I've played with other settings, no joy. I'm not sure if it's the 2.5d concept or if it's something else in the graphics or optimization but the bottom line is... I just can't play it. And I'm actually a bit glad about it.  I've asked for a refund but I doubt I'm getting it. At least it was dirt-cheap.
11881	Even after buying this on Summer Steam Sale, I now wonder 'why'? This is the typical balance-your-vehicle-across-the-ramps type of game. There are so many like this, only this might look better. If you are not a hardcore fan of these kind of games, avoid if you want to keep your calm and save your keyboard from getting thrown to the wall.
11882	What I expected: a third person driving game, much like ATV: Offroad Fury, but dirt bikes on rooves. What I got: A side scroller arcade style driving game with boring challenges and even more boring gameplay. But hell, it was $.99
11883	Even after buying this on Summer Steam Sale, I now wonder 'why'? This is the typical balance-your-vehicle-across-the-ramps type of game. There are so many like this, only this might look better. If you are not a hardcore fan of these kind of games, avoid if you want to keep your calm and save your keyboard from getting thrown to the wall.
11884	Worst game ever! You will die at least 25 times on each map to take 2 or maximum 3 stars from 5 stars.
11885	Useless copy of a good game. Bugged and glitched as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Spend your 0.99Â£ on some other crap. Jesus
11886	i don't know why do i have to collect the stars and unlock different maps like what i'm doing in the mobile phone games. Can i pay the money to unlock these maps? Actually this game is just a mini game, you don't have many choices on choosing the style of your motor bike and your cloth ( maybe you can unlock more, because i didn't finish this whole game ), so i don't know why do they call it 'Freestyle'.  In other words, it only costs 99 cents, and has awesome graphics. it was really cool as i thought when i was playing it at first time. But then, i started getting tired to play the map again, again and again and still can't get enough stars ( damn skill ). i was impatient and hoped to play every map in this game quickly. it's vain, and it's why this game had low rating. If you are a stubborn warrior and want to beat these hard challanges, just try it. Me? Just surrendering.
11887	You like Trials HD? Well, This is not like that. This is terrible.
11888	This games controls make me sick. When I purchased this game I wasn't expecting another Trials but I was hoping for a similar experience. This game just feels like a flash game. Thank god I only got it for $0.99.
11889	Don't be fooled by the glamorous graphics and the shiney levels.... This game subtly reminds me of one of those crappy ps2 games that you are so siked for and end up becoming disappointed after the first few levels. First off the levels make no sense... you ride on a pipe and jump to a platform that launches you into a container that either A. ends up killing you, enabling you to hit the spacebar ( this becomes your friend ) or B. exit out of the game in a furious rage. The upgrading abilities are far from satisfying. You can upgrade your engine at the price of having worse handling, or you can upgrade your chassis at the price of having slower speeds. There is always something for something and there's only 3 upgrades per area. Getting money to upgrade is far from 'fun' ( not sure why fun is quoted ... maybe because that's more fun than getting money in this game ). I digress ... the money is located in bags throughout each level. You can only collect them once. That is the only way it is obtained. You can spend your money on helmets and clothes, but then you won't have any for engines, tires, or chassis. Some areas of levels are impassable unless under some freak of nature miracle that you hit something a certain way to do something to get you passed it. The constant reminder that someone online has trumped your score and that you keep getting either 3 stars or 4 stars average is also very demeaning and makes you feel like the whole game is an unsuccesful attempt to have fun. It's almost like you are excited to go on vacation with your family and they end up just making you more miserable than your 9-5 job. If you think I just don't like the game because I can't play it then try it for yourself. You'll realize...
11890	The physics utterly suck. Make it nearly unplayable. Going up a hill, you'd think you need to lean forward? Nope. Not leaning means you'll flip backward, and leaning forward means your bike will flip forward suddenly and *very* unnaturally, forcing a loss of all grip immediately. Trials does this too, but WAY more natural and physically believable.  Coming from Trials Evolution, the physics here are a joke.
11891	DUMB AND EDGY  I picked this game up on humble, because I like the trials games from Ubisoft. This is not like a trials game from Ubisoft. You basically drive in a straight line through edgytopia, where edgy things happen all around you but don't really affect you driving straight. There are few upgrades, and half the levels are the same as the other half, except that they add ghost drivers. The motorcycle noises are annoying. It's just all around bad... not worth the dollar I paid for the bundle.
11892	TL;DR What a terrible game.   Got this on a Humble Bundle, and thats the only time its ever worth considering. It starts as a simple 'bike balance' flash game, but sadly manages to mess up what hundreds of flash games seem to pull off.   The backgrounds are too busy to say the least, Barely a level goes by without a helicopter crash, a tanker explosion or some part of Michael Bay's wet dreams. With all this going on, focusing on you non-descript rider (who looks like Techno Viking straight out of the box) becomes challenging.   The graphics themselves are massively dated, and wouldn't look out of place on a PS2 or original Xbox, which make the aforementioned backgrounds even more of an eyesore.   Then theres the sounds, with the bike sounding like an irritated wasp in a tin can, the tin-like explosion, and the 4 soundbites of 'cops' (which are purely backdrops, serving no actual threat to the player) shouting 'freeze' or 'hey you'.   All in all, if you want to play a balance game, find a flash game. It'll be a lot cheaper, a lot better, and not have you reaching for headache tablets.
11893	Well, yeah, ok. You might want to punch your monitor or your keyboard sometimes but it's ok. Games like this do this to you, right? Got it in a bundle for 1 euro along with 2 other games. Totally worth its 33 cents. Not a chance I'd put 10 euros into this.   TL;DR: Buy it if it's ever on discount for like 1 euro. Do NOT buy at full price. Ever.
11894	If you buy it for 0,99â¬ it forth it but not for 9,99â¬. This game is rly not intresting, grafics its greait but you can't see when you playing any of it so it becoming rly shity expirienc. But as i said if you wan't to have not that intresting game for 0,99â¬ you should buy it. I both and not playing.
11895	Blatant ripoff, leeching off the success of the Trials series. Awful controls, leaving you feeling not entirely in control and a general all round feeling of cheapness. Avoid, unless you're a masochist with too much cash.
11896	4/10
11897	Don't bother with this game. It could be $0.00 and you would still be getting the short end of the stick. A game with poor graphics, minimalist controls and sub-par general gameplay. You use 4 keys the whole game and I am quite sure that you could go through the whole game using 2 keys. No real story is present within the game and you are just left to run over obstacles through a city all day. 100% do not reccomend this game to anybody.
11898	Says trials, not trials, would not freestyle again  2.5/5
11899	this game is utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥ never buy it nor play it the creator obviously have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what physics are as the god damn game has the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est of them. This game is so terrible that the customization to the bike is liquid â¥â¥â¥â¥ as all you do is make a bike that is the fastest as 99% of all the stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ needed to get stars require a â¥â¥â¥â¥ load of speed to even get enough poitns to do.the frotn wheel has 0 weight which si â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as â¥â¥â¥â¥ sicne you end up flipnig over more times then anything and cant go up hills for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sicne your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game designer buddy didnt know how to â¥â¥â¥â¥ MAKE THE FRONT WHEEL USE THE ENGINE! may aswell have made the bike not evne have a god damn frotn wheel sicne 95% of the god damn tiem you goto move you pratically flip off the damn thing backwards not to mention they add â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ puzzles and hazards that make this games â¥â¥â¥â¥ mechnnics even worse! 0/10 don't buy it its seriosuly soemthing you could go get out of a freebie flash game
11900	
11901	Doesn't work with Xbox One controller (constantly accelerates when connected) so have to power off the controler and switch to keyboard as controller takes priority.  Unplayable with Xbox One controller...
11902	I played this game for a while. While i like this type of games this one is just boring.  The art for this game is dark and a bit boring. The maps itself aren't very different or entertaining.  I can't really type anything more about this game. Just boring. I recommend you Trials Fusion more than this.
11903	At the time of this writing, does not support 4K under Windows 7 (see  bug report ).  Quite fun for the rest.  Not recommending until 4K issue is fixed.
11904	Inferior clone of the Trials series. Unreasonable goal times, crappy bikes, fuzzy graphics, unmemorable music. It's just bland all around.
11905	A less entertaining version of trials that manages to be completely uninteresting in every way.   
11906	Feels like a very cheap immitation of the Trials series. Don't really recommend this one.
11907	I got the world record in platform madness and they reset it. WTF URBAN TRIAL?
11908	this game is awful 10/10 -IGN
11909	This game can't work properly with both xbox 360 and xbox one controllers. The game keep registering the right trigger. Both controllers worked perfectly with other games so the issue is not caused by the controllers.
11910	Simple fun, simple game for simple mind. Not worth 10â¬ unless sale -90% 
11911	Worst 99 cents ever spent.
11912	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68vzj_tzF7A&amp;list=PLBonlAW_WHtxNcg43Hd9zv7j-FnGClIlj&amp;index=6   Reasonably standard trials game. MUCH cheaper than Trials Fusion on Origin. Not very fun, but if you are into this style of game you are probably going to enjoy ths.
11913	Urban Trial Freestyle is a poor mans Trials HD/Evolution the general feel of the motorbike make it seem quite heavy whereas although Trials felt sometimes like you were bouncing all over the place at least that was useful for harder obstacles. This game offer just like 6 different stages that don't seem to get any harder so there's not really a learning curve which is quite disappointing froma game that wants to compete with Trials, its just getting from point a to b  Its incredibly easy and doesn't explain the objectives very well which are scattered around in certain levels. It hides moneybags around the level to improve your bike, because thats a great system find the collectibles so you can accomplish the objectives to a higher degree. The level design isn't fantastic either where some obstacles don't properly align with others.   There's alot going on in the background but when you're trying to focus on what your bikes doing the background action can a little jarring and distracting. Graphically its pretty much the same as Trials. Really the only benefit is at least you don't have to use Uplay but this is such a mediocre game, get Trials really get Trials its not a very good port but its still better than this.
11914	no remappable controls. terribad physics
11915	Okay concept combined with cool dynamic maps, held together by a horrible PC port and rubbishy vehicle upgrade systems.. the game doesn't really hold any explanations of how to play, it has the absolute WORST feel of any game I have ever played (no decent background music, just the horrible tinny sound of your bike, which sounds like a nitrous buggy that has been burned out), and to top it all off the game is quite short. Definitely would not recommend, even after buying during a sale for $4.
11916	I bought this for 99c thinking it'd be the dollar store version of Trials. Well ... it is, but it's actually worse that that. It's kind of like playing Trials if they hired the physics dude from Bad Rats to design the bike contols. Some levels have some interesting design, but it doesn't matter becuase of the 'Absolutley Terrible Gameplay' feature they added, but forgot to mention on the store page.  Stay ... away ... seriously.
11917	just... no. please. listen to me. do not buy this. please. do not play this for free. stay away. just... avoid this forever. dear god. please. i'm beggin you.
11918	what is this even
11919	This is like Trials, minus everything that makes Trials fun. The graphics are decent, and the level design is kinda cool... but the bike physics are terrible. That pretty much ruins everything else.
11920	Worst biking game ever. If you want a good game, get any Trials. This game is worse than the worst game in the world. It is a dark motorbiking game that has to be backed up with a 'Child Friendly' piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.   DO NOT BUY THIS, it sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11921	Rather buy trials fusion this is a husk of a trials game. Repeats levels over and over. Graphics are meh at best. No multiplayer.
11922	mite b fun if it didn't stutter so severely every few seconds that it â¥â¥â¥â¥s with your eyes  eye-strain/10 would play if i wanted a migraine
11923	Not terrible, but the older titles of the series were more fun. Can't figure out specifically why, they just feel better and more responsive. Even went back to play an older one to make sure it wasn't only nostalgia, just can't reccomend this one.
11924	Cheap rip off of Trials. Do not buy.
11925	this gam was ver good but no alot of game play i 100% gam in 7 minot but i had god time
11926	Steer clear. One of the most badly built games I've ever seen. Where is the refund section?
11927	I thought it was a new Trials game. I should have researched more... Don't get this game. Just stick with the real Trials games.
11928	Gave me special person DLC. I am not special. I am offended
11929	Really trash. The screenshots look cool and all - but it's a 2D game. UP and DOWN to move. Left and right to lean (forward or back). Not challanging. Really bad game.
11930	Let's start with the only pro that I have found: The dynamic level design can be interesting at times.  Now on to the cons : Graphically lacking, gameplay is stiff and unresponsive, the levels may be interesting but you need to play each one twice, childishly easy, virtually no customization, not fun.  I bought this game expecting it to at least resemble Trials Evolution: Gold Edition (an infinitely better game of the same style) and was sorely disappointed. The $3.74 that I paid for this game was too much. All around a bad game. 3/10
11931	Worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game ever. I bought it in 75% sale but I still want my money back you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Buy Trials Evolution instead.
11932	worthless. The feeling is completely wrong. You actually have better feeling in the bike on the facebook game Trial Xtreme 3... Hope the guys who made this feel embarassed. Not worth the money even though it was very cheap.
11933	What I just played was one of the most insanely idiodic things I've ever experienced. At no point during play was this game even close to anything that could be considered fun. I am now dumber, having played it. I award this game a 0/10 and may God have mercy on my soul.
11934	I bought this because it was on sale and i love the Trials series, but this is is just crap, you cant costumize for â¥â¥â¥â¥. Tracks are OK but its overall bad. Trails Evo is superior compared to this. I dont recomend buying this game.
11935	Shoulda bought MX vs. ATV.
11936	Not as good as excpeted.
11937	Constantly crashes to desktop
11938	I would never buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ for 10 bucks. Thank god it was on sale. Cause this is really bad.
11939	WOW... this is one BIG old pile of buggy S-HIT!   Buy this if you like feeling ripped off and unhappy.
11940	No, this is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Solid bad-quality rip of the usual Trials games.
11941	Uninstalled so fast
11942	Until you're a lover of ridiculously difficult 2D flash trial arcade games, stay away from this game.
11943	It is just a bad console port
11944	Errors. Errors. Errors. on 3 different PC-es. with really high specs.
11945	Expected this to be a Trials HD clone, got a poor example of a trials HD clone instead. Lack of analog throttle/brake controlls shows a vast inferiority to what the game claims to be. Audio was shoddy at best. Only pro to this was I picked it up basically for free in a humble bundle.
11946	it sucks
11947	This game is compared to Trials a lot. And it is very much like it with a few changes. But these changes, in my opinion, are bad. In some tracks you are supposed to go for points by doing things like getting the highest jump. It changes things up which is nice. You do the next track and it's either getting points or a time trial. Then after that, you repeat the previous track doing a time trial this time. It's like the developers think you're three years old and can't notice you're playing the same track twice.  You would expect the bike to control well. But it doesn't it's very hard to turn correctly. You can upgrade your bike but that just makes it even worse. Some obstacles in the game are incredibly hard to pass. Some of the obstacles hardly ever work. And sometimes a car that it supposed to stop in a certain spot wont stop there making you fall. Or a car will stop in the middle of the road when it's not supposed to. This is completely random and you have no way to control it. The hard obstacles combined with the horrible controlls make the game extremely frustrating to the point where you quit.  The game doesn't let you progress very easily. Each track has 5 stars to get. The number of stars you get depends on your performance on the track. By the time I was halfway into world three I had three or more stars on every track. But I still didn't have enough stars to unlock more tracks. It is very hard for players who aren't good at the game to progress.  I payed 99 cents for this game and I still feel like I was ripped off. Don't buy this game. It's a waste of time and money.
11948	worth what you pay at the summer sale but you only will get about 10 min of enjoyable playtime out of it.
11949	I was expecting it to be like trials hd. 3/10 Would not reccomend
11950	1 word! shocking! glad i only payed 0.69p even then its not worth it
11951	The physics are just average and the controls are sluggish. And it only has 47 levels, half of which are unique, because each level has a Time Attack and Best Score mode in the level select. After a hour of playing I was already at the last world. Buy only if it's on a sale or if you're a HUGE trials fan.
11952	I normally don't really care that much when a game draws a LOT of inspiration from another, but this is just abysmal. It's essentially a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of Trials, some of the tracks are decently designed but the actual physics of the bike (y'know, that thing that the entire game is based around) are heavy, clunky, and awkward. I got this game on sale for a buck and I still feel ripped off. Do not buy this game.
11953	its  a poor mans Trials  a very poor mans Trials...........but for 69p you get what you pay for. Controlling the bike is not that challenging and takes a lot of the fun away, if you cant/have not played Trials you will enjoy it otherwise give it a miss
11954	â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was 99 cents. and total crap   0.1/10
11955	Play Trials for free online.
11956	Go download Uplay and get HD/Evolution/Fusion because this is not worth your time nor your money.
11957	The 'race against a ghost of the record holder' feature is kind of cool for aspiring D-list Steam celebrities, but this game will become repetitive and unsightly to anyone other than the most die hard of motocross or Trials fans.
11958	Don't buy this game! It locks up randomly and the only thing you can do is shut down your computer. NO support, in fact they delete bad reviews and any forum posts that say negative things about them. Again, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!
11959	this is just a terrible entry of an awesome series. no track editor what the hell. also very few levels almost not worth the 99 cents i paid for it
11960	It's more or less the knock off Trials game....
11961	At first this game was good but then I noticed some really bad things about it. Pros -Challanges like highest jump or farthest flip lots of fun Middles -Interactions with the environment are cool but can be worked on Cons -ONLY ONE PRO -Graphics pretty bad  -no skill required just up arrow and right arrow holding -attempt at story but comes off as cheesy clichÃ© and boring -not much customization -only 12 achievments Overall Just give me my trading cards and leave
11962	I paid .59 CAD for this. Got what I paid for.
11963	This game isn't fun to play. You will be better off saving up for Trails Evolution.
11964	For a game I paid 0.99 for its okay, anything hogher then that your just wasting your money
11965	Looking for another EPIC tilty bike game? Look somewhere else. This game isn't about skill or tilting, it's about fancy backgrounds and holding down the acceleration. You may occasionally need to tilt but thats in very specific and obvious places. Oh but there are so many levels! Except that every few levels are exactly (They ARE and look 100% the same) the same as the one you played 3 levels ago. You are playing an identical clone to the same level! SO MUCH FUN. And don't forget the baddass things your character says every couple seconds! 'Feel my wrath! Not!'. Eergh I feel hardcore just typing it. And the customization... Oh dear god.  So why should you buy this game? You shouldn't unless it's on sale for $2 and you really enjoy not having to do anything in games. Otherwise skip it.
11966	I wouldn't buy this game full price. I got it for 99 cents, which isn't a bad deal. However, the game has bad fps lag which really takes away from the gameplay imo. Other than that the game is exactly what you expect. I bought this game as a substitute for Trials: Revolution on the xbox. I thought I would get a game similar but of a little lesser quality so I didn't expect alot.
11967	It reminds me a lot of free flash games of the same style with less features, to me it wasn't worth buying as it doesn't have half the features you would expect from a game of this style no jump, no upgrades etc... the graphics are not entirely overwhelming either, the game levels remind me of some platform games from the 80's and 90's.   It also doesn't register that i've completed several levels and no steam achievements have been earned for playing the game.
11968	Horrible physics, horrible graphics and horrbile game play. Biggest waste of 70p ever
11969	Not to be confused with the more enjoyable (and more expensive) game in the Trials franchise.
11970	Decent graphics. The game is just borring. You can find similiar games for free that are much more enjoyable. Levels are uninspired and quite a bit depends on pure luck. Do not recomend to buy for full price.
11971	Average game. On my oppinion not worth 10â¬. But anyways, i got it for 1â¬, so i don't care :P
11972	Sorry but if you think this game understands momentum then you should probably seek help. It's not an awful game no but it's nothing special I'll say that right off the line. If you want to be infuriated because of the lack of momentum then this game is for you. Not awful but not great. Worth 69p like it's being sold for in this sale.
11973	poor mans trials game level design and mechanics are worse then trials way worse this game is like one of those android ripoff trials games
11974	Urban Trial Freestyle is a very bad port with terrible performance issues and no reboundable controls. You can't use the mouse on anything which would be nice to use instead of the control scheme that isn't well thought out (function keys to navigate). Despite stating that, the game definitely feels a lot better with a controller which shouldn't be the case considering I am playing on a PC. The level design seems to get distracting sometimes due to objects blending in making me miss a crucial jump. The bikes feel very unnatural which also ruins the game for me. All this being said, the only recommendation I can make is the price it is on sale for and for a dollar, you get a game that you can spend short amounts of time on but for full price, Urban Trial Freestyle is 100% not worth it.
11975	I was hoping for some kind of freestyle dirtbike game on par with DiRT. This is a lot more like Motocross Maniacs for the Game Boy, except MM was a little more open about how you could attack a track. This is linear--it's literally linear, you cannot steer left or right, and most tracks have three or four score zones and that's about it. So much for freestyle when you're only scored on how well you score in each of the designated zones, and how quickly you get through a track.  The environments do look cool, and the interactions are kind of fun, but in general I feel like something's missing from the game, like it's a minigame from a much bigger, better dirtbike game.
11976	this game can be fairly frustrating, alot of games are trail and error and let u experiment with different strategies for winning or in these types of games u expirement with different ways to approach each obstacle. But in this game alot of the time u gotta make the right choices straight from the beginning of the level or your whole run is going to be bad. there has also been many times were i die on an obstacle over and over and when i finally get passed said obstacle i don't even know how i did it most of the time. Or if u buy one or two things in the store that you werent supposed to ur not going to be able to afford the biggest engine. and if u don't have the biggest engine u dont have a chance at beating this game. becausealmost all of the challenges depend on speed. thers straight up speed tests, highest jump tests and flip test and u need speed for all of them. and the worst part is if u made a few bad investments at the start of the game getting money will be very difficult later on because you will need speed to even reach the money bags to unlock more parts. i give it 4/10 atleast it did'nt cost much...
11977	was only priced at $0.99 and i am still sadly disapointed it cost me that much, not nearly as satisfying or technically designed and developed as the game Trials. very singular gameplay. dont even have the option of changing your controls, i knew i would not be able to hook up a controller but not even being able to change which buttons i wanted to use on the keyboard seems like big thing in such a simple game
11978	One of the worst Trial games, honestly.
11979	dont buy any of the DLC's cuz they just make your character look awesome with no work
11980	I got this game free from my friend and tried it, it really sucks lol Bored game, just bike all around and there are mission that are too hard to pass for beginners I do not recommend this.
11981	not good at all i would recomend trial fusion if you want a trial biking game =[
11982	I'll be honest, it's very basic, and I don't want to spend any more of my time writing about or playing this game, get Trials Evolution, whilst I have no major issues with this game other than the physics feeling a bit amateur. ultimately it lacks fun!  3/10 At a push
11983	game looks nice but if works correctly .. it hangs every time i ran it .. keyboard stops responding .. game video is running but no key input from keyboard .. even ctrl+alt+del dont work .. only solution is to press reset button to restart PC ..  dont know what is the problem .. but this kingd of basic thing not working for game cant make me recommend it to anyone !! .. buy it at your own risk !!
11984	glad i got it from bundle and didnt waste more money on that.. simple, stupid and pointless :P
11985	grind to make enough to upgrade one part only to find that upgrading your engine downgrades handling. and upgrading handling downgrades the engine. and upgrading top speed downgrades handling. the levels are garbage and i'm pretty sure the simplicity of this game will make me worse at actual trails games. thanks for costing me money and downgrading my abilities in other games. never had to pay for that before.
11986	So, it's alright, I wouldn't lay 10$ on it.... Good thing I didn't. It's pretty funny, but the tracks themselves are way easy, the difficulty comes in beating the high scores. Sadly it's pretty obvious that cheaters are in the leaderboards, since their replays show them taking forever cause they're pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ at a pretty easy game. Pick it up while still on sale, otherwise you won't be to satisfied.
11987	game keeps going to desktop when launch bruh
11988	it is worth it if it is .99 but not 10.00
11989	Even on sale it doesn't make up for the fact that this game still SUCKS!
11990	I tought it was in multiplayer :/  
11991	Not even worth the 99 cents. It's like 5 of the same stages played over and over with different tasks.
11992	wtf is this
11993	i dont recomend it. Not fun. i played for a couple minutes and hated the controls and hated how the game was designed.
11994	Meh. Came reccommended, but It's no excitebike. Physics are too real (weight) to have fun with it. If you don't start a flip at the right speed, you will not be able to complete it, no matter how you fiddle the balance control.
11995	While you can still have fun with this game is undeniable that it has a lot of problems. Starting from the stars progression system to the way you're supposed to earn money to buy bike upgrades that do not seems to have a real impact on the game. The level design is good in general but sometimes you come across certain spots where it's only a matter of luck, resulting in extreme frustration.   I can't recommend this
11996	Edit: Oh this is lovely, like all indie developers who get bad reviews, the two for this game both gave me 'did not find this review useful' then now told me that the reason I found the campaign to be repetative was because I hadn't played it enough yet. What total nonsense. They claimed that playing death matches or capture the flag would make the game more fun. I played both (specifically where I said 'Multiplayer games against bots') and they were still not fun.   Edit 2: I've checked the steam page for Gas Guzzlers and there's not one negative review with over 50% of people who found it useful.Huge redflag. Out of a 100 negatives reviews there's none with constructive criticism deemed useful ? I call BS.  I'm giving this a thumbs down because I don't believe its worth the $24.99 price tag.   At first, the game is a lot of fun and its really satisfying when you blow up your first car. The problem is that this is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played.  You'll end up in first most the time, trying to decide whether you should slam the breaks to kill people and break the monotany or just go for an easy win.  The 'campaign' consists of  1. Race with no weapons  2. Race with weapons 3. Race with weapons, but whoever is in last place gets taken out at the end of each lap.  4. Play multiplayer games against bots when the game decides its a special occassion.  You'll play dozens of these races and feel like you aren't getting anywhere.  New cars don't unlock often enough to keep things interesting, a sponsorship insures that you'll have about 5x as much money as you can possibly use, and its just agonizingly boring to win 5 races and be told CONGRATULATIONS! YOU UNLOCKED....1 NEW RIM AND 1 NEW STICKER!   This game is fun for about an hour or two, but around the time you reach the first championship, you'll start to ask yourself why you're wasting your time driving in circles (alwasy in first place) when you could be playing Twisted Metal, Mad Max, or any number of car combat games.
11997	Don't trust the preview videos... This isn't the no-holds vehicular combat game it's made out to be: it's a racer... and a bland one at that.  There is no real choice of vehicles, since each new car is a straight upgrade to the former. There is no real choice between maneuverability and speed -or any other factor, for that matter, like armor or weaponry.  Gas Guzzlers isn't a bad game, but it doesn't have enough to it tobe interesting past the first 15 minutes.
11998	I can't stand this one. At first I considered giving a detailed point by point, but this title just isn't worth my time. Not worth it to play, not worth it to go in depth. I'll skim the surface.  Gas Guzzlers Extreme is what it is, a brainless party racer with boring/unrewarding controls, poor track layouts, and a consistently tasteless sense of humor bashing users over the head at every turn. It's a game where gently nudging somebody off the track is far more effective than pounding them for half a lap with automatic weaponry. More frustrating than fun.  That said, the game does look pretty good, has a decent number of race modes, and the career progression seems pretty well put together. Even though it's got those premium ingredients, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is let down when they come together and provides a below-average experience overall. I can picture the game having an audience--everything does. For some, there is surely fun to be had here, but it isn't for me, and I wouldn't recommend it.
11999	Initially quite fun, but it gets dull fast. You quickly unlock most of the useful stuff, and after that it feels too repetitive. I imagine multiplayer would give it a significant boost, but it was dead whenever I tried.
12000	Actually it is 50/50 game. It got cars and gunz, is should be fun! Yes ? Nooo! Unfortunately it's booring. Cars look similar and handles identically. There are few useless upgrades. Nothing stands out.
12001	Massively overrated and overpriced game, even in a steam sale. After playing the grid, gt, burnout game, this game feels tired and washed out after 5-10 minutes of gameplay. The action is just monotonous and repetitive,   I mean the graphics are kind of nice, 8/10, but it just lacks style or artistic quality. It just feels like, the entire game was written to do the minimum amount of work to please a manager. It just doesn't feel like anyone's soul went into this game.  Basically this is wipeout 2097, but wipeout 2097 had better style, concept and art. Even though wipeout's graphics is far more pixelated than this, it's a far more enjoyable game.  It just feels like there is something central missing from this game, and I just can't put my finger on what.
12002	A bad racing game. It's a fun combat game but the driving is so floaty and janky that it's borderline unplayble.  Real shame since it has quite a bit of content: - Normal Racing - Battle racing (racing with weapons) - Knockout racing + weapons - Capture the Flag - Battle Arena  But because of terrible car handling the game is pretty much unplayble. Just go get flatout 2 instead.
12003	I thought the game was great for the first little while, but then I just started blowing up for no reason. I would be winning, full hp, no cars around me and the game would just blow my car up and say 'KNOCKED OUT' continually through all levels after a certain point in the second series. After not being able to figure out what was going on, if it was some glitch, I tried using the godmode cheat I found online. Even still, my car would randomly explode for no reason and I would lose races. I wouldn't recommend this title because of this game breaking and incredibly frequent glitch. Really, really disappointing. I will probably never finish it because of this.
12004	Bought during holiday sale, was very interested to try it since it's a developer from my country. Turns out, the game is extremely laggy even on the lowest settings, the cars are absolutely uncontrolable and while they look pretty shiny and all, the enviroment looks very low-poly and bad. Flatout 2 is a much better game even though it's older. The 'humor' is forced and on the level of a 5 year old.  And to think I could have bought The Talos Principle for the same money instead.

12006	Game was bought and installed from a disc but will not play it will not let me get pass the profile screen. it states that the microsoft visual C ++ is 2010 and clearly my laptop is of a higjer version. was so looking forward to playing this game.
12007	Was expected way more fun with this game. Gamepad support (Xbox 360's in my case) is next to non-existent - can't drop mines you use any specials :( Also, the gamepad works awfully in the menus, and I have to reach for the mouse. Gameplay is very repetitve and after you have flawlessly lead for a few laps (pickin' and usin' all the nitros) competitors suddenly start gaining on you by the end of the game. WTF???
12008	Bad game to me and friends.  We experienced broken physics, questionable mechanics, poor ping on the available servers (officially hosted), races were not fun at all due to the lack of smart racing mechanics mentioned above), multiplayer interface (and interface in general) is poor as well.  Best part about it appears to be the singleplayer which is extremely cheesy but has nice a nice flow if you accept and like the simpleton style.  It does have bots in multiplayer - which is positive since even though multiplayer was relatively dead (only about 2-3 players at prime time on the level relevant server) it can be played.  Co-op though? Not even close. It's your typical team based multiplayer (CTF, TDM) and there is no co-op option anywhere in the game. Seeing how the devs interpret co-op explains the overall lack of quality in the game. It's your typical 'we've made a team multiplayer, let's call it co-op' thing. Also not enough players to fill up two teams. In conclusion it looks and feels like a poor mashup of Blur, Flatout etc. Only recommended to genre fans.   Recommended price point: 5$ 
12009	This game isn't all it's hyped up to be. The FPS drops every time I start a race. It goes back up but keeps fluctuating. It even lacks a split-screen option which is one of the main reasons I play car battle games. There's nothing particularly bad about the gameplay, overall it's solid but don't expect anything groundbreaking, it's all been done in other games before.   For the price, I certainly would'nt recommend this game to anyone. For avid fans, I'd say the game might be worth 20$ with all DLCs but if you're just a casual gamer you might want to look into something else.
12010	It does NOT have local couch multiplayer, despite the video showing 4 way split screen. Whal the hell... The gameplay itself is sluggish
12011	Driveing controls suck Fix turning!!!! 
12012	I don't even know where to start, this game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awful in every single way possible. +1 point for x64 support tho.
12013	Bought it on sale and I still regret it. Total garbage. Ammunition is EXTREMELY scarce, the AI cheats...
12014	Open game. Watch opening. Create Driver. *CRASHES*
12015	i didn't get it. bought this game, because of the very positive reviews. but i dont get warm with this game. for me, it isn't any fun.
12016	Just couldn't get into it. Terrible controls. Uninstalled after about an hour. Very shallow, and not nearly as fun as it would seem.
12017	No australian servers  No players  Horrible driving physics
12018	A truly great game made by a great developer, however i cannot give this game a thumbs up from the experience that i have had so far.  Sadly the game uses direct x9 which is fine, however despite it being a game produced in 2013, direct x 11 doesnt exist exist for the game.  This however is nothing in comparison to the games stability as it constantly crashes no matter how hard i try, the 64 bit version of the game is very unstable and sometimes crashes on launch and the fps of the game is sometimes woeful for its age and graphics, the game can often feel very sluggish in reguards to the gameplay and the frames can suffer realy badly.  If you dont believe me, just search it up. The community have posted about this for years and the developers seem to be either ignoring the issues or taking way to long to fix them, especially as they have only just released a christmas match which is a sad sign that this wont ever be fixed :(
12019	GOD AWFUL CONTROLS!!!!!  Super Mario Kart has way better controls then this, and that game allowed you to move straight down the track. this game is nothing more then bobble heading all the way through(left, then right, repeat), it basically does it the way I had to do in order to slowdown/stop my snowmobile when going down a hill with no breaks.   Not recommened.
12020	WARNING: Do not buy this game if you want to play in split screen . The video game gives the impression of being local multiplayer with split screen, but actually is not . The game looks good, but just bought to be able to have fun in family . I made the return of the same .  ATENÃÃO: NÃ£o compre esse jogo se quiser jogar em divisÃ£o de tela. Pelo vÃ­deo o jogo passa a impressÃ£o de ser multijogador local com divisÃ£o de tela, porÃ©m na verdade nÃ£o Ã©. O jogo parece ser bom, mas sÃ³ comprei para poder me divertir em familia. Fiz a devoluÃ§Ã£o do mesmo.
12021	this game when try launch game gave you black anytime you try play this game and you have turn off computer get windows back you guys need fix this problem
12022	Doesn't work with steam controller. Tried top 5 configs. Got the game plus all the DLC and was a total waste of time and money.  EDIT: Devel team says its steam keeping them from supporting the steam controller. Not sure whats going on here, but the end result is I can't play the game. I hope steam and the devel team and figure out how to make â¥â¥â¥â¥ work. The game looks great and I want to play it.
12023	The problem with this game is when the levels get harder your car stops work correctly and yet all the AI cars can turn and get grip. Its not a level field and when your car doesnt do what it has been doing you get frustrated . The game is not programmed smartly. Half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ attampt at at shooter driver. Even with the 4 gig upgrade this game is just frustrating
12024	It's unfortunate that a game which seems like it is tailor made for playing in the living room with friends simply refuses to work with Steam Link and controllers.  I bought the game because it promised 'full controller support' but nothing I can do will allow me to use my XBOX wireless controllers while streaming the game to my TV via the Link box.  Yes, I have used this set up successfully with multiple other games.
12025	I've give this game a 'meh'.. Luckily I only paid $5.60 CDN as it was on sale. The reviews for this game were so compelling, I had to buy it, but I feel ripped off, eventhough I only paid 5 buks.  I give this game a 60/100. The graphics are ok, the driving feel is not that great. A game similar to this with better graphics, better driving feel, and overal realism is Flatout: Ultimate Carnage.  I dont know why this game is given such high reviews, honestly its just not that good.  Don't buy it, unless you are dying for a new game and only pay next to nothing.
12026	for me it constantly lags. Not happy with it but if you want to get it, by all means try it out. Maybe it is just my computer xD 
12027	Buy Flatout ....
12028	It gets boring after getting all cars. People compare it to mario kart and say it's very similar but with guns. I agree, but they left out something very important: the replayability. I remember having countless hours on mario kart after I unlocked everything, but for this game I just can't replay it. If you haven't noticed, most people who vote positive and compare it to mario kart have less hours than me in this game. I only have 6.9, imagine if you played more.
12029	The handling of the car is weird. Not as much fun as Blur, Flatout 2, or Split/Second. Just play the demo before buying.
12030	absolutely NO controller support
12031	This game is a cool idea just ruined by the makers They have made the AI so stupid: - Travel faster than you - have unlimited ammo - Suddenly have a large acceleration period if you are slightly ahead - You die so fast to them - Follow you around an arena when you are low on health - act like coward when they are low on health - In arena just sit still when attacking someone Then the gameplay: - Just the same thing over and over - you don't have a large of things to do - If you press FIRE, FORWARD and LEFT at the same time your car doesn't turn left VERDICT: Don't buy
12032	Nothing special.
12033	Literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ do not waste your money.
12034	Steering is horrible. Graphics are horrible. At least i got it on sale.
12035	Another game where you oversteer and lose all the time. There's no reason to make an arcade driving game next to unplayable except to hide the fact that the gameplay actually is shallow and routine.   
12036	This is quite possibly the worst multiplayer interface i've ever had to deal with, it's basically based on the minecraft system, and acts as seperate part of the game, so you can't make a server and play on it with friends unless you have two computers with each having a copy, absolutely terrrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12037	I have pro PC and is go lag
12038	I bought the game on Dec 20 for 38.69$ and now on Dec 21 the game is 7.73$  Steam doesnt want to refund me because I ''played'' 12h (game opened afk)
12039	very much lag i cant play the game
12040	It's ok... but the question of why is the republican party so prominent in the USA? Can't be that many people that benefit from 'the tax cuts' because most americans are broke as â¥â¥â¥! HA! (c is omitted because murican society seems to enjoy their panties in a bunch up the cavity) Poverty breeds poverty in that female dog! LAWLZ
12041	a buggy, poorly optimized mess of a racer with dlc that splits the already small multiplayer community
12042	Just don't buy it. It isn't similar to Twisted metal, its a crap not worth a penny. Co-op is a tragedy.
12043	While I had high hopes for this game, and it IS a pretty solid racer in its own right, but the multiplayer is a joke (multiplayer being the main reason to pick this up).  1. There is no peer/client listen server option. The only way to play a private match with your friends is to run your own dedicated server. Yes, the devs believe it's 1998.  2. The peak number of players in the WORLD at one time is 200-ish people, right after the Steam Xmas sale. This will drop back down to a dozen on a busy day in a week.  3. Even if you want to bother setting up a server, opening up ports, and MANUALLY GIVING YOUR FRIENDS THE IP TO CONNECT TO (that's right, it's a quakeserver!), there's no steamworks integration. Seriously.  It's like the devs decided they wanted to make a game with zero future.  If you can get this for $2, it's worth it for the singleplayer, but not much more than that, as by the time you can pick it up at that price, there will be no one in the world playing (that's 2 weeks from now btw), but maybe you can sucker a few of your friends to pick it up and you can pretend it's the 90s again and feel the nostalgia of setting up and running an external dedicated server that you give the IP to your buddies to play for 15 minutes and then never play again.  Pretty sure we'll never see another game from this developer. That's a good thing. 
12044	'Not recommended' with caveats.  It's fun. The driving mechanics feel good. There's a lot of grind to get to the better, faster cars. You'll need to win a lot of races to unlock them slowly, one at a time. The punny humor (racer names like 'Jack Kass', 'Alotta Fagina') wasn't my thing, but it doesn't ruin the game. The announcer, in particular, sticks to the essential information. Things you actually want to hear. God knows how many racing games have been made less pleasurable experieces thanks to blathering announcers.  But bear in mind that Burnout Paradise is $20, and the first GRID is $15 these days. Compared to the $25 price tag here I'd say you're getting a lot more content with either of those games. But, there are guns here, unlike either of those two, and that adds a Mario Kart-like dynamic which can dramatically affect how racers will place or if they'll finish the race at all. If you love racing games and want to pick up another for something new, Gas Guzzlers isn't a bad choice. Look for a sale price or find it in a bundle.
12045	Since latest update game contains a trojan virus will chnage my review once its fixed as its and enjoyable game   Screncap of antivrius detection  http://imgur.com/IE3NJak 
12046	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm_Cwrhzago  - Reason why I don't play this game anymore. Like it was fun at first but I don't know what to think of it now.
12047	Unfortunately when I played this it glitched immediatly. There is no way to play it, and basically just wasted my money
12048	I would'nt have complain for a 10$ game but seriously a game that crash every now en then in the menu after a race...Over that, there's not much to do. After 3 hours, i'm bored. And dont buy it for the multiplayer option, the server are often empty.
12049	This is just Mario Kart plus Death Race 2000 with all the interesting parts filed off.
12050	not very good. races are extremely monotonous, you will be using only few weapons, and unlocking new cars/races can be quite confusing. with big sale you may buy it, but for full price? no way
12051	I didn't like it, but the game was not bad. And the devs listen to the players, and that is cool.
12052	This game sucks i dunno who is out there reccomending it to ppl.   The AI is dumb. the customization is pointless. I bought the zombie vr, never saw any zombz. Theyre only seemed to be 3 typesof modes and they didnt matter cause either it was racing (sucha joke agaisnt AI) deathmatch (suffers from the DOOM problem of one weapon too OP makes everything boring) n i dunno just save yourself the money.   If your looking for a coop racing game like mario kart on steam id go with sonic all stars and if your going for like a twisted metal type game, this aint it.
12053	actually thats a bad copy of the game BLUR True value of the game is 2.99$ 4/10
12054	graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ so ya
12055	The videos, screenshots and reviews painted an entirely different picture from what we discovered in this game.  Good ideas, but it feels very negleted to the point where we only saw a total of 3 players online, it felt more like a mini game from UDK or similar, not a full production.  Pros  - Nice graphics - Nice design idea - Quirkly, off the wall   Cons  - A total of 3 people showed online - should have raised suspicions then! - Cannot fire with mouse, ENTIRELY reliant on keyboard controls - Boring gameplay - no real sense of satisfaction in weapons - Repetative after 2 races  Luckily it was on sale but IMO not even worth Â£6
12056	Not particularly enjoyable. Poor controls
12057	this game is crap far to slow coudent get even racing hopless game i will never play this game again
12058	playing the first race, was awesome, not perfect drving but, slick graphics and engaging battles during a race.   but then  I get done with the first race and I have to drive a slow, mini cooper look a like or a 3 wheeled car??   this is such a slap in the face to racing lovers, hate it when games do this waste of time, very low level crap.
12059	the game sucks so hard
12060	Unoptimized to the point of being unplayable. Stick with Blur, or maybe Wipeout; they're much classier games, anyway.
12061	car is all over the place and the ai dont now what the hell they are doing
12062	This game compare to 'Wreckfest' or other racing types, this one has low quality graphics, small rate of cars, and a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay to beggin with! Sure, it takes back the time in 2012th, when the Beta version came out, but the point is, that this game is weak with short story line in it. Just *bleh* xq
12063	A waste of money and time!!
12064	Gets boring and repetitive very rapidly.
12065	not as dank as i wanted it to be
12066	Avoid. Simply broken, no idea whether the game would be any good after all: it won't load.
12067	the came sounds and looks awsome but can i please get my money back my computer doesnt quite run it the way i thought it would. sorry for being a hassel but i would gratelly appriciate getting a full refund.
12068	new patch full bulshit now game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
12069	I dont know why i have spent 19.99â¬ for this game.
12070	Jolly multiplayer, functional bots, and there's ye olde standard SP thing too. The SP races have great names.  You can choose between racing, full on deathmatch, a variety of modes blending those, customise how much rubberbanding there is, and so on.   Some rough edges and some rather curious dev stances ('you want to disable permanent voice broadcasting? pull our your microphone or disable it for all Steam games, easily fixed!') though. It's not unknown that criticism is met with thread deletion, especially in cases where a dev is called out on any of the frequent questionable statements.  This was a 'Yes' review before I noticed the disappearing threads.
12071	I've taken 2 years to finally write a proper review of Assetto Corsa, to try to like it and write a positive review. But I've been let down, so there goes a thumbs-down review.  Assetto Corsa came out almost 3 years ago as an Early Access release for a reasonable price taking into account the amount of bugs, lack of content and everything that an uncompleted game brings. The title got a quick nice response from users for its remarkably detailed physics and the absolutely superb work on cars and tracks modelling, being the tracks laser-scanned. Another positive point well welcomed by the community is the full mod compatibility, which extends the possibilities of the game in terms of content and personalisation to amazement.  Kunos though are a very small developing team which has worked so hard to release new tracks and circuits, all of them officially licensed by brands, and refined the game architecture to add capabilities, fix bugs and improve and optimize graphics and performance. All this work is released slowly, drop by drop, long time between, but at least they release it. This year though they decided to get the game out of Early Access, and with a nice full-price tag of double the initial price. The game itself works smoothly, quite well optimised (don't trust the minimum GTX460 required, you can run it with a GT540 easily) and with full compatibility with any wheel or pad. Where's the problem then?  As said before, the amount of content is alarmingly low. After some years the number of cars and tracks hasn't increased much and the variety isn't quite wide really. You have the full Lotus catalogue and most Ferraris, and then a few other cars like a McLaren MP4/12C and its GT3 version and some other road cars. Don't misunderstand me, having such fleet of Ferraris and some of the fasterst road cars is rather coool. But the problem is that they end up being all the same. All the Lotus cars are similar, Lotus cars are similar to some other featured cars, Ferraris are similar to the other high performance cars... After all, you have an acceptable amount of models, but you can summarise them in a few. There isn't a car that outstands among the others, or different types of cars like go-karts or more motorsport disciplines. In fact, you can differentiate 4 categories: F1 cars, Supersports cars, Sportscars and Abarth. I've driven every single car released and it's like that.  Despite that, with the first non-beta release a DLC came out, which adds the Nordschleife and ten cars, which again you can summarise in 4 new real additions. And for a price of 14,99â¬, right after having paid 49.99â¬ for a game that seriously lacks content. Unreasonable.   The game is limited to hotlapping. AI is just unraceable because it will just stick to the racing line. Make a move and they'll bump into you as if your car wasn't there. Rival cars will never make a mistake nor get corner-cutting penalties, which you get every time you put a single wheel outside the tarmac and that slows you down to 50kph.  Practice and Hotlap sessions are fun though, they feel as if you were actually there driving on a client run. The entire circuit for yourself, just you and your car. Actually it's fun, especially using a wheel. It ends up challenging yourself to beat your lap time, but after some laps it gets boring... Although it's been announced as out of Early Access, the game itself proves it is just the same as before. Only fully playable mode is hotlapping and you can only play on dry track and not at night. The fun part of this game is pushing against the clock to beat your lap times, but if you can only race in the same weather and light conditions the challenging aspect of the game is lost as soon as you have lapped a few times every circuit.  Online was released in mid Early Access and it was reasonable and justified that it didn't work at all. Later updates made it more stable and raceable, but nowhere near from easy to use. It worked with a 'booking' system. There's a server list with the race info (players, ping, track and cars allowed). Those which are post/pre-race are open for around 5 minutes for people to join by 'booking' an entry on the race. There's not even a matchmaking room, you just click the 'booking' button and wait 5 minutes to play, although most times when the countdown ended the server would just crash and force you to book again. If you manage to enter a race room, it is most of the times empty. Bad part of this is that despite being claimed '1.0 version, full release' the multiplayer keeps just the same.  Mods are more or less easy to find. There are portals and forums which have the Mods and Download sections and uploaders generally have a decent knowledge on the matter, so their work is usually nice although don't expect to find everything you're looking for because most of the mods get banned for copyright and licensing. The game though isn't very respectful with mods. After an update you may find that none of the mods you downloaded are compatible, and as they're mods they don't auto-update. Annoying stuff if you have a large collection of mods.  In the technical aspect, Assetto Corsa is close to brilliant. It may not have rainy weather, or night racing, or a proper damage system, or headlights that actually work or breathtaking graphics effects, but the attention to physics has no rival. Aero effects, weight balance, force feedback... Absolutely amazing. If we take a look at updates changelogs, most of the updates have to do with these things. Handling then will be completely realistic, tricky as it should be. It is not at all playable with gamepad though, but this game is a simulator so it's rather 'dumb' to play with anything different from a wheel, which works perfectly once set up.   The base is solid and really promising, but the lack of content is a fact to consider. Not only that, the gameplay is limited and lacks basic functions. I don't want to compare this game with another one because it's not fair and every game is different on it's own, but Assetto Corsa isn't the best option for a race simulator right now. I'd say it's better to wait until more content is released, but I've done that for a long time and it's becoming hopeless. It's not fair to double the price of the game when it has almost the same things that you had when it was Early Access. Not to mention the DLC...  *PATCH EDIT*  2 more DLC...  4.5/10
12072	So finally this game came out of early access and is finished and there can't be any excuses anymore. The game didn't changed much. Kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something. I'm not talking about childish comments like 'your game sucks'.  The game has a big potential. The physics are good. It has great force feedback. You feel the car, you feel almost everything through the wheel, the driving feel is really good.  Developers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department, but still i want to see subaru, nissan, ford, audi, peugeut, opel and many more. Itâs a racing game so we need more cars. Of course i donât want fake 1000+ cars like in GT series, where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars. But i think ~100 different cars is a must and it's going the right way. Yes there're mods, but i want professionally created cars/tracks, not by some amateurs. There's no auto updates for the mods, so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time. And some mods for this game cost money. I don't approve such behavior and will not support it.  The track selection is not very good at the moment. Still thereâs no famous nurgburgring, but it is annouced as DLC. Itâs not like iâm against DLC, but i think such track must be included in the game from the start. Especially seeing how good the game sells they should have the budget now. I think Kunos did not expect such luck. It would be cool to have some fictional tracks as well.  AI. It's bad. AI is not aware of you, they just trying to drive trough you. So racing against AI is not very fun. At least they've sorted the difficulty so it's possible to beat AI now even if you make mistakes. Penalty system is absurd. It punishes you every time you go out of track, no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track. Where's the logic behind this? I'm already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time.  Thereâre challenges too, but theyâre so hard that thereâs no fun playing them, it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless. The best times should be achievable to all players (after some practice of course), even for those which are playing with keyboard/mouse or with a controller, not only for aliens. Online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule. Oh and forget the game if you're playing with a controller. This game must be played with wheel only. If you're looking for something similar to forza or GT, know that this game is nothing like this.  Multiplayer. It's a joke. MP is boring and pointless. There's no leaderboards or player profiles, no statistics. Most of the time there're too little servers, you just can't find a game. You can join the league, but it's not fun for a casual player to compete with pros. After releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added. Of course now every mod can ban/kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason.  Community is one of the worst. AC fanboys are the worst, you can't say anything bad about AC or criticize it. The game is perfect for them.  What year is it? Almost 2015! And there's still no night racing and no weather conditions. Even GT5 has this and it's some old game made for an old console.  Graphics. The cars looks really great, but everything else is just bad. Like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom.  No leaderboards. It is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world, find your country and try to beat the time.  There are few game modes.  Career which consists of races and time attacks, It will take some time for you to complete it and you'll try the cars. Time attack. It's some broken game mode which makes you go slower. The slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get. Drift and drag racing which i'm not interested in so i can't say anything about them.  Another small annoying things: When in photo mode you can't hide the racing line.  Mouse pointer do not disappear while playing.  Can't pause the game and check apps. Racing line is completely broken.  You can have some fun in career mode and in MP with friends, but besides that i can't see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan. I'm still trying to like this game. It has some really attractive things and hope Kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans.   Pros:   Great physics Good graphics Good performance Setup sharing   Cons:]   Lack of tracks Lack of cars No workshop support No leaderboards Shallow career mode Challenges are impossible for a normal human
12073	Solid game but in dire need of more content and better fleshed out multiplayer. Still gets a thumbs up.  EDIT  After a long time I feel the need to edit this review. The price it is going for right now which is about â¬45 is NOT WORTH IT.  No nighttime Nurburgring is in a DLC pack Barely any car brands to choose from.
12074	Here we go with the dam DLC. I bought this game when it was still brand new, beta (Early access). now after waiting for MONTHS finally some good cars, updates and tracks come and I have to pay again? that's total BS. so sick of buying games, and then having to buy more stuff to get the full experience. sigh, what a complete fail. I will not buy your DLC. I'll wait for Project cars, thanks.
12075	Bought this game 7 months ago, physics are great and its a fun hot lap simulator. However its far from finished and Bringing out DLC for 15$ for a few cars is ridiculous when the base game barely has any cars to begin with.
12076	It's an excellent hot lap simulator. Unfortunately that's all it is. And It's not worth 60 dollars.  Kunos continues to be opaque with development, and throw tantrums during any criticism on the forums, banning people that complain. I'll sum it up.  Online: Netcode is garbage. It's extremely difficult to join a race. Server browser sucks and doesn't have enough options. It's not as though that matters, because there's nobody playing.  Single Play:  The AI is nonexistent, so racing offline is a no. They simply don't recognize the fact that you're there. Smashing in to you in an attempt to stick their pre programmed lines. The penalty system is absurd. Two tires off the track and you'll have your speed cut. Get rammed by the braindead AI? Speed cut. Forced to swerve and cut a corner because the AI doesn't acknowledge you as 'there'. Speed cut. The Career mode is a joke. It never feels like you're doing anything or progressing in anything.  There's a time attack mode that is...odd. And pointless, since there's no leaderboards.  Simulation: ALMOST peerless. Everything feels super tight and realistic. The only thing that's lacking is the sound design and force feedback. The forcefeedback is absurdly high by default. You can fine tune this pretty easily, it just takes time. But the game doesn't seem to want to save my settings. I come back to the game to find my degrees of rotation back to a full 900 despite what I have set up in the in game profiler, and the stand alone one I have.  The UI: Terrible. Everything feels extremely wonky. Once you have everything set up and are ready to drive. I'd say race but again, its a hot lap simulator, it opens it in a SEPARATE INSTANCE. Which makes streaming a nightmare.   Even out of early access, and being out for a full year it's worth 30 dollars at best. There's not enough tracks, and not enough cars. There was dlc announced before the game was even released.  The cars themselves look superb, but everything else looks last gen at best, ps2 era at theworst. This is mostly a problem with usermade tracks so its excuseable.   Because the PC is starved for sims that have the latest roster of cars, this game is basically a must play. But buy it on sale. It's not worth full price. It wasn't when it was in EA, and it's not worth it now. I wouldn't spend more than 20 dollars on it. Almost every aspect of the game besides the driving feels incomplete or lazy.  Edit December 2016, hope you like DLC.
12077	This game does an excellent job as a racing/driving simulator. The physics are good, the cars are fun to drive, and its overall very realistic. The reason I recommend you not to buy this is because of it's lack of content. A lot of the cars feel the same. There is very little difference between each car, and there are not even that many cars to select from. The track selection is also mediocre.   The real fault in this game is the lack of good multiplayer support. The multiplayer in this game is just a series of community servers. Its very hard to find a server hosting a legit race. If the game ever introduces a matchmaking-type multiplayer, then this game would definitely be a must-buy. But as of now, the multiplayer sucks. You run out of contect quickly with singleplayer, and after about 10-15 hours you lose your drive(haha) to play the game.  Overall, the game does an amazing job at capturing real driving, and makes it super fun to drive the cars. This being said, there is very little content, and will bore you very quickly. Not worth at full price, maybe worth at half price if you REALLY want to drive some realistic cars.
12078	Great for hotlaping. Iconic cars. Great Force Feed Back and car handeling. Laser scanned tracks. Modable.   Terrible Ai and bare-bones multiplayer.
12079	TL;DR: The following review is inaccurate (because it is now a year old) and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things, I still do not recommend this hotlap-simulator.  Update: a year after, it seems like the netcode and AI have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track. They added 4WD support and a few free cars next to the DLCs to show off this new feature of the physics engine. DLC #3 has been released, with some Lamborghinis, nice to see them deliver that promise. One of the Lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game (if I remeber correctly). All in all, if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don't care for AI or online multiplayer, you might want to try the game. Beware though, it is a simulator, so it is best played using a steering wheel, preferably a 900degree, so you can use the full lock of the cars.   With the announcements of the Dream Pack #1 DLC I felt like I needed to warn potential buyers of this game. So here it goes: After having pre-purchased this game and having early-access being able to play the beta, it was a pretty good experience, the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles (eg: BMW M3 E30, BMW M3 E92, BMW Z4 E89, BMW 1 Series M Coupe, KTM Xbow, Lotus Evora SR, Lotus Elise SC) The front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me, but as I am not a fan of these I will pass the subject. Now for the gameplay aspect: Menus are reasonably well designed and constructed, the options menus is very big with a lot of options (very nice to see). Just a little side note, menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your PC cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game... Graphics, well oh boy... The optimisation... the obvious lack of thereof... The graphics look good but it's nothing extremely spectacular and yet I struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate (my system: 2-way SLI of GTX 680s, an i7 4770k @4GHz and 16GB of RAM) The in-game UI is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion, but Kunos has THE answer, modding... Yes, like the rest of the game, you can mod, and the UI is coded in Pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else. I will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub-par to all the other simulations I've played but it was about 8-9 months ago so it might have changed. The AI is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track, the difficulty of the AI is also something strange... You, well I at least, can't keep up with the race leader, if you don't overtake the AI in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you'll never catch up, interrestingly, if you turn the scenario the other way around, if you are the race leader, even if you don't drive that well and don't set lap records they'll never catch up (assuming you don't crash of course). So finally Assetto Corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with... not a lot of content. 37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car 10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter variant A drag strip for quarter and full mile A dedicated drifting playground 'track'  But this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards... Yes you guessed it, they have at least 1 DLC planned.  Regarding the controls also very important to note, if you do not have a steering wheel... well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse... You have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise.  Also apparently 45EUR (or your regional equivalent) is not enough... they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free, they are planning to release a DLC in the coming weeks... months...? but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only DLC that is planned... What the F is wrong with game devs nowadays? Why DLC? Whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished, when there is content that make the game worth buying?  At this point I don't know what I should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added, and see how much the DLC will cost... As I generally do with any game that does include DLC in its roadmap... look at blizzard people please, they have a roadmap that says: 1-dev 2-bugfix 3-release 4-make sure everything is stable 5-dev DLC* 6-Bugfix DLC* 7-release DLC* (8-repeat steps 4 to 7)  * In Blizzard terms, DLC means expansion that is downloadable, your game does not tell you all the time 'this content is part of a DLC to unlock it buy the DLC', no instead it doesn't show anything of it in-game, it does show however a nice thing on the  Battle.net  Launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game. A Blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a DLC and for a good reason, it add a butt-ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome Pixar-like quality animations for cutscenes... PLEASE EVERYONE STOP BUYING DLC...  And here isa little bonus (yay more text). It's the comment I left on the Assetto Corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the Dream Pack #1 DLC: Not long ago they made something 'very fun and appropriate'. They released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with Lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game, and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game... They're part of the upcomming DLC (not the lambos, these are clearly coming later)  The modding aspect is great, allowing and encouraging modding is great. But making an engine adding 10-15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class (essantially the same model but with 300 HP instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn't make it that different), 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard-work to make the game worth a damn by making mods, and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it's an elite game, we want to have good content... (The please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum, feel free to go and check it ot yourself)  I am not happy about the money I spent on the game, it was too much for the content provided... I would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game, because frankly 'Your racing simulator'... Well it bloody hell isn't mine...  Thanks for making it this far :)
12080	This game refuses to let me play a race, and the developer refuses to offer any support. Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.  I emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.
12081	Assetto Corsa is a half finished game and I cannot recommend it. AC works fine as a hotlapping sim. You'll ohh and ahh at the graphics but that's largely all there is here. For something to be called 'your racing simulator', there actually has to be racing involved. It should be called 'Your Hotlapping Simulator'.  - No Single Player Pit stops - No Rolling starts - No weather - No Night racing -The Single player portion is largely worthless. The AI is not worth running against. They run off track, run over each other, and run into the back and sides of the player.  -Each time Kunos 'improves' their game, it breaks some other part (sound for modded cars, graphics, etc - The force feedback is far over exxagerated - The tire model is laughable compared to other sims and thus the reason it is changed with each patch. - you'll cringe at the CPU Occupancy errors stating your CPU is at 99 percent when while running a CPU monitor, it shows 60 percent usage -If you have Windows 10, forget about running this sim. Devs on the official forums response is to reinstall windows or DDU your graphics drivers (in other words, they can't fix it).  Wretched game In my opinion. Had the refund option been in place when I purchased it, this turd would have gone back to Kunos.
12082	Although very well done as a simulator, Assetto Corsa still lacks content and features that it should have had long before they even thought about releasing a dlc. For me to come back to this game 6 months after purchasing to find it in almost the same state I left it with the only difference being half the cars required me to buy a dlc to use was aggravating to say the least.
12083	As a simulator this game is absolutely incredible. The physics are a bit unforgiving if you drive beyond your limits, as it should be. Furthermore, the graphics look wonderful (Use the Glide filter to prevent brightness adjustment, by the way) and the selection of cars both mod and official are pretty decent.  As a racing game in today's market, it's not that great. Single-player AI is pants-on-head stupid, the track selection is incredibly small, and multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable at 200+ ping. Official leagues don't exist, public lobbies are filled with idiots, and you'll rarely ever find a good room of people using any of the more interesting disciplines, like the Lotus Eleven.  If you are a racing simulation enthusiast, this is a decent choice for you. I love driving the Mercedes 190E DTM around the Nordschleife, right where it belongs. The tracks are all very well done, and some of the mod tracks and cars are unbelievably fun and/or to AC's laser-scanned standards. Lake Louise is a fun loop around the Canadian Rockies, and Bridgehampton is just as bumpy as you'd expect a race track situated in Long Island to be. You can drive a Supercharged Cobra 427, but you can grab the mod with the Competition and Street versions as well. There's also a very good NA Miata mod.  If you are anything but an enthusiast, maybe hold off until there is a bigger selection of cars and tracks, or find a different sim to play. I can't recommend this game because SPR is almost broken and MPR is unplayable, if not frustrating.
12084	EDIT: Ok, so i have lightened up a little since last time. Since the 1.5 update i have been playing it sporadic, with so much love that i almost cant explain it. But it still misses out on rain wich i think it's a disgrace to the Ayrton Senna legacy, if they continue to let it out. Monaco too.... So my thumb stays down until further notice. No rain no gain.    'The waaaiting is the hardest part' Tom Petty once sang. I think it describes this sim perfectly since there are lots of promises but no will of doing them justice. Green hell with DLC cars was kinda expected september this year but we still havent seen it. It's a good racing game but the waiting is the hardest part as said before. I will certainly never buy an early access game ever again.
12085	So as far as realism goes, Very good. Looks over all, Very good. Online mutiplayer, garbage. Carreer mode, meh at best.   PROS: Looks very nice while playing. The driving aspect is good through controller and a wheel is best! (DUH) Tracks are fun, and the variety of cars is great.  CONS: I started out with Career mode. Let me tell ya. Borin as hell. No realistic feel what so ever. They are dumb AI. Single line race and easy to predict. Easy to get first place. Dont even have to finish the race. Get in first place and just stop in front of the other cars and watch them retire. Then you can retire and walla.  Mutiplayer: (sigh) This is where it all goes wrong! I was hoping for a very fast pace join in and race game. This is not it. Join in and watch peeps screw off is more like it. Trying to get the feel for the track/qualifying is a problem simply due to the other people. There are always people crashing into you for fun. Starting a race can take up to 20 mins before any magic starts to happen, and when it finally does start, you got those peeps that are not serious and want to crash. I thought thats what GTA is for. Over all It doesnt take long before I sign into a another game and have a dissapointed view of this game.   THE FIX: Dont play this game, Play a different one. (For me at least). My friend who convinced me to get this game say's otherwise.
12086	 Early Access Review
12087	I have change my mind about this game for several reasons. This game is NOT complete, if you have brought it wanting and expecting a Â£35.00 (At the time of writing) game, then you are going to be dissapointed. Don't let them fool you this IS still in early acsess. A list of things that are broken:  Most conserningly for a 'complete' game, the A.I is the worst I have seen in a racing game in along time. They do not know where you are on the track, and will in effect ram you off the road by overtaking in the worst points. This also means that the career is only possible if you are on easy and some kind of God. Also it makes any race very annoying. I may not be the greatest driver, but getting more than third in most races in impossible.  The down-shifting is broken. It will wait untill the car is at 3000 RPM untill it changes down.  You need a wheel, otherwise it is unplayable, meaning it in NOT a relaxing game to sit down and play.  There are some, good things, one major thing is that the handling physics ARE good, but you will only get 20 hours gameplay max from hot-lapping.  My outcome is that this game is to damn expencive.  (P.S I do relise that the dev's put alot of hard word into this game, and I think that this game, whilst in my OPINION is not the greatest at the moment this COULD be an exquisit game. It just not worth Â£35.00 yet. I will continue following this game and I will change this Review when the next big update comes out)  Also my wheel's rotation sensor is broken, but this is the ONLY game in my Steam game list that does not fix this temporarly, meaning on this game, 90% of the time I have to go through long lists to get force feedback working properly, taking sometimes upto 30 mins to fix this, EVEN GTA 5 DOES THIS!
12088	I love this game. I really do. But I can not recommend this game at all. I bought this game when it was in early access for about $35.00. I have watched this game grow into what it is today and now you can just see greed taking over the developers, I have spent 120+ hours waiting for new cars with every update but now they have DLC. It would be even worse for the people who bought this game now for $55.00. So on top of the original price tag of $55.00 people still need to pay $17.00 for the dream pack. What an utter display of corporate greed.   (They also say that it is their first dream pack that came out and implying that there are going to be more. I'm sorry but no. I just can't recommend it.)
12089	After years since early access even if is has been launched the game still feels incomplete, the game engine is good but lacks more cars variety and race-tracks, single player experience is minimal, the AI is Broken, and with all this DLC garbage it is just the opposite as i was expecting for a racing sim game, not worthy for the price. and after the latest updates they just broke the game for me and now it doesn't even start anymore.
12090	I'm not sure why I bought this game... maybe it was that little shinning hope that when it does come out of early access it would be a brand new amazing game. Every time I play this game I remind myself how bare bones and awful it is. I honestly don't know why the community holds this game up in such high regards.  Not all is bad I mean there's plenty of things to like the number one thing being the physics model it's fun amazing and engaging. There tonnes of graphics and user options to mess around with which is great, there's also plenty of support for controllers and wheels. There's a decent single player campaign and a fun multiplayer but that's as far as it goes for me when it comes to the good stuff.  Now the bad considering I paid around $40 back when it was in early access and it now has only like 16 tracks and about 40-50 cars... an embarrassing line up of cars at that too, not to mention half the cars are just the same damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyways and the rest of the good stuff is behind paid DLC. The menus are clunky and more often than not you run into bugs. There is still only 3 good modes more like 2 good modes hot lap, time attack and *cough* 'shitdriftmode' *cough* and to top it off this game doesn't even try to add Steam Workshop considering its only saving grace is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mods.  I'm honestly shocked how people actually want this... is this what the community wants? Just a nice physics driven game with a huge lack of content? I'm honestly ashamed to even own this game, if the only thing this game has going for it is the physics than I rather look elsewhere for a game with actual content.
12091	I really want to like this game, great driving, good mod support, good graphics, just lots of good. But the game is yet to feel finished, they realised the first DLC recently, and I was thinking to myself, 'what? That's absurd! You can't release DLC for an Early Access game!' So I went to the store page and found that the game wasn't in Early Access anymore.  And this is the meat of my issues with this game, it's contentless. There's a miniscule number of cars, and a tiny number of tracks, and this would be ok, if the game was $30 dollars, but it's $50, almost full price, yet, there isn't enough to warrant the price.  I feel jipped when I play this game, yeah, there are mods, but when a game's best feature is something someone else has done, then there is a problem.  This asking price is also annoying for those of us (like myself) who have a limited budget, when I first purchased this game for $30 dollars, I felt a little ripped off, but I thought to myself, 'don't worry, they'll add more content.' Yet they haven't, and I still feel like I've been had. Despite me paying almost half then the current asking price, I still don't feel like I've got a good deal. If I'd purchased this game for $50, I'd probably be ripping my hair out currently.   Yes, this game has a lot of good points, but due to the fact that there is a laughably low amount of content in this game, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone who has respect for their money. If you have money coming out of your eye balls, then go ahead, buy it, enjoy a very good simulation of driving, but if you don't, then move on, because this is simply a waste. 
12092	Before you read the rest of my review please understand i would love to give this a recommendation but at the current time just dont feel i can.  Since i purchased this in the early access stage i have tried repeatedly to enjoy this game, yes i believe there should be some enjoyment in playing a simulation and not just tedium. Unfortunately i cant recommend this game except to the most hardened driving simulation fans and even they will suffer at some point from the absolute perfect driving of the A I . This isnt even mentioning when the AI wish to pass you on a corner etc the answer seems to be quite simple - rear end you , this leaves you ( not them at any point i noticed ) careening onto the grass / track edge for a penalty or slow down to 50kmh ( something you would expect to find in an arcade game with catch up enabled! .  Unfortunately this games just feels like an exercise in stress. I will commend the team for improving the overall driving experience since the early access but the A I simply hasnt been well adjusted.   Another unusual presence in this game is the career mode choices , a time trial just for 'the fun of it' seems to be thrown into career mode, whilst i can understand this gives you chance to practice the track before engaging in a race so does practice ( thats kind of what its there for ) .  I think ultimately the developers need to understand that whilst there are many hardened sim racers out there who will thoroughly enjoy most of this experience they have ultimately sold themselves short by not creating a particularly enjoyable experience.   If you are willing to invest a lot of time of the steep difficulty curve and love racing sims then get it. If you like racing games in general this probably wont be your cup of tea.
12093	This game has been great the handful of times I have been able to get the the non-early access version to run. The support forums are dismissive and downright clueless and why on earth does a game need external python to be install outside of Steam (thats the advice I get from their tech support when I post about my issues, they seem to think it is a cure all for all the games issues...)?  Save your money and buy something else!
12094	Game has a paulty selection of cars and tracks, menus feel undone and most of the game feels half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I thought the game was unfinished and so i was withholding my review until the final product but the inclusion of 15$ dlc has me believe otherwise. The nurbergring is paid dlc btw
12095	Do you enjoy Forza? Looking for something similar, but that you can play on PC? Hoping to use an Xbox 360 controller or something similar because you don't have $300-$1000 of disposable income to buy on a racing wheel? Look elsewhere.   I bought this because I have played all kinds of racing games over the years, but hadn't really found a good PC racing game. This looked like the answer, but after a little over a half an hour of skidding into walls while trying frantically to saw at the wheel in a vain attempt to regain control of my vehicle, I realized that this is not the game for me.  Realistically, in the 'Requirements' section, a racing wheel should be listed. If you're going to say that you support the Xbox 360 controller, then I shouldn't have to futz with the settings just to finally get it to a point where the most minute of movements doesn't have the driver spinning the wheel frantically from side to side. Honestly, this problem has been SOLVED. Turn 10 obviously is aiming almost exclusively for the 360 controller, but these developers basically just shoved in some nonsensical presets and called it a day. It appears to respond as it would to the analog input of a wheel, which is ridiculous. A wheel has wildly different affordances than a 360 controller, yet the default presets make the game unplayable with said controller.  Not to mention the fact that the game crashed multiple times on me in various settings menus. I'm very disappointed with Assetto Corsa. As a racing fan, I was hoping that this would be the answer for my craving for a solid racing game to replace Forza. What I received was a buggy game that only appears to be enjoyable if you've got a racing wheel. Which is fine, but I wish I had known that *before* I dropped $60 on the game. Now, because there is no refund policy for games that you instantly regret buying, I get to look at this game resentfully in my library every time I open Steam.  If you've got a pro racing setup already in your home and you're a racing sim veteran, then this review really isn't for you. However, if you, like I was previously, are looking for something to fill a Forza-sized hole in your PC library, look elsewhere.
12096	Game is okay - controls and response from my controller seem sluggish and delayed, which makes it hard to play. My biggest complaint? The fact they just released a $15 DLC pack, and the main game itself has such a tiny collection of cars. on top of that, there is no menu music, the buttons don't clearly state what they are so you're kind of left guessing in some parts, and the controller support only works during a race and not for any of the menus! Why would I want to put my controller down and grab my mouse/keyboard for navigating the menu?   In conclusion - game has a lot of potential, but come on AC team. Get your prirorities straight, and deliver us a good complete game before you go fishing for more DLC money...
12097	I wanted this game to be good. But its just not a good racing game. I hate to say this but simraceway is far better. Simraceway has things I dont like about it, but at least the racing is fun.
12098	I'd be happy paying a max of 25-30 dollars for this game but no where near what I paid for it.  Pros:  -fast load times make it easier to quit the game -An idea to bring a 'simulation' racer to the PC  Cons:  -Limited cars, can't believe it's been out this long and theres only that many to choose from -Sound effects are great on some cars and absolutly terrible on others -Every windscreen in the game is dirty apparently, funny this because it's based on tarmac, they're all dirty, so enjoy when you're driving towards the sun, over done linear glare that makes it impossible to see anything, this is NOT a simulation feature, this is just poor practice -Lousy textures on scenary, seriously terrible -Game play feels far to linear  It just doesn't feel exciting enough, it feels so boring (Is it lacking atmosphere?) and I'm basing this off the price I paid for it which was $75AUD   I think perhaps if they stick with this and knuckle down it'll be a decent game in a couple years time, however by then we'll have alot more out hopefully, so I'd probably skip on this if you enjoy the forza series and GT series. It's nothing like them, it feels less than one quater of what those games offer.
12099	Honestly i had so much hope for this Sim... the Problem is that its nothing more than a hot lap sim .... the Career mode sucks, no pit stops, no quali, the damage model is a joke, no night racing, no endurance (nothing more than 30 lap race), NO WEATHER and news that the game is going to be ported to console. The game isn't even ready on PC let alone porting it over to a console. Get a grip Such a shame because as i say it has got a lot of hope going for it. Why on earth they made DLC is madness in my eyes. Also there hasn't been a patch since April.... we are in July now. I pray to god they get there act together. At least the game isn't as bad as Project Cars. Its nowhere near as good as ISI or Reiza Studio games.
12100	The actual driving of the cars is good, but this is about it. The game is NOT fun at all, and I mean in the sense that everthing is so frustratingly complicated, Menus, Multiplayer, settings etc. Trying to host a server is a pain in the butt you need to have a degree in IT. I have come to the point that I am not playing anymore due to the fact that I cannot have a proper racing session with my friends. Project cars is more simpler, even though not as realistic, but at the end of the day it does not matter.
12101	Do not buy if you do not have a wheel and pedals.
12102	I thought it was quite awful, to be honest. Worst 25 bucks I've spent in a long time. It lacks polish and has a cheap feel to it. Buy Dirt Rally or Forza or something. Graphics are meh too, even at ultra. I got this game refunded.
12103	The controller support was a nightmare, I could not get it working and ended up spending 90 minutes looking it up solutions. I refunded it after that.
12104	Il explain my experience here. And a few absolutes. After switching on most games you get to play them However that was not thecase with AC. I havent managed to play it yet. The General User Interface (GUI) is in one word... Diabolical. It is set up like a website and not very clear what you have to actually do to get it to work. I set the screen at 800x600 because that is the only way I could get it to display the whole thing. (its usually 1280x900/720).  Then when I get on the actual track its not clear how to get the car to actually move... Then when it eventually does move, its undrivable with massivve oversteer (not very realistic at all). But if that was the only problem I wouldnt have commented here. I would have sorted it but to be frank this game will never get played. The whole experience of it is as mentioned Diabolical.   I like to pick up my controller and press the buttons and play. This requires constant use of a mouse which to me makes it unplayable. If I could get my money back I would. Its terrible. And will never play it.  
12105	Game is completely lacking in content: few cars and very, very few circuits.  Their idea of a single-player campaign is so half-arsed they needn't have bothered putting it in.  To make things even worse you have to reinstall your video drivers everytime you want to play. Otherwise you load into a black screen.  I can't wait for Project Cars.
12106	A half finished game that came out of early access a year too soon.
12107	Update November 2015: ======================= As of the newest version 1.34 the game still has the most annoying flaws I mentioned in my original review. These are jaggy shadows, really bad anti aliasing, moirÃ© effects on the guard-rails, flickering polygon edges, only basic skin variations for some cars and so on. So I still can't recommend the game until you can grap it for 10 bucks.   Original Review: ======================= Missing content that is normally standard for a racing game, incomplete features, bugs and texture as well as shadow flickering are the reasons why prolonged fun is difficult to come by in this game and why I can't recommend it as of now (v1.04). By my mind this game is as of v1.04 in in a beta state and should not have been released like this.  In Detail: I expect from a racing game that advertises fully featured single player modes at least one thing and that is that I will be able to race against AI opponents with a field of at least 20 cars that are of the same racing league and where every single car has its own livery. However, this is as of v1.04 not the case in Assetto Corsa!  Further, some of the skins that come with the game are very basic like the ones for the RUF Porsche or the Fiat 500 Abarth. They do not have any numbers on them or stickers, nothing, just plain single- or bi- colored paintjobs. Makes it difficult to drive in a pack of say 20 and differentiate who is who without turning on hovering driver names over the cars.  Besides those missing basic features this game has other serious problems with flickering shadows and moirÃ© effects on the guard-rails. Unfortunately no configuration settings so far could fix it and the devs do seem to ignore the issue on the official forums so there is no help for it there either. By the way I am playing on a GTX 970.  Other problems are related to performance issues specifically the game displaying a warning about the CPU occupation above 95% but when I check the performance records in the Windows 7 Resource Monitor I can see that my CPU shows just 50% usage. Again no help in the official forums could be found even though several threads for the issue exist.  On top of that a lot of small bugs are very annoying like brake bias that sometimes will not adjust when I press the button for it or the game crashing when I try to assign a function to the ^-key on my keyboard and so on.  So as of now the fun, even so it sometimes is there when the game works for some time as one would expect, goes away very fast because of the small anoyances that in the sum are just to much to keep it going.
12108	Wow. No music, no controller enabled menus, resets your tv unless you choose an option?  True, its one of the FEW racing sims on PC. Thats all its got going for it. If youve got a Sim setup, great for you, else wait till this drops to 5 bucks. Thats all its worth to anyone else who doesnt drop $1000+ into a sim machine (wheels, chairs, etc.). This is an application - very far from an actual game.  For 50 bucks I'd expect a much more professional approach and appeal.  
12109	Every time i click on 'drive' the game bothers me with opening his DLC-Site. It totaly deserves a negative assessment just for that f... behaviour.
12110	The best Racing Sim/Hard+software engineer RPG ever made.  Want to race beautifully rendered high powered cars around outstanding laser scanned tracks from around the world? Hells yeah! Want a really excellent car set-up ability that really feels like it makes a difference? This game really does have all that in spades. Okay the career is a bit boring, but online racing is good. The cars really handle very differently to each other and the laser scanned Nurburging Nordschleife is an absolute joy to drive.  Then a couple of times a year a patch comes along +/- DLC. This is where the game suddenly becomes RPG.   You've proved your metal on the track, you've fine tuned those racing machines to your perfection...now have you got what it takes to do the same to your PC and the software? Before you can get back out on to the track you must cut your way through another field of hopefuls, all floundering in the sand trap cos the FPS drop sent them there, desperately trying to find the fix to get them out of the techno babble hell they've been sent to. My fellow hopeful asked a simple question on a forum (the guy had about as much knowledge as me...not a lot) and got this reply....'26% total core load, yes but what are your individual core loads? You might have one core being hammered to the point that it affects the proceeding cores causing a bottleneck.' FANTASTIC! Possibly the worst good point I ever saw on a gaming forum.   I've been stuck in this RPG phase of the game over a week. Sure I've learnt some stuff about hardware and software, but really I just want to drive a racing car in a video game. I don't want to be going into game files and changing numbers or spending 20hrs in forums after every patch.  If I was to score out of ten, 5 for the drive sim, 0 for the RPG. 5/10.
12111	instead of fixing multiplayer or single player gameplay (engine sound, physics,model etc.) ,they just keep releasing DLCs  edit:they even copy exact same physics from other cars and put them in recent DLC. Think twice before you purchase.
12112	I love driving in this game. The physics are difficult but once you get over the learning curve it's very rewarding. The graphics are outstanding, as is the sound. But that's all this game has going for it.  The career mode could not be more dull. It's a very simple, linear game. And since there are hardly any cars or tracks it gets repetitive. There is nothing to work for. No currency to buy cars, no 'tournaments' that you can only enter by meeting certain qualifications, no licences. I'm not even sure why they call it a career mode. The experience of being a carrer racing driver is not there.  Coming from console gaming, and in particular playing the Gran Turismo series, this game is a huge letdown. I am hoping somebody comes out with a decent sim eventually because there's not much to offer on PC right now.
12113	- good simulator - nice textures, ok shaders - game engine supports 1 light source, which is dumb in 2015, this mean NO SHADOWS, NO REFLECTIONS, NO NIGHT TRACKS, etc.. - lack of CONTENT (car/tracks wise) 
12114	As a big fan of rF2 i have to say that i dont like AC, the FFB has gotten a lot better than it used to be, but its still bad, the cars physics are, alright but their quality varies widely from car to car. The UI is good and terrible at the same time, not having possibility to do any settings changes without leaving track back to menu is very frustrating. Kunoz now started presenting DLCs for which you need to pay extra, something you will never see at rF2. AC simply does not offer what i am looking for in a simulator, that is the reason why i wouldnt buy it knowing what i know, and definetly not recomend it. There are far better simulators. Sorry
12115	First of all, i sould say i've never played a Racing Sim. I was hoping for a PC Gran Turismo, but it's a lot more hardcore. I can't seem to even corner properly, i just go straight most of the time. I need more practice :)  Update With a bit more practice right now, i can corner a bit. It doesn't do me much good at the moment, i'm stuck on the second career challege (the Fiat 500 Abarth SS race). Now, here's something i've noticed in most racing games: the fixed pattern your opponents will follow and can't be moved from. I crashed into another car, which left me spinning, but the other car just kept driving in his fixed pattern.  Normally this isn't much of a deal, but here a wrong corner will make you lose the race. Assetto Corsa is that kind of game. One mistake, you lose the race and hit the reset button. Which is what i have been doing for the past hour; hitting the reset button. I'm beginning to fear that this game is not for me.
12116	This game should still be in early access. Great physics, no content, you get bored after while.  You can have millions of cars and tracks, but that alone is not enough to make full featured game.  This is a missed opportunity for a great racing sim. Hopefully they will make it into a full game one day. I even have Oculus rift and not even that saves this.
12117	Nordschleife is a DLC? In a racing simulator with so little content? FOR TEN BUCKS? You must be joking. Or insane.
12118	This is the best damn burnout, crashing and super overpowered unbeatable ai simuator i have ever wasted 50 bucks on. I want my money back. Dont buy it unless you have a 200 dollar steering controler. And a lot of patience. Neither of which i have.
12119	i think this is ridiculous... not only are the greedy people now charging for dlc packs on an unfinished game but now all modded content is useless... wtf people this is such bull**** its not even funny... i want a refund
12120	Unless you're a true racing sim fanatic and have a racing set up ie; steering wheel, pedals and all that, I'd avoid this one. I found it pretty boring. The only reason I bought it was because it was on sale (hardly), and I was looking for a good racing game. Unfortunately I didn't find it here.   4/10  Bring Forza to PC Microsoft...
12121	DOESNT WORK FOR WINDOWS 10 WOULDN'T EVEN LOAD THE GAME AND WHEN I HAD WINDOWS 7 IT GAVE MY PC 40 FPS AND ON PROJECT CARS I GET 100...
12122	There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but at the same time there's nothing really fun about it either. Assetto Corsa does nothing at all to distance itself from the current crop of racing games. It lacks any sort of spirit or identity, and ends up feeling far too sterile and almost mechanical in nature. There's just not enough here for me to recommend this game.
12123	can you please fix the start engine button not working. i spent good money on the game and even a car pack and every time i click the button to start a race it just loads for 5 seconds then goes back to the menu
12124	Great racing simulation but the lack of content and a competent career mode makes this game unreccomendable.
12125	I was looking for a bit of a change from iRacing, boy are we spoiled over there. This was trerrible.
12126	Not worth owning unless you have a wheel.
12127	This is a really good game and probably the best in terms of driving i've played. However the lack of features in this game makes it really hard for me to recommend it, it feels like it is still in beta. However the modding community for this game is spectacular. So If you are ok with loads of modding etc then go for it but personally i was looking for a more complete game which for me this wasn't
12128	This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game doesnt even work since the last patch
12129	Great mechanics, horrible UI and seriously lacking content. Everything is DLC. A racing sim with DLC that is more expensive than the base game.  Nurburgring-Nordshliefe - DLC Brands Hatch - DLC McLaren P1 - DLC GT40 - DLC FXX-K - DLC and so on...  I supported this game back when it was early access because I liked how realistic it was and wanted more cars/tracks. Turns out you get very little without the DLC.
12130	Worked great for a while, started crashing instead of loading races. Multiple attempts over several months to fix it (repl. drivers, settings, uninstall/re-install, etc.) still won't load a race. Black screen then crashes back to the launcher. It appears the only thing that stands a chance at fixing this god awful product at this point is a full re-install of Windows. I have neither the time nor the inclination to bother with that. Broken game can â¥â¥â¥â¥ right off.
12131	I really want to like this game for its physics and overall driving experience, that i give 10/10. For the game overall i give a 6/10, as i beleive there isnt a game there. You just drive around tracks with these nice cars, which i give them credit for the cars are done really well. The ai has no character about it at all, they never make mistakes, and when they do its predictable on the same corners, like its programed. The career mode is terrible. Not really any incentive to keep going in career. A career to me is something you can work toward, with proper races, and incentives to win the next race. This career mode basicly gets you to try out all the cars, as you progress through it. This game is a simulator, it definetley simulates a driving expereince, just no game part. If you enjoy just going for a cruise in exotic cars doing hotlaps its awsome. For the game part it gets boring. Multiplayer i have not played, so i dont know and cant comment on this aspect.  There is just no decent depth to the concept of Driving in this simulator (game). For example Dirt Rally, F1, Test drive. Using seasons, having a time concept to the game, getting attached to the competitors, a background to why you are racing, maybe even having a money system in it. To make you earn that exotic car you love. To make a car simulator great its the little things over and over that make something big. In movie terms there are some good actors, and acting in Assetto Corsa, but just no plot. Movies are uninteresting with no plot, as you know, and so can games (simulators) be.  I think mods are good in games, simulators, but when you buy a product you would expect it to be good in its own right, we shouldnt have to rely souly on the mods to make the game good. If the game is good by itself, mods would only enhance the goodness of the game.
12132	Sadly i love this game... But i can't recommend it to anyone...  The main reasons are as follows.  -Horrible AI (The AI drive like you don't exist... You will get pushed off at every opportunity.. I race mostly offline and when a car is right behind me i can't race the track anymore i just have to push beyond all my braking points just so that i avoid the AI ramming into me or taking an inside turn when one doesn't exist. I don't understand why this is such a problem for assetto when there are games out there that do pretty good with AI i mean.... atleast the AI is aware that you exist... As for AI vs AI it's non-existent. They just drive the line and that is it... )  -Kunos doesn't listen to their customers as to what they want in this game and consistently release DLC's that no one really asked for and are priced terribly high.   -I tried a g27 a TS500 and a Fanatec. Sadly they controls are just too senstive. I've tried everything to reduce them from within the game or outside and it doesn't reduce sensitivity. Other games easily have this problem solved by allowing you to change sensitivity of your pedals and wheels but this doesn't exist in Assetto. The closest thing they have to sensitivity is brake gamma which really has a set curve that you can move along and with nothing for steering or for accelerator settings... I do not drive any car with TC or ABS even if it comes as factory. For me that kills all the fun in braking with the right pressure and actually preventing your car from spinning out when coming out of turns or braking hard. Some people like just pushing down on the brakes and letting the abs do the work for them.. To me that isn't racing if all you have to do is accelerate to full and brake to full... It makes no sense to me and i don't see any challenge or fun in that.. I've asked Kunos many times to simply add settings for sensitivity but alas as you can see they just ignore everything even though Kunos well knows it will help alot of people out. You can go and type in sensitivity with assetto corsa in google and see for yourself.  -Very bad multiplayer setup. If you want to host a server for a simple race with some friends be prepared to do your homework since it isn't anywhere near as easy as other games where you just click on setup server or custom server or start an internet game. Kunos has almost willingly made it very tedious to run a server of your own.  -No crash damage... You do see a diagram of your car come up and turn different colours as you damage certain parts but as for visually don't expect to see anything apart from perfect cars... Makes no sense to me....  - Nothing to do with weather or nighttime racing.  - No pit stops....  - Basically this game simulates a car i guess really well... That is where it stops. This isn't a racing game its just a car simulator. Please don't get mistaken before or if you buy this game.   The only reason i love this game.  - The physics are great.  - FFB is great and you can feel the car really nicely..   I'm sorry to anyone that wants this game so badly. I just find it so upsetting when Kunos has such a great game and there are very clear suggestions put to them from many people as to how they can really help change this game. But it is beyond me and this doens't go for Kunos only but it is beyond me why devs don't listen to their customers and tailor the game to what they want or need just like any other seller of any goods. It's usually a demand or a niche that people try to provide to which Kunos fails to do everytime. I mean simple things like allowing additional settings has nothing to do with whether most people will like it or not. Just give people the options to race anywhere with any opponents to have all steering and pedal options available... I really don't see this as hard or challenging in anyway...  Lastly and sadly... Assetto Corsa is the only game i know of where i had to do so much research and reading just to even find information that is important. I've got this game during Early Access and i've seen it grow but i'm sorry that Kunos decided to go this way because it saddens me that they really have a rough diamond in their hands... I just wish they would cut and polish it the correct way and the way it's customers want... I still get confused till today as to why devs don't do what their customers ask...
12133	I have played assetto corsa now for about a day and a bit, and i have to say that i do not recommend it. Why? Yes, the graphics may be really good, and the mods you can get are amazing, the reson that i have to thumb this game down is because of the AI. It is pretty bad. They seem to have magical powers of speed when they're in front of you, but, if somehow you manage to catch them up, they are the slowest thing ever, and not to say, at the start, they will take you out 9.5/10 times. This makes the game really aggravating for me and I can count on 2 hands how many times i have finished out of the at least 40 races i have started. Yes, everything else is pretty much spot on, but if you can't get one of the most important things right in a racing game, it becomes worthless. I really hope that the devs bring out an update for this, as I really like every other bit of the game.
12134	For anyone wondering PCars is way more fun.  I like this game alot but I cannot recommend it to others for a few reasons. If you decide to buy it it will not be your loss but it seems that racing sims have been plagued by a few but significant glitches. Asseto Corsa is no exception to the palgue that is destroying racing sims lately. Maybe developers are trying to get fans to fall out of love with the genre and create a generation of non- drivers. IDK  The game has absolutely beautifully rendered graphics. WOW just WOW. Impressive. The cars , the tracks, amazing! Ignore the pit crews and fans and it is a 10 on the graphics chart. Cockpit view, frame rate all the above gets high marks no doubt about it.   The down side is the game play itself. How can I say it? It is unplayable. Even with the G920 Force feedback wheel it gets super low marks on the fun scale. No fun, just frustration. I will go into detail for those like my self who desparately want to believe that is must be some terrible mistake.   Physics. On track contact goes like this. I am driving a balloon the AI is driving a Mack truck .I get tapped and all hell breaks loose, that simple. I can ful speed rear-end an opponent and they might wiggle a little before recovering and driving off. That is no way to play but the AI will run you right off the track and you can do nothing about it, including drive away. They pin you and you are stuck together like two magnets. WTF?  Realism. Ok guys so lets race. I have played a score of racers. Sims and arcade. This game asserts itself as a sim no doubt. The AI runs a perfect line everytime. Accelerates perfectly every time. My car however has no consistency in its handling. Tire wear ? Whats that? Keeping the RPMs up? No such thing. Drafting? Nope. Rules? Who needs those , just drive across the grass because that is the only way you can win a lap.  Ok so lets turn the difficulty all the way down and set opponent strength to it lowest. Now it becomes like a Sunday drive. Try turning even one of the difficulty features up to make it more realistic and once again it just become unplayable.   It is really sad because this game had so much potential from appearances. It makes me sad because they come close but miss by so much. Just another beautiful game plagued by zero fun game play. The jokes on me.
12135	Uhm , recently assetto corsa does not load , i have updated it , while going on play button does load screen and goes back to menu , ALSO whenever i am in the menu le wild steam page with assetto corsa dlc page comes up in my browser wtf
12136	This game looked promising while it ran, but constant crashes and troubleshooting ruined the experience. I deem this game completely unplayable.  I am sure it works for some people, but I have reached my limit for trying to get a game to work. There are lots of other race games on Steam that don't require dozens of workarounds.
12137	- carrier is joke and its is pretty much pointless / but hey u can mod'it. - A.I its another joke / yes sometimes they leave you space on the road... just to ram u on next corner xD -game crushing sometimes &lt;for no resonable reason&gt; -not much content / ofc u can buy DLC or mod'it. -no ingame setup for DFGT &lt;yes im not so pro im driving without clutch&gt;  -/+ graphics +running nice on older PCs / ingame presets changing colors,saturation etc.-yes u can mod'it2   - not as nice as pCars  + multiplayer track days and events ( -kinda unclear menu what 2 at begining) + good game for Hot Laps fun      
12138	Graphics are not even CLOSE to what shows in the videos in the steam page. VERY disappointed since the only reason that I bought this game, which is JUST standard racing game with very standard graphics. VERY DISAPPOINTED and feel that the game was sold based on the graphics (check the videos on the steam page) and they aren't spectacular with everything on ultra (TITAN X here).  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
12139	Pro's:  - graphics - sound (better on some cars, worse on others) - amount of options  Con's:  - quantity of content - polish - no weather options - AI - Anti-Aliasing  I had bought the game previously, right after the game went retail, and now I bought it again. Honestly, this game still doesn't feel close to being retail at all. Yes, it's stable and won't crash or drop you back to desktop easily. But that's about it. There's only a handful of profiles so you'll most probably have to setup your controller from scratch. Some functions don't even work, like the joystick on my wheel (normally used for looking around or navigating menus), or are the wrong way around by default (Fanatec pedals).  The default FFB feels artifical and leads to heavy jolts of the wheel now and then. It never feels like a real tire though. The default setup of pedals &amp; brakes (gamme curve) is very nice though and allows for some spectacular feathering. The graphics are nicely detailled and the framerate is rather high, yet the game never really feels smooth and fluid. No matter how you set up the AA, the screen will still drip with jaggies all over the place apart, and that may be funny, the cockpit itself.  I'm sure this game will improve further any maybe in a year or two it'll have the content and polish of a true retail game. Right now, all I'd recommend it for is the Ferraris and, of course, the laser-scanned Nordschleife.
12140	Well, after wanting this game for some time, and paying Â£40.00 and now its Â£23.00, its not even worth Â£3.00, total crap, every time i launch it, the tracks are that bright its un-playable, i have to keep pressing pg up and pg down to adjust the brighter than the sun brightness, then that starts to take away the eye candy, so no point in having the graphics on max because by the time you`ve turned the ultra brightness down, its to damn dark. Now, the handling of some of the cars are such a pile if sh#i#t#e, i have driven some of the cars in the game at speed around the Silverstone F1 track and the cars DO NOT handle the way they do in this game. Wished i had saved my money and brought a proper sim, like mario kart. Utter sh#i#t#e, DO NOT BUY.
12141	not recommended for anything but singleplayer!  worst multiplayer driving i ever encountered anywhere. out of the box there's no point joining multiplayer at all.   looking for a league now to get my moneys worth (i'll appreciate a pm if you have any suggestions)
12142	Paid full price for the game and got dlc for 5 bucks. It's a great sim from physics standpoint, but what troubles me is the countersteering. It's not right. It's very hard to recover a car when you lose the rear end a bit.  There also are not enough cars in the game.
12143	I understand this is a racing simulator, and yes the way the cars handle is better than anything you can buy on a console only game, but for this price (even the sale price) I was expecting a much prettier game. Not the graphics of the cars, but of the interface. It looks like something a highschooler threw together the night before it was due. It feels sluggish to the point where every interface just isn't natural. I found myself clicking things that weren't shortcuts but very much could have been. There are too many points missing in this game and until there is a massive overhaul in graphics and in layout, I will consider this a waste of money.
12144	Game was great in Early Access. The bugs and poorly developed features were understandable at that point.  Then they decided to release the game, while it still is inconplete...  In terms of feel I would give a 9/10. Best feel I get from any racing game.  Globably I can't give more than a 4/10. Severall features are too incomplete for this to be a released game.  Hope they improve in the future, instead of focusing on DLC's  EDIT as of 15/10/2015:  As I feared, game is still looks like an incomplete mess. Still not worth the full price if you want a solid experience.
12145	I have had some fun with AC, but the last twelve months have seen development slow to a crawl and the tyre model get worse and worse. It's clear that their efforts have gone into developing the console version which I have no interest in. All the while they keep pumping out premium DLC that only serves the splinter the community. I should be able to compete in a race against vehicles I don't own in a car that I have purchased instead I have to purchase that content just to get on a server even if I don't feel like buying the car. The AI in this game is also terrible, some of the worst out there, they can't get around a lot of the official tracks without having huge pile ups and will happily run you each other off the track.   I much prefer rfactor2 as an online platform, not to mention it's far and away the best sim out there right now. I mean it rains and a dry line forms based on where cars actually drive and rubber builds up where cars actually drive. AC uses a script that just seems to make the whole track grip up x amount p/lap. I have got rfactor2 outside of steam although I will be converting it to steam soon. I would have thousands of hours in rf2 by now, in some ways I'm glad it hasn't been counting all that time.
12146	this game will not let me play it because when i start it it does fine but when its time im done choosing my car and stuff i click start and or start engine and it just goes straight back to the customisation screen.... i do not recoment this game............. right now atleast,when they update it so it works, sure i do reccomend it. For the time being i dont reccomend it. 
12147	Way too hard on single player.   Is it realistic that you'd need to have a lap time ranked in the top 1000 worlwide in order to beat the very first race on the lowest difficulty setting?
12148	it's a great game don't get me wrong, i just can't get into it like i did forza on the 360... i don't know what it is. just not giving me 'the fizz'
12149	No car in the world oversteers this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing much. Turning the wheel 1 degree left makes you spin and no matter how hard or fast you countersteer, it will act like you aren't even countersteering, or holding the steering wheel at all, and the spinning will go on until you either crash the car or the game.  EDIT: Now Assetto Corsa won't even start at all because it keeps redownloading the same 6.8 GB of update over and over and over. I even tried deleting Steam and all the games i had, including Assetto Corsa. I had to download a cracked version of the game. Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together, Kunos.  EDIT 2:  https://np.reddit.com/r/pcars/comments/35xzjz/a_question_for_those_quick_to_trash_pcars_physics/cr8xlgo   ^^^^^ This guy said everything. I am â¥â¥â¥â¥ing done. I can't even get a refund. This game is a scam, and immediately needs to be removed from steam. No wonder it's made from italians. (I'm italian, i know how italians are.)
12150	Horrible car selection even with first DLC theres just no variety everything is european with the exception of one single vette and you get about 10 tracks total so imo 30 dollars was a ripoff..and the a.i. is in serious need of work..really bland game
12151	I think i am a mediocre to decent player at racing games but when you can't even beat the first race against AI in career mode something is seriously wrong. Other than that the game just simply offers little content with tracks that could have been more interesting.
12152	I bought this in Early Access, and liked it, but was expecting a lot more content. I couldn't belive this was rushed out as a complete game, and now you are going to charge for DLC? Complete the game first!
12153	Before I start this review, I want to point out I am no stranger to racing games, or actual racing experience  Unless you have a top notch wheel, 144hz screen, and a sense of racing, this game can be considered a bummer.  I first played this game with my friend's amazing setup of a dual motor Thrustmaster, custom bracket setup with a Bride Zeta II, 27' G-Sync monitor, as well as a computer that allows for a constant 120FPS. The game was honestly a hundred times more fun than Gran Turismo 6, Forza, NFS Shift 2.  I myself have a Logitech G27, my computer chair and a 27' 120hz monitor, and a computer that allows for a constant 120 FPS, a far cry from what he has.  The game is incredibly unfun unless you have a fantastic setup, I'm struggling to even finish one lap before I quit out of boredom/frustration.   The game feels like it's still in it's beta phase with the mouse/keyboard menu, as well as the very lackluster ambient graphics.  The potential is there, but the execution is definitely not.  TL:DR: You MUST invest in a proper racing setup unless you want to play a game of struggles.
12154	I am running an FX8350 and r290, but the performance in the game is terrible for me, just juddering and laggy and unplayable, and the graphics are quite dated to be honest despite an evening trying to tweak it. I spent half an hour trying to setup my Fanatec wheel with it, but as soon as I restarted the game it forgot all my settings. The convoluted menus are far too mouse centric, I have to jump put of my cockpit just to load and start and race, and then try and jump back in before the green light. Why it doesn't have some basic wheel support for the menus escapes me...  I understand this is supposed to be a hardcore sim, but lacking those basic player focused elements just killed any desire to play with this sim any further, at least until another patch comes out. I've been obsessed with Dirt Rally instead...plug and play works fantastic.
12155	Save up and get Project Cars instead.  I can only recommend this game if you REALLY like the cars that are in it. As Project cars is far more polished, and has alot more content. (and a bigger playerbase too)

12157	I review this game as single player as I do this most. I have most racing sims at the moment from everyone thereâs something to enjoy, I have seen a lot of mixed reports about this game but I thought I would give it ago, I havenât played this game from early when it was released. I also got the dream packs awell   i started the game I have to say I love the graphics I think itâs about right for a racing sim and the reflections and effects I thought looked great, great detail on tracks, cars and cockpits. so graphics are great in this game. The sounds are good in this game not as good as race experience.    The cars selection is ok not as many cars as I thought in terms of racing cars but it had a good selection of gt3 cars. the track selection I thought was poor really not as many tracks as it should be for a game that has been about for a while. Really thought this was lacking.    When playing the game as a single player I suppose the ai has to be good for the experience and this is where the game for me goes down. They seem to be lifeless and stuck on rail, when beside them I had a lot of contact and damage. Even when I kept to my racing line. They just donât seem to be aware of you, when I compare this to rfactor2 ai there is such a difference in the experience had when racing.   They call this a simulator I wasnât really getting this when driving I felt safe all the time I could put the car through the limits and never really crash and burn. I think the driving has been simplified and that was disappointing takes the fun away from the experience of driving a high powered gt3 car.  The damage model is terrible, I can crash into a wall at 100mph and yes obtain some damage but still able to race, if I did this in other racing sims I would be out of the race. The visual damage is well a few scratches on the paint work.  Overall I was disappointed in this game with the ai and the driving experience, I think this game has potential but it seems that itâs never going to have these things changed or the extra simulation to make this a worthy racing simulator  
12158	Needs more cars and a more dynamic career mode.
12159	Game doesn't work. After setting up your race it says loading and then just goes back to the same menu.
12160	Don't bother if you don't have a steering wheel.
12161	It was fun until it started crashing every time I started a race.
12162	Meh. Assetto Corsa was near the top of my list while in development. I thought the physics were top notch and the tracks were amazing. Sadly that's where AC's amazing features end.   The game is great if you just like hot laps. Otherwise it's pretty meh. Clunky interface, limited cars, horrible AI, horrible multiplayer and pathetic career.   Get Project Cars for a better PC racing experience.
12163	I think Assetto Corsa has very realistic physics, good simulation, good graphics, but the game its a bit dull, its missing content. Its bad when you have to get mods to make the game enjoyable, and now I have to pay for the dlc to get a few more cars and Nurburgring. This game was a disappointment :(

12170	if you want a racing game, there are far better options out there. if you have a racing wheel and you like to play a racing sim, then this game is 'ok'. the graphics is not that good, there is no 'full' support for your gamepad and menus are very complicated. before buying, you may want to check some gameplay footages first.
12171	Imagine you purchase an elaborate cake from a bakery for your wedding, your kidâs birthday, whatever. The bakery has lots of customers and examples of their cakes you see in the store are impressive. You bring the cake home, take it out of the box and it looks fantastic. Then you cut into the cake and find that itâs literally half baked.  This is what itâs like buying Assetto Corsa.   Pros:   Looks good. Iâm not usually an eye candy guy, but wow this is definitely pretty.  The amount and variety of car content is commendable. Both official and mods.    Cons:   Automatic pit lane speed limiter.  When a race weekend session ends, the screen just fades to black and places you back in the pits at the beginning of the next session.  No apparent way to review your individual lap times after a race weekend session has ended.  No way to do standing starts dumping the clutch with the car in gear (well known).  No assignable control to place the car directly in neutral. Race cars have had this for over 20 years. Amazingly, thereâs half a dozen assignable controls for MGU-K and MGU-H hybrid power, but nothing for the simple task of putting the car in neutral.  Car will not roll downhill when in neutral. It doesnât matter how steep the hill is or what the surface is. It can be off-track grass or the track surface itself. If the car is sitting pointed uphill, it will not roll backwards once you place it in neutral. Spin off uphill and you have to shift down through all the gears into reverse and power yourself backwards. You canât just simply roll back.  Different behavior entering/exiting instant replays. To enter a replay you hit Esc which pauses the action and brings up a small dialog with a menu. When you exit the replay, however, youâre returned directly to live action in the car. If the action is paused going into a replay, it should also be paused coming out of a replay. This could be placated with a simple assignable pause control but alas, like selecting neutral, there appears to be no assignable control for this basic game function.  And the worst flaw...steering!  The way this game handles steering is an immature and absurd mess. I'm not aware of any other racing game for the PC that makes dealing with the most fundamental vehicle control (steering) such an arduous and complex task. Maybe it actually is technically more accurate. I donât know. But this is still a piece of entertainment software not a commercial engineering simulation. New owners of the game should not have to spend 2x-5x as much time researching steering and getting it configured than they do actually driving anything in the game. And thatâs just to get to the point where itâs possible to physically complete a lap on a track.  There is no steering lock adjustment as part of the car setup. None. Youâre stuck with how you have your controller configured. Now couple this with the fact that cars have steering lock ranges from 360 to over 1,000 degrees. Which, by the way, are not visible anywhere from within the game. You have to find the values for each car online or activate a developer tool and measure it yourself while sitting in each car. Either way, youâll probably need to keep a notebook or spreadsheet so that you know what values to configure your controller for  before  you select the car you want to drive. Had your controller configured for a car with a different steering lock value than what youâre driving now? Too bad. Youâll have to exit your session/race to either load a different controller preset or leave the game entirely to access your controllerâs profiler software.  Itâs quite possible youâll enjoy this game if you have a wheel controller with 700 â 900 degrees of rotation and profiler software to control it. If you donât, however, be prepared to put in an extraordinary amount of effort just to make the game drivable.
12172	i was excited to see a racing game boasting about graphics AND physics engine, however the car selection is nothing short of disappointing. im not about to pay another $10 so i can enjoy a game i just spent $30 on.
12173	Can't even force myself to play this game anymore. It just finds a way to â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off everytime. Feels so dull and unpolished overall. Community is obsessed with it and think it's above god for some reason but really this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Buy Project Cars instead it actually gets proper support from the developers and is WAY more fun to play.
12174	its as good as the manual ... what manual ? thats right the designers were to busy counting their cash before they got to this part of the game . and it starts off so well .
12175	What a massive pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game really is.  This game is constantly broken, and when i seem to fix it some how, it then breaks in a diferent way.  After finaly givng up on trying to make the game START on Windows 10 (as well as other games not working and the whole 'Microsoft sees everything incase your a terrorist' thing) i went to 8.1 adn the game worked once, letting me drive the newley added GT86.  Came to it today to hopefully finaly make a video on it, and i cant load any cars or tracks and it said some sort of .ini file was missing, after some digging around and finding â¥â¥â¥â¥ all support and the forum being useless i decided to download a mod car to see if i could find the missing file in that. Guess what i found. The whole 'Data' folder in all of my default car folders is missing.  ARE YOU KIDDING  Even better, in trying to fix it, i have verified the cache in steam, completely reinstalled the game, deleted all the tracks and cars, verified it again and let it redown the tracks and cars through that and the 'Data' folder still is not there.  I would ask for a refund but due to the purchase date and how long steam thinks i have played i can't steam thinks i have played the game for 6.6 hours when in reality, its only about hour, maybe a little more, and the reason it took so long for me to play the game was because i spent so long trying to make the game start on windows 10!  Dont buy this game, should still be early access, and it would be one of the poor ones at that.
12176	The little bit I've played has been amazing... but there is absolutely no reason a game that supports Xbox controller inputs won't let you use the controller in their menus...  You literally have to walk to your computer to manually start races between races or even to scroll through the pause menu. The input's already there... just allow it to navigate menus!  I do not recommend this for controller people for that reason.   Given that they said they'd be working on this in 2013, I gave this a negative review:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/666825525106158137/  ... and then disregarded more complaints in 2015...  https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/492379159717320215/  ... and even more complaints...  http://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/46476145623035468/   https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/598198356169749509/   I'll change my review to recommended if they fix this issue.  If you're a keyboard / mouse and Wheel guy, then this will work great for you.  Game plays amazing.  NOTE: Before you Flame me, I like OPTIONS. Sometimes I mouse / keyboard or Wheel at my computer... other times I use my controller on my couch... depending on the mood I'm in.
12177	Overall the driving is good, everything else is not good enough, no where near enough cars or tracks, the car list genuinely looks empty, the dlc is alredy mentioned in the list also,. Feels alot like this game has succumb to cash issues or just plain Boundry pushing devs when it comes to the margin between a finished game and DLC time, A.K.A operation cash rake (although everyones doing it these days)
12178	Its not good enough by supporting these games before they are fully released, they also want you to pay vast amounts more on DLC packs. I am getting tired of a promise of a game, only to be stung later just because i want to drive a different car around a different track, No i have to pay extra for that priveledge. Why cant we just buy a game anymore without all these extras I thought this game had promise, thats why i invested in the development of it. Now if i want to drive around another track i have to pay another Â£10 ... NO THANKS !!
12179	I support you during early access and then you have the nearve to charge me for DLC right after it goes full release????   Is it too late to ask for my money back?
12180	I really thought this was going to be good, bought it early access, awaited every update with anticipation. Then 1.0 came and went, no nordschlief full course, no integrated skin customization, still feels like my tires start two inches in the ground, extreme audio glitches, and minor physics glitches.   Then Dream Pack DLC comes out... theres all the stuff we teased you with that was 'coming soon'. Turns out they would like $15 more of my money...  All this coupled with cars that have no... i don't know what to call it... feel i guess. I can't feel the road change under my car, i can't feel the g forces in the corners, none of the visual effects in this game give me any sensation that i'm driving a car, in any of the views.     I really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend buying it for all the flaws  After some more updates, they're at 1.6.1 or something like that, this game has become completely unplayable. I cannot load any car on any track, it just crashes to the front ui, and many of the cars that came with the game have no preview thumbnail.   Hopefully it at least uninstalls okay and I won't have to look at this garbage title at the top of my steam library.
12181	Assetto Corsa  I expected a lot about this game, the sheer number of positive reviews is astonishing, the high ratings from magazines, so much positivity, but I was kind of sad when I bought the game + the dream pack DLC and I booted it up to get my own impression.   There is a lot to say about this game and I have a lot of negativity to report. First of all, the launcher. As my desktop runs in the 4K resolution, it starts in 4K as well. There is no way I can lower it for the launcher at all, it just keeps running in 4K. Thats okay, it kind of adapts to the resolution, but a small portion of the screen is used, a lot of wasted space. Also, I cant seem to get it running windowed, it just MUST stay in the desktop resolution. Okay, I can look beyond that, although the launcher runs very sluggish. And when I witnessed the first launcher crash, I thought 'oh dear, I hope its just a one-time only crash.'. Unfortunately I was wrong there, the launcher crashes often.  So I'm gonna do a practice round, with any car, I want to see the enviroments, testing it out, getting a taste of the in-game atmosphere. Monza '66. Sounds good, lets see what its all about. I'm taking the old alfa romeo out for a spin. It loads up, ofcourse not windowed and in 4K. I specifically said that it had to run windowed, but it doesnt. Okay fine, lets see what you got then. I'm happy to report that the game itself runs smoothly in high settings on 4K resolution. Its running between 50 and 60 fps on my rig. Thats very smooth in my opinion, well done, thats a good start. The car handles well, the sound is great and the Xbox 360 controller does its work well.  So far so good! Now for a lower speed lap and look around a bit. Well what can I say .. Everything looks very static. The cardboard crowd, theres no breeze through grass and/or trees. Nothing lives in the game, except for the pit guy .. well he just keep standing there with his sign in his hand. It feels as lively as Race 07, an old SimBin racing/simulation game, but with slightly upgraded graphics (not much!). Also somewhere on the track, the road splits up, which makes me think 'Oh, the next round I try the other road, this can be fun!'. So I do that, at high speed I enter the other road and my car slams into an invisible wall. Yeah .. very realistic. Then dont give me the frikkin' option to enter that  road!  Okay nevermind, lets play the Nordschleife touristenfahrt, my buddy was all excited about it, yeah its laser scanned! Whatever that means. I thought .. oh its scanned, it must be VERY accurate and the graphics must be top notch then. I'm disappointed to say, it doesnt gets me woo'ed and excited. Again, nothing lives in the game, okay that ofcourse does the framerate very well, but the enviroment is all stiff and dead. First thing I try, is taking a blocked off entry gate to the green hell. Theres a wooden barrier blocking my way. No match for my sportscar! So I run into it .. BAM! The car is damaged, bounces off, the barrier stays up. Wow. Amazing physics, yeah in the real world, that would happen too huh ? Surely, they would see you like a prick in the real world, taking the wrong gate thats blocked off, but I'm very sure the barrier would break or fall over.   Again the car and controls handle very well, but thats where the good stuff ends. The rest of the game is mediocre and feels old. Real world physics are non-existent. Theres no change in weather. There isnt a single breeze. Its like the nuclear holocaust has happened and everybody and everything was frozen in time.   Theres a railway track next to the drag race enviroment. I havent seen a single train there. Its dead as anywhere else in the game. I have no idea how this game got past version 1.0. It surely still feels like a beta. Running into the end of the track does 'BOINK' again, no bits fly off the car, everything stays on, there is no damage model, I ran into the wall with 250+ km/h, nothing broke off the car, except for the textures that look dirty and wrickled a bit.  Fine fine, its all fine, lets do an online game with my friend. Lets start a custom game! Just us on the Nordschleife touristenfahrt, good idea, lets do that. Its impossible to start your own session. You must have a dedicated server for it, and you cant start your own online session. Okay, whatever, lets join a server then. Ofcourse we both picked a car thats not on the servers car list. Sorry, doesnt work. You have to use one of the listed cars or you cant enter. Really .. this game .. it doesnt make me happy. In the end, racing together was fun however, you just have fun anyhow when you're on voice and chatting about it. Just those launcher crashes ..   So the conclusion ..   I dont understand any of all the exciting positive reviews. This game feels mediocre. Definately NOT worth the amount of money they ask for it. You still have to have a gaming console for the best simulation game, like an Xbox with Forza, even that lives more in-game. It must be the lack of good, decent, racing simulation games on the PC that makes everyone so super excited about it. I'm disappointed. It doesnt add up to my expectations. Try again and back to the designing board.  Pros: + Runs smooth + Good car handling + Good car sounds  Cons: - Lack of number of cars to choose from - Enviroment is static and dead, no physics there - Multiplayer custom online games are a huge hassle - Launcher crashes on and on - No weather changes or wind  My PC: Intel Core i7 @ 4 Ghz, 12GB DDR3-1600 RAM, 256GB SSD, 2TB Hybrid disk, GeForce GTX970 OC 4GB, Iiyama Ultra-HD monitor @ 4K 60Hz.
12182	Worst AI in any racing game ever I literally have a video of an AI pit maneuvering me because it wouldn't alter its preset line because the AI in this game just has like 3 preset lines for each track that aren't even interchangable they just ram you if you are in their way (which you should be because their preset lines are racing lines) tl;dr if you take the correct line you get thrown into the wall by an AI with a better car than you and if you take the incorrect line you loose because the AI have better cars than you. Apart from that great simulator just â¥â¥â¥â¥ everything else besides the physics and cars, glad I got it on sale â¥â¥â¥â¥ paying full price
12183	I'd stay away from this game if you are here for Oculus Rift support. The game seems awesome when it works, but there are too many missing features and crashes in VR mode to recommend this one.
12184	I bought this game for the realism and multiplayer. The multiplayer is not good because it feels like you just keep driving in an infinite track. There is no sense of achievement in this game.
12185	I love the graphics, physics and force feedback in this game. But I hate that there is no real single player component. No real career mode (yes, there's one in there but it is not good, just a bunch of unrelated races with no real sense of progression). And the AI, though improved over the last few updates, is not good enough to race offline with. There are also issues with multiplayer and this sim, in general, just is not a good 'racing' sim, as it has been advertised. It's a 'driving' sim, not a racing sim and for me, that is a huge disappointment.  While I don't necessarily regret buying this (I bought it through early access, so at a reduced cost) I can not give it a recommendation. At the very least, I would only recommend buying it while on sale ($25-$30).
12186	I think it's disgusting to start milking money out of everyone who bought the game in early access.. No new tracks or cars have come in a while and when they do we should pay? If all the upcoming tracks and cars are dlc-only I think I'll just delete the game.
12187	I'm really disappointed with this game, it looks amazing in the videos, but even with everything turned up to ultra it looks awful, it also feels really clunky to drive and not natural at all.
12188	Release a game that isn't finished so we can release a DLC pack that contains content that should have been released with the game.  Top work Maxis/Ea Games  I do not recommend buying this game until its less than $10.  
12189	Still the best sim BUT Kunos have just decided that many of the features you need to set up a reasonable server with all the cars you want and a track rotation. is not needed.. They also just decided That if you want anything even resembeling a working multiplayer system You pretty much have to write it your self..   This has renderd the game pretty useless, because single player is terrible. and now Multiplayer is basically drive arround 1 track all day in a selection of 4 or so cars...   Do your selfs a favour and buy project cars. No project cars is not a sim like AC is. It really isnt, But aslong as you dont play asetto corsa you wont know the difference so you will be happy with project cars..   ME?? I cant play project cars because the feel of AC was a million times better so i cant go playing it as it just does not feel right or feed the information back to you that you need.  And i cant play Asetto corsa any more because 1.2 just killed it..  
12190	This review has been heavily edited. If you found it useful or unuseful before, your opinion may have changed.   I haven't re-written this review to say that, now that i have a slightly higher amount of game time, i fell in love with this game and i'm ready to recommend it. My overall opinion on Assetto Corsa hasn't changed: i do not recommend this game for a whole series of reasons. I just wanted to change the tone of the review and some of my pros and cons. Let's see.  PROS -The driving model is probably the most convincing out there right now. It is not 100% perfect, but it sure manages to give the player the feel and thrill of driving a fast (or VERY fast, depending on the model) car. Without any TCS, ABS and stuff, the cars react to every imput in a very plausible way, blocking the wheels when you brake too hard, losing traction if you try to go pedal to the metal at the wrong moment, and generally making a mess if you're not capable of handling them. Learning to drive decently in Assetto Corsa can be a tasking challenge, and it's very fun and satisfying, though sometimes frustrating. There are some slight flaws, pointed out in the cons, but globally it's awesome. -The magic triangle dampers-tires-track is depicted extremely well. The vehicle is realistically influenced by every bump (and with Laser Scan, you can only blame the track for being like it is), the grip is extremely realistic and you can select various asphalt setups (i.e. perfect, dirty, old etc.) that influence the behavior of your car. Very nice. -Online is taken very seriously by the community, and has nice races with qualifications and so. -Career mode is vast enough and as varied as the small car amount can allow it to be. -Adjustment to your car's components is extremely precise and well-crafted. -There aren't many circuits, but it's a rather good selection: iconic raceways (Silverstone, Monza, Spa), modern raceways (the Nurburgring GP), some italian tracks (Magione, Vallelunga, Mugello) and a curiosity (the challenging 17 km mountain climb from Trento to Bondone, also good for relaxing). Few but good ones, i'd say. And the Green Hell is coming. -The sound effects are excellent. Full stop. People say this or that racing game has realistic sounds, then play Assetto Corsa and drop their jaws to the ground 10 seconds after the car accelerates. -The game is very open to modding, to a certain degree (read: it has to be GOOD quality modding, otherwise go away. Kinda classy, but assures a high average quality).  CONS -The current lack of value for money. As i've basically said in the pros, the core game is there and works magnifically, but there are few cars (43, a large part of which are variants of the same car, like GT2, GT3 or such racing modifications) that don't quite represent what sport cars are today and/or were yesterday and few tracks. I understand buying licenses and scanning tracks is all but for free, but the game isn't for free as well. Its price is rather high. More cars and the notorious Nurburgring Nordschleife track will come, and DLCs are said to be planned up to 2018. But... -...they will be payed DLCs. No surprise, after all. The willing to cash in on a game through downloadable extra content is common. Kunos is somewhat justified because what they'll offer isn't already finished and ready to ship but is being actively developed, but i'm ready to bet these packs will be excessively expensive. The only hope is a lifetime season pass or the fact that i'm wrong and these packs are cheap. -I am forced to hit this nail a little harder. Stop being such elitist a-holes, please: not everybody can afford a steering wheel and/or is willing to buy it just for you. I have a different kind of problem, for example: it doesn't fit in my current room layout. Assetto Corsa can be as better as it can get with a good wheel, a full pedal set and maybe a gear lever/paddles layout, but you can't just shoot in the legs the users that don't have a steering wheel. Joystick controls are broken: accelerator and brake can't be remapped, thus forcing the player to revolve around the frontal triggers while the right analogic lever is also a good choice (i prefer it, for instance). Steering sensitivity is also way too obviously steer-like even while playing with a joystick (read: way too histerycal to allow the needed precision, because levers are way less accurate than a dedicated peripheral). So please please please, take 15 minutes of your developing time to improve those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls. -The racing UI is highly customizable, and that's good, but it has some flaws. The rankings can't be moved from the bottom of the screen, an uncomfortable location, and all the adjustments can only be done while in the middle of an actual event, a very annoying and inexplicable fact. -Now a quick summary of minor cons, not very serious but still annoying: 1)Having an automatic clutch, which even many steering wheel users have no choice but to accept, makes the car start in a very unrealistic way, unless you start revving the engine in neutral then insert first gear suddenly. Kinda annoying, sometimes. 2)Some technical issues (questionable optimization, anisotropic filtering having an inexplicable as severe performance impact, some out-of-the maps clipping bugs in Trento-Bondone and a generally last-gen quality in background and scenarios, needing some improvement). 3)Incomplete localization. The game is made in italy, but the default english text isn't fully translated (cars descriptions are still in this language). For an italian, that's quite a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥slap.  Summarizing, i like how this game handles (though i'm limited by the controller i can still 'feel it') and i find it fun, but lack of content can be a problem on the long run and the very likely DLC spam feels depressing already. The game has quite a high price now, and though it has been officially released (current version is 1.0.4 when i write this review) it feels unfinished on some sides (dynamic weather will arrive in a future update, and don't come and tell me that's not a feature worth being inserted at launch, in a Driveclub fashion). So do i recommend this game? There isn't a 'meh, it depends' button, so i'll go for the no. But my judgment isn't negative. If you find it at around 20-25 euros, then spend them: you'll have fun, if you like the genre.
12191	Great game, IF it was a beta. Still needs a lot of polishing. Also, Steam Workshop support would be a HUGE improvement.
12192	Game wont even initialize when you go to tracks aparenlty common problem for lower spec yet still direct x 11 compatable graphics cards. But seeing as ive run poorly optimized things like day z and run gta on mid settings running direct x 11 50-60 frames and low temps so id try the game out as my graphic card was only thing on minimum list. As i said game didnt initilize when you went to start race common problem loads of diff things it could be tried em all nothing the games menu and actual game are seperate exe aparently. went to original forums and told rudly they wouldnt help and banned for slandering graphic quality of the game. all in all tried it on my friends pc not even worth it with all the bugs if they dont apeal to community they have now the game will fail good luck.
12193	10/10 WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.  I really wanted to believe in this game but time after time of updates breaking mods it's not worth the money.  Okay let's say you buy it and play with every car in game. Great that's like 10 cars and it gets boring. I bought this game in beta and I know this game isn't even finished but yet you see it here with DLCs not minutes after the 'Official' release.  If they took the time to write the code correctly the first time they wouldn't have to change the sound files with every update.   Oh and let's say you like drifting like me, great no car really has enough power to have fun. Yes you can just throw it into the corner but not keep it without putting 10 degrees of camber.   This game had so much potential but they threw it down the drain. 
12194	Only enjoyable without AI racers. Career mode is not enjoyable at all. I was having trouble winning a race, went online and one of the strategies is to start off slow and gradually speed up your laps so the AI won't be tuned to run so fast. That's a strategy? It actually works too. Pathetic. I guess the multiplayer is good and the tracks and driving models are impressive. I just can't enjoy any sort of story, only driving. It's racing for no reason. I'm not upset that I bought it, but I can't say I would recommend it unless you just want to try some car or track it offers. Maybe some mod or later update will make it better.
12195	This game is essentially Project CARS but worse in every single way  worse graphics less fun expensive dlc boring boring boring. Do NOT Buy this game it is awful I had to refund it it was so bad
12196	Not a abd ddriving game but generally not that exciting either. I would say its 'middle of the road' lol!   Good driving experience whilst on track but no pits, controller settings dont work well with my joystick (no views using my hat), once you set manual gear change the car doesnt enable you to auto gear change.   Good force feedback from the road.  Project cars has more tracks and cars and is a far better experience all round. And I would say rFactor2 is also a better game if you can handle the slightly lower standard of graphics beause that game is very customisable and has ultra realistic driving conditions and tyres etc.  Also the career is a bit lame compared with other driving games you cant do Championships it seems only race weekends.   But the glints on the tarmac are nice which is probably the only thing I could say this game does better than the others. I tehrefore dont recommend it because there are other better games out there.
12197	I tried solution problems reinstall windows 7 &amp; 8 same problems this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At8UyXoYe90   Assetto team support no solved problems and no reply me only left me. projectcars are better than you f*****g right now uninstall your game goodbye
12198	This is the only game which I think is a complete waste of money!   Cannot get it to work. Carreer mode has never been able to work. I have a high end PC which can run witcher 3 on high settings, but this game is full of bugs and makes my PC shutdown every time I start a race.  Looks like it could have been a great game but I've been waiting for a long time for the bugs to be sorted and still terrible....  xbox 360 controller doesn't work in the main menu...again..this game is not finished and should have never been allowed to launch full of bugs.  Will never purchase an early access game again!
12199	Excelent physical simulation and good graphics. However, it lacks content (even with mods, there aren't that many). Sound, while detailed, is a bit of hit and miss (some cars sound really loud while others really muffled). AI is competitive but they just can't handle properly around you. I'm being constantly tail-whipped or rear-slammed as I brake into turns. It's downright frustrating.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend it in current state and definitely not for this price tag. Unless you're a hardcore racing sim player and don't mind paying more for less you're better off with Project Cars.
12200	I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy. 17 hours or so of just trying to get my G27 to work. The clutch serves as a nice decoration and my 900 degree turning radius miraculously reduces itself to roughly 100 when 'playing' this game. Absolute worst force feed back, ever! Just a little bit of resistance. Wow.
12201	After prelaunch testing and many many attempts to like the game even past 1.0 I've failed. I don't like the physics, there's much to be desired from the car and track selection, the career felt uninteresting, the suggestion line appears to be static and brakes feel really inconsistant so it's really hard to go a whole race without accidentally understeering straight off the track. And of course it doesn't work with my racing wheel, and configuring a controller may give a lot of options it seems to give too much chance to ruin everything over actual functionality (like letting me configure my race wheel).  I know I'm not the best at racing sims but I've spent a lot of time with GT2 as a kid, and Forza 1-4, ontop of many unsatisfying hours of EA's various racing sims. So I'm no noob but I'm nothing special either. I could see this game really being enjoyable for some, the level of customizability on many levels is appealing but for someone like me who wants to play something close to Forza 4 on a PC (seriously Microsoft?) this game just can't fill the void.
12202	Great game I mod my own cars and have every car you could ever dream of. Thats the problem tho. Kunos really hasnt done much of â¥â¥â¥â¥ for this game. don't blame them though it's the way of the gaming industry these days. The only way to stop them is to stop buYing, For instance gta 5 what a laugh you have to peorder like a month in advance to get some pay to win cash and the games a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. I wish i could go back in time and never buy axc but i cant. so that being said i wont be buying many more games. this has become a snowball effect of early acess rip offs and dlc â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boxes,
12203	Not bad...not blow your mind amazing but it has its moments. I have a slighty bad experience, I use a controller (cant afford a wheel) and it is hell for the first hour trying to hone your skill but after that I was pretty impressed. I've played forza, gran turismo, dirt...etc you get the point so maybe i put it on a higher pedistal then I should have. After all it is sold and advertised as a raceing sim. I bring this up because there isnt much in the way of objectives or a story of any kind. I mean I wasnt expecting much but you litteraly start out driving a fiat...and thats it, no tutorial of the menu or start out objective...you basicly just manuver around the menu and start your career.    Other then the lack of a game feel, wonky controler feedback, and honestly a little more mediocre graphics then I'd like its not bad. Now beggs the question is it worth the 55 bucks (cuz trust me your gunna want the dlc). No....not really, like i said its not a bad game really its just not really worth the money...it has a pretty empty feeling. 30 bucks I would feel comfortable but right now I feel like I over paid honestly.
12204	essentially no customization or tuning, no weather. career is mostly tedious, boring and very repititive. multiplayer is a mess of servers forcing you to drive whatever cars the server wants you to drive. and now Kunos has decided to make me pay more to get content for a game that, in my opinion, isnt even half done.  and where is the GT86, nevermind.
12205	God awful UI.   God. Awful.   This game lacks the polish of a great title. I would steer clear and purchase Project Cars.
12206	God awful UI.   God. Awful.   This game lacks the polish of a great title. I would steer clear and purchase Project Cars.
12207	Currently I have to not reccomend it. I loved this game when it first came out but currently it fails to load the game, I press start engine and it begins to load in the cars and the track but then right when it looks as if its about to load into the race windows pops up and says that a problem has caused Assetto Corsa to stop working properly and that if they find a solution they will notify me etc etc.... However this is one of the most prestigious in its category and who knows my problem might only be in the unlucky %5
12208	Was so disapointed with this game, Multiplayer is dead only two Aussie servers up and career mode is iffy and boring as anything, AI non stop rams you and doesn't look anything like the screen shots (R9 290 Reppin with 12GB of ram) Car customization is weird too, some car settings you change have little to no effect like camber adjustments ect, which in the real world make a whole load of difference, I'd love to recommend another game but iracing requies you to get a bank loan.  
12209	Very difficult to control the vehicles (I'm used to Forza, with nearly max difficulty). I did not enjoy this game, and stopped playing after 5hrs. I'd only recommend this game if you wanted it to be EXTREMELY realistic, i.e. more realistic/less driveable than you might expect.
12210	Currently I have to not reccomend it. I loved this game when it first came out but currently it fails to load the game, I press start engine and it begins to load in the cars and the track but then right when it looks as if its about to load into the race windows pops up and says that a problem has caused Assetto Corsa to stop working properly and that if they find a solution they will notify me etc etc.... However this is one of the most prestigious in its category and who knows my problem might only be in the unlucky %5
12211	Be aware the AI in the game has some issues. AI cars have a set driving line and crash into you with catistraphic results to you but with no harm done to them. They will do pit menuvers and run you off the track just to stay within thier line. There are many other great things about this game but the AI nees some work.  There are limeted cars and tracks as well, however this may be resolved in future patchs. I would recommend this game if the AI worked well and there were more cars and tracks. Until those issues are resolved, buyer beware.
12212	I was expecting a lot from this, as reviews where so good, wel I found very very average. It's is not awfull but far from great, even the feell of driving is just ok. If I compare this what simbin has done in years or the wonderfull Rfactor, then they are miles away. Even the menus are just not slick enough, It had an unfinished feel. So got a refund. maybe i get this back in a year or so and at 5-10 bucks when the game will actually be finished.  Update January 2016.  Maybe you should call this game Early access alpha mode. There is still so many things that doesn't work, try a 920 wheel, it shakes, it is oversensible and more, in career mode i can't even click on the races anymore, in challenge mode you get errors midding cars or saying unavailable even if you have the cars and tracks. and seriously this game comes with 6 base tracks! hahahaha.  yes fanboys keep voting this down, The thruth must hurt so much!
12213	I was so excited about this game until I progressed to N-1 in career. Never before have I needed to play a racing game with stability control enabled. The KTM ( or whatever) still cant make it around the track without oversteering. If you really want a laugh, look at some of the default vehicle setups. I have set up cup cars, road course cars, and I am also ASE certified. I have played every single big name racing sim, and I think by now I should be able to get a baseline setup on a vehicle on an Xbox controller. Not so with this game. Maybe I will come back after I get a real steering wheel, and edit this review. I can't suggest this game as a racing wheel only game, seeing as I have no experience in that area.  6/10  Gives me the Rage  uninstalled
12214	The game, technically, is pretty good. But if you want to play a sim racer online avoid this title...unless of course you enjoy being punted off the road, at turn one, at every race, by people who qualified poorly and dont know what a brake pedal is for. Seriously, once or twice, you don't mind...it's online racing after all. But with Assetto Corsa it's all the time. Seriously ALL THE TIME. It's rubbish, honestly.
12215	I really wanted to like this game.... The physics seem decent, but don't cooperate with a controller (waiting to afford a good wheel) but I spend more time facing the wrong direction than I do on the track. This should be looked at and at least taken in consideration for those of us who don't have wheels. My main gripes have to do with the menu and poor graphic performance. In Project Cars, I can run Ultra graphics with rain and 24 other cars without a problem with my Nvidia 860m, but this game lags even with medium settings with just my car doing practice laps (which make it look like a racing sim from 2010) . The loading screens take forever, and it is overall just completely inferior to Project Cars. I bought both games hoping this one would be better with its modding community, but it is just thoroughly disappointing.
12216	+ Good simulator + OK graphics + Good looking menu (albeit a bit slow)  - Bad AI - Bad controller support - Bad multiplayer  Gonna try the new refund function
12217	If it wasn't for the AI in this game it would be awesome the sounds the cars are awesome but when your driving in a stright line and the other cars constitly hit you for no reason it makes it unplayable if you mess up slightly and slow down a bit they act like your not there and ram into you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
12218	Sounds are awful and physics are just screwed up. IMHO there are better options
12219	The engine in this game is very good. Traction and realism feel very realistic. However, I feel it lacks some sort of progression to it. I would like to upgrade my vehicles rather than just tune them. Not into it quite yet, but it's not a bad game.
12220	Good: Very realistic physics, beautiful world and cars  Bad: Doesn't deserve the price for the amount of content the game has, despite having mods. And very boring to play in single player.  Verdict: 7/10, buy at sale.
12221	Took oculus' money and left us vive owners in the dust.   Revive works, but its far from perfect.   Paid dlc for devs and still no Vive support.

12223	This game is not really enjoyable without a steering wheel and pedals, if you plan to play this with mouse/keyboard or gamepad, you'll have a bad time.  I think the game have good graphics, can't really say about the driving dynamics since I tried to play this with a gamepad and the steering was horrible (if I touch the analog stick the steering wheel does 3 turns instantly) so couldn't even complete a race. You can't remap controls if you select 360 gamepad config and with a custom config the steering is completly wrong.  Saw a lot of bad things, the sounds are terrible, there's very few cars and tracks (not even complete nurburgring, only the GP version.  Wouldn't recommend it unless you have a complete sim setup with steering wheel and don't mind driving only a few cars.  Also blur effect is everywhere, everything is blurry.
12224	I cant believe that the only reason that i bought this game (Nurburgring) is now being sold seperately as DLC, very poor show, wish I could get a refund :(
12225	This game could be great, if they would just fix the UI menu's. You can't navigate the menu system without a keyboard and mouse! I play this game from a sim rig in the living room and sometimes use a VR headset, what a major pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to break out a keyboard and mouse just to play this one game! Come on it's almost 2017, why is this game using such a dated UI that requires a KB and mouse? Sticking to Project Cars, and all of the other racing games untill they fix this one.
12226	The wheel support is annoying and the game lags often :I
12227	This is actually my first review for a game on steam. And I have to say my purchase was a big mistake. I had really enjoyed Project Cars and had generally enjoyed racing games for my whole life but having bought a G27 I thought I would get what most people called the 'best racing sim' around the old internet.  Put simply it is beautifully accurate, but really lacking polish in its presentation everywhere, to the point where I can't enjoy it. I am running it on a 4K monitor, and all the menus are in this tiny box in the middle of the screen. I had to scour forums just to find out how to use my G27 to it's full (900 degree) extent. There are games that openly call themselves early access and I know what I am getting into when I buy one of them. But Assetto Corsa feels like early access and didn't warn me as a consumer. It's graphically ok, the sound is excellent, but the menus are so ugly and unintuitive, and in some cases broken, it ruins the experience.  I absolutely love Dirt Rally, love Project Cars, love the Forza series, but honestly this just lacks any of the charm they have. I know it's a small studio, but it just isn't a game ready for release.
12228	Bought this to support the developer since they were planning on implementig VR support for it. Just found out that they decided to drop it. ugh.
12229	Game has a myriad of issues and does not work half of the time.
12230	Gameplay: Awesome with a steering Everything Else: Straight garbage.  Like everyone said, it's a hot lap simulator. i regret buying it early access, not that any early acces on steam was ever good...
12231	Bought this game today on discount. I simply don't like it in many ways it's done. Most tracks linked to DLCs, which have to pay. no way.I will stay at rf2.
12232	Touts itself as the 'The most realistic PC racing simulation' where it is in fact not even in the top three,  Besides the multitude of missing racing features standard in other titles, the features that are there all feel sub-par.  Specifically speaking after the 1.2 update these are the things that prevented me from enjoying the experience. -No feeling of tyres. Suspension, Steering and bodyroll but nothing at all for the tyres. -Slow inputs. Countering oversteer was too fast for the sim on most occasions. Very unsettling to have to slow down in this regard. Also had the consequence of feeling disconnected from the visual experience. FPS@160 RR@144 -Graphic fideilty actually shocked me. It's the first time I've played the sim since upgrading to a 1440p monitor. At 1080p, it could be argued that it is one of the better looking sims. Howver at 1440p, it is damned ugly. Textures seem very low res and the lack of fidelity caused a headaches.  After waiting since early beta for a decent experience with this sim, I'd have to say, it ain't gonna happen. I'd personally go back to FPS/RPGs if this was the best simracing could offer. Very Dissapointing i5/780gtx/GT2/CSR/R3V 26 year simmer.
12233	I echo many of the other negative comments on this. They released an unfinished Alpha as a full game and this game lacks many of the basic features you'd expect in a racing game. This is not worth the full price as it stands.  This game has all the gear but no idea.
12234	Its a pretty good game, but being told now that i will have to buy DLC for nurburgring, after supporting the game early, thinking it was going to be included with my early purchase, is a massive kick in the balls. It doesnt really work well with controllers either which is annoying as sometimes i cant be bothered to set my wheel up. Really dissapointed.
12235	A lot of things that the game has just igrored by 90% online players that fapping only couple tracks and couple cars, so if u don't like gt u'll get bored to play alone
12236	very dissapointed. asseto corsa call it a game its not even a sim. DLC'S all the time no updates to the core. if i can give my copy away let me know how and someone can have the piece of crap. stopped me from buying other titles to support at early stages. my hard earned $$ could have been spent on better than this crap would recomend not to buy it if looking for a SIM.
12237	The devs made us beleive it will be Vive optimized 5 months ago.  (the truth is on a flat screen, it's sooo boring, with 0 speed sensation, so we all expected a Vive support) BS, they justdon't do anything except lies, bans and delete posts on forums.  Bad company, bad support, and false accounts on forums for their own â¥â¥â¥-licking. Just hate these guys and their overhyped old game.
12238	Very big dissapointment for a super hyped game. Bad optimization, bad AI, sub standard multiplayer. The cars are nice and the physics may be great but that's not all it takes to make a good sim. How can I enjoy great physics if the game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥? cpu occupancy 95% message when my cpu is almost on idle? random fps drops in the middle of the race? no thank you!
12239	Be wary of this dev. They sold this game in early access and promised more features and proceeded to make the vast majority of them paid DLC. Shifty as all get out.
12240	Good:  - Nice looking tracks and cars - Most tracks are laser scanned - Great selection of cars - Driving feels good - Nice force feedback - Great options menu - Frequent updates and DLC  Bad:  - No weather - Game engine only supports one light source so there is no night - Tracks are very static - No dynamic grip build up on the racing line - Career mode is basically some random events slapped together - AI is mediocre - This game is a oculus rift timed exclusive - Slow development because it is a small dev team  Overall not super bad but not the holy grail like some people make it out to be. There are better options out there (iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom, Automobilista).
12241	I am very disappointed about the game, the developers. I bought the game when it was in early access. Now, 1 1/2 Years later, it just feels unfinished. Sure, they keep adding content, the physics are great, but its far from beeing a complete game!   No options to edit the grid No Flag Rules A way too less cars and tracks in the main game, so that you have to buy DLCs  And did i mentioned that there is at the moment no slipstream beeing simulated in this game?!  It started so good and development was very quick in the early stages. But for that money and that less content after the game was released, its just a big disappointment.
12242	I have only 22 minutes on record, and I even asked Steam to refund the money i gave for the game... It wasn't like I expected to be. Very hard unrealistic control (played with Logitech G27). I have only 22 minutes on game, that's why I can't say no more about the game. On the all videos the game looks insane with nice graphics nice engine, everything, but before buy i recommend to download &amp; play the game 'pirate' and see if you like it and even then buy it. 
12243	Game is less than what i expected, which is not much considering half the time it does not work. Almost as bad as DayZ in my opinion. Looks half thrown together and quite frankly I reret this purchase entirely. Forza Motorsport was a much better driving simulator.
12244	The physics are great. The graphics are good, but not compared to Project Cars. Another nice thing about AC is that its efficient enough to run on my 11' laptop. The reason I don't recommend it is because the car and track selection is too small to keep me happy. I really hate exotic/hyper cars and thats just about all you'll find here. Put in some classics and some 'every day' cars and it would be much more exciting to play.
12245	This isn't saying I hate the game. That's far from the truth. It's a fun game/simulator that has a lot going for it. Laser scanned tracks, fun cars, realistic looking graphics. It just falls short of a true simulator.  Pros:  Fun cars.  Fun laser scanned tracks (THE RING!) Easy to drive, hard to master Great Graphics Modding! No Monthly Fee!  Cons:  Physics are not terrible, but not right. No simulated aero, fudged tire data, etc. Even on lower track levels, this feels apparent.  AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥. There is no other way to describe this. I mean, it's gotten better. Certainly better than the Kamikaze cars in Project CARS, but compared to rFactor 2, this AI is by no means good. Modding! = Fractured Community without auto-download tools like PlayWithSix or built in tools. Horrible Netcode  I'd describe this game as a hotlap simulator. It's great for driving. It's great for doing time trials. But when it comes to dealing with actual 'racing', it falls incredibly short.   If you want a decent offline racer, go for rFactor 2 as a great simulator or Project Cars if you want a more arcade styled simulator.   If you want to race Online, rFactor 2 still has some great leagues. Also, iRacing has some of the best pick-up racing you can get (excluding the low Strength of Field rookie races. Ugh), and recently released the amazing Aston Martin DBR9, which is awesome.   Also: Stock Car Extreme is pretty fun too! :D
12246	If youre looking game like Forza or Gran Turismo, this ain't it.  -Only few cars -Only few tracks -No night time -No rain
12247	Multiplayer is still not working very well, no servers with low pings at all for west coast usa, rubber banding and disconnects prevent enjoying multiplayer racing. Posted on forums negative comments and was banned, now i cant look through the posts to fix game issues or even make another account for support since it is tied to the game key ,,,,  support sucks, mulitplayer is a joke. force feedback racing is great otherwise. going to give thumbs down becuase they do not allow reading of froums for support issues if you get banned or do not buy a copy of the game.
12248	So the game Is finally out, feels unfinshed with a small selection of cars and now they dump DLC on us for $15 ??!? Not to mention the DLC tracks, why are the DLC tracks the only tracks with the longer distances with them??!?? â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
12249	There are already hundreds of reviews detailing all the things wrong with this game, so simply put don't buy it.
12250	I feel ripped off ...
12251	cheap game, way behind the competitors, no good wheel setup, dash setup and so on, no sim, just arcade game
12252	do not buy unless you have a full racing sim set up!
12253	it so bad, first it has like 5 cars and it is very expensive to have more i really hate this game is a waste of money
12254	If you can get the thing to run, it's fantastic! A wonderous racing simulator with emphasis on the Simulator aspect.  But that's a very big IF.  Latest update has made the game completely unable to even boot for me these days, even on a clean install, a clean install alongside a clean install of windows, verifying cache does nothing as it reads everything as a-okay.   tl;dr if it works, it's great, but never ever trust italian software or electronics to be reliable.
12255	In Assetto Corsa there are many different cars to drive. But some of them are only driveable when you have bought a DLC. The negative part of this game is that there are not many maps to play. About the graphics is nothing to say because they are really well made. The online mode wasn't really funny to play. The main menu is really confusing to find the right option you want to choose. I wouldn't recommend to buy this game because for me it was no fun to drive in the maps.
12256	Not fun at all, unless you have a racing wheel.
12257	I liked this while it was in early access, but now it's being marketed as a finished product.  This game is horribly incomplete. Career mode is a poorly-made gimmick, multiplayer doesn't work half the time, there are numerous bugs, and AWD isn't even complete yet. I find myself just driving around in singleplayer.  What pisses me off more is that they have the audacity to release DLC for an unfinished game. When did they become Ubisoft?  It's Gran Turismo 6 all over again.
12258	there's not enough content, simple as that.  why pay 35 pounds for a game when you can buy a much better racer for 15?  I'll admit most of the simulation is pretty incredible but without much content to usse it with this game becomes tedious and un-intreaging so I have to advise you not to buy this game.
12259	I thought I would give this a try because of the Summer Sale deal, but I have my regrets. On some of the tracks the sun is so bright. It's like a super nova. The colors are washed out it's ridiculously bright. It needs fixed. On the driving model. Yes it's good and the cars for the most part tend to drive differently which is nice, but it's very shallow, there's not much to do other than time attacks and over taking the car in front of you. The AI is simply put, stupid. The other cars drive on rails most of the time and will run you right off the road. Sure you can tweak a ton of things, but you can't setup a realistic race weekend with practice, qualifying, fuel managment, tire management, and pit stops let alone a realistic racing season? Racing games had all of this stuff and more twenty years ago. I don't see much more to do in Assetto Corsa than what's in GRID which is a sorry state. Skip this and try iRacing or RaceRoom. They're more expensive but better games.

12261	Graphics are decent, but thats where it stops. Too much dlc and not enough off the start. I bought it really for nurimburing but thats dlc... Controller compatibility is poor and hard to use. My mouse randomly jumps up and right constantly in the menu screen which is really annoying when setting up controllers. Adjusting controllers constantly to get proper setup. I spent over an hour just trying to get my controller to work right
12262	Game doesn't work correctly and by that, i mean it only worked once! Everytime I click on DRIVE the loading screen comes up for a few seconds and after that it goes right back to the menu! Without ANY explanation. And that's it. I can click on it as much as I like. It's always the same result.
12263	I was hoping for the game to be this amazing racing simulator. I read the reviews and it seemed hopeful. so I bought it and the dissapointment sunk in. Firstly....what the hell is the point of this game? there are no unlockables, upgrades, rank, or money. second...the campaign is totally unfair as the AI seem to be way to good. Not to mention its repetitive and you race everyone in practically the same cars. thirdly....This game gets boring quick, because there are no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing goals, and no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unlockables , there are no reasons to play this game!!!!  This game has pros however; first...the sounds are easily 10/10 second...the physics feel real and feel good third...the cars feel almost real do to the looks and the cosmetics of it all  If I rated this game I would give it a 4/10 
12264	Bout this game a while ago.. It has a great feel to it and the cars and tracks are great, it just seems to lack the content of other racing games.   My main issue is that everytime I step away from the game for even a few days to a couple months and come back, I have to go through hoops trying to get the damn thing to run again. Most of the time I just get an error on start and it just won't launch.   My other issue is reading their guide provided no help. Go to their forums to get help.. Nope.. you need to register just to view the damn threads.. Seriously? Just let me read the troubleshooting threads at least.  Pretty tired of doing all this run around just to put in a few laps.. Its not a fair comparison but I'm just gonna wait for Forza on PC
12265	Bottom Line: In my opinion, Project Cars has this game beat in every aspect. Glad I got my refund!  Reasons include:  Extremely limited content, very few tracks, even fewer cars, no music, lackluster graphics.   Additional evidence of a poorly made game: garbage UI, no weather effects, no track map overlay, no useful telemetry... basically all the items Project Cars has is missing in AC. And where the F is Laguna Seca? What racing game leaves out such a major international track?   The only advantage I see to AC is the sandbox modding you can do. Why pay for an unfinished product that you have to mod to even function the way you want it to? Think RPGMaker for a racing game sounds cool? I did too until I saw the lack of polish even for top-tier mods- for example the 'community made' Laguna Seca track was horribly glitchy on top of being incorrect for the iconic corkscrew turn. Where are the fan made R34 GT-R's and C7 Z06's? Not worth waiting around for someone's pet project to turn up while you pay for this barebones game that the devs left to the community to support.
12266	I only bought this for the apparent NATIVE oculus support ok here is a list of appalling faults  Firstly Its not native otherwise it wouldn't need to have the *.ini files to be mucked about with or the screen priority's to be changed.  secondly it will NOT exit whilst being played and can only be pushed back to the launcher using crtl+alt+del. hitting the esc key does nothing but remove the sound but the game keeps running !!!  after doing the above the game will crash back to the launcher every time you try to race even after restarting steam and the game, only restarting windows then allows the game to run ; i also completed a race to see if it then sends me back to the launcher..... nope it just sat there staring at the car in the pits so... force quit and the cycle restarts.  the controls won't reassign, i hit a button when prompted and it just ignores the input even though it can SEE the input on the indicators in the setup screen   the track is nearly invisible due apparently to the exposure levels and has to be adjusted each time the game is loaded (and the game won't pause) so you cant get off the line and adjust the exp' at the same time and adjusting the exp' of course then makes the cockpit incredibly dark and is unusable    
12267	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ game worst piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ simulator ever seen don't buy.
12268	Filled with menu bugs, bad UI and now you get alt-tabed out to Steam Store DLC page every third click or so in game menu. Game turned into worthless crap thanks to this...
12269	Overall, I'm disappointed in this game. It's got great physics, well-optimized graphics, and awesome sound. However, the gameplay falls short and that's what we're after, right? Not as many tracks or cars to choose from as there could be, sure there's a modding community, but I still feel like it lacks native content. The menu is buggy, and the enviroment isn't all that fantastic. They could get away with small graphical details not being the best on console. I'm looking for a game that has gameplay features on par with something like Forza, but utilizies the resources availiable to us with PC, such as 1080p 60FPS with fantastic detail textures and models, and then going beyond the typical console racing game with the gameplay, because you can. Real PC gamers typically don't want simple quick gameplay like you see in console games, they enjoy more in-depth micromanagable type things, because the PC can handle that. It's a good game that's decently put together, I'd just like to see more out of Assetto Corsa. Especially with the price tag.
12270	PROS: - Awesome looking graphics - Nice sound - A lot to do  CONS: - No gameplay experience for low end or mid end users  (A GTX 650 Ti, AMD FX 4130 and 8 GB DDR3-1866 RAM is way too less to play this game. Only had 15 FPS on 1080p, 20 FPS on 720p and even on 480p only 27 FPS. Even with overclocking to the masximum I only had 20 FPS on 1080p, 24 FPS on 720p and 30 FPS on 480p no anti aliasing used, else the FPS will drop to 5 FPS.) - No NVIDIA 3D Vision support  (screen stays black) - Controller works only partial  (menus still needs mouse and keyboard) - The controls feel strange  (played Forza, Gran Turismo and GTR. But those feeled way more realistic) - The racing line is static or doesn't work with my hardware. - The AI is definitivly made for pros, never had a better placement then 5th. (finished GT 1-6 a 100%, Forza 1-4 &amp; horizon series a 100% but this is way harder.)  RESULT: If you have a high end PC with i7 4xxx / i7 5xxx / FX 8xxx series, an R9 xxx / GTX 9xx series give it a try. But if you have a lower end pc, don't even try. You will not get any decent FPS here. I can play Metro Last Light 1080p on max settings, including the 4xMSAA with 24 FPS on lowest, but here my PC can't even run the game on lowest!!! settings. The gameplay and a bit strange driving physics are learnable. The goals from the carrier can also be solved at 80% AI at least. But the performance is so bad on low end PC's, that it makes absolute no fun. And to play this game in overclocked mode isn't really possible, because it crashes every 15 minutes, Metro Last Light does not, with same configuration. It could be a really awesome game, but only for high end gamers, mid and low end can't enjoy it. Too high system requirements. I will probably give the game another try, when I get my new INNO3D GTX 970 Hybrid card and i7 4820k with DDR4-3200 RAM, but before it will be unplayable for me. :'( (\s/)
12271	Its Hard even with the settings on what should be the 'EASY' settings its not easy I have played racing games for years and never in a game before have I not been able to take 1st place. Also while you can play the game with a controller it doesn't help much at all the game is still ludicrously difficult.  The menu before the main menu won't allow me to go into career mode from there it won't load it.   I will say however that the game is absolutely gorgeous and seems fairly well optimized so long as you have a DEDICATED graphics card. I broke the new RUF car that was added into the 1.1 update somehow snapping off my rear passenger wheel? I didn't have the mechanical settings in effect but I have a screenshot to prove it.(not sure how to report bugs)   Pros: Stunning visuals  Extreme challenge for those looking for it Very detailed Tuning aspects for those who what they are messing with  Cons: Its Insanely HARD for the more casual racer  To really get the best experience you NEED a racing wheel
12272	For all the control options, they won't let me just shift with the triggers and gas and brake with A and X on my gamepad. WTH? Why do control freaks always end up in charge of game menus? This unfortunately makes the game unplayable for me.
12273	needs car customizations and all cars mode in online race so any car is available at least,wheres all the awesome cars??
12274	If you're heavily into simulation games, sure, give it a go, but only if it's on sale for like 5â¬. As it is right now, there's too many things lacking to call it a proper game.  Pros: + nice engine sounds + nice sense of speed + quite stable  Cons: - woefully bad AI - lack of tracks - lack of cars (six different Lotus', BMWs, etc doesn't count) - no weather effects - no night driving - mediocre graphics - career mode is, well, bad to put it nicely
12275	I really feel like this game is not complete. also the controls are not the best and there are not that many cars. it is very pretty thought.
12276	Looks terrible. Incredibly simple ai. Very disappointing.
12277	I bought this game and was really excited. Unfortunately it came up short, as the career mode is lacking and the whole game is lackluster. Get Project Cars
12278	I hate it how steam said that it was compatible with my graphics card and then all of a sudden it says its not compatible in game get your game specs right steam
12279	Its pretty bad unless you have some kind of controller/wheel. Even then... $50???
12280	Physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. I honestly don't know why people are giving it good reviews... Cars handle NOTHING like they do in this game. I kinf of feel like i wasted money on this game. I'd like it if the physics were correct. It really takes away from the experience.
12281	Absolutely disappointing game. Unrealistic driving, crashing with 200mph only scratches and broken windows and so on. Pitting also very bad.
12282	I don't like it. I have triple monitors and I can't change the viewing angle, so some cars im viewing from the hood and feel like im driving a semi. Some of the cars feel great and others are like driving a marshmallow. The cars feel like they are floating to me. If you want a real racing experiance Iracing is the only way to go.  There are not very many cars to choose from, half are lotus. The graphic quality is not what I thought it would be either. I have two GTX960 sli and 16gb of ram running this thing full out. The trees and track look good but the car interior is nothing better than iracing.
12283	i wouldnt know, it has major issues with my logitech G27 wheel so i havent sspent any real game time with it...
12284	Game doesnt work, I cant even start a race as the loading screen for the race shows up and nothin happens, then it returns to the menu again and again.
12285	I bought this as a replacement for forza 4 when my xbox broke. I was hopnig for a game i could do some drifting and this SEEMED like a good game. I was wrong. The car selection is a shard of what forza has. The track selection is about the same as forza. As for the actual gameplay i was VERY disapointed. Trying to get all the settings to work correctly with a usb/xbox controller was awful. Not to mention you cant operate ANY menus with the controller, which is really stupid. You cant adjust the settings in-game either so i spent an hour going in and out of a practice race to try and get all the settings right. As for the drifting, it just doesnt work correctly. Evertime i tried the car either understeered into a wall or it would just do a 360. This was with multiple attemps using different settings and different assists. As a racing game its alright but for drifting dont bother, it garbage.
12286	Sounds lag and not much to do anymore since multiplayer is dead
12287	Good game with great physics but lacking a polished career mode and does not have a great car list and subpar graphics.
12288	Very uncomplete game, is selling DLC already! clearly they had the files ready was waiting for victim to buy the game expecting more content only to be shafted! Avoid like the plague and focus on project cars.
12289	I bought this game in November 2015. It has NEVER worked. I have a number of other racing sim games which all work fine. Unfortunately I waited til after Christmas to sit down and take a hard look at the problem. I still cannot get it to work. I asked for a refund. Valve/Steam refused. I again asked for a refund, pointing out that Australian consumer law requires them to give me a refund if the product is not fit for purpose - without limit to how long before I ask for it. They again said no.   I am not averse to trying any reasonable technical steps to fix the problem. As a career computer professional believe me I DO know what is reasonable. I could not get it to work. What I then found was a long list of UN reasonable steps to take. Taking those steps could make other programs on my computer malfunction and it's just not worth it.  If you buy and it does not work ask for a refund STRAIGHT AWAY. It's not worth the grief.
12290	Good game with great physics but lacking a polished career mode and does not have a great car list and subpar graphics.
12291	Sounds lag and not much to do anymore since multiplayer is dead
12292	Very uncomplete game, is selling DLC already! clearly they had the files ready was waiting for victim to buy the game expecting more content only to be shafted! Avoid like the plague and focus on project cars.
12293	More DLC than base game content, oculus VR only.
12294	This is a review for testing it out in Oculus Rift. I guess maybe because it's a sim, but it's nothing like dirt rally or forza. I was hoping to get an other great racing game for VR. But it was just awful. Having to go in and setup the controls to try get it work properly. ugh. and having to use the mouse while in vr and not the controler is a buzz kill. Note you can only use the headset when you start the race, other than that, you are constantly taking the headset on and off. Hope this helps others with VR looking for an other racing game.
12295	I've tried playing this game a few times and never really had fun. I picked it up at launch to play with the Oculus Rift. The support was very glitchy but I wasn't expecting much and it was kind of neat for a few minutes after the couple hours it took to set up.   Aside from that, the menus in this game are TERRIBLY laid out. There is an overwhelming amount of options but it's all sort of thrown in your face without any sense of presentation and it feels very alpha. It took me too long to figure out where to begin, what the first challenge was, whether or not I finished the first challenge, and that I was supposed to open the menu on my own and manually quit the course when I felt like I was done. I tried setting up my G27 wheel using the included settings but I could never get it to recognize correctly and gave up after 30 minutes of fooling with the menu. A few times the game has crashed from menu and I've had to reboot my computer to get it to start again.   As for the driving, I can't say much as I've quit after the first couple challenges. I know this game is a racing sim and I have played a couple other racing sims before so I know what to expect, but I don't find the racing enjoyable enough to play further. I wish I had waited until this was on sale.
12296	Disappointed with the poor support for the popular Xbox 360 Controller which I have used and tried different settings with, which games like Next Car Game already have good settings without changing anything.
12297	Like others have said its good, kinda a hotlap simulator becuase the online racing is terrible. I perfer iracing all day but if youre not into real competitive racing and just want to turn some laps its fun.
12298	First off, this game does not work at ALL with gamepads that aren't specifically an Xbox controller.  Not only can you not rebind any of the buttons, you can't bind them period. All the buttons remain completely functionless with no way to change them.  And the game automatically makes the wheel spin at insane ranges of degrees, even though there's an option that's supposed to set how many degrees your analog stick should map to the wheel, it doesn't work. No matter what you set it to, it always acts as though you have it at the highest setting.  Also, the game does not allow you to change any options while actually in the game.  Don't buy this if you're hoping to play it with any gamepad other than a 360 controller.
12299	 Early Access Review
12300	Too bad Kunos aren't interested in OpenVR support. Hopefully they will rethink that.
12301	I am so disgusted with this game. Don't bother trying to just go in and race for fun with a friend unless you want to spend hours browsing multiple websites for various 'workarounds' and 'fixes'. I have spent the last hour trying to set up a simple server and it's still not working. Having a game in early access and then moving to an official release without even offering a simple way of creating a multiplayer match is ridiculous.
12302	With every update your wheel config gets deleted
12303	Game doesnt work with win 10, and they ban you if you mention it. Oh and now they are telling me to remove my anti-virus program that has worked perfecty for 10 years, but their game needs it removed... sound pretty shady to me. Avoid at all costs, you have been warned!
12304	 Early Access Review
12305	Not that much fun in 2D. Also, if you intend to buy this for use with your VR headset don't hold your breath. They tweeted in March 2016 that they had no plans to implement it. Too bad, it might have been fun with the extra immersion.
12306	I bought this while on sale and all I can say is that I deeply regret it. Support for the Logitech G27 isn't up to scratch. Gameplay, graphics, physics etc are all sub-par. I've put over 100 hours into Project CARS and it is 100x the game that this will ever be!
12307	i am not sure what developers are going to do next, i was going to hold off buying till this game gets in final polished state, but it dsnt look like it, Graphics are frankly horid, was expecting good graphics...store pics and videos looks crisp but in game graphics are far from it! only bonet cam is good for playing, and the cockpit one, but honestly speaking cockpit looks not impressive, Project Cars have way cooler graphics compared to this,  handling is really good though, like it allot! but graphics are let down!
12308	The single player career feels like an afterthought with thrown together races and time trials. They bring little excitement or feeling of progression, leaving you left wondering why they even bothered. Then there is the AI that leaves allot to be desired. There is no penalties or rules for any poor sportsmanship like ramming other players (or being rammed) other than being punished for driving off track with a slow down to 50KMH / 30MPH. For anyone looking for a awesome racing experience, steer clear of Assetto Corsa.  The physics and force feedback are very good and the only reason I get any enjoyment from this game is running hotlaps. I think that is the only real selling point of Assetto Corsa, as I can think of no others to speak of.  Had they produced a proper career with structured racing guidelines, I would have recommended this game. There is allot of potential with Assetto Corsa, but the developers need to work on the racing aspect to make this a successful racing sim. Instead they have moved onto producing DLC rather than improving a game that feels like a work in progress.
12309	Unless you own a racing wheel stay away. It tries to be a pure sim racer but allows no grace in controls. You'll lose speed in nearly every corner compared to other racers unless you can be extremely precise in your steering.
12310	Just another racing game that relies on pretty visuals and not on realism. Pass if you are looking for something decent.
12311	Half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ racing simcade on rails  -Terrible slip angles -cars snap on turns -Still no pitstops during races -Beta form at best -lack of varity of car classes and tracks -mods ripped off from other games GTR and rF1 and the devs let this slide  If you like hot lapping this might be the game for you. Terrible AI really makes solo racing pointless and career mode is a joke. If you want a traditional simulator look else where namely rFactor 2 or GSCE. I might also add this game is releasing in April of next year on consoles. Which in the current half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ state of the current game I would steer clear of the console port too.
12312	I'll say the same exactly as in Project cars for this game  The more I play it, the less I like it. The dynamics are way overdone beyond simulation. Without a wheel, don't bother. Without perfected throttle and steering control, theres absolutely no skid pad or room for mistakes or fun beyond simulated driving in this game. Looks great, sounds great, all the options are amazing, lot's of neat positives in this game and all the cool race trakcs as well. Decent game all around, just dosen''t have the fun handling.
12313	Assetto Corsa is extremely challenging. I cannot recommend this game for casual racers.  I've played many racing 'sim' games like Gran Turismo, Forza, and Grid. All of which I would highly recommend over cheaper more arcade like racers like the Need for Speed Franchise, Burnout, etc... With that said this game makes games like Gran Turismo feel like the cheap arcade racer games they actually are. This is definately a true racing sim for the hardcore fans.   Playing career mode is punishing. I managed a gold on the first time attack stage but was blown away on the second stage when racing a full grid of AI racing opponents. Even if you scale the difficulty of the AI back to 80% (lowest) it's difficult to finish in the top 3 positions. The AI makes no mistakes and follows the racing line perfectly. The only change the AI slider seems to make is that the opponents drive marginally slower, enough for you to win if you drive flawlessly around the course. After numerous attempts I was able to secure second place.  If you're like me and don't have the patience to master every single event in the career by practicing it over and over then this game is not for you.   The physics, graphics are as good as everyone is saying. In Multiplayer I'm sure this game is a real blast. I really wish I could vote this game up for the hardcore and down for the casual.
12314	i won't recommend it because its too hard to understand. In-Game UI are very messy. I bought this game while it still in beta... for way more then right now, when the game is finished. I'm sure many will agree with me, all user that buy this game on its beta stage should get all DLC from now until ever for free, because we pay more than standard game fee. Its like you pay for game with season pass.  for people who is looking for a very technical game, this one is very recommended though. I can give 8/10 for all aspect but i will not recommend this to a normal person. only a hardcore enthusiast will get this game and enjoy it.  for the last time, WE PAY MORE FOR THIS GAME DURING THE BETA VERSION, WE SHOULD GET MORE FROM THIS GAME FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE!
12315	I play this game at a friends house so i have more than 30 min on here. I love this game but with xbox controller it sucks. The wheel is so much nicer. Also I had never realized how complacted it was to set up everything from scratch. And to be honest the graphics are very disapointing. I have been a PC gamer longer than iv been playing Forza. If u like Racing sim and have xbox just get that b/c this to me is a crap sim. But like i said i am a forza guy. If you want any custom cars u have to get them online and put them in this isnt a problem if u know how to do somthing like that. I just hate the fact that i got this game thinking i would be abel to do alot more from the start. I have hours of downloading and modding to make this game like i have always played it at my friends. This kinda upset me mainly b/c my dude told me to put stuff in the wrong folder and gave me crap links to get the cars. So i had installed and reinstalled like 3 times in one day. But After all that at the end of the day it is a very fun game. Just be prepaird for lots of frustration on navagation threw menus and having to go back and forth so much just to change settings and controls. Honestlly This game out the box is not any where close to worth what it cost but after hours and hours of downloading and changing stuff up it can be awsome. I am going to Not Recommend this game just b/c of that reason pretty much. There are not much for updates and from everything iv read the company has no plans to ever try and fix any of the navagation problems with the game or any of the little bugs. But if ur a die hard pc guy and want a sim to me this is the best u can get still not worth 50-60 bucks tho.
12316	Since most people here have their nose parked up the behind of these people, ill help provide some balance. I'm not a hardcore sim-gamer, but i've played racing games since the mid 90's and i'm a big fan of track racing. This game managed to really get on my nerves, and this review was written when i was still in a pretty foul mood.  - Yes it's a fancy looking game, but still nothing not better looking than titles released 10ish years ago .. its not FANTASTIC in any way. I would have looked great 10 years ago, today it simply takes more ...  - The sound is mediocre, cars sounds lame (are the sounds even recorded in stereo?). Again, theres nothing 'amazing' or 'fantastic' about it.  - The gui is confusing and the configuration not very intuitive. It took me 10 minutes to find where to disable raceline and all the stupid driving aids, i mean; 100% ABS, 100% traction control and gear shift help as standard .. really?? There's no feedback when selecting anything, no 'activate setting' and '[x] settings activated', just click the 'go back' button and hope it works (which it didnt). Two 'start'-buttons to start the race ... why? And two buttons almost next to eachother, that takes me to the same car properties screen ... It had my G27 (what is a 'G27 900'?) in the wheels list, so i guess thats a plus .. but once i clicked and 'activated' it, it wasn't highlighed anymore. Confusing.  - Tripple screen support is a joke (in my case, im sure others have got it working); it lets me select it but it never worked (i never got more than one screen in 'race mode'). I cant select resolutions because theres no 'drop down' where theres supposed to be one, just a white square that does nothing. Even Farming simulator 15 have better tripple screen support. When trying to resolve it i find a link to  assettocorsa.net , but to read it i HAVE TO LOG IN .. are you kidding me?? By this time (1 hour later), i'm so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the stupid company there no way im giving them anything else, they already robbed me of 45 Euros. - I tried editing the video.ini and triple_screen.ini-file in the game folder but nope. - I have 2 ASUS and 1 Dell monitor (all 27' 1440p, GeForce GTX970), and nVidia wont let me do spanning in nVidia settings, but i've managed to get triple screen working in all other games i've tested so far.  As you can clearly see, i've had a really bad experience from this game and my review will reflect that. It obviously isnt all bad or it wouldnt get 85/100 ... but i didn't pay 45Euro for a beta or early access, but thats what i got. It also feels like thats what's what most people have reviewed it as. I dont think they will mend the confusing gui, but i could get used to that. If they continue to release fixes for everything else, i might come back to this game some day and get my 45 Euros worth ...
12317	Lets just start with saying if you not own the correct sterring wheel then you cannot play this game! Since the default button layout are made by aliens and same with the reaction for buttons, and nothing can be changed in game menu all buttons are locked = not worth a buy (not even for free you should take this)  ps. Never have i felt so cheated and scammed as i did with this game thought it would be one of my favorite games but instead i can only rate it 0.5/10  (remember to read the link i have posted since this explains evrything)
12318	The game keeps crashing and posting the following message: 'launcher stopped working.' I've tried to fix this in many ways but still, the game crashes. Hopefully someone can guide me the right way. All the best. -H
12319	The difference between lowest settings @720 and highest settings at @1440 is 10fps, specifically those that occupy the space between 40 and 50. This game does not run well, and if like most people you consider 60fps to be the minimum playable framerate then you will be very angry with this console peasant simulator.
12320	the game is quite fun with a wheel, complete fail with a controller (360) i dont recommend because of the lack of tracks and cars for a racing game there really isnt much to it. very short career with set cars you have to use. glade i got it in a sale this game is quite dear for what it is
12321	Giving AC a try every 6 months since I got it in early access and it didn't improve much. But what makes me more hopeless about this game (not going to call it a sim....) is Kunos interviews. I just can't say the guy want to do a simulator whenenever he talks in any interview and this is being proved in the game... So if you are more of a casual gamer and not exactly a sim racer buy it. It will worth every cent. But as a simulator you got better choices out there so as I'm judging something that calls itself a simulator I can't recommend it.
12322	It's ok, but it is no iRacing
12323	This game is a good one but if you are looking for a better games for FFB wheels IRacing is a better way to go because i do not feel when the tires come off the grond or can i feel the bumper strips and nurburg has a rougher roads than they depict
12324	I reccomend this game to people who are big into really realistic racing games cuz i got it and im not very big into it and im bored of it cuz its hard sometimes
12325	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest mp in history of racing games. Otherwise quite decent.
12326	This game is lagging on my two gt 210's, how the hell is this possible.
12327	â¥â¥â¥â¥
12328	Terrible VR support. Wouldn't even call it supported at all. Still haven't updated to 0.7 runtime and Rift is already on 0.8. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO USE IT WITH OCULUS RIFT!
12329	Pros: Very well made driving simulator Somewhat realistic damage to cars during race Uses real cars  Cons: Too difficult Unlocking cars is too easy Not enough cars
12330	I've played everything from the Microprose days through TOCA, GTR 1 and 2 all the way to RBR and the like.   I've spent months just with data logging on GTR 2 for the perfect setups.   I can not get what the fuss is about this game. I've tried but this is just not value for money to me. Thank heavens Dirt Rally is available and in a few hours Project Cars.  Sorry, but I can't recommend this.
12331	i tell them why they should not bother if you like multiplayer: i was blacklisted for loosing controll of my (fictional) car and crashing into others.....i was hit in the back along the straight at Monza....French servers again.....nothing was done.....excellent game online baby's race against....
12332	Dont bother buying this poor excuse for a racing game. Its still real buggy, not complete and the devs are already adding DLC for an unfinished game. That is what is destroying the gaming industry already and this is just taking it too far.  Plus game, what little there is of it, is not even fun.
12333	Firstly had difficulites getting the actual game to work. Then when I did was disappointed with the handling and graphics in the game. Haven gotten into Raceroom I found it to be a lot more fun to drive using the G27 steering wheel than this. Not just from easiness point of view, but the way the cars handle in this game dont really remind me of how my own car handles.
12334	For a driving sim, I didn't like agree with anything about like this game in early access. I put it down for months hoping it would become equal to Forza but PC. Playing it now, it's basically the same thing with less bugs.   There isn't enough content to keep interest. What is interesting, is DLC. Its like that 'Next car simulator' game, it'll hold your attention for about 10 minutes.  Its still an underster simulator. Most of the time your wheel is maxed out to a side, and you slide forward but don't spin out. Its a poor simulation of how a real car handles.  The multiplayer server browser is such a bad and frustrating system.  VERY MUCH REGRET THIS PURCHASE!
12335	I wish I could get my money back. I have been trying for a week to get it to run just ok. Iracing took me only 3hrs to get it to very good.
12336	Get Iracing its a real driving sim not this arcade game. I see reviews saying perfect game perfect sim maybe with a gt force or thrusmaster/madcatz but with a real sim setup this game is garbage. This game is just Gt6 polished for pc its pretty and sounds good but thats where it ends. Tried in beta form and it was terrible and have now tried fullversion which is an improvement but still feels like a arcade racer with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t lap times and corner speeds. This is a game so don,t call it a simulator because it will teach you nothing about really driving a race car. And yes iracing was not very good about 2 years ago but in the last year has been redesigned a few times and is now the one to go for. It didn,t win Best Pc Driving Sim ever made for no reason.
12337	Do yourself a favor and find something else if you are looking for awesome graphics and driving experience. I played about 30 minutes and could not stand the graphics quality. I had max settings on and it looked like trash. Requested a refund already.
12338	Shaun Cole was right all along, this is an arcade racing game. Don't be fooled by PR talk or fanboys, this is no SIM race title, and it never will be, think a cross between the Forza series and the Gran Turismo series, but without the fun of having many many cars and tracks... Truth be told, it is abit of a bad joke that this is branded as a 'next gen' SIM, much like how Gran Turismo is marketed as 'The ultimate driving simulator'   - engine supports only 1 light source = this game will never feature night time driving... - changeable weather? i haven't seen any in any case... - no timed racing, only option is to set x amount of laps - no rubbering in of the track - no damage model - press escape during an online race, and you end back in the pits with a new car, ready to go out (and wreck) again - tyre model? i doubt it - ridiculously small amount of input options - community - BIGGEST deal breaker: racing online, when someone finishes it sets off a timer, if you don't cross the finish within that time, your screen just goes black and are taken to the results page TAKING AWAY ANY INCENTIVE to even start a race !! what's the bloody point in driving x amount of laps on any track, if you can't finish your race because you are not in P1 ?? Or close to him?   All in all, nothing in the game is geared towards beeing a racing SIM, eyecandy and stupid showrooms are the order of the day in this title, wich is fine if you are looking for that kinda of game (and don't have an Xbox to buy the much superior forza series), but not so much when you are duped into thinking this is a propper SIM.  background: 10years + of SIM racing on titles as FIA GTR, Rfactor, FIA GTR2 and Rfactor2
12339	you better have a monster computer, this game needs alot of work. i could be the next GT. wait till it is on sale!!
12340	As much hype as this game got, it still feels stale and dated. It's an okay game, but that's about it. A racing game without a good AI is not a good racing game. Even Gran Turismo has AI that can overtake slower cars. Even Gran Turismo 1 had that.   If this review gets me banned from the official forums, then it just shovs that they can't take any critique. (It's not even harsh.)  5/10 - It's okay for hotlapping. If you can get your settings right.
12341	unplayable. cars spin off at the first corner and some even when going in a straight line. xbox config wont let me have the triggers as brake/gas like in all other games. joke of a game. and all the good tracks and cars cost extra!   DLC WARNING! BAIT AND SWITCH
12342	Thought I was buying a game on par with Iracing. This is not. Iracing is leagues in front of this. Shame.
12343	To be a real simulator, it needs lots of improvements.  - Clutch button does not exist - I cant assign mouse buttons for shift up/down nor anything but accel/brakes - Mouse stering configs very poor (no dead point, tolerance, etc) - With G27, many functions needs very much work and calibration to get working  Resume: - The game looks good, but dont worth the price
12344	'Oculus Rift Early Support' = Supports barrel view but good luck getting through the menus and actually into the car. Tried a long time ago, wrote a bad review and got hassled by a fanboy. Well, here it is nearly a year later and still no support.  I bought this BECAUSE it stated it had support but clearly this is unsupported.
12345	After many many many months of knowing the cause of the problem, the resolution switching bug has not been fixed, nothing has been done about full controller support for menus, and any and all fixes have been for the gameplay and not the game itself.  Once you're racing, assuming you're not cursing at your screen resolution configuration being ignored, the game is fun. It's the closest I've felt to Forza on something other than an Xbox, and definitely feels better than any Gran Turismo. But why is there DLC for a game that still doesn't feel complete? Moreso, why is it shoved in your face while going through menus? 'for only $25, you could be using this car on this track!' I'm sorry, no. If it weren't for that I bought the game well over a year ago, I'd be looking for a refund at this point, because it feels I'll never get my money's worth, especially when the game keeps asking me for more money.  I really really really wanted to like this game, and the potential for me to do so is very much there, but I feel like it will always keep me at arm's length, at best.
12346	I love a driving game, and I love realism, but this is not a game. It's a simulator. How is it a simulator and not a game? It has a career....?  Firstly, the XBOX controller support is poor. If you want an axis-based control mapped to a button (i.e. clutch), you're screwed. And vice versa (i.e. camera look). None of the menus support controller navigation and there is no optimal configuration.  Secondly, there's no music library to add fun to driving in the program. No background tracks meant to improve the experience, catered for the buyers to enjoy.  Thirdly, some of the stuff doesn't work. The driving lines that are meant to tell you the best way to drive for a fast time are very often wrong, and by disobeying the lines, you can shave several seconds off your time on even a small circuit.  Assetto Corsa had the possibility to be what Gran Turismo and Forsa Motorsport are for consoles, but it fell short by JUST trying to be a simulator.
12347	not a bad game not the best sim out there but its close enuf its good how you can add mods but i personaly think project cars will be better over all tho AC still good game i recomend it but i dont think full price is worth it   id say wait for project cars to be fair.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was before career was put in DO NOT BUY utter rubbish the devs distroyed a good game i for one want a refund of this game dont waste your money!!!  ive played allsorts or sim racers forza race 07 f1 to grid need for speed moto gp..  and this assetto corsa utter bull cod please do a favour do NOT BUY IT ITS CRAP!!!!!
12348	Can't start a race after update... woohooo
12349	Visual quality is low for the fps you get. Physics and mechanics feel like an arcade game. Forza 4 seems better on the xbox 360 for physics and traction (more realistic (actually takes skill)).
12350	sucks
12351	This game is horrible, AI is too good, it never makes mistakes, no point in having damage on because you will just be in last place. There was no point adding controller support because obviously this game will only work well with steering wheel, which must give you super powers because sometimes the AI can overtake me in the same car as me when I'm going top speed.   The game still feels like its in early access. very barren and boring.
12352	Could be a great game, but the modding community just isn't there. It exists, but not at a level to be satisfied with.  Not only that, but the community doesn't seem to care about realistic car's at all, on many of the older car's posted to RaceDepartment, you see idiots bashing the modders of slower/older car's, saying â¥â¥â¥â¥ like 'This car isn't realisitc' 'Too slow' and etc, because the game is corrupted by Gran Tursimo, Forza and Need for Speed, idiots.
12353	Maybe its me but the steering is uncontrollable, the slightest input is magnified beyond any reasonable expectation, The graphics are nothing like the video adverts either. Very dissappointed. Not a patch on any of my other racing games.
12354	The game is very buggy and is incomplete. i was really looking forward to playing a game that would be close to forza but this is complete trash in comparsion. the cars are very limiting and now they are trying to sell little bonus packs like wtf, there is only 50 or so cars in the game and they are already making people pay for more... The AI is sh*t and how the cars act on the road is unrealistic. it makes you wonder if the devs have ever driven a car before. On top of all the sh*t the game appears to have died for me as i cannot start races. The only good part about the game is the graphics  spend your money else where
12355	Bit of a kick in the nuts from Kunos, this game is cheaper Retail than Early Access. Kunos you control the discounts not Valve, stop disrespecting your early adopters (unpaid testers) and undervaluing your game just to chase sales. No wonder people are buying the game from foreign Key Sellers - you only have yourselves to blame!!!! Get your pricing structure and timing right FFS!  As for the game..... I will update when I have played 1.0. SLI performance was terrible during Early Access, in order to play you needed to have static reflections and very low smoke generation, selecting anything else would result in 20-30FPS. Additionally playing in NVIDIA 3D wasn't the best experience. The clouds and mirror reflections were all wrong and this issue was addressed over a year ago and wasn't fixed during that duration, since nothing has been mentioned in the changelog about this then I guess it still has not been fixed.   Until I test this game further tonight I cannot reccommend this yet.
12356	Only aspect of this game that is actually good is the driving mechanics. Graphics are descent. Nothing remarkable, just ok.Everything else is laughable.   The cars that come with the base game are very limited. The UI, although functional, is poorly designed and often feels unresponsive. The AI is a joke and never does it give you the feeling that you're competing in a race. The game in general is full of rough edges. There are no pit stops, no weather effects, no night races. It feels extremely dull and empty. But the icing on the cake is the sound. That godawful sound. The engines' sounds are so flat and soulless. You can find games from the 90s that have better sounds and, to be honest, I'm not even sure if the audio is stereo. I mean, stereo should be the absolute least one would expect in 2015. I swear that not even once did I get a sense of space. Everything sounds awful. And on top of that, I experienced a cracking sound bug that took me a good two hours to fix.  This game is by no means a racing simulator. A driving simulator, maybe. If you don't care about jumping in and driving alone then you might enjoy the realistic car handling. But if you want anything more than that, you're more than likely going to regret spending your money on this one.
12357	If it dosent work after 2 hours, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it.  I currently own a Logitech G27 and this game does not support it.  The steering wheel works fine, but the game does not support the H-shifter, for a game that claims to be a Real Driving Simulator this is pretty lame.  I tried everything to make it work and it still will not work, i know that my material isnt defective because it works on every single other racing games that i own.  If you don't mind playing with a controller i guess its fine but this is not for me.
12358	I want my money its sucks

12360	I am a big fan of racing games but this wasn't my favorite. I don't know why, but it did not feel very real for a simulator.
12361	If you ever consider buying Assetto Corsa just know that it is the buggiest game, that doesn't launch races and leaves you stuck in menus rendering it useless. You're better off donating the Â£34.99 to a charity instead.
12362	Best driving simulator out there - 10/10 Worst racing simulator I have played in the last 26 years (most frustrating AI in AI history) - 0/10
12363	Not nearly enough content  Edit:   Jesus Christ they just keep â¥â¥â¥â¥ing adding dlc when the base product isnt even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing finished. Do not buy this game they will jew you to death.
12364	This game is overrated.  Sounds are terrible, the exact same tyre screech regardless of car or speed or angle or whatever. The UI is made of 2 parts, like 2 separate programs - you set up what you want to play and then launch the race in a separate instance. This means you can't fix any settings on the second one, you keep needing to exit, reload etc. The cars look decent, but the tracks, trees, pitstop is very basic. The simulation is mostly decent, but it's very synthetic - the asphalt is perfecty smooth, tyres either grip or not, not very organic. And when you get off track the game adds the wobble many arcade games do - at least it doesn't do the complete slowdown when you touch grass. Car and track selection isn't very varied, There appears to be many dozen cars, but lost are slight variations of an other.
12365	cant say yet if game is good or bad but it took 9 hours to download and another 12 euro worth of GB wifi  iv a bran new steering wheel works fine on f1 but wont take a corner on this game cant get force feed back to work either so just a heads up if you think ur gonna jump straight in and drive you most likely are gonna spend hours just setting it up il add to this review if i ever get to ply it
12366	Â£35 it looks like a beta game and now doesnt load any tracks after spending hours configuring a controller. Dont bother
12367	Bad game. Waste of money. There is no simulation of this at all.
12368	This game needs a dynamic racing line and more cars and tracks that are not downloadable content, otherwise it simply can not compete with Project cars or Forza 5. All and all, a good game but not worth the thirty dollars I spent without the fore-mentioned additions. I would love to buy the Nurburgring Nordsliefe DLC, but it is simply not worth it without more of a game. Another case of pre-release being hyped. I would recommend this game for about fifteen dollars, and that's it.
12369	Force feedback feels feels wrong, physics are not really good.
12370	This is the singulary most obtuse starting menu I have ever had the displeasure of trying to start.  Buy the time you get the game working you are out of the mood to play.  Thrustmaster T500rs works VERY good everywhere else except in this frustrating piece of garbage.  When you are lucky and get to play after 2 hours of set up, the game is fantastic with very good ffb,  It just isnt worth the time to get there.
12371	it sucks, just dont buy it, thank me later
12372	crashes every time WTF
12373	DLC-simulator.  How do these devs justify putting out two barren DLC packs when the game itself is barren of content? They've padded the car selection with lotuses that are identical to eachother.  It needs more free cars, not more DLC.  I really can't recommend this game unless you get the base game + the DLC (two as of writing this review) for 15 bucks.
12374	Two words for this. Buy iRacing. I'd even go so far as demanding my money back for such a â¥â¥â¥â¥ product
12375	It askes me for a Sever password when i have played on the sever before without using a server password. PLZ help
12376	This game has a ton of promise, but it's too barebones to be worth anything over $10. It comes with almost no cars, almost no tracks, and a TON of ads for things that you NEED TO BUY RIGHT NOW BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!  The modding community is kind of garbage too. Everything has a billion horsepower, everything is a drift car, everything is a hillclimb, maybe 1 in 25 tracks have a working minimap. The best track as of yet is the C1 loop made famous by wangan midnight and tokyo xtreme racer, but it's in the day time, and with the weak selection of cars, there's not much point.  Things like that aren't really Kuno's fault, but shipping with around 10ish? cars? then releasing a TON is. If you bought this any time before V1.0, you got robbed. Don't avoid this game because it's good or bad, Avoid this game because of bad business practices. Kunos needs to learn that skalping is bad.
12377	May be it is a good game, if you can get Logitech G 920 wheel to work. I had to ask for refund Could not get it to work
12378	I bought it for VR as a replacement for Pcars... ohhh boy, worst decision in a long time. It's unplayable in VR, especially if you have a racing wheel. Simply because all the menues aren't visualized in VR. Not even badly... you have to take off the headset, select something, put the headset on again, take it off, navigate the menue, and so on... And the developer seems to refuse to patch this simple thing, but rathers push more car DLC's out. Unbelievable, half a year is gone and still nothing...
12379	Great if your happy battling against useless AI or hotlapping, online is a joke! More sim than most but still quite aracdey, cars can be saved too easily and have far too much grip. Looks nice.
12380	i just buy this like 2 hour ago after i start game  i try to understand how to play, i find a car that i want to play iwant to drive mazda rx-5/rx-7 so i have to buy dlc for that it ok i buy japan pack i got mazda BUT WHAT I DONT KNOW IS I CANT DO ANYTHING ON THIS CAR - NO CUSTOM AND WHEN I FIND A SERVER THERE ARE NO SERVER THAT ALLOW ME TO DRIVE MAZDA  VERY SHAME MONEY IS NOT PROBLEM FOR ME BUT IM SAD . I HAVE TO BUY DLC FOR A CAR THAT I CANT DO ANYTHING AND I CANT EVEN PLAY A CAR I BUY DLC FOR IT  37 MIN OF PLAYTIME I REQUEST A REFUND THIS GAME IS VERY BAD AND THIER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD HAVE SOME SHAME ALL I SEE A REVIEW ON YOUTUBE IS LIE  THIS GAME IS LIE   I WANT MY MONEY BACK THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME FOR ME
12381	Unfinished product 40% finished.   If you're looking for a real sim look elsewhere, arcade at best, waste of money, -2/10
12382	Dont let the videos fool you. sucks...... needs lots of work. very few cars.
12383	This game seems to be always broken in some little annoying way. There is no polish and doesnât feel like a complete product despite always needing to download updates.
12384	IMPOSSIBLE to drive a car. looks great cars handle like a bag of potatos - forcefeedback more like a forced slap in the face. i played forza GT6 and the likes and very much enjoyed them, downloaded AC and have just struggled to even control the cars using a logitech driving force pro, you expect grip from a race car you do not get that you just get a racing drift car.  Â£30 + Â£7 for the dlc pack 1 and what a letdown , i have more fun playing eurotruck sim and american truck sim at the very least feedback is not trying to rip your arms off. the haters will hate but speak to the wall becasue this hand aint listening.  career mode is impossible , the AI is way to strong even when dialed down to 80% ( yes thats it no lower) and even then one tiny mistake and your out , some of us are not pro drivers ( i do not own a real car or licence but i can drive) and to be honnest it does not feel like driving a car more like trying to wrestle a 15ft 350lb salt water crocodile.
12385	Worst game ever. It gives me freeze screen whenever i move mouse 1nm.
12386	Don't get it. It's still buggy and isn't worth purchasing right now!
12387	Game doesn't work and still should be in early access. waste of $55 ...
12388	Oh dear.....  Looked forward to this for a year, finally got it.... oh dear.  Maybe ive ben spoilt with R3E's sound and transmission/ engine/ tire model..... but Assetto Corsa has none of these.  The sound is terrible, cockpit and chase cam use the same sound???? There is no excitement changing through the gears like you get in R3E.  Again the sound plain sucks. I will note however, it is VERY WELL optimised, Im running it on a laptop in medium settings and it looks very very pretty..... sad thats all you get with this, lots of eye candy.  Drifting is good, i think they got the physics spot on there, but if you want to drive actual racing cars the physics are terrible. Gear changes are boring, there is no feeling of mechanical parts working together what so ever, i honestly get more excitement playing TOCA2 Touring cars on a PSX emulator than i did from this.....  Such a shame really looked forward to it  Summary.  sound sucks tires dont feel like there are on tarmac lovely visuals very good for road spec cars and good for messing around in them very very bad for stripped out racers  If you want real racing in real racing cars then R3E (RaceRoom Racing Experience) has this beat in every way by miles!  5/10
12389	the physics for this game with modern wheels is bad compared to other games out there. If you have a g27 its ok but newer wheels are not supported well. FFB feel really bad even after using LUX
12390	-cars feel like trucks to drive -constantly under steering  -car doesn't know when to stop steering -changing steering options doesn't help because then the car becomes even worse going round corners. -impossible to control any skidding/drifting. -most cars struggle to get out of 1st gear when going up a hill. -annoying external camera, shifting alongside the car when turning a corner. -1st person view not bad but the steering wheel is annoying because its impossible to adjust the steering sensitivity so the steering is actually good. -no reverse gears.  absolute disgrace of a driving game. ToCa Racedriver 3 is a better racing game than this.  Never trusting the Steam Community reviews again.
12391	This game is not Forza. I was lied to. L
12392	bad game for beginers, un-said but you need to be amazing at racing to get far and it helps to have a $100+ race controler too. if you don't have these then geting lucky is how you get far game is still to hard in my opion, in career there is no clear 'start' i still just guess when it really starts. once you mess up once there is no way to catch up so one bad turn and its time to reset the race.
12393	Cars dont handle good like in grid or Toca race driver 3 they have the cars driving like â¥â¥â¥â¥ do not buy this game they need to fix it like Toca race driver 3 where u can pick slim or pro slim driving.
12394	ai just recentley bought Assetto corsa and its giving me this launch error anyone know how to help me thanks!
12395	Not only is this game not modding friendly it also limits the different ways you can set up a car. For most cars the tuning options are non existent. Changing gear ratios to suit the track? Forget about it. Different tyre compounds? Who needs it? More horsepower for the ring? Are you crazy?! /s This is weird because there is a save slot available for every track and car in the game. This also means u default to the standard setup every time you change track or car (this includes the POV setting).   I can't recommend this game because having arcade levels of tuning in a simulation game is unacceptable. 
12396	It's not a casual racer. So if that's your bag, I couldn't recommend this game to you.  On a brand spanking new machine made by the lord of PC gaming himself, this game looks FANTASTIC.  And if you like driving around doing time trials or just watching the world go by, it is excellent.  But if you're anything other than a hardcore sim racer, you're going to have a real hard time with the career mode. It starts off stupidly hard. And by about half-way through, even with settings set as easy as they go (which isn't far btw) you will struggle to keep up with the last placed car by the end of the 1st lap of any race.  + Looks fantastic. Buy it to impress your friends and family with that new PC of yours.  - Not so much a game, as a visual display of racing.
12397	Very nice racing sim, runs out of steam quickly though.
12398	Wow. This game feels like it's only 30% finished. AVOID. If you want a good racing game, get Project CARS.  The menus and UI don't even have controller support...
12399	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UI, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in game redirects to pull money out of you, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ career, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car.  Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
12400	I really wish i could give a better review. i really do. It's a fun game, very realistic in SOME ASPECTS  Pros -  Great wheel optimization  Great physics  Great laser scanned tracks  Good graphics  CONS.  HORRIBLE clutch support  HORRIBLE sounds  Not many cars are H shifter compatible  Have to use flipping flappers to change gears, without the option to change to Hshifter  Compared to real MANUAL cars, this is horrible  I did enjoy this game a tiny bit, not enough for me to recommend or play anymore. Needs to update more. I've been backing since day 1. The Physics and wheel support are really good, just not the pedals.... or Hshifter support. AT ALL.   Did i mention the cars sound like toasters 
12401	It's not a casual racer. So if that's your bag, I couldn't recommend this game to you.  On a brand spanking new machine made by the lord of PC gaming himself, this game looks FANTASTIC.

12402	Doesn't work on my system. Requesting a refund as I am already at 53 minutes of play time all from troubleshooting. I can't get any type of race session to load. I am just taken back to the race settings menu. I clearly don't have enough time to mess with the settings and I don't care to. The game should just work really. But it doesn't and I want a refund, because I straight up don't have the time to fix your product. On top of that, this problem is a common problem. Alot of people seem to be getting it. So be warned. This is what you could be getting yourself into. You can't have anymore than 2hrs playtime to request a refund.  Looks like a good game though.
12403	Totally UNREALISTIC cornering; only loads and loads of understeer until you come out of the corner. So you better not buy this game until they fixed this...
12404	this game would be awsome if it worked.... when im done choozing mu cars and maps i click the race butten then it loads than goes back to the screen i need help!!!
12405	I was really excited to play this game using my G27 racing wheel, brand new high power windows gaming machine and oculus rift DK2.  First time I ran the game, the graphics were all messed up, the mountains were drawing over the track. It was a mess.  I noticed that the steering wheel was rotating way faster onscreen than the physical device. Considering this is the most popular driving wheel you'd expect that to be working out of the box.  Ok well no loss, maybe it will work better in the rift? No such luck. After following rather painful instructions on the forums, the game just crashes when you load up a race.  It might just be this version and things will be fixed soon, but I really cannot recommend this game right now if you are looking for a VR driving experience. My setup is not finge case so you would expect the developer be a bit more focused on providing the VR experience it is touted to have.  I would say hold on to your money until they fix the game.
12406	I listened to the community, saying 'It has realistic physics' And 'The physics are so great'.. So is that why grass behaves like ice? Why cars bounce uncontrollably when only hitting minor bumps? Why your car stops instantly when you grind a barrier? Why your car goes skidding for miles when you get bumped by someone else?  You can either listen to the troll community and buy this crap, or use Â£35 to buy project cars.   -Graphics are sh*t -Barely any content -Overpriced DLC which should have been in the game already -Laughable physics  But what can you expect from an indi game eh 
12407	Short and simple - the sims/simarcades that are out right now, are much better. Assetto offers weak car selection, decent physics, poor graphics, just plain bad audio quality, and a whole hell of a lot of DLC. Even with the DLC, the car selection is very low. Head over to the DLC section for this game to see what i mean. Cars the the R34 GTR, Mazda RX7, Mclaren P1, Porsche 918, you know, the basics for car lovers are DLC. Sure you can have your F1 cars, 458's and 12C's which have been the standard for 6 or so years, but any of the loveable 90's classics or the modern badass super/hypercars are pure DLC. So what, you pay $60&gt; for a good car selection for a game that at its core is weaker than old sims like GTR 2 and Rfactor? Cmon.
12408	Doesn't look merely as good as the rendered screens. Bad physics, feels like driving a floating carpet. I'd buy an Xbox One solely for Forza5 rather than playing this torture.
12409	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ feels like it's still in â¥â¥â¥â¥ing beta.  hosting a multiplayer game takes an external DOS executable and configurations to be made via editing a cfg file. what is this, 1993? it's also barren. not a lot of content. not to mention fugly as hell, but that's a minor complaint.   anyway, get automobilista instead. if stock car extreme is anything to go by, it's probably a better buy.
12410	Buyer beware, avoid this like the plague. Biggest pile of steaming horse manure I've witnessed.  False advertising, Misleading claims  -Claims to be a Sim but in reality its a glorified keyboard/pad racer habited by arcade racer fanboys who have ego issues. eg : ' SeriousSpy 1 hour ago You're right, TDU2 is so much more realistic.' - Keep them coming guys.  -Claims to have G27 support but â¥â¥â¥â¥, the FFB model is as shithouse, tweak it all you want theres one fixed ffb curve and a few sliders, forget the silly ffb plugin toys, just fluff that doesn't contribute towards addressing actual issues.  -Toxic Community :   Originally posted by   mr munkee  :
12411	Call it a sandbox, call it a masterpiece, call it simulation, but it's still a Game, that should be made for fun. This one gets  boring , maybe too serious, you have to repeat a path over and over until ... you miss by 0.1 sec..  Really?  No  open world map? Hats off devs  24/100
12412	Don't buy this unless you're wanting to spend hours trying to figure out how to play with someone you know.
12413	Feels like an ice skating simulator if you try using an Xbox 360 controller.   DLC for a game that felt like Early Access is lame too.
12414	Buggy game. Actually very bad!
12415	Multiplayer is garbo, DLC / Updates are lacking, and little to no support for VR.  
12416	The developers have stated directly that they aren't interested in VR for Assetto Corsa, and that was the whole reason I bought this game. They can do whatever they wish of course, but I can not reccomend this game if they are going to ignore the die-hard sim people, especially for something as excellent as VR.
12417	This game is just fail. Physics is nice but lack of cars and tracks makes it boring very fast. Wish I bought project CARS instead...
12418	I dunno if im playing a different game to everyone else but this is awful, bad physics, terrible ai, graphics that wouldnt look out of place on a ps2, barely any cars or tracks, most mods dont even work properly, terrible sound effects, complicated menus,glitches galore and its extreamly boring i was expecting much more with such good reviews.
12419	No HTC vive support ....... prefer money over anything else ...... so you have low content with teh game and need to pay tons of DLC to add few content .....   ban without good reason people and post on the forum (not me). ..   and this is the racing game with the worst sound design i ever try !!!!!!!  RRRE for example have a good sound design  run away
12420	cant use my wheel
12421	Does not play in windows 10. Wasted my money
12422	Dissapointing handling, could do better.
12423	Looks and plays nothing like advertised. Textures are bad, AA non-existent, sound quality poor, and the UI is a mess. The fact that the game relies on filters to make the game look pretty is shocking. This should of stayed in Early Access where it belongs.  Played on an i7 4770k @3.5Ghz with a GTX 780.  I'm happy that Steam have refunded me full credit. You have been warned!
12424	When I first experiense this, It was an Early acces.   1 Month later it was call a full game and you have to pay for every update. EVERY. UPDATE.  Yes it is F*******g good and realistic.   Am I going to continu supporting this fashion of ''let call this game done and charge for every content we originaly plan to put in'' ? Absolutly Not.
12425	this game will make you feel cheated from time to time in certain races. Some cars DO NOT handle as a car should when turning a corner at 20mph... why is a bmw slipping so much at that speed. graphics are getting dated.. the only enjoyable races are with the faster cars. It's NOT the most realistic racing game out. 
12426	I know I am going to get flak for this but I will say this, it is still a really good game hell one of the best racing sims on steam.   Pros: -Sound (oh god the engine sounds :)) -Optimization -Graphics - All the cars drive uniquely  Cons: -Crash physics is eh compared to other AAA games (improving though) -THE BUSINESS MODEL  I am sorry to say even though I love this game, I cannot reccomend it solely on the fact that the devs (or publishers) thought is was a good idea to sell DLC for an early access game. Now if the game was 20-30$ normal price this could be bareable, but it's base price 50 FREAKING DOLLARS. Now if you add the DLCs DP1 and DP2 this game is a whopping 75$, which is MORE THAN A AAA GAME (Forza, Project Cars, Gran Turismo). Bare in mind that right now even with all the DLCs the there are only 60 cars and 18 tracks.  So sorry I really don't see why I have to pay for DLC in an early access game that is 50$ base price (maybe 30$ for sales) where not some but all of the content is added later on for free.
12427	This game isn't fun. I spend the rest of my Christmas money on this game and it doesn't even work with my wheel, which is a Logitech Driving Force. I have seen several people use this wheel for this game and it work perfectly fine. I assigned the throttle for throttle and the brake for brake and the brake ended up being the throttle and the throttle pedal was the brake. What the heck! The game is super laggy even though I am playing on a 2 year old computer. I tryed to adjust graphic settings and nothing helped. Super big disappointment. I had high expectations for this game and it doesnt work. I want a refund. I will try this game again if the developers fix these ridiculous problems. MAKE IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!
12428	i dont know if its so realistic or physics are wrong, u can barely go into a corner 50 kmh, these are sports cars  beside the f1 car its very hard to go into a corner also the steering wheel always shift lil bit to the left, dnt have this issue with any other car games  list of cars is very short
12429	This has very limited (only few) cars and few tracks, you have to buy everything, when you click none of them works. i made a mistake buying this.
12430	Cancer of the â¥â¥â¥â¥
12431	 Early Access Review
12432	dont buy this game. it's good for hotlapping but the devs couldn't give less of a stink about multiplayer or the community in general. if you must, wait for a sale.
12433	This game is so Bad,cant belive i payed for this crap.
12434	i was not very impressed.. its no good unless you#ve go a steering wheel. and there are way too few cars and tracks. also i tried some custom key binding and saved it so, but it did not function properly.   but the graphics and style of the game was cool and an interessting idea.
12435	A less than desirable rate of release on updates compared to what was expected and comapared to current market competitiors.   Also the updates you have change menial stuff to do with the single player or adding more cars so the multiplayer functionality is still hideously limited. Also the fact AC is on steam means when MP does work long enough to complete a race you get smashed off in turn one by some moron keyboard jockey.   AC looks pretty and runs well. The cars feel off and the tracks are laser scanned in the very loosest sense of the word.   If you want a serious sim to race in go to iRacing or rFactor 2. If you just want to muck around with some morons on a (just about) working multiplayer then get AC... but on offer because Â£30 for what you get now is laughable.
12436	Sorry guys, but from the looks of all the reviews that I've seen of the game, and after playing it myself, they don't match up at all. I felt strongly enough about this game to post a review, which I practically never do.  This is not Gran Turismo. This is more like Live for Speed, and an unfinished one at that. Car sounds (The Fiat 500 Abarth that I tried) are tinny Xbox 360 controller steering is cartoonish at best (very digital. Turn right, it's immediate right, no give, no play on the steering rack, just immediate right.) No menu music No atmosphere The main game switches from an almost website-like feeling menu system where you go through the career and choose your track / objective etc, and does a distinct directx window switch into 'the game', which is even a seperate executable (acs.exe). No game does this any more; and if they do, they hide it with menu music or similar. The AI are unrealistically impossible. They make no mistakes, they follow the perfect line at the perfect speed and it's impossible to catch them if you make a single mistake. There is no track directional audio, no pit-side audio telling you where everyone else is on the track, how well or bad you're doing. No mid-lap time notifications to tell you how far behind or ahead you are compared to the next car.   Am I asking for a lot? Yes. Is it unreasonable? No.
12437	This game has the worse AI I've ever played against. They just sit on the racing line and won't give you space when you try an overtake even though you're half a car length ahead. Completely brain-dead AI Go buy rFactor 1 and/or 2 instead
12438	Good game let down by poor graphics.   In short: AC's graphics look dated compared to many other modern driving games out there, especially when you pay attention to details. AC's cars themselves look very good but that's it. All the (laser scanned) tracks in AC look very sterile and dead. Just compare the graphics and the livelyness on and around the tracks to games like Dirt Rally, Project Cars, F1 2016 etc. and you will clearly notice it.  There is hardly any movement on and around AC's tracks (the static trees and bushes are completely motionless, no wind effects, no leafs, grass, birds, planes, floating or flying in the air, no animated effects next to the tracks, etc.) and the spectators are some of the worst looking you will ever see in any game: they are just paper thin static cardboard figures! AC's ambient sounds are lacking as well.   There is no way around it, AC looks dated, no matter how many more car packs they will release for it! What's the use in getting them? You'll still be driving around in a very sterile and dead looking environment. It's almost just a hotlap simulator while it could be so much more!  As long as they don't improve AC's graphics I will not play it anymore, which is a shame because I own all DLCs for it,  excluding  the recent Porsche packs because that's when I lost interest in playing AC because of the sterile and dated graphics and the lack of graphical improvements. What's more, I have completely uninstalled the game at the moment because of this.  I wish AC would take note of what other driving games are doing in this area: Dirt Rally, Project Cars, Raceroom, GRID Autosport, F1 2016 etc. all these games have much better graphics, more lively tracks, animated 3D spectators and better ambient sounds and are way more fun to play and much more immersive.  The excuse of 'AC is a sim, it's focused on physics' (and therefore it's okay to look like crap) is just very poor, it's 2016, it's okay to expect and ask for more! Yes, AC has excellent physics, however good physics alone is not enough, I expect and want more. A perfect example of this is Dirt Rally: it has become more or less the de facto standard of rally sim racing and it has great physics, beautiful graphics, solid damage model, different weather conditions, day and night tracks and plenty of atmosphere and immersion, proof enough that the really great games get it right on all fronts.  Thusfar I have not even mentioned a dynamic day and night cycle, weather system or (visual) damage system yet. But you guessed it: these are all absent in AC and there are no night races either: the headlights don't even emit light on the tracks when it's dark. ËsteamboredË  Just imagine AC and its excellent physics with the beautiful graphics of Dirt Rally/Project Cars and the fantastic audio of RaceRoom Racing Experience: then it could become the best driving simulator ever!
12439	I came back to this game after putting it down for a while when it was on early access. Picked it back up again after they added carer mode, then put it back down again due to the over the top dificulty level. I have completed precicely one time attack, that's it. You have to be a god dam pro racing driver to be able to complete anything on this game.
12440	Career mode seemed to be incredibly limited. No feeling of accomplishment or advancement at all. Dated graphics looked more akin to a late PS2 title than a recent PC title. AI was terrible. Vehicle physics felt like every other recent racing title.  Overall this game does not feel anywhere close to being finished, let alone justifying DLC already.
12441	Nice sounds and nice graphics, if you like cars because of the looks or sound..Great this game is for you. If u want a great all-rounded racing game, look else where, in short; This is a Dad game.
12442	The game won't even go past the initial load screen for me. When you go to the support forums they have a huge checklist of items you are supposed to complete before posting your issue. I got through some of them like the typical 'cache integrity check', deleting the folders in My Documents. Then there are a list of things they want you to reinstall, like DirectX, Visual C++ redistributables, .NET frameworks.  Too much work when every other game I have on Steam 'just works'. I've had issues in the past with games that get glitchy and you have to update your graphics drivers, or disable a certain setting, or even the cache integrity/reinstall option. But this is just too much work when I just want to play the game. I'm not building my own Arch Linux machine here.
12443	Fantastic program with OK graphics and extremely poor synthesised sounds which ruins the game grately. You address a few of the issues with modding but would have been nice to have basic things out of the box.  Simulation is 8/10 (Force feedback is great) Graphics 6/10 (pretty much 4 years old engine) Sounds 3/10   Modding 10/10  Overall 7/10: good but could have been way better  
12444	I would not recommend this game due to the lack of controller support, unless you like driving with triggers its right up your ally!  Game uses that same progressive driving for these types of games you can't play what you want to play till you play all the other disciplines. Plus not getting any feed back from the developers is another common issue with this game. Been with them since early access and wrote to them that they needed to have the ablity to change the xbox gamepad controls and never did add that feature to change throttle controls. Players will gun you down if you mention anything of the sort.  Never got a chance to play multiplayer because of disconnection issues or either very bad lag, but happy to you if your able to play online. Plus I would ignore these paid to review companies as they always sway towards certian games.  Plus game still feels unfinished since last time I played and never had any fun because I was fighting the controls the whole time I was playing.  So if you don't mind using a wheel, this game is for you. But if you want 'Your Racing Sim' well thats not going to happen. I just wasted money on this game and thought it was going to be fantastic ended up being a controller nightmare.  so in conclusion: If you play with wheel = good! If you don't = tough luck! I recommend you check out Project CARS, more content than this game from day 1.

12446	Would buy again 9.1/10 Best game of the year  PSYCHE   Bought this game in Early Access. I thought I would wait until they added better cars, since thier variety was really limited. Waited, then DLC came out with cars that should be in the normal full version. This is not acceptable. I rarely spend 50$ on a game, and I saw that this game has potential. Also, graphics don't really push my system and are not the greatest. Also, my fps gets capped at 30fps when I turn at corners, causing lag and stutters. With all this aside, I truly believe this is one of the best simulators out there.  Conclusion:  Wish the car choices were better at start, because no one likes DLC, and fps related issues were fixed. Would play this game more if there was more then 3 cars I liked.
12447	Should have done a bit more research into the game: was hoping it was going to be kind of a 'collect-a-car' type of racer, like Gran Turismo. After switching to PC I was looking to find such a game. This game is amazingly beautiful, but the driving isn't what I was hoping. All in all, not a game I really enjoyed playing all that much.
12448	Cobbled together piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ would rather play barbies dreamhouse

12453	When it worked it was better than average. But, there is almost always an issue getting this game to run properly after updates for PC and I've tried all the usual fixes for 4 hrs today. i'm done...not worth the trouble. Was fine 3 months ago ; with updated graphic drivers I still get no farther than the menus. The old 'start button' issue. Guess that's why most folks go console these days---less complicated, same hardware.
12454	Worst car game ever. Not even realistic. I disliked this game.
12455	Worst simulation game I played; steering set to 1% and still not controllable!! LOL what a joke...those plp obviously dont know how to drive cars in real life (simulation thay say). LOT OF GLITCHES
12456	steering controls totally
12457	I wanted to buy assetto corsa as it seemed cool for a race game and everyone on steam encourged people to buy this game because they said this is the best racing simulator, ok so I listened to them and bought it. I have to say this was the biggest mistake of all my life. What a shame. Most peopple on steam write negative comments about project cars how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that is and how good assetto corsa is. You know what peopple, you don't even know what you are saying. Project cars is far better than this poo and more realistic, etc. This asseto game is crap. what a shame, I couldnt play it for more than 10 minutes.

12466	Cars handle horribly, audio is appalling and visuals are horrid even in ultra 4k. Also there's barely a handful of cars and tracks to choose from and far too many DLC's.   Absolutely no reason to buy this game compared to other racing titles.  And for all the people who follow this game like a cult try playing project cars it blows this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the water. It has a better menu layout, far greater capability of cars, infinitely more cars and tracks to drive and the audio and visuals are actually up to date with it's release date. Assetto Corsa seriously looks and feels like an unfinished project, not a complete game that sells for full price and has DLC

12483	It's missing some of the most basic features that others have had for over 10 years, Kunos is constantly messing with it, the physics are dreadful, the AI is still too stupid to have a decent race with, the sounds are terrible and require mods to make it sound good, some of the cars are copy pasta (for example, the Mercedes AMG GT3 is just the SLS AMG GT3 underneath), and it has very little base content which requires mods to make it feel like it has some substance to it.  On top of that, Stefano Casillo and teh people who work for him have zero ability to take any kind of criticism, construcive or not, and the fanboys who defend all this crap are some of the most idiotic people I've ever seen.  It's billed as 'Your Driving Simulator', but it sure as hell isn't mine. At least the first 3 letters of the title let you know what this game is.  AC has good graphics though.
12484	this game runs at 32 mothâ¥â¥â¥â¥in bits. i cant find my controler and normally the keybored isnt to bad but i have to alternate from gas to brake to turning with the arrow keys. fake physics missleading graphice â¥â¥â¥â¥ you i want my money back
12485	its not even close to being as good as project cars so buy that instead
12486	Cars feel like crap.   I've been looking for a Forza like game for the PC. And this just isint it.   Can I have my money back?
12487	This is the worst game I've ever played. There's no way to learn how to play it well. it's not exciting, Waste of money. 1/10. it's more boring than a Catholic Liturgy. Do not recomend. I'm a noob, and I don't know how to play well, but I wish I knew some tips or tricks to avoid hitting the wall every time I turn...  
12488	Pretty game, but physics suck for the casual gamer coming from consol, im sure they work great if you have a steering wheel setup, but that not how i enjoy racing games. DO NOT BUY!
12489	I am a new comer to racing games, but compared to Project Cars, this game is not very good.
12490	This simulator has excellent graphics, good force feedback and excellent settings for triple screen I have ever seen. Unfortunately I am still not willing to dedicate myself (and not recommend it now) on it as it feels and behaves as an eternal 'beta'. It is taking too long to really feel as a finished and developed simulator. Although improving tire physics, there is no change in time, no night races, no rain, few selection of tracks. AI behaves only on pre defined 'official' tracks and it is a disaster on any mod installed. Door to door contacts and crashes are still poor.  It is far from Rfactor in terms of online races, accidents and bumping controls, replay, broadcasting tools, AI behavior and mods acceptance. Automobilista is developing really fast and I believe it will take over Asseto as things are going on so far. Other simulators just need to evolve to a newest directX in order to improve graphics and beat Asseto.
12491	Technical difficulties review: Game would load, but can't get to race/ events aka driving. It just says loading and returns back to event selection. I had to ask refund.  Edit: And yes. The resolution was correct.
12492	The game is broken and does not work very well so if it gets an update and get better/fixed i will play again but for now i do not recommend you play this game It may be my computer but it does not work well at all.

12504	feels like im driving on ice, games sucks compared to project cars. dont watse ur money...
12505	On the surface everything about AC sounds great. Nice looking DX11 graphics, amazing dream cars. However when you spend enough time with the game and get past the initial gloss the cracks start to appear.  When it comes to the content of the game this area is seriously lacking, there are very few tracks and cars. Also it is strange why the Devâs decided to bulk the game up with filler cars like having multiple lotus elises/exiges and BMW's. I find as well that the street cars in the game are just not very fun to drive and a bit pointless. DLC is a gripe for me as it just gets very tiring that game developers will not include enough content in the first instant and then make you pay for more. For me it somewhat represents a gaming existential crisis. I keep asking myself why do I keep putting more money into something that I donât get enough out of and why am I supporting this financially, when logically I should just walk away from it. The cost of the DLC alone means I could just go buy another sim instead.   AI is akin to driving against basic drones that follow a line, they have no real life to them at all. This is a massive blow to this game, As it becomes not worth racing the AI. Which then leads you to just hotlaping all the time. This takes away a very core element of a sim racing game being a big source of the fun.  Car physics which compared to rfactor 2 are lacking quite a bit. In rfactor 2 the tyre model overall physics are amazing. AC does not come close to rfactor 2 in this regard.  Sounds have improved but are still lack lustre. When you have low quality sounds it takes away a lot of the immersion.  Something I have noticed and other people may have as well is that the scale of the cars and tracks seem to be quite small, which I find weird.   In summary I feel like this game simply has no soul to it. It just has an allure of flash but as the old clichÃ© goes no substance. If you are a hardcore sim racing person who values more the racing experience rather than having dream cars to drive, I would recommend you avoid the game and go for rfactor 2 instead which has loads of free content and is much more of a true to life racing experience and is a lot more fun.

12508	This game is a perfect racing simulator. Good car mechanics, good graphics, good everything. BUT! I think that those developpers are so money oriented that they dare to make not 1, not 2, BUT 3 bloody PORSCHE DLCs. You want a 911 and a Cayman spyder? Well you have to buy two seperate f***** DLCs.   /*/*/*Edit1: I can give it a negative review because of their dlc pricing policy. Since the number of cars in the original version is not much(!)  No laguna seca, no hockenheim ring, no brno circuit, no magny-cours, no circuit paul ricard, no suzuka and so on. This game lacks content. But the physics, mechanics, graphics are great. Renault: no check Dodge: no check Volkswagen: no check That f***** Maserati SUV: check omg such car, much italian, very new.  /*/*/*Edit2: Okay, so if PORSCHE is notorious for their pricing thing, maybe they could add more other brands than PORSCHE, like the examples above. And this still doesn't certify their 3DLC policy. They're not kind with their DLC pricing policy, that's all what I'm trying to say.   /*/*/*PS: I WILL RECOMMEND this game once the amount of content is adequate (tracks, cars)

To put this into context, Automobilista has a similarly lacking interface but it is worth it due to the driving experience and AI. If you want better driving, try Automobilista, iRacing, rFactor or even Project Cars.

12521	So I bought this game with high expectations maybe a bit to high. So when you start up the game you get a really neat short opening movie which got me more excited for the game. But then I went through and had to set up all the controls for my Thrustmaster T150 Racing wheel which was a pain. But I was still excited until I started a event... The HUD layout is very... outdated looking. Graphics are poor. But that is nothing until you find out that the price of the DLC's are more than the game its self. I bought the game with all the Dream car packs dlcs included. I was suprised when I saw how little cars there were. So I will stick to Project cars  BUT if you are the type of person who likes ok graphics,mediocre force feedback, controls that are hard to setup, and dlcs that will make you go bankrupt then this game is for you!

12523	well... I tried to find something good in this game comparing to iracing, rFactor, f1 2016 and project cars and i literally failed.  -graphics (on my taste even iRacing have better graphics) -damage model (hit the wall on 300 kmph and yeah ull get a scratch on ur bumper) -interface (its like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest i ever experienced) -Singleplaer Career (what? I need to get enough points to switch to another 'series'? Lol ok. worst campaign ever) -suspension work  +- Physics are ok. Sometimes weird sometimes bad sometimes good. Bad when it comes to bumps and suspension work good when it comes to slides. FFB helps to feel it but i had MUCH BETTER FFB experience in iRacing FULL MONZA Course for example)  + yeah its cheap. U dont have to pay subscription fee as in iRacing but u still have DLC's to buy. + tracks looks legit  overally i would give 6.5/10. When 10 is unreachable at the corrent state of racing sims 8 is a stronk sims like iracing and 4 is a good arcades.  History: i bought this game once and requested refund. Then i decided to give it another try and i really did but still i dont like it and probably wont play it much  
12524	It's a great simulation of a grey screen because you can't get past the menu  --- update ---  Got the game working but kind of wish I hadn't. There is no sensation of speed, cars are pre-selected for you in career races, it's boring to play, I'm relieved I got it in the sale and didn't pay full price.  Might give it another go if they finish the game off.

12536	Not much to this one. Nearly all the cars are just sports cars you can go out and buy and drive in real life if you want to, I'd like to see a lot more cars that aren't just street cars that are available to buy, and be able to drive some real racing cars that are not able to be bought on the open market. The idea is to be able to drive a car that you couldn't drive in real life, not just drive the same cars in a game you drive in real life, that's just boring.  Graphics are sub par for a modern racing game, the tracks are basically without any texture at all and the cars don't have the details and sharpness of other games in this genre.  I'll wait until the graphics, physics and cars are worth playing and try again.  I wonder when or if the AC team will give the organic shapes some love. The trees and natural features in the game look like old 8 bit crap from days gone by, please do some engine modding to get this fixed, it ruins the realism.

12538	Bought it 3 times and refunded 3 times. Every time i installed it had glitches in menu, everywhere buttons without any labels, non responsive UI, game didnt want to start the free practice sessions because there was no button to start! It might be good if it actually worked..
12539	Horrible controller support. You have to own an Xbox controller or a big expensive steering wheel because nothing else works at all. The devs blatantly lied when they said that any usb input device would work - check the forums - it's literally impossible to get a ps4 controller working.
12540	I'm just not enjoying this game.   I guess it's because I like arcade racers rather than simulators.   The main thing that is ruining this game for me is the menus. They are so frustrating. They are hard to read, not really obvious what each button does and no clue as to what they are by hovering your mouse over them either. I am sure you will get used to them after time but it's little touches like that which are missing. The game just doesn't flow very well and it's the menus that cause this.   The career mode is a bit boring and I just don't feel like I'm having an exciting race.   There is just something missing from the game that makes it less enjoyable than it should. Yes it looks great but the playability and user friendliness is missing.  If you like simulators and enjoy looking and driving around in different kind of cars then this is a good game for that. If you are looking for high action arcade racing with intuitive menus and a great career mode then I would look elsewhere.   I wish I had spent my money on a different kind of racing game now.

12543	I feel like i wasted my money buying this game, i saw such good reviews, saying the handeling was good, so i bought it and i was seriously disappointed, the steering felt so stiff, in a BMW M3, you go 30MPH (it looks about 5MPH) and you start to turn, and the wheels start screeching, and you arent doing anything, in the pagani huyara the steering feels so stiff, i breaked down to 15MPH and start to turn and its stupid, nothing happens you just go off the track, even though you are going slow enough that it feels like you should corner no problem, wasnt for me, which i could return it.

12546	Holding a $45 USD Price, this game is utterly dissapointing. I gave it a fair chance but it failed me and the hype it had built. This game is definitaly not worth the hefty price tag and is a complete waste of money. It has performance issues and UI issues. It's campaign is slow starting and boring. Non of its good reviews lived up to it's claims and match each and every bad review on this game. For a simulator its probably one of the worst; High price tag, good reviews, good previews, but when it comes to playing its complete garbage. I spent 10 hours downloading, Spent $45! USD which is $58.95 AUD and that is ridicoulus. Sure if i didnt like it why did i spend over 2 hours playing? That's because 2 hours isnt enough time to completely make up your mind for a hardcore gamer like me. Such thing enrages me and I'm not a happy camper.
12547	It might be a great game but only for Hardcore racing fans Its impossible to play with a controller (keyboard too ofc) also the BAD UI ughh... Must be amazing with a wheel though  well REFUND!
12548	I'm told that Assetto Corsa is one of the most realistic driving simulators there is. But in my experience, it may be the hardest and least user-friendly driving game I've ever encountered and I really can't recommend it to anyone.

Graphics are horrible compared to most other racing games (I know that graphics don't sell a game, but it doesn't do this game any favours), sounds are weak (not as bad as Gran Turismo, but close), menus/UI are clunky and unintuitive. One good thing is that the driving physics feel responsive and grippy. The game feels like some sort of steam greenlight release never to see it past alpha, but the price tag says 'super serious simulator guys'. I don't recommend it, but if you want a sim racer you might want to check it out.

Also does not scale, if I lower settings to 1920x1080, or whatever the 1280x720 or any other dimension, it just uses a smaller portion of my screen.
12560	The driving is really bad if you don't have a wheel, and the graphics suck too, this looks nothing like the videos. I cranked my graphics as high as they would go and was still always getting well over 100 fps and the game looked Bad. It's impossible to drive well with mouse and keyboard on this game I do not recommend it.

12566	Okay, it's a simulation. Wow, great, so you can only play it with a steering wheel, not a chance with a gamepad (well maybe with all the driving aids on, but there's no simulation in that). There's a very, VERY limited choice of cars, if you want more, you need to buy all the DLCs, but you will still only get different skins for cars you already had. Does it even have good graphics? No. I mean I saw some pretty decent 'ingame' screenshots, but what I'm getting while playing is far from that. Nothing better than MEDIOCRE. Sounds? Pathetic, there's not a single car that sounds even remotely like a real one, engine sounds at low rpm remind me of games I played 20 years ago. Sorry, I had more fun playing GRID Autosport, which might not be a simulation game, but the car choice is better, it's perfectly playable on a gamepad (even DiRT Rally is, and it has a better driving model than AC) and when you crash, you can actually see it on the car. And when talking about dirt rally - that game can be really challenging when playing on gamepad, but you still enjoy it. That doesn't apply in this case.  EDIT: you can get other cars and tracks as mods, of course, but the range of cars included with the game is just too narrow.

12572	Not even close to being worth the price it's sold at. I wouldn't have gotten my money's worth if it cost $20. Limited car list, no vehicle personalization, tuning is miserable, very limited track choice, interface is an atrocity, graphics extremely poor compared to competition. Only upside is the C7R exhaust note. Which is part of a $15(!!!!!!!!) DLC. Save the money, buy NFS Shift and call it a day.
12573	The reason I bought this game is because I heard it was similar to Project Cars. They are often compared and sometimes PC comes out as a winner, sometimes AC. So I decided to give Assetto Corsa a shot after having played Project Cars.  Now I am really dissapointed.  The game just seems amateuristic, menus aren't nice, no controller support in the menus, there's no background music and the graphics (unlike what some people may think) are not good in my opinion. At least not good compared to Project cars. The car models are good, but the environments look really dated, and even with the highest AA settings, there are still quite some jaggies. Also the lighting is better in PC in my opinion.  I did quit the game after 2 races, so maybe I should have given it a little more time, but the races, the career, it all seems so bland and uninteresting.   The gameplay, physics, etc. may be good, but these things really bother me. It looks and feels like an early access racing game from a small, new developer.   Maybe I'm just too spoiled with Project Cars.
12574	0/10 COMPLETE AND UTTER SCAM.
12575	Description: Press any button, and you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! I am not just an arcaderacer who doesn't know how to drive, I would say I am fairly good at driving games, but this game... As raw as it can be, cars don't turn (I have to go around 60 kilometers slower than the same car on Project Cars) and if they turn, it's because they oversteer like crazy, AKA you are going to spin out. Honestly, I probably need a tutorial JUST for this game, but WTF - going STRAIGHT is not an option? Constantly fighting that huge â¥â¥â¥ magnet in the wall of the track trying to suck me into it, cause when VTEC kicks in yo, you're going to have a bad time

12591	Terrible. Absolutely terrible, graphics are bad, physics are bad, rough translations are bad, car selection is bad, user interface is bad and what is it with every car bouncing around for no reason?
12592	Would love to say this game is worth every penny, and it used to be but since the last update its worth it if you like playing with menus because thats all you get , the actual racing wont load
12593	I've played iRacing, bought AC and Dirty Rally and now pCars. Initially I was put off by the negative reviews of pCars and bought AC and later DR. Dissappointed with the adapted Vive experience of these two sims, I bought pCars yesterday with native Vive support. Purely with the Vive mind, I was totally surprised by pCars. It feels and plays great in VR. AC and others should be ashamed of themselves for siding with Rift. Great job, pCars! You gave me my best VR sim driving experience on my Vive. If you're like me looking for the best VR racing sim on the Vive, I do not recommend AC.
12594	 Early Access Review
12595	I dont like this game  i give you 1 reasson why  i expected to be a game like grid autosport or other race games  but i was wrong and this is a simulator where you can change everything what you want.   This is not something for people who play grid autosport or other race games. This game is very advanced and very different what you expected.   Still, maybe im gonna try this game a few months later but for now i stick with other games like grid and nfs.  but this is for me, if you like simulators, like grand turismo, then this game is a must have. For me its not a must have at the moment.
12596	How can a racing sim be so nearly good yet so far off because of a very poor, unintuitive user interface, ridiculously over the top visual effects and some very basic things missing in car handling? It seems to me that Kunos is somehow trying to compete with the visuals of Project Cars but the result is a complete mess of over-the-top lighting which on any setting makes the sky look blindingly bright but most of the interior of cars so dark you simply cannot see the needles or gauges.  The contrast is so high that with almost any manual exposure setting the track (from the cockpit) is unclear, especially with the sun glaring at you and the other cars look so dark the only way to see them clearly is to up the exposure so everything else is literally blinding. Even with post processing off it is still way too contrasted, and cutting down your monitor contrast so the whole screen is a bland, washed out mess hardly helps. This attempt to make the sim look more appealing has backfired badly. There are some post process mods which slightly improve things but the fundamental flaw is still there.  Controls ----------  The Force Feedback is potentially good but the general wheel/control adjustments are poorly explained and poorly implemented. For example, just a tiny increment in speed sensitivity grossly restricts the steering movement unless you are going very slowly, which means there is not enough lock to catch a slide. On the other hand if you switch speed sensitivity off you can barely turn the wheel in a fast, straight section because the steering then becomes too sensitive. When I say the speed sensitivity control is too coarse, you have to understand that a miniscule 0.02 increase in speed sensitivity makes the steering impossible to get full lock unless you are so slow that it cannot possibly catch a slide.  Understeer ---------------  Some cars are decently designed with reasonably convincing balance, but many of the default cars (Lotus Elise) have terminal understeer. In fact I could not even get the tail out in 2nd gear on full lock with full throttle! Yet the Elise is notorious as a tail happy car.  Other cars - particularly the Lotus 25 in Dreampack 3 - have an inexplicable and quite unrealistic tendency to wander while going dead straight. This interpretation is something cooked up but it is not accurate at all. In fact single seat cars of this era were, and are, not unstable in a straight line and the assumption that they are is a complete myth. Other basic flaws with the Lotus 25 is that the 'auto-blip' to match revs to a gear change-down is insufficient so changing down results in the rear wheels locking and the car spinning. Why have an 'auto-blip' if it does not work? The Lotus 49 also demonstrates an inexplicable tendency to wander while in a straight line.  Sounds ----------  These are mostly good and in some cases, very good. However some cars have poorly implemented transition between power on and power off. You can hear the 'join'. See GT Legends for absolutely brilliant sound design.  Shadows -----------  AC has the worst shadowing in any sim I have seen. Just to indicate how bad it is, GT Legends, a decade old title, has much better shading and much better shadows, and at maximum detail hardly impacts on frame rates and stability. The shadows in AC are a horrible collection of annoying and disturbing, over-contrasted, jagged, swimming and shimmering blobs of darkness. They, and the reflections, when turned up to a half-decent level, ruin frame rates and impact badly on computer performance. I recommend using the frame rate restrictor unless you have a stella computer system. I lock mine at 50 fps and this improves the stuttering which is evident particularly at Brands Hatch (Dreampack 3).  AI ---  I'm told the ai has somewhat improved with Version 1.5. Well, in that case I wonder what it was like in earlier versions. The AI cars regularly wander way off the track yet carry on as though they were being driven perfectly.  Good parts ------------  It's not all bad. Some of the cars are well presented and drive reasonably well. When the FF is adjusted it can be quite convincing. This, and the ai, still does not approach the quality of rFactor 2 and rFactor 1. There is great potential here for a sim to be a pleasure to drive and there are many qualities which with sensible presentation (The dire UI needs an overhaul) and concentrating on the driving experience rather than things like over-the-top lighting effects does reep rewards.  The tracks that are included are quite well done, but there are too few of them for a full priced release. Missing out of the box are some classic tracks which should have been included, although so far the DLC is at least reasonably priced.  Maybe this sim will improve further. It could be so good if Kunos looked at the basic flaws and stopped trying to make AC compete with Pcars. I fear that might not happen however, at is looks as though recent updates are preparing this sim for arcade use with xbox etc. That would be a pity as AC has the potential to be a great simulator, and already the modding support hugely surpasses that for rFactor 2.  I'd be happy to recommend this title if Kunos pay more attention to the fundamentals of making a good racing sim which at the moment are trumped by a seeming obsession with grossly impractical lighting, poor shadowing and unnecessary bling at the expense of a convincing driving experience.
12597	Not arcadey enough, takes too much time to learn.
12598	 Early Access Review
12599	I find this game frustrating, being rammed off the road in a simulation game just seems far to 'arcady' to me. Very irritating.
12600	If you play Dirt Rally and want to keep your settings, don't play this game. I installed it and set up the wheel settings to get it working and it completely destroyed months of tunig for Dirt Rally. The game was OK but again I am back to Dirt Rally. NOT RECOMMENDED
12601	No HTC Vive support. Got my HTC Vive and G27 sitting here, can't make use of it.  There may be many positive things about this game, but for me personally, no proper VR support kills the game and I thus do not recommend this game to anyone else who has the HTC Vive.
12602	good racing game... a RWD having bad understeer and a AWD behaving like a RWD with a very lively rear end.  My only point of reference is my driving experience and my years of playing Grand Turismo. By that view I would say the simulation isn't quite on point with that I was expecting and as such, I cannot recommend it as a Racing Sim.
12603	In short - if you want a game which is realistic in almost every regard, this is for you. If you want a 'racing game' you will be disappointed, as it's truly awful for the casual user.   There's no denying that this game looks amazing. Running at maximum resolution and detail the cars look absolutely stunning and with some screenshots you'd be hard pushed to decide whether it was the real thing under some artsy camera filter.  I am a huge car fan, and after getting a taste for it in NFSU2 more than a decade ago, I've been searching for a game where it was possible to customise your car. Modify, upgrade and tweak and then test the difference on the track. This game allows you to adjust practically any feature of your car you could in real life, and the descriptions of what you're altering (camber, return rates etc) will be handy for anyone who's not as into cars.  However it falls into the same trap that all 'technically correct' racing games do. They forget that when you're driving a car through a pad, or through a keyboard there is no feel. You can't feel the back end slipping, the suspension doing it's job or any number of other cues that you'd get driving in real life. This game tries to faithfully recreate real life handling, but seems to forget in doing so that it's supposed to be a game. I don't want complete clown, cartoon handling but at the same time I don't want to learn to drive over again except this time without the aid of any feedback from the vehicle and based on what some programmer thinks physics is like. It's simply not enjoyable - I haven't got hours upon hours to practice getting a feel for it. I just wanted some a game with excellent graphics and lots of cars to play around with - not someone's attempt at creating the worlds most beautiful, technically accurate but fundamentally dull physics simulator.   
12604	Pros  amazing support for wheel and all accessories inc 3 pedals and shifter. looks good career seem big  Cons A.I is hard A.I is better than you A.I cant be turned down unless using file manipulation  i played this game for an hour. setting up wheel, gear shifter and pedals took 10 mins. i spent a bit of time in time trial getting use to the cars. i bought the dlc just to get my fave car The AE86. Once i'd done in time trial i moved over to career and thats where everything fell to â¥â¥â¥â¥.   The A.I is amazing. I cant keep up i did 3 races coming 8th twice and quit once i got lapped in the last one. With no way to turn A.I down a few pegs to make it fun i gave up.   
12605	This game honestly feels like it should still be in early access. Vehicle models are nice but sounds are messed up. Plays absolutely horrible on a controller (plays kinda ok but who have to spend waaay too much time finding what works) if you don't feel like hooking up a wheel (making it pretty much necessary). Lack of music really makes the game seem stale. Car roster is very limited same with the tracks. Overall i would say buying this on sale of less than 60% is a waste of your money. I'm going back to Gran Turismo.
12606	 Early Access Review
12607	if you wanna buy a race game this is not he one you need it is not even close to project cars 1. i dont know how to bring up my graphics and its 32 bit 2. i feel like playing an alphe because fps sucks even with titan x 3. standart grapihcs sucks.  so if you want a simulator game project cars is amazing:)
12608	When Forza Apex gets wheel support on pc this game will be obsolete. Low detail tracks (even after they improved them), screenshots look better than the game itself, many car variants are just copy-paste so not many cars overall, no fun in career mode, the game is just a big practice mode without real racing feeling.  If you want a complete racing game get Automobilista or Forza Apec rather than this expensive physics simulator.
12609	What a waste of money. This game presents itself very nicely but fails to work. Upon selecting car and track, the whole game just returns back to the selection screen when hitting 'start race'. Marvelous work.
12610	this game is aiiiight. Project cars is better...
12611	On ultra graphics, looks nothing like the pictures and videos. PS2 level Graphics and Audio at best. Racing wheel support is nice, but not much of a game to use it with. Constant gliches and errors, and general buggyness.. Absolutely should not buy. 4/10.
12612	I Wasted Â£15 buying this garbage, career mode i absolute s**t and it is not good with a gamepad at all. AI is terrible they just smash into you and you lose control of the car, then they speed off with no way of catching them and they take the corners perfectly without any mistakes. I will not be buying this for console either. Save your money and dont waste it on this rubbish like i did.
12613	This would be a great game if it weren't so full of bugs. pretty much unplayable.
12614	 Early Access Review
12615	ok, so time has passed, I have an i7 now, graphics card is a G980 and everything looks great(ish). Development has progressed and the game is GA. So I thought why not take another look. I failed to configure the G25 steering wheel properly (so input of 30 degree gets interpreted as 360 degree, I got interrupted in my off-line practice session by the game trying to connect to the internet after running for 15 minutes (no, not steem, that game did) and ontop of that I had 0 fun.  I am not sure if its fair to call this a real issue (although these are issues for me), but I can't be asked with it. The menus are badly organised and poorly implemented, the automatic steering configuration stops working when I try to center the wheel, The driving is completly unrealistic (I can drive a lotus elise around Imola for real, but fail to do so in the game) and I have come to the conclusion it is just nmot for me.  I am sure someone will point out something obvious like steering calibration, but I tried that in the game and it failed. No doubt this is all my fault again, but I am a user who paid money for this. I wish i hadn't.  ---- original review  It seems that the trend of early releases continues, in line with other toxic internet trends. If you are looking for an enjoyable experience this game is n0t it. If you are looking for quality, look somewhere else. Aparently releasing limited, buggy code is ok. Asking for money for this is just laughable, yet I fell for it. Simply put, stay away unless you want to pay for testing privaledges, because that is what you are becoming, a paying tester. The driving is sluggish, the code is buggy as hell (I keep getting video setting alert from windows, that interfere with the code so everything stops working, there is no code optimisation to create a high performance race game - at least my 8 core computer, NVDIA 2GB, 8GB of RAM are not fast enough to make it past basic settings). To boot there is no racing, just trying to get good lap times. It is still a mess, and that is ok for a .5 version, but pleease don't make people pay for playing it. If you can't fund a development program, don't start it.

12617	While this game seems to have an avid fanbase, and lots of people who swear by it, I can only speak for my own experience.  I bought this game a long time ago, and I bought it because it had VR support. Imagine, a beautiful racing game with VR support. At the time, that was fascinating.  What I didn't know was that they had 'temporarily' removed VR support from the game, in the same week that I'd bought it. This meant that I would never get the chance to try it in VR, as they never added it back in, even months and months later.  I can't tell you how the game works, how pretty it is, or how great the physics are, I've never actually played it.   My 'not recommended' is simply because they advertized it as 'SteamVR' when I bought it, and it's never actually worked for me.  Is the game good? I've heard it is. But, for me, this will remain on my library list as a sad reminder of a VR experience I was so excited to try, and never got the opportunity to.  :*(

Once in a race it doesn't have the right feel. It's like your not really connected with the car.   Very disappointed.   But that all said, they have got the graphics and sound working really well.
12624	Are you â¥â¥â¥ kidding me!!!!I paid 44 euros forthis and it has like 15 cars????If you buy forza for a bit more you get around 200 cars and if you buy need for speed you get around 50....i know it has mods an sh*** but still it could have at least 60 offical cars.I mean its a simulator after all so i espected more.

12627	TL:DR - It had frame rate problem even on my 10k pc. Sad.  I bought this game to drift on my race wheel, which worked great! It had tons of settings, but that game frame rate was just horrible. At that time I had a 760 GTX overclocked and a I5 4670k overclocked, 8gb of ram and I was getting a max of 30 fps on all setting. Forcing the game to 32 bit helps but still was getting a max of 30-32 fps. Fast forward about 1 year, I purchased a VR headset and wanted to try it on this game. I also upgrade my pc over that year or so. I am running a 980 ti and the same I5 and 16gb of ram plus 23gb of page memeory on my Intel 720 ssd (CRAZY FAST) and still getting around 35 fps which sure is an improvement but that still not playable for me, and vr sucks below 90fps  Extra info - This was done on solo play with no AI, I did change mirror relfection a known fps eater and still nothing help, was on lowest, medium and highest setting I could get still poor fps.  I'd not recommand this game for any price other then if it was free or below 10$ and you are will to play at 30 fps.

12632	This game is one of the worst game i've ever come across, the user interface is made for the developers that made the game, you litterally have to use a few hours to get known to the controls and settings, there's NO tutorial what so ever. Time attack is EASY to get gold on, the AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ridiculous, they have 50% more engine power than you and their movement is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid. please stop making â¥â¥â¥â¥ like this.  Edit: also charging this amount of money, then adding expansive DLC that add such small amount of content.
12633	The only 'game' i've ever asked for a refund on Steam, this thing needs to be advertised as a physics sim and not as a game, whoever designed the UI has zero idea about designing an interface for a videogame, the people who made AC seems to be pretty strange to videogames, let alone racing videogames, nothing on the menu is where it should be and you can't use a gamepad on the settings, menu or start screen, it forces you to use mouse and keyboard like this was 1997, the software also performs like crap giving no more than 30 fps on a machine that can easily max actual racing games like project cars at silky smooth 60 FPS.  This thing is not a game it's more like a software to test and tune expensive PC racing wheels, if you want an intuitive racing game, got project cars or wait for forza to be released on PC.
12634	Not something you can just pick up and play..

12649	Tried the VR support again, for the first time in a long time. It's the main reason I bought his game. It still doesn't work at all on my DK2. The game took about 8 minutes to load a race and then crashed my video driver and I had to kill the task.  Don't buy it for VR on the expectation that VR support is 'WIP' as there doesn't seem to have been any progress in a long time. Can't speak to the rest of the game.

12652	 Early Access Review
12653	After playing the game for over an hour, I personally think that some of the cars don't handle like they should and it makes the game very difficult to play.   When I bought the game, it cost Â£29.99, which I think is too much for what it is. I am aware the price has now gone down but even now I think it is still too much.  However, the graphics are pretty good but overall I just feel it isn't worth the money it asks for, mainly due to the fact that some cars are pratically uncontrollable with my G27 and the game is just the same thing over and over again.  Tried to refund this game but steam decided not to let me.... :(

12675	I had to correct my initial review. This game is a good DRIVING game. It has a good stack of various cars available from the start, very accurate tracks and beautiful engine. Its also modable, so there is a lot of 3rd party content out, some even have AAA quality.   The AI is very bad. It is either very slow or alien fast. Their speed is very inconsistent, they go very fast through one corner and very slow in the next one. They will never(!) race you. Put your car beside them and they will let you pass, they will never try to pass you back.  The multiplayer is not ready for release. The netcode is terrible, small contacts will often cause huge crashes. There is no flag system. The damagemodel does not make any sense(your front windscreen shatters, when someone hits you from behind).  Conclusion: It is a good driving game, nothing more. If you want to get some seroius racing done, wether online or offline(against ai), then this is NOT the game for you. Better stick to GSC or iRacing for that matter.  Why did click 'not recommended'? This game is advertised as a racing sim, but it isn't. There are a lot of core features missing (flagsystem, proper racestarts, rollingstarts, penalties,multiplayer ui, etc.). Last year the Nordschleife was announced to be released in fall 2014. Its not here, but they already annouced additional content. Despite being no longer 'Early Access', this game is not finished and for the current price of 44,99â¬, I cannot recommend it.
12676	This game, however awesome the first few days, is stuck in development for AGES. And now they are finally adding some content, theyÂ´re making people -who were kind enough to actually BUY the unfinished game (not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheap either)- PAY for it? They must be having a laugh out there. Absolutely outrageous. Never buying anything from this rank amateurs again.
12677	I do not think this is a good game. I do not consider it as a simulator, it does not has race flags, you can't start in first gear, the UI is horrendous, and the pitstop is more than worst. The AI is really bad and both circuits and cars are few.  They started to launch DLC to cost the console version, and doesn't look like they will add more content. The current price of 45â¬ It's a steal.  Worth 10â¬ if you need to purchase heach DLC at 8â¬, don't pay more.
12678	Mix: As of March 13, 2015. It is so hardcore that an average player will be spinning all time, they need to improve the sensibility of the throtle control for gamepad users as the R3E has done.   Pros:  Handling is good and steering is perfect Force feedback is excellent,  Cockpit view is the only that gives the feeling of speed Graphics are not bad (Raceroom and SHIFT2 have better)  Cons: - A lot of cheating, Cheaters manage to bypass the checksum file -Yellow flag rules are not enforced, some players overtake under yellow flags or crashes into a player that is careful because of the accident ahead and/or at the next turn - Lapped cars under a blue flag are not forced to slow down and yield/ give way or they should make them invisible - There is not a cause a coallition penalty system - There is not a reputation points, that it could be linked a driver with the number of race incidents and/or penalties that could help filter/prevent bad drivers from joinning clean racing servers  -Very limited car selection -Very few tracks/circuits -During qualifying putting all wheels off the kerb and/or white line at some corners do not disallow the lap,  -There is not ping cap for online multiplayer races. it is difficult to avoid laggy players on track - Servers badly configured, it should be 8 mins of Qualifying and 6 lap race the lower standard, practice should be assigned for offline single player. -During qualifying in the out lap 2 wheels go over the white line, and then on the 1st hotlap, it gets disallowed. -Sometimes, online racing will display a 'WARNING CPU OCUPPANCY' making everthing laggy and frozen -Schedule/table sector times are missing, it could be helpful to see where time is being lost -Lack of tracks/circuits on public servers -Game pad - sensibility need futher adjustments throttle and brakes (check Raceroom Racing Experience) -Brakes Damage setting is very fragile, which makes the game unplayable. -Lack of more filtering options on online servers lobby -Online Multiplayer is unbalanced a lot of cheater manage to by pass the sumcheck file -Breaking is not precise and it feels laggy.  -Engine sounds needs more development. (Raceroom, SHIFT 2 and Dirt 2 have better sound quality) -Sometimes sound is lost during gameplay  -Chase camera jumps and shakes alot even after adjustment.  -Lack of feel of speed, it is not accurate in the other camera views, except cockpit view
12679	I would give Asseto Corsa a passing grade, the multi player sever setup is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. The days that you had to setup a server to game like this has long passed!!!! The menu's are setup poorly.  THE BEST THING TO DO WITH THIS GAME IS TO DELETE IT !!!!!!!
12680	game is terrible with a pad awesome with a sterring wheel game is over rated , menus are dull no music feels unpolished . its unispiring stuff. the game suffers from the syndrome of *we have a bit of a cack game so weel make the handling over the top to account for it* some cars feel good some are shocking. get pcars when it comes . cant wait to unistall this 'gt' of this generation
12681	Very disappointed.....worst online multiplayer system I can remember in years....its ancient and clunky. The game looks great, but I was really let down. I'd suggest saving your money unless you're into hard-core realistic simulators. I was looking for something more like Gran Turismo and this fell way short. Pretty game though... :P
12682	5 months after the release of the full version, it still isn't possible to control the menus with a gamepad or racing wheel. That's just pure lazyness, and can not be excused. This game is meant to be played with a wheel, and while I do have a fancy wireless keyboard with touchpad, it's annoying as hell having to grab it after each race.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great racing game, and the physics as well as the force feedback (G27) are the best I've ever seen. But releasing payed DLC when you haven't even solved the most basic UI issues just screams for a bad review.  If you're a racing game / simulation enthusiast and own a decent wheel, grab it while it's on sale, but I can not recommend this at full price.
12683	 Early Access Review
12684	hate it
12685	The game is realistic, but the grapichs and tracks makes the game boring very fast.
12686	Version 1.9 -  The Graphics:  Porsche's... amazing, but the tweeks to the Audio in the game ruins the inclusion of these cars.   The Audio:  Wow! its Horrible now! what are they doing to this game? During play, its ok, but it sure lost something with these 'improvements' 'tweaks' theyre doing. What a shame.  The Replays:  Dynamically adjust from 16 ms/60 fps or 33 ms/30 fps, its a jarring and ugly transition.  To fix this, Uncheck 'Full Screen Rendering' in the Display Options.  The Audio during replays, sounds OFF... and very odd at times. It was more intense, directional and immersive in 1.8  Version 1.8 -  Assetto Corsa is shaping up to be the best Racing Game on any platform. Each update shows improvement.
12687	this game is bad dont waste ur money on a dumb game like this yes it looks nice but thats the only + for this game   driving feel swampy and all cars somhow seem to be hovering above track. also all cars lean over a lot as do they all seem to have major understeer.  hopefully they get to fix it cause the game it has potential   a lot off nice cars altho id like to see even more special cars  car brands i miss are lamborghini, tvr, lancia, and there surely wil be even more i didnt mention  and you can use difrent kinda controllers stil the settings keep messing up  steeringspeed as steering angel the game has also lag no propher replays â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car setups  fwd tend to understeer rwd tend to oversteer ai drives flawless at unreal speeds  even the feeling of speed has total lack when you drive 180 kmh it stil feels like 40 kmh  also cars dont steer and real life cars like youre granny has are faster around the track then those cars they stuffed in here !!!!!!!!
12688	I have to give this game a thumbs down for the fact that it will not load regularly. Since purchasing the game on March 24, 2015, I have not been able to get the game to play consistently. I have an open thread going on AC's support forum but nothing seems to work for my situation. I have reinstalled, updated, refreshed, and tried everything on their FAQ page and the issue still isn't corrected.   http://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/wont-start-through-steam-or-desktop.22672/ 
12689	was a backer and well they now want to milk me again to play or i should say as some think this is ok ... to add new cars  way too soon so to you a goodbye ...
12690	I give up. This game has so much *potential*... the developers put an amazing amount of work into making the physics right and the handling great.  But all that effort is wasted, poured out like water on the ground, because the AI is horrible. Pole Position, from 1983, had better AI than this game. Every race you enter, you'll restart a dozen times trying to make it around the first corner without being run off the road or spun out by a clueless AI driver and their monomania to be exactly on the racing line, even if you're already there (and ahead of them). One touch from the AI car, and you go spinning down the track, while they proceed uninhindered.  If that wasn't bad enough, the penalty system is an insane joke. If you exit a corner too fast and drift a bit too far over a curb, you are suddenly 'cutting' the track. So you have to slow down for 10 seconds. As you watch the clock tick down, and your opponents speed past, the clock resets itself back to 10 if you accidentally touch a control. The upshot is that if you drive one pixel too far over a curb, the race is over and you must restart.  AI drivers, on the other hand, are blissfully unaware of these penalties, and will drive over the same spot that gave you a penalty and suffer no ill effects.  I'm amazed that the developers would spend so much time an effort on a game, and then ignore these fatal flaws. All of these things have been pointed out, repeatedly and often, in the comments, but nothing has changed.  This game is unplayable. Worse, its not fun.
12691	I primarily bought this game to drive the Nordschleife, which I now don't want to pay another 15 Euro for. NO car handles that crappy. They all drive like â¥â¥â¥â¥. Understeer or oversteer to the extreme no matter what you do. Waste of money.
12692	Great game.  But you will never see it became a real final version game, It will always be in a kind of beta state. No weather changes, online mode is very poor... things like that.   R$90 On that sh..it ! The menu of the game crashs all the time!!! If you wanna host a online server you Â´ll have use a external software, extremely difficult to use, and I have never see it working.  There are worried about making more DLC and new sales, even with the game as incomplete and full of bugs  Consider the actual state if youÂ´ll buy it. But is an awesome racing simulator, maybe the best one.
12693	I expected so much about this game and it really disapointed me :(. Dont buy this game for 50 dollars, theres nothing much to do in it, rare updates, lots of buggs and small amount of cars..... If you like racing games definetly get The Crew....
12694	Current state 6.5/10.  I bought this game on sale ($20) and was a little uneasy at first because  there wasn't a demo  I couldn't find the demo and I almost never spend that much on games (praise GabeN), in the end, only worth what I payed.  The developers inconsistant, but it has a great fanbase (including rFactor, iRacing and LFS) who develop maps, liveries and cars (aprox. a LOT of maps and 40 cars released but HUNDREDS in development).  The stock game has 31 cars and 13 tracks (though only ~15 unique cars due to racing variants).  At this moment, the game is not easy to play with a 360 controller but I use a G27 racing wheel and it is good.  The physics are OK but are pretty inconsistent and the cars are pretty low polly, the only real beauty in the game is the shaders.  Pros: - Good simulator - Beautiful looking game - Good community  Cons:  - UI can be difficult to learn and still lacks 'easy' navigation - No keyboard mapping in-game yet (though I'm not sure if you can change the config's) - HUGE CPU load with AI at the start of races (my 4.5GHz 3770K runs @ 95%) causing 3FPS for roughly 5 seconds - Unintelligent AI, they know you're there but will hit you in turns - THERE NEEDS TO BE IN GAME CONTROL/VIDEO/PROFILE EDITING, I do not want to have to wuit the race just to change the 'chnage view' button.  Overall 6.5/10 - I had to rewrite my review to give the game a much lower score... The developers hardly release anything and when they did it was DLC, there are barely any tracks, all the cars that come with the vanilla don't match up in races so 1v1 can be very difficult, no native servers so good luck finding one in your area with decent ping and anyone in it... The price is absolutely stupid and 100% would not buy it for half that. AT MOST the game is worth $30 including future potential, the devs always say they are working on new content or are signing manufacturers, BUT IT NEVER COMES...
12695	After an initially positive review (made during Early Access) it has been all downhill after 1.0. (a reminder of why Early Access titles shouldn't be seriously reviewed, I've learned my lesson). It seems the goal in the physics and force feedback department since launch has been to make the game increasingly less serious. Then again, how serious can a 'racing simulator' be taken when there are so many missing features that decent racing is pretty much impossible?  There are so many missing features that this game still feels very much like an Early Access game.  No enforced flag rules. No pit stops. No Races longer than 10 laps with AI because the AI is too stupid to add more fuel.  Longer races are impossible anyway because no pit stops. Did I mention it's a racing sim with NO PIT STOPS!!?? Multiplayer is a broken pile plagued with net code issues and so many missing features that serious league use isn't possible.  What we have here, then, is a somewhat pretty (if you can ignore the terrible aliasing even with the highest levels of AA forced on in the drivers) car physics sandbox for hot lapping and monkeying around with mods. Funnily enough, none of this has stopped Kunos from asking for money for 2 (soon to be three) DLC packs. And nothing stops the parade of fanboys who are ready to bully the hell out of anyone who dare utter a single negative syllable about the game. Seriously, the community behind this game sucks. They have become not much better than a gaggle of Call Of Duty squeakers.  Lesson learned. I shall never invest in another Early Access title. What sounds good in theory has become an excellent way for developers to get paid to break promises. If you like racing, don't waste your money.
12696	When the race its loading it return to the main menu.
12697	So dissapointed in this title.  The dlc was just pure moneymilking from the devs, the content never delivered on what they said in the pre-orders.  Support for it has been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, to non-existant.  Multiplayer is the worst racing experience I've had ever.  edit: originally I had said it was good and recommended it, it's a good game, it just didn't deliver and leaving a lot to modders isn't the way to go.
12698	Can'T start a race
12699	Somehow it's just feeling wrong for me, but I can't say why.  Graphics and stuff are really good, but the gameplay could be just better.   
12700	It's a fantastic sim but Kunos *still* hasn't added native Vive VR support.  Come on Kunos. Turn that No recommendation back into a yes.
12701	It's an ok driving simulator but the car physics are unsatisfying.They look kind of unrealistic.The graphics are ok but not really anything special.It gets boring after a certain period of time.
12702	The game is amazing, superb. More cars and we are up and running   *EDIT* The inclusion of DLC for most cars and tracks with barely any updates otherwise has made me thing twice about recomending this game to anyone
12703	in 2014 this was the best driving experience going, great FFB and driving feel with a few holes in the racing experience. Sadly those holes still remain whilst the FFB and driving feel have gone backwards since August 2015 there's been a sharp decline in quality and standard simulation features that have been in racing simulations for decades now are absent, such as stalling your engine, overheating the engine or brakes, false starts, pit stops, even tyre expansion is not simulated.   On the plus side there's a lot of content for hotlaps, many cars that driving in real life would be a dream, outside of hotlapping these cars there's really not a lot on offer for single player as the often broken career mode follows nothing remotely resembling a real life championship and the AI at anything other than full track grip are unable to stay on track, whilst the multiplayer side has been sadly woeful for a long time with pings needing to be much lower to avoid comical crashes and lag events, and even then the crashes are still anything but realistic.  It's very hard to see a positive future for this title unless there is major attitute changes by the developers themselves as repeadted constructive critiques of these issues on their own forums has led to multiple bans to members shining light on these issues...  Bottom line for Assetto Corsa is do not take the tagline 'Your Racing Simulator' seriously, you will be sadly disappointed... If you want to test drive some high end road cars on a track all by yourself, then this might be for you... Otherwise, check out one of the many alternatives...
12704	This is for deleting the modding forum.
12705	It could be a good game... Not the best one, but good. But it's not even good. Because Ubisoft. Uplay? Check. Microtransactions? Check. Season pass that don't include all DLCs? Check. Multiplayer that was added after all DLCs? Check. Most players just moved on already. Also the game has much worse optimisation than Trials Evolution, a lot less stable and so on. Just be aware that you might not be able to launch it at all because reasons.  The main problem is that Trials Fusion isn't exactly the most creative game... It's just another sequel just like Ubisoft likes it - bland unispiring game with exactly the same visuals and gameplay with a bunch of gimmicks and extensive marketing campaign on top.  Trials Evolution was just better game overall. It was just that - complete package without gimmicks, a really great and all round polished game in which developers cleary put their love and soul. And Trials Fusion is just a second-rate game that only exists to get your money, Ubi-business as always.
12706	Please take time to read the whole review...  Don't get me wrong, by itself Trials Fusion is a decent game - Great graphics, great scenery and keeps the elements of its predecessors without changing too much. However, as a person who has dedicated over 120 hours into Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I must say that Fusion is pretty underwhelming compared to it.  First of all, there are significantly fewer levels in this game than there are in TEGE - it took me at least 20 hours to get the medal tally required to unlock the platinum medals, but in Fusion it only took me 4 hours. It definitely felt like a step backwards in content.  This leads to the next point - Ubisoft decided that in order for us to get more levels, we'd have to fork out money for a season pass. That's right, they took our beloved Trials franchise and decided to include DLC in it. It definitely feels like a dog move against us.  Lastly, they decided to leave out the most essential feature when they released this game - online multiplayer! And only this year they decide they're finally going to release it? Pretty crap if you ask me.  Final verdict - If you have played Trials Evolution Gold Edition for a while and feel like playing some new, different levels, buy this game when it's on sale, as if you ignore all of its flaws it's a pretty good game. If you have never played a trials game before, buy Trials Evolution Gold Edition as it is a lot more fun to play than this game.
12707	In my opinion this game stands on its own as a Trials game, but there are a few things that I hate about it and force me to not recommend it. First up is Uplay. Everyone hates Uplay.   There are never any players online, so there goes that whole section of gameplay... there's never anybody to play with.  The DLC is just a huge money grab. The game by itself doesn't have enough content to justify the $19.99 price tag. I paid it and expected a lot... I got a little with the offer to pay more to get tracks that should have come with the game. That extra $19.99 for the season pass seems steep, because it is. $40 for a 'complete' game that doesn't have much depth or the replayability of the older Trials games is a rip off. If the DLC (which should have come with the game anyways) was included in the original price, I would be more apt to recommend it.  Screw Ubisoft for being so greedy, and for forcing Uplay on the innocent.
12708	This game worked for a while, now it crashes on startup. Ubisoft support is terrible, all the recommendations given where not only worthless but wrong. Uplay sucks. And the business model with bad and overpriced dlc is the cherry on the top. Don't buy from ubisoft, vote with your dollar.
12709	i think it's pretty damn crappy that you can buy the season pass and yet they still withold content from you. although, admittedly, said content is pretty f'ing stupid. and i only know this because the awesome max edition was on, like 80% discount for a very short time when it came out, so i bought it for one of my other pc's.  other than that, it's an ok game, i guess. worthwhile at 75% discounted price. notwithstanding that, i advise against purchasing this game because there's an unbelievable amount of recycling in the race courses.  and, quite naturally, this game, which the customer pays for outright, has been infected with the dreaded microtransactions which were supposed to be reserved strictly for the free2play business model. very, F'ing, shady.  also, i unlocked almost everything in this game in about fifteen hours of play.  Red Lynx has sold their souls to ubisoft and i won't be giving them any more of my money.  in case you feel the urge to contradict me on any of these points, don't waste your time, i'm not here for conversation.   this section was provided for me by steam to state my opinion and i won't stand for anyone to come here and offer me their review of my review. so, you can keep your critiques to yourselves and simply move along.
12710	I am heartily disappointed with this game. The previous two Trials games were great; full of content, great level design, simple but effective layout/gameplay/difficulty levels.   Trials Fusion offers an infuriatingly bad soundtrack, a forced 'story' and setting, an SSX style 'tricks' dealy that is hardly utilised, a redundant multiplayer mode etc etc  Not to mention the fact that the game is largely hidden behind a season pass paywall. That means Â£32 for all of the content. Most of which is probably terrible.   What a load of paywall bull***t!   Also: Uplay.   Thanks for nothing Ubisoft and associated sell-outs.
12711	as much as I love the the Trials series, I can't recommend this game to people. I'll play the living hell out of it because I'm obsessed with the series, but it takes a very specific kind of person to really squeeze 50 dollars of play value out of this (base game + all DLC).  Ubisoft really did some damage to the series and this game hardly stands well against previous games in the series. I still believe Trials HD is the best in the series, but that's more a personal opinion. I would recommend checking out the previous game, Trials Evolution Gold Edition, rather than settling on Fusion. Although the multiplayer is still rather empty, it's still a more down-to-earth title that keeps a lot of the aesthetics that make the Trials series so great. Plus it has way more tracks in the base game than Fusion does.
12712	Buying this game is like dating.  Date One: She's Kinda fun. Bit pricey, doesn't hang around long. Date Two : She tells you she wants to get serious. (Better fork out for season pass). Date Three : She tells you she is not ready to commit (Better buy some newly added suprise dlc to keep her happy) Date Four : She tells you she wants to see other people (reduces price for everyone else) Date Five : Wants to get married, and take half your income. (adds microtransactions)  Edit: One year later: You try to reconnect to her. But she hangs up on you. (Uplay servers won't connect anymore).
12713	When the game would suffer any drop in FPS it decides to run in Slow motion. Making it unplayable. Bugs are riddled throughout, Crashing frequently. Being forced to use uPlay you will also be plagued with another service that does not function. and thus removes a loarge proportion of the game as uPlay is unreliable. You must also then wait at every option for the game to attempt to connect to Ubisoft, wasting you time as you are told what you already know, that ubisoft is unavailable.  On top of the game being unplayable for a lot of people, The Deluxe edition with the ason pass has not been transfering across with Uplay, meaning that the Season pass unlocks are still Locked.  Do not buy untill the game is fixed.
12714	This is a poor console port just like that last trials you have to disable SLI to run it. The game stutters if it goes below 60fps due to engine limitations.  I cant recommend this game untill they fix those basic issues.
12715	-Bad Optimization. -Uses Uplay launcher. -Slow Motion on almost all new GPU's and some older ones. -50fps cap, if you have less than 50fps, your game will run like a crap.  My last result would be - DON'T BUY! save the money for something more worth than this crap game...
12716	TL;DR: Looks good, includes interesting features with a lot of community interaction and fun gameplay, however there are issues such as Uplay, large quantities of DLC and optimisation problems.  This is the first Trials game that I have ever played or owned, having heard good things from previous instalments I picked it up on sale. After finishing half of the game (excluding DLC) I felt that I could make an opinion on the package.  Positive features: -Nice colourful graphics -Fun challenging core gameplay -Level creation functionality and user created maps -Interesting concepts e.g. the ability to perform tricks  Negative features: -Uplay is required -The music is bland -DLC is frequent and costly -Issues with performance in certain instances  To conclude, while not a bad game, Trials Fusion left me with an unsatisfied; while exciting to begin with the experience lost me and was never able to recapture my enthusiasm. If it's on sale it might be worth picking up if this style of game interests you.
12717	This game is so broken. I am running it at the lowest settings and it still lags like it's Crysis running on a toaster.  Fix this pile of crap.
12718	Stay away right now. I've played it on all 3 of my different computers and in all cases it crashes, lags, and causes video issues. It also needs to be optimized a ton.
12719	This is not a terrible game by any means, but it feels like a definite step back from the previous installment and, by comparison especially, a lousy value proposition.  The tracks are significantly fewer and blander, and that's not balanced out by the new mechanisms.  Doing tricks seems to be based on your angle and the input on the right stick, but it feels pretty sketchy/inconsistent. The stages built around doing those tricks for points are too unforgiving: the checkpointing means you only get one shot at each jump trick, so any failed attempt means you've lost a potential 20% or so points for that stage. Maybe losing your multiplier would have been enough of a deterrent; as it stands, falling is too easy and too costly, so it makes sense to play it safe -- and that's boring, especially for a mode that's supposed to be a bit more crazy than the precision driving at the core of the franchise. Uniracers did it first and better, basically.  'Challenges' are either Easter eggs hard to figure out without a guide, or require feats like finishing with zero fault while doing 10 tricks or never letting go of the gas pedal. That's one way to stretch playtime over a small number of tracks...  Tournaments are one thing that's improved, though: they're time-limited and renewed every few hours, which is a good encouragement to participate and try to rank high.  Now that the first piece of DLC (out of a planned 6) is out, it's obvious that we can't count on them to fix the fundamental problem of there not being enough content: each will be the size of a world, so 6 regular tracks and 2 gimmicky ones (and the first pack is boring like the rest, too).  Are RedLynx / Ubi counting on player-created content to pick up the slack? Trying to find really good content is still a crapshoot though -- you can only rely on the 'featured' categories, very basic filters, or a percentage of positive reviews. There's quite a few enjoyable enough tracks, some with clever moments, but few if any are comparable in quality to the dev-made tracks from Trials Evolution, and you have to be in the mood to rummage around for them.  It pains me to say it, but this is a disappointment. Just get Trials Evolution, and don't get Fusion until you've played so much Evo you're sick of it. And even then, be aware it's not great value at full price.
12720	Why do i have to use uplay? Why is there no online multiplayer? Why is the game so jggidy?  Fairly disapointed only played the last trials online with friends, and now i cannot do this, the thing i liked most about Trials Evolution.  Also my game has decided not to show any of the letter 't'.
12721	LOTS OF FUN. Not as impressed as I was with the last one.. Most likely because this one is not finished. I WAS EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED TO FIND NO ACTIVE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.. Because everyone else who releases unfinished games (i.e. Stoping Land, Rust, DAYZ) they clearly state they arent finished. It will probibly be ALL DLC. ' Id ask for my money back, but I know I wouldnt get it. I even preordered this UNFINISHED thing. All in all, it was fun. But, I cant get passed how unfinished it feels.. DONT BUY 
12722	only giving a negative rating because this game is consistently crashing(will change if problem is resolved), is anyone else having this problem? all my other games run fine
12723	game constantly crashes sayin trials_fusion.exe has stopped working many people have had this problem so i dont reccomend it at all
12724	Being a trails fan ever since the relase of HD, I was incredibly excited to get this.  But of course, whenever i try to play the actual game, I only get around 15 fps at most. Looking at the system requirements, everything seemed a-okay except for my graphics card, which at the time wasnt a huge issue for me as id play on the lowest settings. With games that I dont have the expected graphics card for, all I did was that, and they ran fine.  Except for this game.  Even with the absolute lowest settings I lag like hell. The lag is so unbearable that it goes in slow motion, making it absolutly impossible to play at all. Ive never had any problems with this in the past.  Im going to possibly try to get another graphics card to fix the issue. But until then, I can't reccomend this to anyone.  ALSO, Uplay is the most useless â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever.
12725	November and still no multiplayer. Add to that the fact that you can't play most (any?) user-created content without buying the season pass.
12726	TO be honest, i think the whole future thing was not a good move. It was really disapointing not seeing the woods and the dirt as much as trials evolution. The feel of trials evolution was so much better and it felt for of a dirt bike game in my opinion. Fusion is a step down from evolution.
12727	Slow motion....unplayable.....uplay.......no multiplayer......money back please!!!
12728	It's a fine single player experience, but if you don't have Uplay, U(Don't)Play. Ubi being trash as always.
12729	I wouldn't have any problems with it if all that mattered was that you get to the end of the levels, but the structure of the game makes speedrunning the levels very aggravating. There are about three or four voice acting clips for each level, and they repeat over and over, which makes them tiresome very quickly.
12730	This game goes into slow-motion even at 120 fps. This may not be fixed in future so at the moment I highly recommend not buying it.
12731	Whats the point of buying through steam if you are forced to use the uplay launcher anyways?
12732	it suck â¥â¥â¥â¥
12733	I recommend Trials Fusion the game, but Trials Fusion for PC is a scam. The game doesn't run properly, it doesn't matter how good your PC is, it's port to the PC is the wost I've ever seen. It's practically unplayable. Trials is all about reaction and skill, imagine how hard it is when the game is constantly dropping to 15-20 fps and going slow motion below 60. The famerate is all over the place at all times for every track. So basically, have fun trying to control your rider as the game is frequently changing speed and frame rate. Even with their updates, lowering your graphics, lowering your resolution, turning off v-sync, turning on frame skipping, setting Trails Fusion to high priority and PC settings to performance, you will only marginally improve it. This game should be removed from Steam for quality control, they sold you a completely broken game that they don't even try to fix, or make good on. Absolutely shameful display of flippant disregard for the PC customers who shelled out the money and can't even make use of it as a paperweight.   DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. FOR. PC.
12734	Don't get the game because on steam it does not work. Before they let it link and you could download it on steam you had to download Uplay but now you don't and I can't play the game anymore.   To conclude the story I can't even play the game anymore and that's some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and if i could get a refund I would love one but put it in my steam
12735	Thumbs down because UCrap
12736	The music is great, the graphics look good, the gameplay is... it's, it's not very great. The levels are dumbed down from Trials Evolution. The challenge is getting past certain parts of the map that your bike can or cannot reach at random times. You could do the same think 10 times and the results would be different. The physics for the bike vs the person don't really make any sense either. Sometimes the bike is super heavy and other times it is as light as paper while the driver is the one with all the inertia. Oh, and no online multiplayer  4/10
12737	Really poorly optimised and no Online multiplayer.  Wait for a lot of updates before even considering this game, probably alright on Xbax/PS4 though.
12738	not recommended just because Uplay is so horribly broken it constantly crashes the game
12739	Don't get me wrong, I love this game. Just not on PC.  2 reasons why. 1: Its Uplay, 2: It's super laggy unless you have like a huge super gaming computer.  It's waaaay better on console... Sorry to say that, but it's true.
12740	i wouldnt have bought it if i realised you had to use uPlay.
12741	uplay ruins everything

12746	It's basically Trials Evolution with different models.  Just a few criticisms: The new FMX tricks are very clunky. It's difficult to trigger the one you want, some of them make your bike flip wildly when starting or ending the trick, and sometimes your rider just sits there doing nothing when you're trying to activate a trick. As for the level design, there's a lot of little things that ruin it. Later on, there's a bunch of jumps where you have to hit it just right or you'll fail. On paper, it sounds like that's just difficulty, but the bike control can sometimes be frustratingly bad. One of the worst things about the controls is that the bikes are rear wheel drive. If your bike comes an inch off the ground, you won't be able to make the jump. And if you want to get a gold on every level, you'll have to completely restart, because the timing is tight.  And then there's the small things. Customization is so lacking that it might as well not be there. You can (supposedly) buy new bodykits and wheels for your bikes and paint them. So there's a whopping two options. The thing it doesn't mention is that half of the bikes either don't have additional bodykits or can't be painted. Rider customization is slightly better, but that's just because you can consistantly paint the different outfit pieces.  I've also noticed some bugs, and many, many crashes. For instance, when you restart a level too quickly after finishing it, the level completed popup appears, and won't go away until you reset again. There's plenty of crashes in the editor, which makes it almost unusable until you've learned just which features crash the game.  AND THEN THERE'S UPLAY. Uplay is one of the worst things about any Ubisoft game these days, and is the single reason I will not buy another Ubisoft game until they drop Uplay. First of all, changing your name from the automatically generated 'guest-XXXXXXXXXXX' is a pain, and you won't get the one you want. And then you get to deal with the wonderful servers. The best way I can describe it: Do you remember a time when 'DLC' was crazy, because there was no way you could download 10MB in a sensible time? Well, Uplay simulates that by taking 10 minutes to download a 10MB update. And then I got to wait another 10 minutes to sync my saves, and then another 10 minutes after playing the game for my saves to sync. I'd like to say I'm exaggerating, but I can honestly say that I'm not.  But hey, it's all worth it, because it's totally preventing piracy (assuming you ignore the fact that it was cracked within a day). The thing that always gets me is that I'm sitting here waiting for the game to launch, and someone who just decided to pirate the game is already in the game, for free. It's a noble cause, but it's only hurting the people who are actually paying for it. They're just punishing legitimate players at this point.  Basically, it slowly turns into trial and error. I guess I was just expecting more speed and flips rather than precision jumps with clunky mechanics. So if you liked Trials Evolution, you'll like this. If you like putting up with terrible DRM that makes you wait half an hour before you can play the game you payed for, you'll also like this. But with that said, it's $20. You're paying for a budget game, and it definitely does that title justice.  Recommendation: Buy it during a sale, and don't expect to play it until after the sale, because Uplay will be slow as hell because of all the traffic.
12747	I was extremely disapointed in this game. I'd played Urban Trial Freestyle and I loved it, so I was hoping this one would work just as well.  The controls are atrocious by comparison. It was basically unplayable after being used to such a superior game. Plus you have to use Ubisoft's annoying game launcher UPlay to even play it. If you want the game you thought this would be, go here:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/243450  Ubisoft just can't do anything right anymore.
12748	Requires UPlay account to play.
12749	Five months on and we still don't have online multiplayer. Don't waste your money on this unfinished garbage.
12750	Broken. Every time you finish a level, it takes 20 seconds to try to connect to the Ubisoft servers. You're better off downloading this one illegally...
12751	Trials gold was fun, I love it. This one, not so much. I can't put my finger on it...but the tracks don't seem as fun or as well thought out.  I can't even bring myself to bother sticking with the game through the hard levels....while in Trials Gold I couldn't stop myself from trying to master the 'ninja' tracks.  Uninstalled out of boredom.
12752	Bought and downloaded this game... SURE WISH I COULD PLAY IT! Uplay launcher pops up.. won't accept my user name and password. Takes forever to send me a password recovery email. Finally reset it. Go to log in.. says 'you're account has been banned.' WHY DOES UPLAY EVEN EXIST!? no more ubisoft games for me, thanks.
12753	That 0.3 hours it has said I've played? Yeah, no.  Game crashes before I even get to the menu, so I don't know where that time played comes from.
12754	If you have an Xbox 360,PS4 or Xbox One, dont buy this on PC! First of all, the game runs terribly Frames drop very quickly  And you need a beast of a computer to run this smoothly on max setttings, wich i dont happen to have. Personally i think that Trials have always been a console game not a PC game PS: F*** UPLAY!!!
12755	Terribly optimized game, do not buy this game. If you did, request a refund ASAP.
12756	Preordered this game + the season pass, and they add DLC content NOT included in the season pass as well as add microtransactions. Uplay is constantly down and they are now milking this game for all it's worth. The loyal people who bought the game with the season pass get screwed over. You've lost me Red Lynx.
12757	I do know I like this game but when i try to play it my GPU isnt good enough and ive already got it and cant play it. i want a refund but i cant contact anyone about it. If valve would tell us requirements before buying things that would be great.
12758	I have played every other Trials game and I was very quickly dissapointed with this game. Let's first start with optimization. This game must have a perfect 60fps to run, because if it drops at all, even to 50fps it slows down so much that it is completely unplayable. I have to set this game to absolute minimun settings and even then I still get massive fps drops. And my computer can max out Battlefield 3. Next we have the addition of the trick system. It is the most god awful thing you can ever attempt to use. It does not do what you tell it to do and the rider will frequently get stuck in a position. But apart from the huge gameplay issues, the game is still just not fun or challenging. This game is so easy that I was able to beat almost every track first try with a gold medal. The leaning is also very unresponsive in comparison to older games. The older games were very fun, but they totally blew it with this one. Complete waste of $20. Don't buy it.
12759	KEEP AWAY from this game if you liked Trials Evolution Local Supercross.  I bought this game only to play with my friends i Local multiplayer 4-player Supercross.  Well... the track central is DEAD on that category. And when i say DEAD i mean DEAD.   really stick with Trials Evolution and to be honest forget Trials franchise after evolution if you like Local Multiplayer like me.
12760	This game was a let down. Not because of the gameplay... but the requirements. I very recently just bought a new computer.... which far exceeds the recommended system set up to run. But it is so choppy that it's unplayable. I played with every single option, but to no evail.  What now steam? It's just a rip off at this point. Had their been a demo, as there is with Trials Evo, I would have known. Just through away $20. Lovely.
12761	Excited to play, good sale price     crash...   crash...  crash...   crash...    Can you fix your game please?
12762	its â¥â¥â¥â¥. steam saying its running but cant se â¥â¥â¥â¥
12763	i cant even log on 
12764	its â¥â¥â¥â¥. steam saying its running but cant se â¥â¥â¥â¥
12765	I have been a long time fan of the Trials series, since the very first flash version on the PC, and have purchased the previous versions of the game on the xbox 360 as well as the PC. I have to say, the whole DLC business has left me feeling sour, and I don't think I'll be buying future versions of this game. I bought a season pass because I don't want to keep making microtransactions or buying additional content. A bunch of mediocre extra tracks were released as DLC, and then suddenly I have to buy additional content? Much like many other games nowadays it seems like the developers have gone from focusing on delivering a great game and instead focus on how much money they can bleed out of customers. Also, with the latest updates, the game seems to run very badly now. It used to run very well on my high specced gaming laptop, but now it fluctuates all over the place with the framerate speeding up and slowing down the game randomly as it pleases. Get the previous trials games, but I cannot recommend this game, and I'll be avoiding any further releases due to the capitalist greed that's infected so many other games/developers/publishers. Also, uPlay is the biggest pile of *%$^# ever.
12766	Bought both base game and Season pass, liked the base game, loved the premise of a game that would get worked upon as time went on.  Every DLC has been pretty shoddy, not a whole lot of content, then finally one of them caught my eye (Awesome Level Max).  Man, was I â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off to find out the one thing that would bring me back to the game was behind a new paywall, because RedLynx came up with a new definition of Season Pass, more focused on the Season than the Pass. Not spending another buck in this game, recommend that you avoid it too, this is everything that's wrong with the industry.  Oh, and it has microtransactions too.
12767	Just get Trials Evolution
12768	Expensive DLC buying game,espeically many tracks in track central are not able to play without DLC.  Bad controlling.
12769	too ****** layout and impossible with keyboard controls.
12770	Love me some Trials, have been playing the games for a long long time. This game is fun, but uPlay crashes my computer (even after a format, then Googled to see that it is common and has been for a long time) and I picked up the Season Pass, which doesn't net me all the DLC. So fun game, but the value isn't there with all the problems and shady marketing.
12771	I just got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by uplay and chop at the same time, MY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!!! P.S. Don't buy this game.
12772	It works well with AMD APUs but it is basically a Pay-To-Win game with DLCs and Season Passes
12773	0 out of 5 stars for Uplay Its a great game and all but I will not put up with extra hoops I have to jump through, unless there in game, of course.
12774	Its a good game but you have to pay for everything and it keeps crashing
12775	Yeah you know UPlay? Like that one kid in school who was weird and pushy and agressive and annoying and you couldn't stand him, but since he had a slight mental disorder and was like twice the size of you you had to play with him. Well yeah, thats trials fusion's plus one and theyre in-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-seperable. (It now also comes with a special feature of making the game near impossible to start, as in i have been trying unsuccessfully for 10 minutes now)
12776	MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD   My NAT type is strict and did everything possible to fix it. Nothing worked. Even the port forwarding pointed out by Ubisoft.   Also I was able to find 3 matches out of 10, and it takes about 2mins for the search to end. All matches included the same 2 players everytime (i guess big fans who keep playing anyway.  The singleplayer is good IF you include the season pass, otherwise the fun will end shortly. And the fact that you have nobody to compete with is a shame.  Overall bummer. I think they waited too long with the multiplayer so nobody came back for it.  :(
12777	trials fusion is a fun game especially when your playing with your friends and ive played it bafore on console but on pc its a piece of poop im not shure what the problem is but i think it has something to do with me using wondows 10 but the game always crashes before it finished loading and gets to the start menu
12778	Could be a great game if it had better lean controls. you are either leaning forward or back and nothing in between.
12779	I am familysharing this game with my brother but it does not let me play it because i need a code to play the game and i had to creat a uplay account for it just to find out i cant play it.I tryed to use the same code he put in but that does not work either.When i try to play it now it just sayd'searching for codes' ant it will keep saying thet until i x out.If you familyshare on steam i would not reccomend this game because i bet im not the only person with this problem.I SPENT 4 AND A HALF HOURS DOWNLOADING IT JUST TO FIND OUT I CANNOT PLAY IT!
12780	I really wanted to play this game but to be forced to check-in in you Uplay to do so is really poops! Why? WHY?! Installed and uninstalled! -_-
12781	Get trials evolution instead. There are very few tracks in the base game so you have to add all the DLCs which cost a lot.
12782	The last time i will purchase a game on steam that requires a secondary log-in.

12787	The is not many content in this game its boring.
12788	It could be a good game but crashes on the startup and Bugisoft doesn't want to fix it (even if you lower the graphics to the minimum)
12789	changing reviewdue to multiplayer 5 months later stil aint on they put multi on evo even tho that didnt work properly 4 months
12790	This was a great franchise that got absolutely destroyed by Ubisoft and Uplay. Honestly, still a great game to pick up if you just want to play single player or custom tracks alone. Multiplayer, however, is non-existant on PC. There's just simply no one on, because they rushed it out the door without MP and didn't add it for a year, and by that time the game was dead already. They made sure they rushed out those DLC's, though.   Also, don't buy the DLC. You get infinite content through the community hub.  I played and bought all the DLC's from all the previous Trials games, but supporting Ubisoft's destruction of a beloved franchise just isn't good.
12791	**Edited August 7, 2015**  OKAY REALLY. The game was great on release, i thought. It has some interesting new content and game modes and I really enjoyed the tracks and environment, as well as the map editor. HOWEVER, things changed. This games content is pretty much hidden behind a paywall. The season pass also doesn't even get you all of the DLC and there are micro transactions. Multiplayer took for â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ever to show up, and the content sharing system is â¥â¥â¥â¥. This game could have been so much more than what it turned into. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Ubisoft needs to get away from small developers or rethink their entire business practice, as they clearly don't develop/publish games for the gamers.  ____________________  ORIGINAL REVIEW  The trials games are some of the best games out there in my opinion. They can be great fun if you're not all that great, but take a very long time to master. They provide a lot of good entertainment and have a great community for custom tracks, with near endless possiblities (similar to SC 2 Arcade.) This game continues to deliver. There's a lot of new Rider and Bike customization options which are very fun to mess with.  They made Fusion much more competative with friends, too. You are notified if a high score is one upped by a friend, and if you beat a friend it will notify both you and them. You are able to watch replays of all learderboard times which is cool for comparisons or learning tricks. The new challenge system adds 3 challenges to every track that comes with the game. These can make for really hard, but also really entertaining events to each track, or just a little challenge like completing flips.  The physics in this game are spot on and I have not found any game that can match the quality. HOWEVER. Ubisoft bought out RedLynx and have inserted Uplay into the question. Uplay is an awful DRM, and requires constant connectivity in order to play any game. Ubisoft tends to have horrible service and I have grown to dislike them greatly recently but that's not why we're here.  Pros -Very fun -Well polished -Beautiful New Art Style -Lots of tracks -Challenges to keep you busy and entertained -Multiplayer Local, and Online in a future update. -Tricks can be a very fun addition  Cons -Uplay -Can be VERY frustrating -Ubisoft -Occasional Frame Drops -Crashes if menu is navigated too quickly sometimes -and uplay  I highly recommend this game if you like physics based Bike Racing, Couch Gaming, have patience, and have a good internet connection. I love the trials games, and this one (besides uplay) has not disappointed me at all.
12792	I own it on uplay but it wont let me play it. it just takes me to the buying page for the game...... any way to fix?

12794	changing reviewdue to multiplayer 5 months later stil aint on they put multi on evo even tho that didnt work properly 4 months
12795	Initial opinion, upon opening the game it failed multiple times to connect to ubisoft while my connection was fine. After it made it into the game it immediately took me to where i can purchase more DLC when I was starting it for the first time to play it. Maybe i'm tired of all the games pushing DLC but there's something real annoying about a game that opens for the first time not with a cool intro movie or walk through but straight to the store page to sell you more. I'll add more as i continue to play the game but controls seem to respond poorly.
12796	this is great except when playing career mode frames go down to 6 fps plz fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12797	I wasted my money on this game and it won't even open. I regret buying this game.
12798	what a bad game.it would be cool if it was made right and also when anyone buys a season pass you still have to pay for the latest update what a joke.first of all evey time i have ever played this it glitchs when you switch for muitiplayer and campaineand leaves you hanging on a load up screen untel you get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and have to close down the program another way.thanks for nothing ubisoft.

12800	this is great except when playing career mode frames go down to 6 fps plz fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12801	Crashes way too much. Get Trials Evolution Gold Edition.
12802	They promised multiplayer, but half a year later and locla co-op is the only thing available....
12803	Steam says: Muliplayer, but this â¥â¥â¥â¥ support only local multiplayer!
12804	I think the game is fantastic on its own, but if you can buy it on a console, do it. Terrible PC support, very few answers in forums. Bad framerate issues even with high end PC, some tracks worse than others creating progressively worse issues the longer you play the map, while others run fine. After 20 hours of play, I can't even launch the game anymore, and I can't find anything anywhere to help resolve the issue. I've tried re-installing, rebooting computer, you name it, no go.
12805	Didn't realise the game had Uplay.  Instantly uninstalled, waste of money.
12806	Buy Evolution, this game was ruined by Uplay and lack of replayability due to such a small number of people playing online. Don't waste your time or money with this, if you want a trials game buy Evolution, far better game.
12807	This game runs at a terribly low fps which has ruined this supposed exiting game
12808	this game wont run why i met the requirements so tell me why
12809	buy trials evolution, dont waste your time with this one
12810	It is a really nice game, with some disappointments. there is uplay, which is forced on you. And the multiplayer isn't quite what i expected. in evolution you could actually race agains others.. oh well.  if would recommend evolution over this game. however if you need more content, than this is the game. also you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed without a season pass.  edit: there seems to be a proper multiplayer now, however i only found one other player online.
12811	Decent motorbike game but a ridiculous exercise in fustration. Honestly, â¥â¥â¥â¥ uplay. Game is currently covered in ads for DLC not avaliable through steam. Very aggrivating.
12812	No Online Multiplayer? Wowwwwww.......... The best part of Trials is playing with your friends. This sucks.
12813	Symply put, the game does not work.
12814	If you really want to play this game then dont waste your money! Buy Trials Evolution its a way better then this one. 
12815	I love Trials games. My first was Trials 2: Second Edition back in like 2008. I got the demo, played the crap out of it, and bought the game. Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and bought it as soon as it did. This game was AMAZING. The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. Once I had all of them cleared, I saw on Facebook that Trials Fusion was in the works, and excitedly waited for it's release. After pre-ordering this game, and launching it the first time, I was immediately disappointed. The soundtrack is terrible (maybe not a big deal for you), loading took forever, and the bikes/rider/maps/tracks/menus all look really thrown together without much thought. My opinion, of course, but if you're going to get a Trials game, get Trials Evolution: Gold Edition. That game is the SH**.
12816	The game is not as good as the first titles. They took the old core concept and slaugthered it: You have to pay real money for optical upgrades like this is a free to play title. The season pass needs to be seperately activated within uplay (another software/account for gaming) and does not include the last DLC they released (WTF IS A SEASON THEN?!?) and the local coop (the games selling point imho) is worse than the previous titles (less tracks,less player made tracks).   i strongly recommend to NOT buy this!!!
12817	UPlay account? No multiplayer?  Uninstalled.
12818	Welcome to the future! I have not played earlier trials games so I can't compare them to this game but overall I'm not a huge fan. I was led to this game by the app trials fronteir. I did enjoy the app but for anyone who thinks this game is like the app it is not. I was hoping to be able to upgrade the individual bikes a little more but you just get the bike. The only thing you can change is the way the bike looks, but not the actual traction of wheels or engine or anything else. And there are only a few bikes to choose from. It's a fun game to play every now and then but I can't see myself committing more than 30 minutes at a time to this game.
12819	It always really bugs me when people low-ball the ratings for things because it didn't work for them.  But in this case I think the technical issues are bad enough to be a non-starter. To clarify, the underlying game is a blast, from what I played, but to get 25 minutes of gameplay I had to put in about 3 hours of troubleshooting across two different (and very normal) computers, a PC and a laptop. There's a solid mix of server problems (uPlay AND another Ubisoft connection, both of which can, and for me did, fail often) which immediately reset your saved progress (it's always-online), graphics problems, and start up problems; all persistent across both computers. More irritating, the demo worked fine after a bit of work, and the full game did not: the demo uses uPlay but seems to save itself a lot of trouble by not attaching your progress to your account.  I love the hell out of trials. But this game is hard enough to even start playing to make me wary of any future uPlay thing. It's more headache than the fun is worth.
12820	Railroads you into installing uplay which is very unimaginative clone of steam, and of every other app-store ever invented. However ubisoft have seen it reasonable to attempt to remove your personal choice of which app-sore you would like to use. Even though this game is purchased and installed through steam it will refuse to function unless you log into your new coporate overlords so they can assault you with sensless marketing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t every day via uplay.  0/10  Railroaded into uplay. Cant play game without it. Uninstalled, game broken. Waste of money.
12821	On Xbox I was a dedicated follower of the Trials series owning all three of their Arcade releases. I was excited to purchase fusion on my computer, however whenever I load the game and attempt to play it crashes and I'm given an error message. No fixes online, may as well have flushed Â£16 down the toilet. RED LYNX. PLEASE FIX.
12822	no gyro effect from throttle. has magic corners that the bike goes around.  Don't waste your money. just get trials 2 se, the last real game in this title.
12823	IT WONT LET ME START T FROM UPLAY ALL IT DOES IS SENDS ME TO UPLAY AND SAYS I DONT OWN THE GAME WHEN I HAVE BOUGHT IT!!
12824	I'm a bit sad that I can't really reccommend this. I wanted more Trials, just to get rid of the shakes, but this..  This is most likely not the 'More Trials!' you are looking for.  Play Trials Evloution instead, if you have not done so and/or wait for the next one, where they hopefully tune some of the stuff back to 'functionaltiy over visuals'.  Pros: - Graphics are amazing. Really, really pretty. - Still the same great Trials physics, bike handling feels almost exactly like the previous ones  Cons: - UPLAY -- This piece of garbage. BigPicture &amp; COntroller -&gt; Start any UPlay game -&gt; Wait for Uplay updates &amp; start looking for the mouse to click 'Start'. The day UPlay dies will be a happy one. Make a suicide pact with Origin please, why don't you.   - Visuals over functionality -- Camera too often shows the scenery instead of the track you are about to land on -- Performance was never great with the Trials games, but because of the grat graphics and their camera work, Fusion performs HORRIBLE at times - which really sucks in a skill based 'pixel perfect' thing, when you fail because of lag/hitches  - 'Trick Mode' is just bad. Right stick to perform stunts w/ the bike while in the air. Sounds nice, controlls horrbily. HORRIBLY. -- These levels are mandatory and mixed in with the normal Trials stuff and that sucks, because it just does not work well   I like trials more than I'd normaly publicly admit to, but this.. Yes, Trials should feel frustrating.  But not because some Designer went 'Hey stop showing so much of the track, show the background, we spent a lot of money making this!'.   They essentially broke their game with that attitude, about 50% of all levels I have played have had this. I am at about halway through, and between that and the Trick stuff, this is it for me, and I am actually a bit sad about this.. I want more real Trials.. :/  Also, that intro Song.. O.o  Next time, just make Trials Evloution 2, yes? Everyone will love you again and actually play your game..Thanks! :)
12825	I'm bad at it  Therefore the game is bad
12826	I WANT REAL MP GOD DANG IT
12827	On Xbox I was a dedicated follower of the Trials series owning all three of their Arcade releases. I was excited to purchase fusion on my computer, however whenever I load the game and attempt to play it crashes and I'm given an error message. No fixes online, may as well have flushed Â£16 down the toilet. RED LYNX. PLEASE FIX.
12828	Takes ages to load but the biggest problem is the trying to connect to the servers. always fails the first time and takes a long time to connect on the second atempt.
12829	I got this as part of the arcade pack a while ago, and kinda forgot about it. Today I felt in the mood, having played some Trials HD back in the day.  I start it up, and FIRST THING, it takes me to dlc. It literally shows the menu where you'd pick levels, and automatically scrolls over to the paid content. If I hadn't gone searching in disbelief, I could easily have been fooled into thinking that this game contains no career 'on-disc', so to speak.  Once i figured that out, I was puzzled that I'd gone and downloaded a free-to-play game without realizing. It even has premium currency and expects you to buy outfits (which are also listed before the ones the game comes with).  Everything about this screams money-grubbing, consumer-hating, can't-find-our-butts-with-both-hands-and-a-flashlight corporate stupidity. I feel like I paid someone to spit in my face.  Maybe the rest of the game is good, but I have no idea. I'll never play it again. There's a hell of a lot more game out there that actualy, you know, COME WITH THE GAME IN THEM.  Ubi's gonna have to something pretty damn amazing to get me to install their pathetic U-play BS again.
12830	The game by itself is amazing and the $/hour value is insane with all the content you get from used created content, but there's a slight flaw which is best explained with an example:  1. Decide to play the game. 2. uDontPlay update 3. Launch game - unskippable logos, but that's okay they're short. 4. Preload before the main menu. Okay, could've done that during splash screens, but okay. 5. Connecting to Ubisoft servers..... 6. Still connecting. 7. Failed to connect to Ubisoft servers, hit retry, 8. Finally connected to Ubisoft servers, yay. 9. Browse around the menus checking for new stuff. 10. Random freeze, Ctrl+Alt+Del =&gt; End task. 11. Wait for uDontPlay to do some bs before it shuts down. 12. Relaunch game, surprisingly uDontPlay hasn't been updated since then. 13. Splash screen logos, preload, connecting to Ubisoft servers. 14. Failed to connect to Ubisoft servers, hit retry. 15. Go straight for playing this time, let's see the new content. 16. Spend ~2minutes to complete the first medium map in the new pack, loving it! 17. Autosave after the level completion takes about as much time as the level itself. 18. Lost connection to the Ubisoft servers............. That explains it. 19. Hit retry, twice this time, before it actually works. 20. Back, back, back, back, quit game.  That's ~15-20 minutes of Ubisoft bullcrap to play two minutes of an otherwise solid game. Guess I'll try again in a couple months.... but every time I try to pick this game back up it's the same reason that makes me shelve it and that's uDontPlay. I'll admit, the freeze could've been a bug from Redlynx's side, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ubisoft DRM is so well integrated that it is the reason why the menus are so slow to swap inbetween to begin with. Setting up Excitebike on a NES emulator from scratch would probably take less time than each fresh launch of Trials through uPlay after a prolongued absence.  TL;DR Great game that's close to unplayable thanks to a U shaped anchor.
12831	no gyro effect from throttle. has magic corners that the bike goes around.  Don't waste your money. just get trials 2 se, the last real game in this title.
12832	Uplay ruined this game for me. It is not good enough to excuse installing another program just to be able to play a single game. Evolution is better, and this was a step down.
12833	â¥â¥â¥â¥. UPLAY. They wouldn't even let me get above 30fps. The game runs like syrup and jello. I have 8 gigs of RAM. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing atrocious. Never buying a Ubisoft game ever again. That's 40 bucks wasted.
12834	dont play this 
12835	The game crashes on startup, some people don't get this crash, good for them, you're welcome to roll the die if you like, I'm sure it's a decent game if it runs but myself and many others wouldn't know about that. I've tried a bunch of fixes but yeah, this game is a dud. Also Uplay so yeah, eurgh don't bother.
12836	uplay on xbox and ps are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing easyer then pc right on my pc it says that i am playing trials fusion so far its says 61 hours of playing the game i have only played one hour of this game and uplay i cant delete i cant delete trials to this is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horses â¥â¥â¥â¥ so if anyone know why its doing this please tell me
12837	I loved this game, but it's has stopped working on my laptop.

12839	Good game. Shame about Uplay.
12840	no multiplayer and a lack of community levels (that you can dl without the dlc) makes this game not worth the time. Buy trialsevolution instead.
12841	Very sloppy. Lots of explosions and colours but physics and gameplay are very limited.
12842	Runs in slow motion unplayable 2/10
12843	Good game. Shame about Uplay.

12845	Very sloppy. Lots of explosions and colours but physics and gameplay are very limited.
12846	Runs in slow motion unplayable 2/10
12847	UPlay sucks. Vendors need to stop forcing gamers through tons of loops just to launch a game. Paying for DLC is likewise crap. I'm not interested in paying for a game that is handicapped from the start.
12848	Aye, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. F...UCK IT.
12849	This game is terrible. It's nothing like a motocross racer. It involves all sorts of ridiculous tricks with poor instructions. At one point you need to complete the FMX training to continue through the game but they give you so little instruction on 'how' to complete it you could spend hours mashing keys hoping to get lucky and perform the trick.
12850	Game crashes when trying to create a map or play the game. Don't purchase.
12851	Not evolution. Closer to that one playstation kartingTM game. 0/10.
12852	WARNING: Do not buy this game when you have a somewhat older graphic card. It wont run at all(!!) or lag. Even if you can play other games with equal or even better graphics than this game, ubisoft decided that you wont be able to play, because this is such a graphic revolution for a game that only choosen people with newer graphic cards are allowed to play the game. Even then many report lags and many other problems.   Read the forums first before you buy it!
12853	If you're a fan, stay away until all DLC release
12854	The game has a really good and fun way of playing and riding a motor bike, which makes the gameplay very good. The levels get very hard, most gamers won't be able to finish the entire single player campaign. I don't know if I find this very fun or not, because it's good to have a challenging game but this makes it a rage game, which I don't really like. Of course you could always just not finish the single player and move on to the custom maps but most of those are very hard aswell, so you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed either way.  But the real problem for me, and the reason why I don't recommend it is, the local multiplayer supercross. In the prequel (trials evo) you had 10 or so standard supercross tracks and you could download a bunch of custom ones. In this game, you also have 10 or so standard supercross tracks but you can't download any custom supercross maps. This makes the supercross very lame very fast and is the reason why I won't buy another trials game if they don't implement it anymore.  TLDR: If you like a challenge and you liked the old trials evo's singleplayer maps you will really like this game. But if you want to play with your friends, don't buy it and stay with evo.
12855	This should have been dlc for the last game. This game is way easier than the last and you never feel like you have to hold out on a level for a silver or gold because a)you always seem to have the medals to progress and b) you always seem to get silvers and golds anyway. Yes there is a connection between these two things but it just means that the game is not challenging enough. It wasn't until the 'hard' levels that I really even felt like I had to do much at all with the controls.   Sure, they give you ATVs and tricks but it doesn't mean much in the end. The ATV doesn't amke much of a difference gameplay-wise and the tricks are clumsily implementented.  For players who haven't played Trials, go play Evolution Gold Edition or maybe the previous games (I don't know, only played Evolution). I'd pay $5-10 for this.
12856	I loved this game, but it's has stopped working on my laptop.
12857	First time I played it, had to make a new Uplay account. Register. Immediately banned from account for ten minutes for trying to log in too many times. Uplay needs to go.
12858	would'ent let me play it becouse it sead that the code was already on a account with I have never used
12859	Not evolution. Closer to that one playstation kartingTM game. 0/10.

12867	Aye, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. F...UCK IT.
12868	looks great, game physics is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier than the previous game, and you dont even get a real trials bike till near the end. this has nothing to do with motorcycle trials.
12869	Trials Evolution is way better IMO. Fusion feels overly gimicky and even on lowest gfx settings brings my 550 TI to its knees. Mostly because of all the stupid background crap that you can't watch anyway because you're focused on the track so... yeah, thanks for demanding that I upgrade for no real reason.
12870	I played the hell out of the last Trials game, but this one fails to deliver the promised features.  There are several performance issues, online multiplayer still missing and the editor doens't support supercross/local multiplayer tracks  1 month and no news
12871	If you're a fan, stay away until all DLC release

12874	Don't lose your uplay logs...
12875	Crashes almost every time I complete a level. What is this garbage?
12876	LATEST BUILD CRASHES ON STARTUP. PLEASE FIX.  I just got the season pass when it was on sale and now i wont be able to play what i paid for. Update this thing even if you go backwards just get it fixed.   then start making the engine run faster than fixed 60fps.  Edit: Have tried validating the game/files and deleting the config file.  Goes to loading screen, but quits just before title
12877	USES USELESS UPLAY CANNOT CONNECT TO SERVERS, OH WELL, CAN'T PLAY ANY CUSTOM TRACKS OR ANYTHING TOO BAD
12878	Uplay means I no longer own this game even though I spent money to buy it through steam, avoid like tha plague
12879	The game is great but I can't get it working on my copmuter.
12880	my problems   1.the rider glitched with the quad bike (made the game very easy as no stupid rider to worry about)  2.The checkpoints are in some of the dumest places. the bike won't beable to make the from the checkpoint.  3.Why lock something away if i unlock it. i would like to use the quad or any of the bikes on all the courses.  4. the feeling that no matter what i try to tell the rider to do balance wise it has very little impact on the game.
12881	Got the game, got the season pass! ALLL GOOD......... wait no i gotta pay $10 for the new 'DLC' when the game has been out for a Year+ GG Ubisoft/RedLynx
12882	Great game ! NO MULTIPLAYER ???
12883	Just ubishit living up til their standards...
12884	months after launch, still no online multiplayer.
12885	Not as fun as Trials Evolution , actually kinda regrent buying it .
12886	The game is like an ipad game moved to the PC, it only runs in so little resolution that its like playing on the ipad but i cant forcefully press my fingers on the screen, unless its me trying to smash that little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'s head in the main menu out of frustration. It then makes me feel worse at the people playing this game saying it looks great and is fun, while im sitting here watching my guy go in slow motion as a mash the A button madly doing backflips and jerk off with my tears. I feel like an idiot staring at the tiny screen that the game runs on and it doesnt help that the rest of the game wont run at normal speed unless it looks like pong and trials HD had gay sex in a back alley. I dont think anybody should buy this game due to my problem but who gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥ Trials can â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a potato, cook it for 5 hours and slam it in a case and name it Trails Fusion and everybody wil buy it anyways.
12887	HARD AS HELL !!!! KEEP YOUR GAMEPAD AWAY FROM WINDOWS BECAUSE GAMEPAD CAN FLY !!! EXTREME TRACKS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT !!!
12888	Trials Evolution Gold was a great game, Trials Fusion is a really good example of how you can screw up a game. it feels sterile, we play the 4 player local coop, and it was no fun at all. The music is bad, no atmosphere... supercroos belongs in the dirt... We would prefer a mappack for the old game rather then this.  
12889	This game was made to be played at 60FPS, so if you don't meet the recommended specs, don't buy the game
12890	This game forces you to use ubisoft's garbage uplay system. It's as fun as any of the other trials games are though.
12891	Crap!  Unicorns, Uplay, no atmosphere, only 10 mulitplayer tracks (all no fun, it couldn't be worse!
12892	Yeah, â¥â¥â¥â¥ Uplay -- â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ubisoft -- the game would run great, well until the second checkpoint in the tutorial level. An awesome waste of money..
12893	I bought this game thinking 'wow it looks so fun and I can't wait to play it'. I bought the deluxe edition and started the game. or at least I tried to. It took me to the Uplay account login screen. I signed up for Uplay thinking I would be able to play the game after signing in. But no, I can't connect to a Uplay server. I thought, 'okay, i'll just play in offline mode'. But no, I have to launch it in online mode once before I can play in offline mode. So, I thought to myself. I just wasted 39.99 dollars on a game I can't even play. Until I can find a way to get Uplay working, i'm going to think to myself 'wow, I just wasted 39.99 dollars on a game that was going to be awesome but I can't play because Uplay can't connect to servers.' I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a working Uplay account.
12894	this game was fun. for as long as it let me play it. i was really into it but Uplay mesed up my account and i cant acces Uplay so i cant even play it. i preoderd the game and i cant play it because of Uplay. this game would be good if u didnt need to use Uplay
12895	(Please note that I am downvoting this as a sequel if you have played previous Trials games. If you have never played a trials game before then you won't understand why i think this one is a failure so go ahead and play it.)  As a standalone game this would be amazing. I'm a big fan of the Trials series (go to hell Uplay and Ubisoft with it). However this one just doesn't stand up to the previus installments.   It's clear ubisoft was trying to appeal to the 'new generation' with all the techno bits and futuristic looking backdrops, which I guess is standard for Ubisoft nowadays isn't it?   I really like the solid color art style in other games like portal or Mirror's Edge, but it feels kind of out of place her. That's nto to say it's completely out of place as it still works. but as a long time player I miss the gritty and harsh art style of old. Just my preference though.  *Important* If you were hoping to find those unforgetably cool tracks like the one's from Evolution and HD then you will be disappointed. The tracks leave something to be desired and I breezed through all of them fairly easily. There's no Castle Crash or Gigatrack or Archipeligo. I rememebr most if nto all the tracks from Trials HD and Evolution by simply hearing the name but i couldn't even tell you the names of th first few tracks in Fusion. This is rather big for me as I really wanted the memory hook that previous tracks had given me.   They give each difficulty a general 'Theme' for example the second area you unlock is supposed to be in the city but I couldn't be less enthusiastic about the environments. They just seem copy and pasted together and I turned off the audio because I didn't find 'Cindy' or that pother guy i couldn't bother to remember the name of.  If this sounds like I'm calling Ubiusoft out on being the dirtbags they so desperately desire to be then you may be on to something there. But I still LIKE the game I'm just not in love with it like i was the previous ones, and if a sequal can't superceed it's predocessors then it's a failure as a sequel.  But I am sure we will see more of Trials as Ubisoft has made it clear that there are no such things as standalone games anymore.  Go to hell Ubisoft and takle your piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ excuse for a 'Client' with you  Also i would be nice if steam had a spell check, I knwo that's lazy but I'm legally blind so proof reading is too much of a hassle
12896	The game itself is probably fine, I have no idea because I'm not going to play it much if I have to deal with Uplay every time I start it up. 0/10.
12897	this game ehhh this game whenever i try to play it it pops a bunch of things up and i cant play it it frigin sucks it was a waste of money
12898	Just bought season pass and trying to revisit this game with dlc tracks. Turns out my save is gone, also couldn't connect to ubisoft server. My progress is 0, can't even start dlc tracks because i don't have enough completion. I have to do everything again in order to play the DLC i just bought! Are you kidding me ubis%it?
12899	Do not buy! It requires uplay.
12900	Cons: -Uplay -Ubisoft -Local multiplayer which mean cant play online with friends -Pointless  Pros: -None
12901	Don't waste your time with Fusion. If you're a very experienced Trials player, it can take less than 2 hours to reach the Trials Trophy. I personally don't like the futuristic setting or the soundtrack, but if you like the setting you may like the game. Trials Evolution and HD are worth your time, not this.
12902	WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  Bought this as it was cheap in trhe Summer Sale and I own and love the game on my PS4, big mistake.   As if it wasn't awkward enough to try and run in the first place (thank you Ubisoft, I totally wanted UPlay), it then crashed every time I tried to progress beyond the start menu, and every 'fix' I found online didn't work.   So after racking up a tidy 0.4 hours play time just on the main screen, I decided it just wasn't worth the hassle and requested a refund.
12903	the stupid uplay is bull sh*t i forgot the email and password damn i cant login now i cant play LAMO
12904	Hey Ubisoft, fix your ruddy DRM, I literally just bought this game from steam but yet you tell me I don't own the game...that makes sense!!
12905	do dont download this game, says i dont have directx and i need to download it, i have Directx 11. i cannot play
12906	I got traped in tutorial because of some bug and i cant get over it, i cant play further.... bg
12907	the uplay severs dont work with this! do not buy it
12908	Uplay is crap can't play the game because its locked me out of my own acount tried making a new acount it only gives me one uplay activation code
12909	BUY EVOLUTION INSTEAD.  For people deciding on which trials game to buy, BUY EVOLUTION. Trials evolution was better than this game in pretty much every way, once you've squeezed evolution dry for all of its content, you can buy this one and play it too.  Good: + This game has a bigger online community than trials evolution. Even so, its good to play through single player first, which is why I still recommend evolution over this.  Bad: - Some of the music in this game is good, but trials evolution had much better and more memorable music. The title screen music for this game is nauseatingly bad. 'welcome to the future'  - The grapics on this game are so boring compared to evolution. They went way over the top with the 'futuristic' style. Everything is made of polished metal and strip lights, which gets very boring after a while. Trials evolution is grounded in reality which makes it look much nicer and it ages better.  - Uplay  - Uplay  - Uplay...
12910	If you haven't already bought this game, don't.  If you want to play Trials, play Trials Evolution.
12911	I have watched slide shows that were smoother than this game. 1/10
12912	Well I didn't expect much out of this game... but I got it simply because I can always wind down with long easy Trials levels. Reading the reviews of this game, I knew it wasn't much, so I don't regret buying the game. However, I cannot recommend buying this if you are looking for a good Trials game.  It is buggy, some levels are unbearably laggy (bad optimization) and the 'skill games' from the previous Trials game are baaaack! And even more annoying than ever! If you want to play with keyboard, don't bother trying to do anything with those games. Ubisoft themselves wrote that they were designed for pad. But, these games are so lame that I can't be bothered configuring my pad.  The levels (when they aren't laggy) are bland. There is no challenge. I play this game when I want to wind down... It's good for that. But if you are looking for a Trials challenge, you won't find it here. Also, you need to pay much more to get the other half of this game (DLC) and there is no multiplayer.
12913	The game is extremely clunky and reminds me of how much I hate Trackmania. One of the biggest, yet simplest, turn-offs is that the lean sticks. Instead of a central position where you can lean back or forward from, you have to constantly fight the lean. Oh, you stuck that landing after leaning back? Here, try this super wheelie on the ramp 10 feet in front of you.  The game looked so fun from the videos I've seen and so much promise from user-created tracks. Such a let-down.  Edit: Out of 100 games, this is the first one I've considered getting a refund. It has taken me 8 years with Steam to now realize there's no refunds. One hell of a lesson, I guess.
12914	WARNING I HAVE HORIBLE SPELLING IGNORE THIS POST IF YOU ARE GOING TO SPAM CORRECTOINS. Not bad but sadly far from good compared to what it was this is actually worse than hd This is coming from a long term fan that has actually been following the companys work since they released a flash trails game yes i know thats sad as soon as they were baught by ubisoft i lost trust in the company and i still hold distrust to this day  Trails hd was simply amazing it was alll about riding skill games were about riding there was no bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game felt completley diffrent  Sadly the pc port was horrible and the gold editoin hd is nothing like the real thing  Evo was a step fowards fun and enjoyable  Then youtube ruined it youtubers like pewdiepie ksi and other idiots played the game the main complaint was  The game is to hard and yet it was actually easire than hd by a long shot   Then this game released dumbed down for the masses i still enjoy the game however it has forced story forced fx â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gimic system  the main thing this game dose that i love is add challenges some of which have mroe time spent on them than the actual level itself! i love this game despite the big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you it has been to lovers of their prevouis games i have actually gotton worse instead of improving because they have made the game so dumbed down everything is easir to do  Just make harder levels you say? Its still not the same play hd on the xbox 360 (if you have played both you will know why the gold editoin dosent compare) then you will see what i mean   Value for money this is perfect yet as a long time fan this is a big f u big time slap in the face to vans the so called added multiplayer isnt even proper multiplayer its a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ supercross map there is also no point in playing the games like there was in evo   that was why i waited then the game was on sale for a price so low i couldnt not buy it  Lots of there loyal audince has left and i know why its dumbed down for the masses.
12915	THIS IS BULL SH#T DOENST WORK I HAVE WAISTED 20$ I WANT MY MONEY BACK
12916	u need to pay to play the campaign after u have done all the easy once....
12917	Whoooaaahhh.. Where on the path from Trials HD to Trials Fusion did this game lose it's heart? Trials Frontier on iOS is what this game here should have been IMO.
12918	It uses uplay, that alone is enough to make me not recommend it  All jokes aside, it's a fun game with a massive skill ceiling, but it can be definitely harsh on your computer, so make sure you have good specs.
12919	Bad game, and you need Uplay to play it. I played Trials Evolution for YEARS on my xbox360 and was actually one of the top 75 players in the world. But this game does not deliver, they took out multiplayer and a lot of the bikes are bad along with the ATV. Just not worth the price or the hassel of downloading Uplay
12920	Ubisoft can suck my wang
12921	This series is just so sad. I have Trials HD wich i got when i bought my xbox 360, and it's one of the best games i've played, i have so many hours sunk in to that it's not even funny.   Then Trials Evolution came out, and i was so happy... until i played it. And Trials Fusion is suffering from the same things that Trials Evolution was. They have gone so far from the Trials HD idea that they are just bad games now.  It seems like they are more focused on racing instead of the 'trials' part.  It's not even close to have the feeling Trials HD had when getting over obstacles. Getting past obstacles in Trials HD was alot of the times skill based, but in the 2 followup games it seems that you just have to keep on trying until luck kicks in and pray to god that you are ready for it and you dont screw up.  In alot of places there is no reason in how the bike behaves so you can't plan for it, just do it over and over again until you get lcuky and guess correctly how the bike is gonna behave.  It's a sad sad story. Trials HD was soooo good and now the games just suck, they are not even fun to play anymore. I bought this in hope that it would be better than ' Trials Evolution' and maybe it is, a little bit, but it's still a bad game and I officially give up hope that the 'Trials' ever will be as good as they were in the beginning. And it is a crying shame really  
12922	Buy Trials Evolution Gold Edition instead.  Level design is worse, lot's of focus to moving platforms and graphical gimmicks. Skillset required is much tougher than in Evolution, several nanosecund timing sequences pretty early in medium-ranked tracks. Game reporter stories are annoying and overall the whole futuristic theme feels pretty stupid.  Bought the game and season pass and feels like I've been ripped off, this isn't a step up from evolution but a rushed botch job from Ubisoft.
12923	Keeps crashing at the loading screen, waste of money get it for console
12924	Keeps crashing at the loading screen, waste of money get it for console
12925	DON'T play this game! Crippled multiplayer, no ability for custom supercross, half the content of Evolution, a sad entry to a formerly great series.
12926	Do not buy this game I repeat DO NOT BUY, Buy Trials Evolution insted, there is no MP in this game and WTF is the point of trials without MP, there is no point, the singleplayer is fine. But not close to Trials Evolution. Yes I know I dont have to much time in the game, but the reason i bought it was for MP. Dont repeat my misstake, safe your money, SAVE THEM !!!.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS PICE OF A â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME !!!  
12927	I CAN'T START IT ANYMORE!
12928	After owning Trials Evolution Gold Edition and finding the challenges get way too difficult I reluctantly bought Trails Fusion and 6 DLC's and it is just as dissapointing as I thought it would be.   You play the first few tracks and are amazed by the game and then the challenges become stupid and frustrating.  Why make a game that is totally amazing in every aspect except playability.   Then you delete your purchases as its not FUN! 
12929	This game sucks!
12930	I Hated this game not worth the $20. First off having to use Uplay. Also the massive difficulty jump from Medium to Hard levels is insane. I went from getting gold on every track to passing level with 100+ faults and these are nearly always racked up at one nearly impossible jump. I don't recommend this game unless you are freakishly skilled and /or patient.
12931	The Wolf Among us &gt; Fails Fusion   https://youtu.be/u8ckxMWfJiA?t=31s 
12932	I love this game... but i had to install a bunch of crap to even play the game. and in the end, guess what! it didnt even work. just buy the game on xbox or something
12933	Beautiful game. Just do not play if you have any desire for REAL physics. Game designers have clearly never ridden a bike before in their lives.
12934	not as good as evolution, bike selection is terrible, tracks are boring. trick system im a load of bs and a waste of time. missing modes, super annoying commentary gets old fast when it repeats the same comments everytime you restart the checkpoint, bikes and leaderboards either load or the dont at all. feels like half the content was removed just for a season pass. NO SUPERCROSS TRACKS IN EDITOR! skip this garbage and stick to evolution
12935	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you dont have the perfect gaming computer, and you are just a kid, do not buy this game. Apparently your 'gbu' thingy needs to be updated or something so you basically need to spend more money. It also makes you download and create so many new accounts. YAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAY I HATE YOU STEAM FOR EVEN ALLOWING THIS GAME TO BE BOUGHT.
12936	  No wonder its a free version, this game is trash. Pathetic movement stuff, boring weapons and above all: slow. I rather play a real game, like Quake or something.
12937	Yet.. until this day, This game has not worked on my Core i7 Nv. Geforce 750... too bad, I was looking forward to playing it.
12938	This has been this worst year for ubisoft, all there games have been horrible. Every year they get worse, but they have reached and all time peak. I really used to like your games, I'm just done. You have lost a customer.
12939	All I can say is screw Ubisoft. The fact that they make me sign into a different account to play is rediculous. I probably wouldn't care as much if the game would actually work, but it crashes everytime I try to choose a track. Very disapointed and will probably never purchase another ubisoft game on steam ever
12940	uPlay servers were an absolute nightmare to connect to. the game would keep running in the back ground so I couldn't restart it with steam. uPlay servers were crap. Multiplayer didn't work and anyone I invited got stuck in loading screens. uPlay servers were terrible. Only real point in buying is for the multiplayer and it simply didn't work as it should for me or any of my friends.
12941	This game resumed in one sentence:  CANNOT CONNECT TO UBISOFT SERVERS AT THIS TIME
12942	the game itself is much fun but... uplay. dont get this people, better torrent the game if you dont want extramly annoying drm
12943	I know I've only logged an hour into this game, but as a very big fan of physics-based games, I have to say this one was a let down for me. I'm not going to complain about Uplay or say that the game isn't optimised correctly, because it plays wonderfully on my system at 60 FPS, ultra settings. There's really not much to Trials Fusion other than balancing your bike over different types of bumps, landing your bike correctly, and occasionally flying through the air to the next part of the track. Now don't get me wrong, there are neat tricks, solid physics, and a great presentation along with beautiful graphics. But even on sale like I got it, I'd say the $15-20 isn't worth it. Maybe at $5. If you want an awesome physics-based game where you do more than just grind through levels by shifting your weight on a bike to get over giant hills, etc., then I'd recommend you go play Happy Wheels. It's free, you can play it on flash, there is a far greater variety in vehicles/stages, and it's just more entertaining. I really love Ubisoft, but I have to say pass on this one.
12944	i really want to play this game i have got it but it just lags loads and it goes in slow motion everytime i start a race witch is really bad. my pc is good as well so it must be the game
12945	The actual gameplay is 8.5/10 but this game is not finished. For a premium price game I expect multiplayer and way more content.  Ill give it 5/10 overall.
12946	Crashes every 5 minutes. Fun to watch twitch streamers play, but do not bother with it.
12947	It's early days yet having just installed and played the intro levels but I much preferred the 2D gameplay in the early Trials games and on my iPhone at this stage. The bikes don't feel as responsive and the camera angles can cause frustration at times in being unable to judge distance to ground and such when doing flips, etc.  Might become fun in the later levels, I'll throw another few hours into it but at this stage not high on the recommendation list if you're a fan of the originals -- if this is your first Trials game, you may enjoy it.
12948	Can't lounch :(
12949	Controller support for this game and trials evolution is f**ked ubisoft must have updated the game and broken them both
12950	â¥â¥â¥â¥ trials fusion it says i have praches asnother

12954	'trials_fusion.exe has stopped working' nuff said
12955	Can't lounch :(
12956	The game comes to a grinding halt when it forces you to complete some ridiculous tricks that you won't ever use in a race and never work the same way twice. Went from a fun time with my kids to rage quitting this pile of junk quite fast
12957	Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game. However I don't think it was worth buying. The reason being that there are barely any players to play with in multiplayer. If you play outside of peak hours , forget about it. Can't recommend.
12958	Buy Trials Evolution  it's playable
12959	Incomplete and inadequate are good words to describe this game. What it lacks in innovative moves or level design, it tries to compensate with a futuristic theme and weird music. The charm is lost and the humour is as good as a failed bunny hop. The multiplayer is incredibly minimal - you're better off playing excite-bike. Go back to Gold and pretend like this doesn't exist.
12960	game itself is not the worst thing... but the FMX trick system sucks. I cant even finish the stupid wind turbine training. they don't give you any clue how to do the trick and for some reason tricks overlap on buttons. I tride every button combination in different bike possisions &amp; twists, but he just won't replicate the screen. If you wanna play trials, go for evolution
12961	Controller support for this game and trials evolution is f**ked ubisoft must have updated the game and broken them both
12962	I love the trials franchise yet when i try to play this one i just have so many problems Firstly it takes hours for Uplay to do some crappy updates everytime i try to play and even when i wait those hours it will sometimes tell me there is something wrong with ubisoft and i cannot play WTF!!!!! Secondly when i do play i cant complete any mission past the skill mission becuase i cant perform any of the skills even thought i do exactley what it tells me to do. That is why i have given it a negative review
12963	â¥â¥â¥â¥ trials fusion it says i have praches asnother
12964	I loved Trials Evolution, but this simply doesn't feel at all like the Trials franchise...I won't buy again :(
12965	I'm talking as someone who never played the previous games...  Good points: - If you like putting a lot of time into something to get a perfect score then this game is as good as any for that sort of satisfaction - It's quite a nice game to look at - The track design is great  Bad points: - The Uplay severs are a joke (I'm typing this as I wait for the game to reconnect) - The game doesn't teach you the techniques for the harder tracks; you have to learn a lot of stuff for yourself once you start getting better - The PC version of this game is nowhere near as well supported as the versions for console - Multiplayer was delayed so long that hardly anyone plays the game now when it finally gets released
12966	This game resumed in one sentence:  CANNOT CONNECT TO UBISOFT SERVERS AT THIS TIME
12967	When I began, I enjoyed this game. Cool, really atmospheric tracks with some tricky jumps and spots that made me feel accomplished when I got over them. One level in the desert world Is entirely silhouetted with a beautiful orange sunset in the back. It was a great game to throw on some headphones, listen to music, and zone out to. Then, I hit the hard levels and the difficulty seemed to spike without warning. It became less of zoning out with a few interesting and well designed challenges to jumps you could only just barely make that didn't give you any satisfaction to finish. And then the extreme worlds. They're â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wretched. At this point, the game stops being clever with its design and just relies on its extremely imprecise controls to simulate difficulty, to a rage inducing point. Its simply not fun. I can't reccomend this game, as you will find yourself getting more and more upset with the controls. Why would you make bunny hop, a very crucial skill later in the game, such an imprecise trick? 75% of the time I tried to bunny hop it resulted in flinging myself into an unwanted front or backflip. I'm sorry, but you can't fall back on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls to act like your game is super tough rewarding experience. Save yourself the rage and frustration, and look elsewhere. Also, Uplay.
12968	Lacking in Content and Repetitive
12969	Uplay is broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥ I always get blocked out because it won't stay logged in or Uplay is offline. Don't buy inless you use money as toilet paper
12970	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I COULDNT EVEN GET UPLAY WORKING.  NOT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME, â¥â¥â¥â¥ COMPANY.
12971	Don't buy this game if you want to have fun with your friend online. 'connecting to ubisoft servers' is the only thing that you will see. Just refunded it.
12972	Looks fun.... Keeps crashing for whatever reason.
12973	One of the biggest disappointements in my collection. I wish I could blame uplay, but none of my gripes with this game have anything to do with ubisoft's sad attempt at making a steam clone. If I wrote this review the day I got it and didn't purchase the season pass along with it I might have recommended it because back then it was good for the price. Instead you pay 20$+20$ for a game that seems to run more and more crappily everytime they update it, the dlc isn't exactly mind blowing for the price and it's been almost a year without the promised multiplayer. Originally, back when I first purchased it I could run it on ultra (my system is better than their recommended), but now I have massive stuttering and frame loss especially on the newer dlc levels. At this point I've only gotten 3 of the 6 promised DLCs and I am ready to uninstall it and pretend I never got it in the first place. Might even harass steam to give me back my money for this garbage.  TLDR; You want to play trials? Go get Trials Evolution. In fact; go get a used 360 (if you don't own one) and get it on that instead because it doesn't have uplay stuffed up it's â¥â¥â¥.
12974	What a waste... I had tried the demo on Xbox and didn't like but I figured 'hey they made 2 great games before, they know what they do', well they do not. I love the first two games but this one is only broken version, everything I loved has gone : - Music is now some kind of pop crap - I had a gold medal in all the races (but extreme) within an hour. - The motorbikes seem less reactive, the quads are a shame - Who hadn't thought before 'it would be fun if we could do tricks', now we realise it is not. - No online multiplayer yet...  By or keep he previous one.
12975	Just finished the 'story' after about 5 hours, but there I a ton left to do earning medals and perfecting the super challenging expert levels that unlocked. Fun &amp; addicting, unfortunately that's offset right now by a few things like Uplay and online multiplayer that doesn't seem to work.   I also had some major frame-rate issues in some of the maps. I don't have the most beefy PC but I was able to run 95% of the game on high settings except for a few levels. I tried dropping to 'low' to see if things would improve on just those levels but no luck. Seems to just be a part of the game and with something that requires precision, it was frustrating when a jerky framerate would mess me up.  Realisticaly the uplay integration isn't too annoying once you set it up, but why can't I get Steam achievements instead of uplay achievements (or at least both)?    If you really dig this type of game I'd pick it up. But for the reasons above I couldn't recommend it at full-price right now. 
12976	Yet.. until this day, This game has not worked on my Core i7 Nv. Geforce 750... too bad, I was looking forward to playing it.

12978	This is NOT a bad game. Its not the best optimization I've ever seen, there's no getting around that but the gameplay itself is solid.  The problem stems not from the game itself but from the platform its on. This is literally one of the very, very few games I would warn against obtaining on your rig; if you have a PS4 or Xbone, get it on there because from what I'm told the community on those platforms is still thriving.  Trials -needs- a thriving community of track builders to keep it good since the default tracks on this are boring and quite honestly, the blandest they've ever been. I can respect them trying to give it a 'back story' in the style of Portal but really, it wasn't needed.  But the really killer is that the community is gone. What is Trials without its community?
12979	Dont buy this game because it has gamebreaking bug. The game slows down after you play it for a while and it has nothing to do with computers or graphics cards. Developers said to fix it a year ago and nothing has happened. Shame on you!
12980	Yet.. until this day, This game has not worked on my Core i7 Nv. Geforce 750... too bad, I was looking forward to playing it.

12986	Crashes every 5 minutes. Fun to watch twitch streamers play, but do not bother with it.
12987	The first level is the hardest. No not the tutorial stage, the uplay sign in. Game runs in slow-mo and have tried everything and thats when it even does log in...... 1/10 and thats pushing it.... total waste of money
12988	would not recommend because of ubisoft. Horrible support and devs are idiots. Issue with game not working right away from launch was solved by a customer. Meanwhile devs took the weekend off.
12989	Trials Fusion at this time is nothing I would recommend.  The game is have some huge issue with frame rate drops, that will force you into super slowmotion. Even though I'm well within the system requirements, set all settings to as low as possible and ran the game in windowed mode I'm still unable to play the game smoothly.  Besides all that... The game looks great! The music and vibrant colors really gets you psyched to play. Some of the annoying audio elements such as the riders voice and the announcer could be turn off which is much appreciated.  If you are way, WAY above the system requirements then buy this game! Otherwise, do and be hopeful for a patch addressing the major issues or.... Just don't buy it.  
12990	I want to start off with the good parts of this game. I played the previous Trials games on the console and I was hoping that I could continue the series on PC. To an extent, I did. The gameplay was as I remember, i.e., incredibly addicting and rewarding. If you were to compare stills of this game to the previous games, you could tell it looks incredibly better. But after I got past the introductory phase, I started realising how annoying logging into Uplay was. I also ran into frame rate problems. I'm not implying that I'm running a powerful system (my graphics card being a Radeon HD 7870), but compared to the smooth 60 fps I can maintain on medium settings in Metro: Last Light and Bioshock Infinity, I found the 40 fps and often 20 fps on low settings to be COMPLETELY absurd. I'm quite offended that the developers put less care to the PC version but I suppose it's my fault for assuming otherwise from Ubisoft. Although I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, I cannot recommend it to anyone without a more powerful system. The low fps is more than nauseating as usual but actually disruptive in the gameplay. Please play the demo, which I'm very grateful is provided, before thinking of purchasing it; something I was too anxious to do.
12991	The game keeps the same core aspects as the previous with added features such as the skill system and challenges and its gameplay elements are sound so if you have a good PC then buy it straight up. However...Requires Uplay to work, which, ok not too big a deal if it wasnt for the fact that it is so poorly optimized anybody on a medium to low computer specs is going to have trouble hitting 30FPS cosistently even on low graphics and not hitting that framerate severely effects the gameplay and responsiveness and if you are someone like me who tries to get all the achievements in a game then i wish i had advoided this. dissapointing considering how much i enjoy the gameplay when it works :(
12992	Crashes every 5 minutes. Fun to watch twitch streamers play, but do not bother with it.

12998	Just don't buy this. It's utter crap and not worth the money.
12999	Bought it For 5$  Cant Get my 5$ Back.......
13000	its a good game but recently it just crashes when you try to start it up
13001	I've loved trials for a long time and the game itself is good, not really great. The game wasent finished when released. The game is only a fraction of the content, after they released all the dlc. You might want the rest so you buy the season pass... But wait you missed some content because there is more dlc that is not included in the season pass.. so we got the game, got the season pass, and the extra dlc and we're good to go.. right? no? ahhh microtrasactions! because a rayman costum is totally worth real money. What else could they add to â¥â¥â¥â¥ us off. how about having to download a 2rd party program just to play the game. Uplay is usless, it just make the process take longer and just annoys people. fusion is a great example of the direction ubisoft is heading.
13002	do not buy uplay â¥â¥â¥â¥ it just dont work  only played it once and now cant even load the game up
13003	This has been this worst year for ubisoft, all there games have been horrible. Every year they get worse, but they have reached and all time peak. I really used to like your games, I'm just done. You have lost a customer.

13008	The game keeps the same core aspects as the previous with added features such as the skill system and challenges and its gameplay elements are sound so if you have a good PC then buy it straight up. However...Requires Uplay to work, which, ok not too big a deal if it wasnt for the fact that it is so poorly optimized anybody on a medium to low computer specs is going to have trouble hitting 30FPS cosistently even on low graphics and not hitting that framerate severely effects the gameplay and responsiveness and if you are someone like me who tries to get all the achievements in a game then i wish i had advoided this. dissapointing considering how much i enjoy the gameplay when it works :(
13009	I'm talking as someone who never played the previous games...  Good points: - If you like putting a lot of time into something to get a perfect score then this game is as good as any for that sort of satisfaction - It's quite a nice game to look at - The track design is great  Bad points: - The Uplay severs are a joke (I'm typing this as I wait for the game to reconnect) - The game doesn't teach you the techniques for the harder tracks; you have to learn a lot of stuff for yourself once you start getting better - The PC version of this game is nowhere near as well supported as the versions for console - Multiplayer was delayed so long that hardly anyone plays the game now when it finally gets released
13010	â¥â¥â¥â¥ trials fusion it says i have praches asnother
13011	It makes you launch Uplay every time you play this game which is really annoying. It also gets pretty boring really fast. Wouldn't pay the full price. Oh and the online doesn't work well. (at all). Im assuming you have to have a really good connection.
13012	Uplay....want a refund...
13013	Game keeps not working.. payed money for a game that I cant play.. I want my money back. â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
13014	Like so much that Ubisoft touch at the moment, this game is ruined by crazy levels of in game purchases for things we once got for free... and the annoyance I am having even activating the DLC I have purchased, correctly. I guess Uplay has something to do with it all.  After entering the product codes, the game tells me I have purchased all DLC, yet clicking on any of these items takes me to the store page via the steam overlay, suggesting I need to buy it, GRR.  The bug ruining Zombi was bad enough, forcing me to sit and wait in the vain hope it gets fixed, but this is a step too far. I am hoping it isn't too late for a refund should my cry for help go unanswered.  The game seems ok aside from this, but I have to warn others of the possibility of endless messages on forums.
13015	Poorly optimised pile of junk(lots of fps drops). Trials Evo was a better game. The multiplayer mode they finally relased is laughably bad with no trials mode, only supercross and is already dead. This will be my last Red Lynx game. Don't buy this, get Evo instead.
13016	i bought the game after seeing the 'multiplayer' stamp on it. when it was finally released i was sooooo disappointed. it only had local multiplayer. usually games which only have local has the stamp 'local' or 'local coop' on it. this doesnt, and they explain it with 'online mode will come later'. it has now been 9 months and we finally get multiplayer. amazing right? no, not at all. the online mode doesnt allow all tracks to be played like the last game did. it only accepts one type of track, and that is supercross x. which means all those amazing tracks you'd play as a ghost against your friends cant be played.  im so mad that i paid full price for a game that dissapointed me twice, first for lieing and then for promising 'online mode like never seen before' with an extremely toned down version of online multiplayer.  0/10, go play trials evo instead. its 100000000000000 times better
13017	There are three major issues that break this game for me. First, if you don't play for a while and want to start fresh, you can't. It's impossible to delete your Track Central data and start from a completely blank slate. Second, your times and ghosts aren't locally saved, so in order to beat your own times on the tracks, you have to have a cloud save, which cannot be completely erased. Third, you have install Uplay, a piece of software which basically duplicates Steam, in order to play.  
13018	Every now ad then I still play this title even though I find it incredibly frustrating to play. The only reason why I do is because I purchased the Season Pass, so I feel obligated to play when the new content releases. I feel that Trials Evolution was the pinnacle to this franchise. The tracks aren't nearly as fun to play in Fusion. The FMX tracks are a joke and would have been an addition that should have been subtracted. To say that I enjoy playing them would be the same as anyone saying they love a mouth full of cavities. I suggest that if you want to play a great Trials game then please pick up Evolution. Or grab any tablet and play Frontier (that one is actually a ton of fun).
13019	This is NOT a bad game. Its not the best optimization I've ever seen, there's no getting around that but the gameplay itself is solid.  The problem stems not from the game itself but from the platform its on. This is literally one of the very, very few games I would warn against obtaining on your rig; if you have a PS4 or Xbone, get it on there because from what I'm told the community on those platforms is still thriving.  Trials -needs- a thriving community of track builders to keep it good since the default tracks on this are boring and quite honestly, the blandest they've ever been. I can respect them trying to give it a 'back story' in the style of Portal but really, it wasn't needed.  But the really killer is that the community is gone. What is Trials without its community?
13020	the worst money ive ever spent
13021	I love the trials franchise yet when i try to play this one i just have so many problems Firstly it takes hours for Uplay to do some crappy updates everytime i try to play and even when i wait those hours it will sometimes tell me there is something wrong with ubisoft and i cannot play WTF!!!!! Secondly when i do play i cant complete any mission past the skill mission becuase i cant perform any of the skills even thought i do exactley what it tells me to do. That is why i have given it a negative review
13022	the worst money ive ever spent
13023	It looked cool by the cover, and would not work on windows 10, which made me highly disappointed
13024	Would be fun if it worked. Full of technical problems. Ubisoft you suck for destroying one of my favorite games.
13025	Not launching simulator 2015. 11/10 would install Uplay again.
13026	I bought the Deluxe edition or something, telling me I get the Season Pass too. I don't have the newest DLC...
13027	The gameplay consists of a Uplay product activation screen with the following text 'We're unable to register this game to your Uplay account right now as the Ubisoft server is unavailable. Please try again later.'
13028	The game itself is good. But they make you launch it through their Uplay launcher. For some reason when clicking on the Trials Fusion play button, the game opens up in the background but doesnt actually open. Then, if you try and play it again it has an error message saying 'Failed to start game (app already running)'. The app isnt â¥â¥â¥â¥ing running is it because I would be playing it if it was.  I've tried finding a solution for this problem online and it has been going on since 2013 and yet ubisoft are not fixing it at all. I have played the game once and it was fun but every time I've tried opening it since then I've encountered this problem along with a lot of other people over a number of years. Poor customer service, and the most frustrating thing ever when you've paid for a game but it wont even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing open.
13029	Whilst the game play is fun, I HATE THE FACT YOU SPEND Â£16 ON A GAME AND ARE EXPECTED TTO PAY EXTRA FOR THE WHOLE GAME. YOU HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER Â£16 ON THE REST OF THE GAME IN MICRO TRANSACTIONS  WWWTTTTTFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!
13030	Would have liked to play this and then recomment, but crashes on start up. Common problem. Getting refund.
13031	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I COULDNT EVEN GET UPLAY WORKING.  NOT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME, â¥â¥â¥â¥ COMPANY.
13032	Like so much that Ubisoft touch at the moment, this game is ruined by crazy levels of in game purchases for things we once got for free... and the annoyance I am having even activating the DLC I have purchased, correctly. I guess Uplay has something to do with it all.  After entering the product codes, the game tells me I have purchased all DLC, yet clicking on any of these items takes me to the store page via the steam overlay, suggesting I need to buy it, GRR.  The bug ruining Zombi was bad enough, forcing me to sit and wait in the vain hope it gets fixed, but this is a step too far. I am hoping it isn't too late for a refund should my cry for help go unanswered.  The game seems ok aside from this, but I have to warn others of the possibility of endless messages on forums.
13033	Game keeps not working.. payed money for a game that I cant play.. I want my money back. â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
13034	its a good game but when you first get it you have to do all this random stuff and what happend to me the game did not work it might just be steam glitch but anyway great game i heard from other people and you might not be able to get in the game
13035	Fun for a bit, I found the challenges a bit too difficult but then again I'm not very good at this game. Level creation seems to be very complex and could be fun if the controls weren't so difficult to get a hang of. If you can get this for free then it's worth the time, but I wouldn't spend money on it.  Also, Uplay blows â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13036	They want you to buy a $12 DLC even if you seasons pass. Also Uplay is terrible
13037	Game has held my interest for 2 reasons, soon to be just 1. First off this game Trials Fusion is like a stretched out version of Trials Evolution which is a way better Trials Instalment. The online gaming feature is only leaderboard competion's. You wont find anybody to play with and if you do it's just the two of you. good luck also if the connection stays long enough to finish the 4 seperate tracks you usually play people against. I have to say that they really dropped a butload of fecies onto the Trials franchise with this instalment. Most interesting part of the game is the Creator Mode. That has been my top reason for coming back to Trials Fusion. Second reason is 2 Extreme rated tracks I have not yet completed. Game is not worth whatever they sell it for, unless it's $5.00 for the whole game and DLC Season Crap and whatever all in one. Should be made into a free to play game. - 6/10
13038	waste of money i payed Â£15.99 for a game that wont start up what a waste of money
13039	Bought it For 5$  Cant Get my 5$ Back.......
13040	Just don't buy this. It's utter crap and not worth the money.
13041	Always says its running when its not, doesnt start because it is running.
13042	Would be fun if it worked. Full of technical problems. Ubisoft you suck for destroying one of my favorite games.
13043	it dont work for me
13044	A huge let down compared to their previous release, Trials Evolution.  The game was released unfinished and lacking in many areas. WIth no multiplayer/custom lobbies the game has zero replayablity for me after completing the single player.
13045	This game runs awfully.  I'm running this on a 390 at 4K (a set up that runs GTA V maxed out in 4K) and I have to drop Trials to low settings to even get a playable framerate, and even at that, I don't get 60fps.  Would not recommend.
13046	This game does not work! Can't connect to ubisoft servers keeps popping up. And No, I'm not going to open up any ports, disable my firewall or mess with my windows boot system. This is [SPARTA] 2016, fix your **** games, Ubisoft!
13047	Let me start by saying this game is actually really fun. The problem I have with it, is that it will not boot. It just crashes as soon as it tries to load. Well done Ubisoft, you have made another game which does not work on pc.   I had to edit the graphics configuration *myself* in order to get this game to boot. I should not have to finish coding the game for you in order to get the game to launch, and yes, this game has had numerous patches supposedly fixing all the problems it came with when it was released (HA!).  This has just solidified my reasoning that Ubisoft really doesn't care about the consumer.
13048	The game itself is good. Really good. You can make cars crash and feel like you're 12 all over again crashing your toy cars against each other and making noises with your mouth to distract yourself from your abusive parents (abusive parents are optional).  It's good. If you buy this, you're buying a good game, but I can't recommend it given how Steam is falsely advertising content that is no longer available in this game. You're not buying Burnout Paradise+All DLC, or even Burnout Paradise+Some DLC, you're buying just Burnout Paradise+DLC Advertisements and a DLC storefront that no longer works.  And that's terrible.
13049	One of the most frustrating games to play I've ever seen. It forces you to log-in via EA's log-in system, which is frustrating to no end before you even begin the game. Then it forces you to sit through an unskippable cutscene telling you how to drive a car, and how wonderful this great city you'll spend your time driving around in. Followed by a tutorial to teach you which button is the gas pedal. Followed by unskippable cutscenes explaining every single race. It's like they knew this would be a horrible game, so they make you sit through as many cutscenes as possible so you can't actually play.   What was the biggest deal-breaker, besides the boring gameplay, the constant cutscenes, and the didactic edification? You can't quit the game without being froced to pass through EA's 'Burnout Store' so they can panhandle you to make in-game purchases. Speaking as a lover of the Burnout series, this is a sleazy and nasty puddle of bile on top of a poorly made game. There are infinitely better racing/driving games. Play those.
13050	Incredibly fun, but you'll have to work your way past the in-game sales features that were stripped out of the game when the developer abandoned it. This means that periodically, you'll hit a button or trigger an event that takes you to an all-white screen you have to mouse you're way out of. It may not sound like much, but it turns a complete product into a constant reminder about the developer didn't care about end users at all (oh, it's EA, no wonder).  Since they didn't have the decency to patch the game and remove the offending elements (as if that would have been to difficult), this game can be considered irresponsibly abandoned, and without warning on the store page, I can't up-thumb it in good conscience, regardless of how much I enjoy the gameplay.
13051	Not all of the DLC was released for this game. I borught this game for the police cars that I now have learned I can't get :(.
13052	I like the game, I got it on sale, however the DLC are not in the 'ultimate box'. I can't recommend this given the misleading title.
13053	The game itself is amazing, but BEWARE - The Ultimate Box is just there for show. Most of the DLC is not here. :( Calling it the Ultimate Box is just misleading.
13054	I got this game because it is the 'Ultimate box' version. It's not very ultimate at all. There is NO big surf island included which to be honest was the main reason for me purchassing it.   No surf island.  No likey.
13055	Not Ulitmate at all.   Research before you buy cause you still can't get Big Surf Island for pc at all except for a fan mod. and you still have to buy all the extra cars for another $10.  Pretty much just the stock game with bikes and the game is no longer supported by the developer anyway.
13056	Doesn't 'Ultimate Box' signify all the DLC from the 'Ultimate Box'? Or was that just a marketing ploy to make more people buy it? That seems closer to false advertising than anything else.  Either way, I don't see any DLC apart from the pass-the-controller Party Mode, which is fairly useless on a PC.
13057	THIS IS NOT AN 'ultimate' pack for burnout. this includes one DLC that is free anyway, and the two basic dlc that come with burnout anyway. The game is still great, however dissapointing it was that i didnt get DLC with the game. Its fun, and a good game, but the controls are weird unless you have a controller
13058	Don't buy this game. EA ended support for this game. It's broken.
13059	Visualy its nice and the driving is awsome but if your looking for a game with some kind of a story, this is not for you. Its great if you just want to jump in a game and crash cars. Just not my type of game
13060	application has stopped working at windows 10
13061	meh!  I would rather have bought Burnout 3: Takedown for the same price.  It was a much better and enjoyable game. This game isn't terrible but just doesn't match up with it's predocessors.
13062	EA Games kinda leave you wondering where the rest of the game went. Oh well...
13063	Amazing game, but I can't reccomend it. The developer dropped this product, so if you weren't already a fan, I'd think twice before hitting the buy button on this one. Crashes constantly and is lacking a lot of support and DLC contained in the console version, not to mention the terrible UIs.  Amazing crashing game, but then again, crashing in two ways.
13064	I'm not a racing pro nor a big fan of racing games, but i tried a few. I want to start this review with pros &amp; cons, but these are just my opinions.   Pros:    Visuals --  The game is Beautiful  --   Open world --  I played with a few NFS titles and Street Racing Syndicate, and i dont remember that any of them had a real open world racing, and I mean racing, not freeroam. Yeah, I was waiting for that open world racing, but i must admit, that sometimes its very confusing, when you dont know where the finish line is.  --   Car Damage --  Yeah!!! I like the slowmo car wrecking :)  --   And I think thats all of the pros in my opinion. Lets check the cons.   Cons:    UI --  Dafuq!!! No speedometer, no tachometer... Is this a racing game or what? But atleast it has a Nitro bar... excuse me, a Boost bar  --   Invisible man --  I know that this is nothing, but this is not Knight Rider... I want a Driver in the driver seat  --   Manufacturers --  Just avoid this if you wish, but the car and manufacturer names are irritating me  --   Car customizing --  Correct me if im wrong, but the car customization in this game is equal to zero... or almost zero... you can choose from a few colors and paint your car. Maybe I played a bit too much with NFSU 1-2, NFSMW and NFSC, but in a STREET racing game the lack of car customization makes the game rly boring rly fast. And for me the customization, new parts, etc. count as motivation... so yeah i lost my motivation  --   Story --  I know, I know... if I want a story, then I should go and play Skyrim. But even in the NFS titles I mentioned before there were events and there was a main storyline, not so detailed as in an RPG game, but atleast I was motivated, but here... i lost my motivation twice.  --   Publisher --  EA... do I have to say more?  --   Ingame Store --  Abandoned  --    Concluson:   I really enjoyed the first few hours in this game, its an eye candy and sadly its only an eye candy, nothing more. Its the second day I play with this game, and its boring as hell. I know that my most pros and cons that I wrote are small things, but small things can make the game good or bad. In this case in my opinion the game failed to be a Good game. Its beautiful, but not even close to be good. To be honest, if u have the chance to win this game on a giveaway, or get it free, then give it a shot, but dont waste any money on it.
13065	Okay so Burnout Paradise is really fun but I feel like it has lots of missed potential. Hear me out. - The open world concept is a really good idea, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to then focus all the attention in 8 points of the world map. You're basically making every other place look uninteresting. - You can pick up events all over the map... Or the city should I say, since the areas outside the city almost have none. That makes the areas outside the city uninteresting. After driving through the roads a couple of times I wouldn't have many reasons to return. - Having everything taking place in the city makes the map feel cramped and hard to navigate through. Burnout is not a game in which I want to go slowly so I don't miss anything. - Good luck exploring a whole city without turn by turn navigation. Nobody wants to open a world map while driving. No, the road signs are not enough. - The events in the city make you leave the city almost all of the time. Which means that if you want to play another event you'll probably need to return to the city, and that feels like a loss of time for the player. You should never make the player feel like their time doesn't matter, especially after rewarding them for clearing an event. - The events start to feel repetitive after a while. Even if there are many types of events, if you are always racing to the same place, it gets kind of boring. - It doesn't matter how high you score in an event since the only thing the game acknowledges is if you passed or not. A rank system would have made the experience a lot more interesting. - The menus don't feel natural at all, especially the d-pad menu. This menu demands your attention while driving (or even while an event takes place), and unless you stop the vehicle there's no way to drive and navigate through the menu without crashing. It doesn't make sense to put the 'Restart last event' option in a place like that. - There's no explicit way to exit an event. You have to stop the car. I had to Google this. That is not good design. - The way to start an event leads to many accidental starts. You can't expect me not to push accelerate + brake in a turning point for any other reason than starting an event. - The classical music feels like a bad joke that was funny only the very first time. It doesn't fit in the mood of the rest of the game. - The idea of including different types of cars and adding motorbikes was nice, but poorly executed. It takes way too much time to find a junkyard and then change the vehicle for a certain event, not that it matters anyway because at least for now every vehicle seems to be fit for every kind of event. It makes me wonder why make different types of cars in the first place and not make just one kind. If you are going to make different profiles of playable entities at least give me a reason to use them. Choices should have a meaning in the mechanics, apart from the way the vehicle earns boost. - The respawn algorithm is just awful. Don't respawn me in front of a wall. Don't respawn me in front of a jump. - Takedowns don't feel as rewarding as they used to in other games of the series. Where is Impact Time? Why can't you do multiple takedowns at the same time? - No windowed mode?  Don't get me wrong, as I stated earlier this game is really fun. But it could be a lot better and that bothers me.
13066	Can't play it, apparently when I try to create an account the maximum number of Personas have been reached and I can't register an account.  What? I go to EA's site but they don't have log-ins, its Origin. I log in to origin but don't see anything about fusing Personas. If I knew what the hell the issue was I'd fix it. I'm not the only one getting this either, Duckduckgo brings me a thread on EA's site where a lot of people have this issue, and it's been marked as 'solved' but its just 8 posts with people saying they have the issue with no solution in the thread.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. Also apparently 'The Ultimate Box' doesn't actually bring all the DLC as advertised. lol EA.   Steer clear of titles needing an EA account. Thank God for Steam's refund policy.
13067	It may have worked at some point, but it's unstable at best on Win 7 x64. Stay away!
13068	I DONT HAVE ANY OF MY DLC THAT I WAS PRIMISED WITH THIS GAME WASTE OF MONEY 
13069	Even though the game is great, the ultimate box does not give you any important DLCs such as Big Surf Island and most of the car packs. I feel ripped off and I do not recommend 'the ultimate box' to anyone.
13070	I've played this game on the xbox 360 for over 700+ hours. It's nice too see burnout on the pc but it lacks all of the dlc's and I'm dissapointed EA closed down the servers :C
13071	one of the worst console ports!!! F*ck EA Games!!!! -I really enjoyed playing this game on PS3, but this is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!!
13072	This game is one of the most boring car racing games iv ever played. It is very repetitive and there is basically no evolution in the game apart from gaining new cars. Very dissapointed.  Much better games out there then this. I do not recommend buying this game.
13073	The Utimate Box is a lie. There's clearly DLC installed that is hidden behind a paywall. This is terrible in and of itself. But, to add insult to injury you dannot buy the DLC as the burnout store is unavailible. So the game taunts you with content that is installed, but not accessable. And a lot of it looks really cool.  The gameplay is fun. It is a fun experience. But, the fact theat the DLC isn't included in the 'ultimate' experience, and that it is flat out unobtainable is beyond silly.
13074	As someone who loves racing games, this one just never clicked for me. I sunk a good 50 hours into it back in the day on console and it was just okay back then. Any way you slice it, it is easily the worst of all the Burnout games (it's a shame the better games never made their way onto Steam). While a bit disappointing, Paradise was still a solid game at it's time, but it simply hasn't aged well. The city is bland, the cars handle very poorly and the takedown system gets really annoying over time. It seems we've had a deluge of open world racing games since this one launched, and with the exception of NFS Rivals, I'd say all of them are superior to Paradise in one way or another. Even The Crew, despite suffering dreadful gameplay, has a much more vivid and engaging world than Paradise. Not that this is a bad game, it's just the weakest in the series, below par when compared to more recent open-world racers, and for me, the âultimateâ kicker that turns this from a âbuy during a steam saleâ into a âno wayâ, is the fact that the game is blatantly falsely advertised. What EA meant by ultimate is a mystery seeing as it does not contain the DLC. Big Surf island, the most important piece of DLC released was never even ported to PC, and the rest of the DLC you have to purchase through Origin. How exactly is that âThe Ultimateâ edition?
13075	Honestly, I just find this game boring. It's not challenging.   'Here's a race, just drive down this straight road. Oh, great, you've done it! Here's a new car!' Seriously? Even with a B-licence greatest challenge is not to miss a road during a race, which happens way too easy, because the mini-map doesn't rotate in your driving-direction. But even when you take the wrong exit you can still win the race, because your opponents are pretty slow. So just drive on, if you get totally lost, there's a way to restart the race anyway. Even though you can't win anymore (2nd place doesn't count), you have to finish. Then drive back and start again.   The open-world-A-to-B-races just make you take the easiest (straight) road again and again. Because they work. Looking for a cool shortcut? Trying another route? Way to risky. Trying to break through a wooden fence may be succesfull... or end in a boring, unskippable slow-mo-crash-sequence. And not every crossing on the map is really one, because the road-height-levels aren't displayed.  There are good things about this game. The world is nice, many things to 'collect', great soundtrack. But for me there was nothing motivating.    I tried several times to find something. Something challenging. Mostly I left the game after about 30 minutes, because I couldn't find it. I guess I'll go back to NFS Most Wanted (2005) again...
13076	So I should start out with saying something nice. My three year old absolutely adores this game, and consequently we've played it quite a lot. This is his first experience with the series, it may well be my last. He has no concept of how many aspects of the series were sacrificed in the insane pursuit of an 'open-world' approach to racing games. He will perhaps never grasp how hollow every aspect of the game now appears in the light of a proceedurally-based sunrise, from the crashes, to the super jumps, to the minor variations on 3 routes that win all the races, to the billboards the game begs you to smash, defiling it's own logo OVER and OVER and OVER, as if the developers were working through some emotional issues. If the obvious cover-up done on the Van's paintjob is any indication, it was a cukolding experience for them. Oh, Criterion, remember when you were making Burnout 2 and Black? What led you to blue barrels and yellow construction signs acting as surrogate blues clues for toddlers?  In any case, by 'Ultimate Box' what EA meant to say was 'Box full of DLC for you to pay for', as this content isn't even Downloaded, it came with the game, you just have to pay to use it. That's right, there are several packages of cars just waiting to be unlocked for extra money, including the hovercraft delorean which makes every other car in the game seem lame. Oh wait, it's not actually a delorean, because EA had to slavishly rip off a bunch of brands without accrediting them. The car that looks like a Bel-Air has freakish air-time, making it the only candidate for completion of several achievements/unlocks.   And they put motorcycles in this game, probably to taunt you with how much you can taste an awesome Road Rash remake, but rest assured it's completely neutered, uninspired, and honestly looks like they just walked away before they got anywhere with that particular aspect of the game.
13077	This is a pretty good car and motorcycle driving game that allows you total freedom to go wherever you want in the huge world of Paradise City. And you don't have to do the challenges until you want to (completing challenges unlocks more vehicles). Although the game does have some MAJOR flaws (some of which are just plain stupid and should have been changed/fixed). There is no speedometer at all. You can't listen to your own music files on your computer while playing the game unless you run your own media player in the background. If you're playing online and your framerate gets too low, the game automatically kicks you from the server (even if it's your own server that you're hosting). Yes, you can get kicked from your own server if your framerate gets too low. There is no in game text chatting. You have to use a mic to communicate with other players on a server. As you upgrade your license, the races get MUCH harder because the AI will very often put cars right in front of you which are almost guaranteed to make you crash over and over. If you go too fast, you are very likely to crash over and over. If you take your time, it can be hard to get to first place. So it's a pretty good game, but with some MAJOR flaws. This game has given me an idea as to why EA was voted the world's worst video game company multiple times. Because of this game's MAJOR flaws, I don't recommend it
13078	The open world killed the serie for me. It's not about shortcuts, crashes and take down anymore. It's about pausing the game every 10 sec to look at the map. Plus the minimap doesn't rotate so you end up going the wrong way and losing the race. Then you have to drive back to the start of the race because it's an open world game and you can't just hit restart to restart the race. Same thing when you want to change car. You have to drive to one of the junkyard. I wish there was a 'fast travel' thing.  Driving and jumping around in the city is fun thought. And the music is great.  It's a shame they went the open world way. Burnout 3 was so much fun.  If you you're looking for something like Burnout 3, I suggest you pick up Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. It's made by Criterion and it kinda feels like burnout 3 (minus the crashes).
13079	Burnout Paradise Short Review  If it were possible, I would neither give a thumbs up nor a thumbs down, but unfortunately it isn't.  Some time ago, a friend of mine sent me a link to the Burnout Paradise OST on YouTube. Don't get me wrong, it really has sonme great music in it. But for me, a great soundtrack doesn't justify a mediocre game. I know, Burnout Paradise has an enormously big fanbase but I have to admit I'm not the type of guy who enjoys playing car games (except Trackmania). I didn't like Burnout in particular because, in my opinion, the entire concept of a driving game, where you only drive, isn't exactly made for an open world. I guess I'll return to Mario Kart xD.  So, unfortunately, and maybe very undeserved, I have to give Burnout Paradise a thumbs down.  Fun Fact: The GTA V map is almost the exact copy of the Burnout Paradise map. It really is irritating.  5/10 nice soundtrack but not my type of game
13080	one of the worst console ports!!! F*ck EA Games!!!! -I really enjoyed playing this game on PS3, but this is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!!
13081	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ crashes, has the worst menu ever and overall was â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by a horsedicked â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ from the dungeons of space
13082	I'd rather drag my balls though 100 miles of broken glass then hear 'take me down to the paradise city' one more time!
13083	Don't let the name fool you, its not the ultimate box. It's just the base game and the DLC doesn't even work on PC. If you want the base game, which is the best game ever, sure, but if you want all DLC (I did) don't buy it!
13084	I really liked the original burnout games on Gamecube and I have fond memories of playing them with my older brothers.  By contrast, this game felt half finished. The graphics were a let down. Even the handling and physics of the vehicles felt poor. Whilst expecting Gran Turismo mechanics would be absurd, this game tries to mask its laziness behind arcade-y-ness. I vote to pass on this title.
13085	UPDATE: THE GAME IS PRETTY FUN BUT IT WONT LET ME CONNECT IT SAYS MY CD KEY IS ALREADY REGISTERED -_- 5/10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY -_- THE GAME IS PRETTY HARD IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT YOU SHOULD BUY A CONTROLLER -_-
13086	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ crashes, has the worst menu ever and overall was â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by a horsedicked â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ from the dungeons of space
13087	Can't play online, EA closed the servers after 4 months the game came out, They blamed they didn't want to support PC so screwed all PC players with DLC's and no online play anymore.  Non the less its fun offline.
13088	The open world killed the serie for me. It's not about shortcuts, crashes and take down anymore. It's about pausing the game every 10 sec to look at the map. Plus the minimap doesn't rotate so you end up going the wrong way and losing the race.

It's made by Criterion and it kinda feels like burnout 3 (minus the crashes).
13089	Burnout Paradise.. Where do I begin? The story and aspect of the game is very good in the beginning. The soundtrack is horrible in my opinion, and it also took me ages to figure out how to turn it off. Aside from that, the game doesnt tell you the controls. You would expect the game to use arrow keys or wasd, but it doesnt. its a to go forward, and I cant even remember. Then, you cant even change the controls. So I couldnt use my G27 which I was hoping I could use, and I couldnt figure out how to do a thing. This game has potential, but sadly I was too impatient to learn the ropes I guess. If you want a game you can easily jump into, this is not your cup of tea. 2/10
13090	Another glaring example of how games are ruined because of the recent trend of injecting social and open-world elements. The first Burnout games worked because they were unique in what they offered. Now it's another drop in the bucket of overwhelming garbage where you can't just play the game without being bombarded with ranks and incessant social account reminders. But also the game is vague in a lot of ways and the camera was pretty irritating. If this were a physical copy, I would snap the disc in half and go play the first Burnout on ps2. At least it was fun the moment you booted it up without having to sit through half an hour of disembodied dialogue telling you all about how awesome it is.  Pros: I got this game in an ultra cheap Humble Bundle Cons: I got this game in an ultra cheap Humble Bundle Overall: The very first song it played to me was Paradise City by Guns n Roses. No.  Score: -0/0
13091	I really liked the original burnout games on Gamecube and I have fond memories of playing them with my older brothers.  By contrast, this game felt half finished. The graphics were a let down. Even the handling and physics of the vehicles felt poor. Whilst expecting Gran Turismo mechanics would be absurd, this game tries to mask its laziness behind arcade-y-ness. I vote to pass on this title.
13092	I was a huge Fan of Burnout 1 through 4 on the consoles, but this open world aspect here just bores me. I don't like to drive around aimlessly. The multiplayer just sucks and is quite dead. The DLC (Ultimate Box) doesn't actually work without some additional hackery thanks to EA abandoning this game. It's a shame Burnout 4 didnt get remastered for PC. I miss the crash mode especially.
13093	Soulless and bland. Mind-numbingly simple events and challenges with cars that practically drive themselves (not a one of them licensed despite all the money in the world to throw at the project), all set to a laughable soundtrack suitable only for the tastes of a fourteen year-old.  It's playable, sure, and the 24-hour open world is certainly novel, but that's about all  Burnout Paradise  has going for it.
13094	I thought this game would be fun, after having played Burnout Takedown and Burnout 3 for hundreds o f hours on PS2. I was dead wrong. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, and here's why:   -The bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥ navigation system.   A small road sign flashes for 1,5 seconds on the top of the screen to indicate which turn at each intersection you need to take, and this is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. You can have no idea what kind of turn to expect without taking your eyes off the road and looking at the map, and you crash when you do this.  -The bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥ shortcuts.   Are you winning? Are you in first place? Have you taken a shortcut in the last three seconds? Well then say hello to last place my friend! Enjoy your time in the last place while the game gives you very helpful directions like 'Exit' and 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t Avenue', all the while everyone else finishes the race and you drive around the map for fifteen minutes, unable to restart the race.   -The bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥ EA &amp; Origin account system.  Want to play online? You need to get an account. But wait, there's already an account with that e-mail. Got your e-mail but you forgot your Origin ID? You need to go f**k yourself. You miraculously have a functioning Origin ID? Here, enjoy the nonfunctional Burnout servers that we forced you to set up an account for!   -The bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥ damage system.  Remember when Burnout had a decent damage system on the PS2? The days when a damaged car handled differently? It's like that, only this time damage has absolutley no effect on gameplay, and is purely estethic.   -The bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥ music.   If you expect good, mood-setting, 'road trip' songs, well you can go f**k yourself. Enjoy generic, boring music. The game has ONE song, and that is Paradise City by Guns'n Roses.  2/10 would not recommend
13095	why is it called ultimate box if it gives no dlc :(
13096	Where is the DLC for this game? How to recommend but not recommend? D:
13097	Overall this is a great game! many hours of fun! but so much for 'ULTIMATE BOX'! Gives you â¥â¥â¥â¥ all dlc, just some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bikes...
13098	While the gameplay is fun and chaotic as it should be, the progression system is enormously unrewarding. Unless you force yourself to do it before then (completionism, yay), many of the cars will remain locked by the time you finish the game. The last couple of hours felt like a chore to me.
13099	EDIT: The game is good, loads of fun (look at my hours) but still, can't reccommend people buy something so heavily DRM'ed that you can't even get its DLC anymore.  Sorry guys, I don't care how good the game turns out to be. I simply cannot reccommend a game that takes me 10 minutes of fiddling with EA's DRM and closing their in-game popup ads; just to make my way to the main menu screen.
13100	The Good:  + It looks a little bit better than the console versions.  + Mods.  + Runs great on 3rd world computers if you're stuck in a situation like that.  + I used the picture of Goa  tse as my crash-cam.   The Bad:  - Music is fu  cking awful. Whoever said this game has a good soundtrack is either tone deaf, or they have terminal-stage taste cancer. Whoever thought Avril Lavine would make a great addition to a racing game's soundtrack, should be shot.  - No support for custom soundtracks. (Muting in-game music and running FooBar in the background is your best alternative).  - Car customization is rudimentary at best.  - Controller support leaves a lot to be desired. And by 'a lot to be desired' I actually mean 'make this fu  cking sh  it work Criterion!'  - Netcode is spotty. I was experience massive delay and lag spikes in a cross-region match (West Coast to Mid-West). Don't even think about doing international matches.   - Barebones graphical options. Very basic, they only offer resolution, vsync, texture quality, AA levels, and I think SSAO. There is motion blur in there, but most of you will turn that off.   - Advertisements are not updated. Burger King has been open past midnight for quite awhile now. In fact, they just begun location tests to measure how well 24 hr of operation fares.   - It gets old after playing it for an hour or so. Then you realize how shallow this game was, with the feeling of regret setting in because you wasted over 100 hours playing this game 7 years ago.  - Not enough blood or naked women.   Conclusion:  I had good fun playing the game back in 2009. Believe me, I platinumed the PS3 version and got 800~ gamerscore on the Heatbox 360 version. But at the end of the day, you realize this was a soulless game with an empty world that consisted of narrows paths that you are allowed to traverse on. You realize that the state of the racing genre is in despair, where arcade racers have regressed to the level of Burnout Paradise, and Sim Racers are struggling to keep away from the corporate-project driven stench that EA's an  us has bestowed upon their two most popular racing franchises.   Final score:  3/10. It's over-hyped medicore bullsh  it; only buy it when it's on a Steam sale.   Hardware used: FX 6300 16GB of DDR3 RAM GTX 770 A Hard Drive Integrated network connectivity Integrated sound card because I'm a pleb PS2 controller connected to a USB adaptor
13101	As much as I want to like this game, well I do, but I can't recomend it because yet again we have a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ization from EA. Usually when a game has a subtitle like 'The Ultimate Box' you expect it to come with all the DLC, yeah EA doesn't think so. After the store going down with no sign of any support whatsoever you literally have to mod your way to the 'ultimate box content' thanks EA! Don't like the music? tough â¥â¥â¥â¥, you don't get the custom music playlist like consoles do either, even though it could be settled with a simple patch. if you don't want to play music in the background on an external app and would rather have your music dynamic to the ingame effects the only thing you can do is change the song files in the most ridiculous way I've ever seen and done, also the only possible way, which didn't matter because after 2 hours of doing this it only rendered my game into an unplayable mess(simple audio files did this), thanks again EA! Lets not forget the obnoxious popup menus that you'll be greeted with every single time you launch the game begging you to use it's unnecessary social account, because that sure doesn't get tiring after the umpteenth time of launching to play. So as good as this game actually is as you'll see from the more positive reviews, I can't recomend it because EA got their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hands on it. 'Becuase remember; at EA we don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what the gamers want, we've already choked this game dry of every penny and moved on. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the developer And â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' &lt;3  Want my advice, save yourself the trouble and go buy Burnout 3 or Revenge
13102	Crap did`nt realize it was EA, they have a habbit of losing games from my ea account Syndicate &amp; BF3 HELL ive even got a profile set up for BF3 with scores n stuff but apparantly i do not own the game!! i puchased both titles at full price when released after multiple emails and various atempts to contact them i just get the silent treatment, i know it wont hurt em none but i`ll stay clear of thier titles and they have quite a few out since the loss of my 2 titles. This game looks pretty awsome and it probably is but EA is obviously too big to worry about the few so to date thats at least 5 titles theve missed out on. Sorry crap review but this situation has left me a little frustrated to say the least.  Hmm seams they have a new security system in place now which possibly means i could trust buying products on origin again iv`e changed passwords n stuff but still i think i need some sorta acknowledgement one way or the other well i`ll see if i can at least get that! if i can`t then F%ck em.
13103	The driving is fun and it has a lot of open world completionist type stuff if you're into that. I would like the game if it was easier to just pick up and play for a few minutes at a time. I found that things load very slowly. The menu system is slow and irritating. I'm also not sure why it's called 'The Ultimate Box' when there's no apparent extra content included. There's a broken DLC shop that pops up occasionally.  Basically, there's fun driving gameplay if you can put up with some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I didn't want to.
13104	Its says I've played 7.4 hours?  Nope, I've wasted 7.4 hours of my life trying to get past the title screen.
13105	It says that it's The Ultimate Box, but actually provides limited dlc and denies access to the rest.
13106	It doesn't even come with the full game! Are you serious EA?
13107	there are cars and motor cycles but you cant get any other dlc's :C
13108	Pros : Soundtrack. Open World. Cons : Can't login --&gt; Can't do multiplayer. I guess the servers closed  3/10
13109	It's quite a nice game, it reminds me very much of Rockstar's Midnight Club series, but the only reason I put with advertising is it subsidises cheap/free anything on the internet. Having advertising in a AAA game is unacceptable, and the fact that I possibly should have expected it from an Electronic Arts game just highlights how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ a developer they are.
13110	GOD DAMN GAME BLUESCREENS AFTER A FEW MIN OF PLAYTIME . i had high hopes for this game but to not even be able to play it is absoulutely frustrating. the game starts up then crashes... look for a fix and found numerous people with the same issue. try'd some of the fixes and got a few more minutes of playtime then crashes. ive given up of this game..... no other game i own crashes just this one!
13111	This is the plain edition of the game. No DLCs and stuff.  Burnout is one of the best games I have ever played. However, I can't really tolerate the fact that the 'Paradise Island' and all the legendary cars are not in the Steam version of the game.
13112	Woah man you have to register. As you registered i will forget your login information, so you can listen to Guns 'n' Roses FOREVER!!!!  I don't even like Guns 'n' Roses, Axl Rose is a clown. Why do i have to listen? Why don't you let me in options to kill the music at last?  Do you really need green grass and pretty girls only to reach the paradise? This is stupid. Oh, how kind, its on LOOP! LOOOOOOOP!   I HATE THIS SONG! I HATE THIS GAME!
13113	I LOVED Burnout series, started with Burnout, then Burnout 2 (Still the best hyper-realistic racing game i have EVER played) Burnout 3 was even better. Insanity. a lot of fun. i have nothing but the best memories of these games.  This is NOTHING like those. Its Terrible. Disugusting. It fills me with aimless hatred. I want to vomit all over myself in hopes of feeling better.  After sitting through far too much cutscene (forced to watch cutscenes explaining how to use an accelerator.) I drove around for a few minutes but kept getting interrupted by events, cutscenes, messages... I could not actually play the game it seemed.   Alt+f4 coz the menus are crap. where are the game settings? where is the damn options button at all? exit button? I had to search online to find out how coz the game itself does not say.  To get to the games config i was forced to go through the burnout store, listing a large amount of possibly great products that cannot be purchased because EA poo'd their pants with this one.  Ultimate box??? NONE of the DLC included.   The game is a Burnout Title, so i was expecting a burnout game. This is not a Burnout game.  Fvk this game, fvk EA, Im going out to find some hoodrats who want bare knuckles, then im going to lose on purpose in hopes of a concussion that will cause memory loss so i can be free of all memory of this steaming pile of dog shiz.
13114	It doesn't even come with the full game! Are you serious EA?
13115	there are cars and motor cycles but you cant get any other dlc's :C
13116	Pros : Soundtrack. Open World. Cons : Can't login --&gt; Can't do multiplayer. I guess the servers closed  3/10
13117	It's a great game but it would be nice if steam wasn't false advertising the 'ultimate box' part of it.
13118	this needs to be available for mac
13119	this â¥â¥â¥â¥er dont â¥â¥â¥â¥in work no more â¥â¥â¥â¥in take i9t back â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
13120	This is the plain edition of the game. No DLCs and stuff.  Burnout is one of the best games I have ever played. However, I can't really tolerate the fact that the 'Paradise Island' and all the legendary cars are not in the Steam version of the game.
13121	Woah man you have to register. As you registered i will forget your login information, so you can listen to Guns 'n' Roses FOREVER!!!!  I don't even like Guns 'n' Roses, Axl Rose is a clown.

Oh, how kind, its on LOOP! LOOOOOOOP!   I HATE THIS SONG! I HATE THIS GAME!
13122	I bought this game a few minutes ago, and I regret my purchase. I'm having tons of issues, and I'm quite upset about this. If I cannot get the game working, I will ask Steam Support for a refund. ;(   EDIT (2 Days Later): I have gotten the game working. Bugs (mostly) aside, here's my ACTUAL review below. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  For years, I'd heard little blurbs about this racing game called Burnout Paradise here and there. I'd seen it used at GameStop back when I was primarily a console gamer, but I never really paid it any attention. After seeing a popular YouTuber named NerdCubed do a video on it with his dad, I was sale hunting for this game.  The Steam Summer Sale came, and the game was $9.99 USD. A few of my close friends had the game, and loved it to death. I thought I'd pick it up, but it didn't just come with the game, nor just the DLC. I got an unwelcomed bonus - A NONFUNCTIONAL GAME. Multiple reinstalls, a lot of Googling, and hours of tinkering came before I got to properly experience this game. One problem after another bit me in the â¥â¥â¥â¥; the infamous DMV screen, crashing at the loading screen right when you start up the game... yada, yada. I got the game to open occasionally; sometimes, rarely, the game would launch flawlessly, and let me play just fine. The other 8 out of 10 times, it crashed. Until I fixed it, I'd only successfully launched the game three times in two days. I probably made 30+ attempts to launch the game. I tried every fix I could find on the internet, and none worked. I eventually thought to try Windows 95 Compatibility Mode 'again,' or so I thought. I thought I'd tried it already, but I must not have! After applying that fix (some people can only get it to work on certain compatibility modes; some XP SP3, some Vista only, some Win2000 only, etc.), the game launches flawlessly. Now, the only bug I get is the game freezes when I try to quit. Saves fine, just I have to manually kill the process on exit.   Steam claims I've played 8 hours of this game. I don't know how many hours of that (probably about 2) are just me trying to get it to launch properly. The game is phenomenal! The world is pretty large, with about 400 gates to smash (which lead you to backroads and alternate routes), and about 200 (I think, I'm not exactly sure) billboards to smash. Many of these billboards require you to do jumps on ramps to get to them, many of these jumps being at the end of the alternate routes that lie past those gates I told you about. I usually overlook elements like that in games, but in Paradise, I like going around and smashing them! Every intersection with a spotlight is a new race. You simply do a burnout (hold both triggers) to start one of these events; you have events where you must takedown other cars, races, events where you have to get somewhere without getting taken down, and more. There's plenty to do in Burnout Paradise!  There are over 75+ cars to choose from, as well as four bikes (which I think are more fun than the cars) added by the Burnout Bikes update included in The Ultimate Box. Allow me to note that TUB was a collection of all DLCs released up to that point; Criterion had no intention to keep making more expansions when they released TUB, but they did, The Burnout Store is down, so you can't buy the other DLCs if you don't go onto either Amazon or GreenManGaming and buy a code. The racing style is very arcadey, but you can also do barrel rolls and stuff when you do jumps, which feels very good and solid. On the cars (and cars ONLY, not bikes) you can boost your vehicle. You have different types of cars like Aggression (for takedowns and strength for when you crash) and Stunt (which are faster and more for doing stunts, but crash and are wrecked very easily). The driving in this game is great, and feels amazing.   The graphics in this game are pretty good, as well as the overall feel. My 650m cannot run it at maximum settings, but my buddy's dual Titans smoke it. It is a pretty good-looking game, especially when you crank it up. The visuals department is top-notch!  The soundtrack is amazing, although there's only one song I really pay attention to - 'Paradise City' by Guns 'n' Roses. That song alone makes the soundtrack AWESOME....!   Overall, Burnout Paradise is a great game. Bugs aside, I give it a 8.5 out of 10. However, with the bugs in the mix, I give it a 2.5 out of 10. I would not recommend it; it may or may not work for you. I don't think it's worth the risk unless you get it off Origin, so you can return it within 24 hours with their Great Game Guarantee.
13123	Grand Theft Auto is a great game, but the driving parts can get boring sometimes.   This is like GTA, only with nothing but driving
13124	After trying several fixes, the game persistently crashes about ten seconds into loading the game. I use Windows 10 and my PC easily meets the recommended requirements for this game. I can't recommend a game I can't play.
13125	I was an Original Burnout, and Burnout 2 player for a Long time. When take downs came into play that hampered the thrill of street racing, and pulled the focus off the racing.    This game has really good graphics, phyisics, a wonderful feeling of speed in game, addictive play, good varity of roads and conditions, the feel and response of every vehicle is different and requires you to learn each one.    This game pays awesome tribute to the look and feel of what made Brunout Great, the open world is fun to race non stop throughout, the selections of challenges is large, but this game has a few features that Really get in the way of My enjoyment.    So much time is wasted in Cinematic moments, at jumps, at crashes, at take downs, at race beginings, at race endings, at paint shops, at repair shops, at gas stations, each time taking control of Your car away from You. All the time this causes me car to crash, or go down the wrong street... Changing the frequency, or turning that off would have helped so much...   I can't change the zoom on the minimap to actually use it, and moving through all the menus just to get to a useable map took a long time because even menu screens have a cinimatic effect, choosing a car has a cinimatic effect, and nothing could be skipped.    Open world also meant no restart buttons if you failed an event, so you have to back track to the starting point by yourself, and this ate a Lot of time.    If you can handle a world where the car never stops, and cinimatics leave you without control of your vehicle often, the rest of this game is awesome. I still hope to learn some patience with it, and I have yet to test online play so I'm hoping that may help. I LOVE open world racing games, but this one may not be the one for me.
13126	worst port â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ever...
13127	this game sux dix
13128	My least favorite entry in the Burnout series. Prepare to be making love to a lot of concrete walls, barriers, other cars while you fumble with a map every 2 seconds.
13129	this â¥â¥â¥â¥er dont â¥â¥â¥â¥in work no more â¥â¥â¥â¥in take i9t back â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
13130	Awful! This game is nothing like the Burnout I remember. It is really lame and I'll tell you why. Also, the game is called 'The Ultimate Box' but it features NO DLC! It was the same price on Origin, and it would have DLC.   The soundtrack of the game ain't bad at all, I actually picked up on quite a few songs.  The big problem is the racing. I wonder who came up with the bright idea of a race in the open world.  I don't know. The game is not amazing. Watch IGN's review, for the first time I geuss they are really credible.
13131	Back in the all too distant past at university a guy on my corridor had one of the burnout games which featured an amazingly fun looking mode where you had you cause as much damage as possible by crashing into an intersection and that is why I bought this game. Much to my disappointment the equivalent mode in this game just wasn't that great. You just start a crash on any stretch of road with limited degree of control and all the cars swerve towards you until you reach a required target. The older version was more like a puzzle to solve with a fixed arrangement of traffic.  That was only the start of the disappointment, the biggest problem is with the phrase âUltimate Boxâ. When a game proclaims to be a superlative edition my expectation is that it is the base game combined with all the available DLC but no this is the base game with the free updates only. When you try and access the DLC it takes you to a store front that no longer works and they are not available on Steam either. There are apparently ways to buy the DLC but I didn't like the core game enough to want to investigate this option.  The actual game continued to disappoint me. The game has an open world environment however the actual races all end in a small number of locations making all the races seem unnecessarily similar. The races do not follow any fixed route but the navigation system is terrible, you have a compass that shows you the overall direction to the finish but the only clue about which road to take is a little road sign that pops up too late to make the turn in the faster cars. There is also a mini map but looking at that is a sure fire way to crash into something so effectively you just have to learn the map. The game progression is too unfocused for me, you just complete an arbitrary number of races to unlock the next licence. Also there is no option to quit or restart and event you have to complete the event and then drive all the way back to the start point.  The other annoyance is all the collectables. I do love a nice set of collectable items in a game but this just has too many for it to work. There are 400 gates to smash through, there is no way you can collect all these while still having fun, you must just be driven by the desire for completion. You are bound to miss a few and then end up painstakingly going through a walktrhough revisiting all the locations till you find the ones you missed. And there is not just the gates there are jumps and best times on every road and biggest crashes on every road.  One of the items of DLC that did come with the ultimate box was the multiplayer party DLC which was again (I keep coming back to this word) disappointing. It had no split screen options, the events are repetitive and the load times are just that bit too long so it starts getting aggravating as you are passing the controller between players.  All of these problems are a real shame as the core game engine is excellent with great driving, spectacular crashing, a decent range of cars, a good map and variety of events. And in the sale this cost less than the price of a bus ticket. Given all the annoyances in the game I can't bring myself to recommend this game.
13132	I can't recommend this given the Misleading title since the DLC is not included in 'The Ultimate Box'!
13133	CD key didn't work when I loaded it up. There wasn't even an option to enter one, It just cut to 'The CD key is invalid' Returned immediately.  two slit wrists/10
13134	Nice game but the multiplayer is to desolate,and the package cannot buy it -_-
13135	eyyy, total forgot I had this game. Its okay to play solo, though ive not played multiplayer. honestly you can love it but i like my freedom for carnage.
13136	I truly loved this game on the PS3 and ive come to love it on here, playing a game of tag with my friends online is always fun but for all that i have to say the one thing i have a problem with is that the DLC Big surf island is not available.
13137	The keyboard controls for this game are TERRIBLE, and it is incompatible with my Xbox One gamepad, the very same one I use for tons of other games. Look around online, and you will see plenty of threads with other people having this same problem.  Don't buy it. Although it might be a great game, it's a poor PC port in terms on controlling the game.
13138	Not really what i was expected.. Crash Physics is ok,but the car i rammed just crashes into a corner and not fly  it takes 3 presses of F1 to just quit and save the game Navigation sucks,i always get lost in a event. Does not let you ingame without login  but overrall 6/10 but i wouldn't recommend unless you want to..well,do the things above Burnout Legends is better
13139	It is with a heavy heart that I give this game a thumbs down and say that I cannot recommend it. Not because of the game itself, tragically. No, the game is one I consider to be possibly my favorite arcade racing game of all time. I end up comparing most new racing games to this game, and nothing has come close to the amount of fun solo and with friends as this game.  I cannot recommend this game simply because its broken. It's up to you whether or not you wish to try your luck, because I'm aware that quite a few people can just download the game and play with minimal effort. Apparently the online mode still works, too!  I'm one of the ones on Windows 10. 'Did you try disabling/uninstalling your webcam drivers?' 'Did you try running in fullscreen or windowless border?' 'Did you try enabling/disabling your microphone? Webcam? Both or alternating?' 'Did you try running in compatibility mode?' 'Did you try running in Administrator mode?'  These are all questions being asked amongst users on Windows 7, 8, and 10 in the forums. None of the troubleshooting or tweaks made the game get past the main menu for me and many others. It's a shame that EA doesn't want to support these games with post-mortem patches. Say what you will about newer versions of Windows, change is inevitable. And it's sad that gems like these might be the things that are lost.  If you can somehow play this, enjoy it. You may not be able to enjoy it for much longer. I fear games like the new Star Wars Battlefront, Need for Speed, or anything by EA will eventually fall to the same fate.
13140	My car has at least 37 Gears (facepalm)(Discovered running thru Freeway accelerating non-stop without crashing (car or game!))  Positive point: Remembered me of ENDURO (Atari 2600) Counter negative point: Remembered me of Big Rigs Over the Road Racing......
13141	There is pretty much nothing to do. The city is lifeless and bland. There are no people at all. The driving physics are mediocre.
13142	ea as usual â¥â¥â¥â¥ing everone they get a chance to i really hope all the consloe pesants stop buying their â¥â¥â¥â¥ so they go out of business
13143	Fun for a while then it gets kinda boring.
13144	Only buy if you are under 11 years old.
13145	Play Burnout 3 instead. Boring races and annoying DJ Atomica.
13146	0/5 wouldnt buy, basic EA â¥â¥â¥â¥ = doesnt work
13147	Don't get me wrong I LOVE this game. Look at all those singleplayer hours, but you know- usually if you are just buying the game itself, the title doesn't suggest that you are getting all the dlc that you are apparently forced to get via Origin.
13148	It's a pretty decent racing game. You will play it and find little things that tick you off after a while and uninstall the game. Months to years later you will reinstall it not remembering what was so bad, then within seconds of playing it all comes back to you. The decent part about it is that the driving is very fun and very fluid, 2 qualities that make or break racing games. SO, what ticks me off you ask? The narator that wont shut the â¥â¥â¥â¥ up stating the obvious after you have been playing for hours and know everything already. The fact that you can just bearly scrape against an object and it goes into a slomo action cam as you reen off course in a metal ball of scrap signifying your loss of 1st place (this will happen every single race more than once). Don't get me wrong, going over 140mph is really fun and satisfying, but when your only 5 activity options include smashing billboards, racing, jumping off ramps, and finding shortcuts all for collection's sake you will get bored quickly. The driving and racing part of this game are flawless and make the game, the â¥â¥â¥â¥ of everything else breaks the fun part.
13149	BORING ! ..............there is barely ANY traffic, no cops to chase you, the only time you get to do anything is when you race, that is already old in just the short time i have been playing. Really nothing else to say about this game, there isn't anything in the game worth talking about, a lot of emptiness.
13150	You can't disable driving assist. Game will make turns for you the most of the time. I feel like the game plays itself 70% of the time, and there is no way to disable this. Arcade game or not, car control should be left to the player at all times, or at least give us a way to disable driving assistance.
13151	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING STUPID IT THINKS I ALREADY USED MY CD KEY WHEN I ONLY HAVE 2 EA ACCOUNTS â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS DONT BUY IT
13152	Crashes like crazy
13153	Great game but the dlc isnt there or what it says is in the bundle
13154	Negative: - No options in singleplayer to configurate the keys/buttons for keyboard or controller. - You can not 'end the game', you have to tab out to the desktop and end the game through right click - &gt; close program if you want to quit playing. - Game has no own tracks, you just drive through the whole world where events will be started - Multiplayer partymode is a joke. 3 short quickmodes which are done in under 30 seconds.  Really, this is absolutely crap, developed without heart. Dont buy !
13155	Open world burnout. Previous installments of the game did a better job. Driving physics aren't bad at all. Dog fighting physics aren't very predictable. Takedowns feel unrewarding. Getting taken down feels cheap. Music isn't too bad. Coming from Burnout 3, this game is very disappointing. Open world burnout does not work well, players will often find them selves looking at the map directions instead of driving. Very easy to crash into wall mid race, not that it matters, there's enough rubber banding to make the game feel pointless. Very immersion breaking. Your car will blink its signals to tell you to take the next turn, it's a fairly useless way of directing the player.  Again, biggest problem is the dog fighting physics. It feels like â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13156	DON'T BUY IT!  Origin account got hacked. people tried to buy stuff on my card. my card is always empty. they failed miserably. I went to close my origin account.  EA say 'if you delete your origin account it will delete all of your games on origin.'  i dont care. i only had BF4. Without telling me they linked my starwars the old republic account to origin.  They deleted my account and Â£150 worth of in game items. Also deleted my burn out account and would not let me make a new one with my product key. GG. â¥â¥â¥â¥ burnout. â¥â¥â¥â¥ origin. â¥â¥â¥â¥ EA Never again will i ever have anything to do with EA and I recommend anyone else reading this to take the same path. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est customer support EVER! not to mention their servers going down all the time.
13157	 EA AT ITS FINEST
13158	If you're like me and you want to buy this to try and relive 10 years ago when you played the first 3 burnout games... you are gonna be disappointed. It's clunky, the shortcuts make the racing unfair, 8 times out of 10 you won't take the right turn while you're racing and when your car is all â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and destroyed it will run the same as other peoples brand new car. 2/10 only because it's a burnout title.
13159	I Would Recommend this game, had Steam or EA try to fix the countless bugs it has. It crashes every single time. During the intro, after races, when you're casually driving. I honestly think it's a great game. But there has been no action taken towards fixing these problems that the game has. Until they do, this game was a waste of money.
13160	The beginning race auto turn when someone bumps you tho &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
13161	Was fun while multiplayer was alive, but oh well.
13162	Good game, but no DLC
13163	Disabling AA fails to prevent the game crashing during the loading screen. All the options in the configuration window aren't visible due to its fixed boundary and the inability to resize the window manually. Altering the resolution also fails to resolve the issue. Steer clear unless you want to gamble, gl and try and have some fun.
13164	Not for me. The cars felt attached to the ground and the whole experience was  just...loud?  Overdone? This didn't click.
13165	Mediocre compared to Burnout 3. Have to waste time driving around an open world map to get to races/events instead of just going through a menu like normal. Also has a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ account system that is required to access multiplayer. Go buy a Flatout game instead.
13166	Negative: - No options in singleplayer to configurate the keys/buttons for keyboard or controller. - You can not 'end the game', you have to tab out to the desktop and end the game through right click - &gt; close program if you want to quit playing. - Game has no own tracks, you just drive through the whole world where events will be started - Multiplayer partymode is a joke. 3 short quickmodes which are done in under 30 seconds.

13169	Unless it's at an arcade, I've never liked racing games. This wasn't really for me. It was bland and all you really do is drive around and hit stuff.
13170	This game is terrible and brings great shame to the burnout franchise. Burnout 3 and revenge are much much better. This game is totally redundant and a waste of money. I'm sorry I bought it.
13171	it toots sucks butt
13172	DLCs that come with the ultimate box version arent even available.
13173	So this is a game.  A game that, if you forget your username in, it will never let you play.  Before you ask how I forgot my username, to make a long story short, I eventually just slammed my fist into the keyboard until I got something.  But yeah, when it's not slow as molasses, it's telling me to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. 0/10
13174	I Would Recommend this game, had Steam or EA try to fix the countless bugs it has. It crashes every single time. During the intro, after races, when you're casually driving. I honestly think it's a great game. But there has been no action taken towards fixing these problems that the game has. Until they do, this game was a waste of money.
13175	requires an online account to be able to play a game offline horrible concept and mechanic keeps me from playing a game i loved to play on the console tried all my known logins and emails and none work you cannot bypass the login to play a game you paid cash for, nice EA
13176	If you don't like the song 'Paradise City' you will hate this game, If you do like the song 'Paradise City' you will learn to hate this game quickly... Other than overuse of this song, the game itself is rather mediocre, and doesn't live up to the previous titles in the series.
13177	Haven't logged much time into the game as of yet. But the extras they promised  with the Ultimate Box edition aren't available. Any of them.  Steam lets this kind of false advertisment continue on their site?  Disappointed that they're letting this offer still remain on Steam. Its just wrong, and against the law.  I want either a refund or the items promised.!
13178	DON'T BUY IT!  Origin account got hacked. people tried to buy stuff on my card. my card is always empty. they failed miserably. I went to close my origin account.

13179	Great game but the dlc isnt there or what it says is in the bundle
13180	This game is terrible and brings great shame to the burnout franchise. Burnout 3 and revenge are much much better. This game is totally redundant and a waste of money. I'm sorry I bought it.
13181	Crashes like crazy
13182	Have no idea what kind of lunatic ported this game to PC but apperantly he wasn't paid well enough. PC games should not ask to press X or circle to do some action. Literally unplayable.
13183	Unless it's at an arcade, I've never liked racing games. This wasn't really for me. It was bland and all you really do is drive around and hit stuff.
13184	I Would Recommend this game, had Steam or EA try to fix the countless bugs it has. It crashes every single time. During the intro, after races, when you're casually driving. I honestly think it's a great game. But there has been no action taken towards fixing these problems that the game has. Until they do, this game was a waste of money.
13185	I have about 20 hours played on the PS3 version of the game. I picked up the Steam version on sale hoping another honest shot with PC-quality graphics would be enough to re-awaken a game I hoped would be amazing.  It didn't.  Long story short, it's no 'Burnout 3: Takedown' and it's for two major reasons:  1) The camera angle.   The camera is at just a low enough position and angle to be annoying. I spent my ENTIRE time wishing I could just..grab it and...move it...up..just a little bit....but no. The game doesn't let you. I don't mind if I can't control the camera precisely but this is a FAST-paced racing game. I need to be able to see CLEARLY what's ahead of me. My car takes up too much of the screen and there's no way to get the angles you want. It's an ongoing frustration that really became a dealbreaker for me over time. The camera is too low and at too shallow of an angle.   I know it sounds nit-picky but it's one of the absolute first things I noticed when I started playing the game. The camera is your worst enemy.  -------------  2) The fact that the entire career mode takes place within the open world.  On paper this seems pretty cool...except it means they should have titled this game 'Burnout: Orienteering'. This design decision means that the game is reduced to 'memorize the city layout and use the same roads over and over again'. Don't feel like trying to navigate a brand new city at 100 MPH? Too bad, you have to do that before you can do ANYTHING else in this game. This game demands that the player spends too much time memorizing street names, locations of gas stations, etc. rather than enjoying the fast-paced action that the Burnout games are best at. Don't get me wrong, the action is still great...but it gets lost behind this annoying navigation layer that's present for 100% of the game!   Countless times I wished I could just tell the game to screw off with the city navigation stuff and just give me a track with flashing yellow signs that shouted 'THIS WAY, DUMB-BUTT!' with occasional shortcuts hidden around, like Burnout 3.  This problem is further compounded by the fact that all races end at 1 of 6 locations. This means no inner-city circuits, etc. Growing up on Burnout 3, yes you played the same stages over and over again but it worked much better because the stages were discrete levels. You didn't get the feeling that you were spending all of your time in the same square chunk of land from 0% to 100% completion. Effectively, the game turns into 'Themes and Variations on 6 tracks'.  If this game had discrete tracks like Burnout 3 I think I would have enjoyed it much more. Burnout 3 still stands out as my favorite game in the series and one of my favorite racing games of all time. This game....ehh, I really wanted to like it because it did a LOT of things right - it kept the core of the 'racing/crashing game' that burnout was best at but it obscured it with obnoxious camera angles and mandatory city memorization that just killed the experience for me. Discrete tracks let you memorize the game's levels in doses - one track at a time. Burnout Paradise forces you to learn EVERYTHING at once and it's just a frustrating ordeal when you just want to get in there and crash some cars.  Too many things obscuring the core of an otherwise great game. Sorry but I just didn't like it. It did get me to play Burnout 3 again though, so it's got that going for it...?
13186	So this is a game.  A game that, if you forget your username in, it will never let you play.  Before you ask how I forgot my username, to make a long story short, I eventually just slammed my fist into the keyboard until I got something.  But yeah, when it's not slow as molasses, it's telling me to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. 0/10
13187	The beginning race auto turn when someone bumps you tho &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
13188	Was fun while multiplayer was alive, but oh well.
13189	I don't give many negative reviews, but in light of all overwhelming positives for this huge commercial game, I'll say my beef.  Reeks of console port, no reconfigurable controls, music not to my liking, unskippable cutscenes, completely inability to talk to others online, infuriating menus, cluttered horrible console-esque hud, I'd rather boot up SAMP and play that for a driving game FFS. Why can't I say GG? Why can't I ask a question? How is a game supposed to have a community without a public chat function? I hate multiplayer games that let us play together but turn us into mutes.  Perhaps worst, car physics feel floaty, unrealistic, and unlikable. You know when you got in the Buffalo or anothe RWD car in GTA: San Adreas, and the whole car buckled down upon acceleration as the rear wheels bit into the earth, giving a vague impression of a real car would act? This game has NONE OF THAT, it's floaty and terrible.
13190	I just couldn't get this game to work properly with Windows 10 in Big Picture mode. As an arcade crash game, it would have been ideal for a bit of streaming via a Steam Link using the Steam Controller. However, the audio would continue, but the screen would randomly freeze in game. Several posts suggest using Windows 7 compatibility mode, that I couldn't figure out how to do through 'Big Picture'. In the end I'd spent a over 30 minutes on it, so I went for the refund. I just couldn't guarantee that is would work. If you still use Windows 7, then maybe this is a bargain in the sale. Otherwise it was too much hassle to get it running smoothly. I guess being an old game it was going to be hit and miss anyway.
13191	It looks so beautiful that it hurts to know that instead for enjoying driving fast you have to watch the mini-map all the time so you know where to go. Maybe my res isn't much but after 0.1 sec I realised something is in front of me, I crashed. It's so frustating to know that half of time I need to watch crashing cutscenes instead of driving. Loading takes long (and you have to hear that annoying song every time you start the game), you can't skip cutscenes, settings are hard to find. I waited half a year before I played this game and maybe that's why it hurts so much to know that it wasn't worth of it. There's games that make me laugh. This didn't.
13192	Shoddy port. Crashes on Windows 10 constantly and no legitimately working fix anywhere online to be found.
13193	I bought this because it looked like a fun driving game. The basics of the game seemed like a good idea. You start with a car from the junkyard and a learners permit. You cruise around looking for races/events and participate to upgrade your license and get new cars. It seems like every intersection has an event so it wasn't too difficult to find stuff to do. I don't like playing though. It feels like work to me, not the kind with a pay off at the end though. It feels like everything is pointless. The cars feel and look generic. The ui feels cluttered and is difficult to navigate. I could not reccomend this game to anyone. I could only be happy with this game if I was to get a refund. The crashes are kinda cool though.
13194	This used to be a great series, fast chases, great maps, and simple fun! However after playing this game for about 20 minutes I was absolutely disapointed. Terrible nevigation system, bland city, silly unlock system, and no story at all. Sorry but this game was dead the minute EA got its big money grubing hands on another great game series.
13195	i accually like the game but after the first gaming experience, when i closed the game it never re-opened, although i uninstalled it a few times and re-downloaded but no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing difference. thats the only â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reason i give this game a dislike. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game 
13196	Terrible, Just Terrible...
13197	absolute crap let down, seriously they went from a masterpiece like burnout 3 takedown to a heap of â¥â¥â¥â¥ like this!
13198	Marketed wrong, No DLC comes with the Ulimate Box and you can't buy it from the in game store, its a great game and just annoyed that I was being lied to for my money
13199	Just not fun at all, Not much else to say!
13200	This game is terrible. You get to drive around a boring city, with lame driving physics until you stumble upon an easy race which you will most certainly win without trying.
13201	Doesn't work... Game starts up fine, entered my EA account and it went to the loading screen to load up the game, but instead of loading the game, it just crashes, i tried everything people have said on the internet, disabling my webcam, adding -multithread in the steam settings to the game, enabling the game into Windows XP (service pack 3) also every other versions of Windows before 8.1, but to no avail. If i actually manage to fix it, I would give this game a thumbs up since I've played it before, and had a blast, but since it doesn't work here, won't bother.  Luckily I didn't get it full price :^), only got it for 1.30 euro's :^)
13202	If you enjoy what a child thinks a car drives like combined with the steering level of a child you would have Burnout Paradise! A garbage game that boasts a huge world, which you will learn within five minutes and then immediately grow tired of it, because even in GTA we â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate driving to get to missions and races. You would figure GTA San Andreas had a huge map and tons of missions, so something like Burnout wouldnt even need guns or the insides of buildings or much dialogue, right? Well, they pretty much get the size of one GTA San Andreas sized town with the same missions over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Garbage.  Garbage. 3/10 Garbage.
13203	If you're looking for a classic Burnout game this is NOT it! My overall critique for those that don't want to read the whole Review is, Buy it on sale! The price, at date of review, of $19.99 CAD is too much for what this game is. There are better racing games for the price and I suggest you look at some of them first!  This is an Open World racing game with Burnout-like mechanics. Road Rage is still one of the funnest game types you can play, with Marked Man following a close second, but becomes progressively harder the more you do it. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it allowed you hit as hard or defend as well as the NPC cars. It goes from NPC cars wondering into walls, basically taking themselves down, to almost god-like AI that knows exactly when you plan to boost and/or ram and reacts to you. I fine with a challenge but this is a pathetic substitution for skill/balance.  Navigation in Paradise City is Hit or Miss, mostly miss as in oops I missed my turn! There's a compass/navigator that tells you when to turn but sometimes it doesn't activate until your on top of your turn. It's like driving with that one cousin that points out the side window as you pass your turn to say, 'that's the street we were supposed to turn onto!' which blows a substantial lead as you end up in a close 2nd. About as annoying/frustrating as it gets! Also, the races are bland and feel forced. You race because you have to in order to progress and don't get me started on the 'Stunt Runs'. They are the worst part of this game. There is so much they could have done but didn't do. It's sad really!  I didn't play much of the online portion of the game, as I just don't care for that sort of thing, but from what I could see there was no Party Games which I remember fondly from previous Burnout games. The lack of game modes like Eliminator or Party Crash was a big let down and what is in game for online multiplayer is lack luster at best.  One annoying feature I found is the fact that your car looks half destroyed all the time. After you repair the car it looks nice for about 10 seconds and one bump later it looks like crap again. All this with no penalty outside of Marked Man or Road Rage. Your car never reaches critical and never blows up outside of those two game modes. Also, miraculously, your car seems to auto repair on the fly. How? Why?  That's just one in a long list of annoying features that I won't list. There is one other that I can't ignore and is by far the most annoying thing about this game. As time goes on, and you start progressing your licence, you come across cars in the Open World that you can take down to add to your collection. They get sent to your Junk Yard and can be switched there. This is a cool idea that I like, in fact, I wish there were more cars and that they were harder to take down. Now for the annoying part. During one playthrough I was able to collect 5 unique cars before, progressing to the next level of my licence, and was required to go to the junk yard to switch cars. A crane drops your newly collected car and begins to pan around it to showcase it in all its wrecked glory. Cool I think. Then it does it again for another car, and again for another. All this is unskippable for about 10 seconds each. I want to get back to racing not watch the same cinematic play for 5 different cars.  In conclusion, if you're still reading this, this game is good with some annoying features. It just doesn't feel like a burnout game in many ways. The Overall Racing is bland and the Stunt Run is just not worth mentioning, in fact I wish I could forget it even exists. Road Rage and Marked Man are the most fun and most challenging game modes. The lack of party games, which I fondly remember from previous Burnout tittles, hurts my rating of this game severely! Your car looks like trash all the time and sometimes repairs without reason which is beyond weird. Little annoying features pile up to make a real love/hate feeling.  This game is fun in many ways but because of the little annoyances present in the game plus the lack of other Burnout features make it too hard for me to recommend. The current price of $19.99 CAD is just too much. I suggest waiting for it to go on Sale, until then this game should be avoided.
13204	Paradise City? More like Garbage City! Unskippable Intros! Non working controls. Hideous graphics. Paradise City Song from Guns'n'Roses? Come on. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, you stupid game.
13205	As a racing simulator 0/10 As arcade racing game 5/10 But the scenario is open world and there are a lot of bridges and steel structures, so you can just look at them, it's enough. Do't buy for more than 1,5â¬
13206	WTF My game keeps on missing textures some one help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  &gt;:(I&gt;
13207	the driving is alright. the crashes are good. its silly having to drive to each stoplight to start races. mediocre overall.  5 out of 5.
13208	It's a very cool game and the fun part of it is really playing it online. There is almost no people online, so there you have it.
13209	BEWARE CANT GET THE OFFERED DLC.
13210	1) Wouldn't let me skip the needlessly long intro cutscenes. 2) For the life of me I couldn't find a menu to configure graphics... 3) ...or the controls for that matter. I never got the car to move before I... 4) ...had to ALT-TAB out of the game as I couldn't figure out how to quit it either.
13211	Boring and repetetive. Sad that this is tthe last game in the Burnout francise, atleast for a while. I has it's moments but you end up not really caring about the huge selection of cars and amazing jumps because the race missions are so boring. Hasn't aged well, only condsider buying at a greatly reduced rate.
13212	I'd stay away from all EA games. It's almost impossible to play online with this. I spent over 2 hrs with EA customer service. Uninstalled and reinstalled the game twice, and they still couldn't get me signed in and playing online. Stay away from EA games.
13213	terrible music, terrible controlls, not really any tutorial or instructions, and the gameplay is stupidly close to driving around in gta4. as much as i hate gta, it would be more worth your money to get gta (or just get an xbox360 and burnout: revenge,)  don't make the same mistake i did, thinking it would be good just because it was called burnout
13214	EA being EA. False advertising and outright lying. If you REALLY want it just get it on a console or wait till a sale kicks it down to $1. It's not worth $20, not gimped the way it is and locked out of DLC we should have gotten permanently.
13215	BEWARE CANT GET THE OFFERED DLC.
13216	Terrible (TERRIBLE) wheel support.
13217	No local multiplayer (no splitscreen)
13218	Just awful.
13219	If you were expecting the classic Burnout sega from PS2 days, stop. This is not it. This is a ill mantained version with little to none resembaance. Online party creation is catastrophic whilst the classic road rage gameplay has been severely reduced in stock, like gravy. Don't buy unless you want EA to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.
13220	Boring and repetetive. Sad that this is tthe last game in the Burnout francise, atleast for a while.

13221	itÂ´s a pain having to sign in EA account. i had forgotten my user name and password, and I canÂ´t create a new one because thereÂ´s one already linked to my email from dont know which game. Then i have to reset the password and try to remenber the username.  about the game i played it for a few minutes and wasnt impressed, thereÂ´s no menu tab for controls that i could find and it took me a while to figure them out, you speed with A brake with Z and guide with the arrow key, felt really awkward. if you press S your car will start spinning on the air and you can press shift to make it spin more, this is totally unreal and it takes too long each time, and i couldnÂ´t find a way to skip it. and I couldnÂ´t find a way to exit the game through the menu either, had to press alt+f4. 3/10
13222	It's uh...burnout? I guess?  So first off, the DLC cars don't work. I'd reccomend using an unlocker.  Second, however, this isn't the best Burnout game. It's a really good entry, but it's still far from as good as 3. The cars are mostly cool. I'd like it if there were less wonky paintjobs for the 'upgrades' as it were, but over all they're pretty cool. The driving feels a little more weighty and sometimes it feels like you're going faster than you ever could have in the previous titles.  Then you miss a turn in the race event or get creamed by an Inferno Van coming out of the left entry to the junction.  This is an open world Burnout game. Which is both good and horribly bad. It stays open world even when you're racing, and whilst there are Burnout 1-style turn signals, you're going to be staring more at the minimap than anywhere else, which will make you crash into either a wall, oncoming traffic, or an already crashed rival several times.  The open world setting only really works well with the Market Man, Stunt Run and Burning Route events. The Races require navigating an entire â¥â¥â¥â¥ing city as opposed to navigating a long track with shortcuts (which we were taught to do in Revenge and minus the shortcuts in Takedown).  I'd recommend just getting Burnout 3. The only real painful race in 3 is the US Circuit Racer Grand Prix.
13223	A disappointing purchase.  I was a big fan of Burnout Revenge on the Xbox 360 years ago, and was hoping to have a similar kind of experience in an open environment. I was wrong. Everything just feels so dry and lacking the charm of the previous games, even the soundtrack sucks.   I don't feel the sense of speed any more, the carnage, the motor going nuts as you crash through traffic going 160+ mph. It feels like they sucked the soul out of Burnout and just stuck it in an open world, that hinders the experience more than helps. If you screw up a race big time, you can't just easily hit 'restart' and give it another crack, no, you have to find yourself all the way back to the beginning again.   Others have obviously found enjoyment in this game somehow, but if you've played Revenge and are looking for a similar experience, give Paradise a skip.
13224	its a good game but calling it 'the ultimate box' when it is missing the massive DLC island that you cannot even buy anymore is a bit disingenuous
13225	The game maybe is goed but in registration EA â¥â¥â¥â¥ me and i uninstallet
13226	controls are terrible. try to find how to quit game without asking google. 2/10
13227	I can't get this game to stop playing Guns &amp; Roses. I hate, hate, hate Guns &amp; Roses. Not to mention it constantly tries to get me to play online. I am SO disappointed in this game. Sniff some petrol instead ay
13228	
13229	boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 2/10 don't buy
13230	The driving part of this game is great. The open world, fast cars and loads of things to do make for a fun few hours of game play. The UI is crap. Absolute garbage. I haven't played this on anything other than a PC, so maybe that is the issue? Either way, getting into the game is a chore.
13231	Aside from being falsy advertised, this is basically a racing game. Burnout has never been a racing game. I came here to crash cars into copious amounts of traffic, instead I found a deserted city and some lame DJ from SSX. Leave it to EA to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up probably the easiest game to make; where the only point is crashing cars. What a joke.
13232	Didn't enjoy even a minute of this game.

13235	This game sucks
13236	this game sux... â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up controls.... bad graphics... no options to change controls or graphics or sound (not that i know of)    this game is basicly try not to rage simulator   dont buy    UPDATE: to configure SOME of ur settings u have to go to library and right click on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. than click configure settings or smthg like that.  although game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ at start... slowly starting to get use to the conrtols.        still wouldnt recomend         unless u want to waste time money and patience.
13237	if you enjoyed the crashes, the PS3 version is better the pc version goes into slo-mode, feels like 'Watching paint dry'  and there dosent seem to be anyway to to turn off or disable (message me if you kno)  This is the ONLY game I enjoyed on a PS3 (I've never own one, I'm a pc man) and the ONLY game to make me ALMOST buy a PS3 (thank goodness for my hundreds of oyher pc game :)

13239	Graphics and detail on the cars are above average, sad to say thats not the case for the terrain
13240	Didn't enjoy even a minute of this game.

13246	Don't get this. If you have aa ps3 of xbox 360 get it on there because it has one more major dlc that this doesn't, Big Surf Island. Othere than that it does have most dlc that consoles had.
13247	bought game for 9.99 and within 12 hours it went on sale for 4.39   10/10 would get ripped off again
13248	They (steam) say its the ultimate editon of this game, all you get is the game and the bikes dlc and thats it, i bought this expecting the frll package. I ordered a full sandwhich and got bread instead.
13249	Well, I got suckered. My first burnout game in years, and my first on PC, and there's no crash mode. NO CRASH MODE. That's the whole reason I bought this Burnout game... Crash Mode IS Burnout! Well, not here, it isn't, 'cos it doesn't exist. â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13250	3/5  I've only played for 4 hours so far so take this FWIW.  I think the game engine is superb for it's time, the graphics still hold up today, the physics are great, and the base gameplay is good. Despite this, I don't really like the game that much.  I've played most of the previous Burnout games, and this one by far has the most repetitive, and unrewarding gameplay.  The game feels incredibly easy, the AI is very wonky, and predictable, and there's almost no challenge in the game but to grind through a sequence of races, and takedown events, with some jumps/shortcuts thrown in between.  The first Burnout game was extremely difficult, one mistake and you were out, this game is far too forgiving.   I really don't like the open world idea for a racer, you have to rely on the minimap and some last minute directions to figure out the correct direction on a race course, it ruins the flow of gameplay for me, and I would prefer a much more linear, and non open world racer.  I still gave 3 stars because clearly it's a good game at it's core, but personally I cannot bare the tedium of repeating almost identical events over and over again to unlock the next level of license.  It's worth pointing out the controls are very unresponsive, especially the menus, and the layout of the game is absurd, the minimap icons are not very clear either.
13251	Very bad port from console. I've never seen so wrong made main menu in whatever PC game. Which idiot decided that you must choose pages in the main menu by F1 and F2 on your keyboard?! Model of open world is very bad, because there are not many things to do, some challenges or time trials only, so you go aimlessly around the city and search what to do. The multiplayer is incredibly horrible because of old EA servers, where is useless to have an active account, because they replaced them by Origin. If you join the multiplayer finally, you will find out that it is not much different than SP and there aren't many possibilities as well. Only positive is fantastic song Paradice City, but it is only song in the game, what is minimally strange.  The conclusion : I expected much more from this game, the metascore 87 must be a joke.
13252	This game is a total piece of trash. Not only does it require you to sign up for a bs account, but it also requires that you use the most god-awful controls known to man, assuming you use a keyboard. Even if you make an account and use a controller, you're still stuck with locked framerates and poor multiplayer. 0/10, just buy Sega all stars or whatever it was. It performs better, doesn't require any extra bs, and is pretty much a better racing game all-around.
13253	I would not recomend getting this game on steam as origin will make you buy the game a second time cause they are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥,  11/10 game  Crash simulator Burnout paradise has crashed unexpectedly when trying to log into orgin account. Best EU west.
13254	whatever i try to do i cant turn
13255	how do I actually play this!?
13256	This game is outdated.
13257	Most casual racing game I've ever played. Most boring Burnout I've ever played. Quit defending this trash as one of the best racers. Nobody knows â¥â¥â¥â¥ from applebutter when talking about racing games on Steam anyway, everyone on Steam loves to play terrible nerd games and feel like they are in position to judge racers.  tl;dr, don't even think about buying this trash heap
13258	Everyone talks about this game like it's the second coming of racing game Jesus, but to me it's a bland sandbox racer with no outstanding features for itself to hold itself up upon.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that it sucks harder than that vacuum cleaner did on that lonely Saturday when you tore your skin trying to simulate a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13259	I would not recomend getting this game on steam as origin will make you buy the game a second time cause they are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥,  11/10 game  Crash simulator Burnout paradise has crashed unexpectedly when trying to log into orgin account. Best EU west.
13260	honestly for a time this game was fun for me but since i cannot get the Big Surf Island on PC and since i cannot get the special cars or movie cars and such then this game is not as cool as it could be and also a minor note here they used tolet you go off a splitramp and do a few barrel rolls but now its stuck to one ballelroll and it will not do more even if you go off the clif jump and try to flip as hard as you can (i used to play the older version before they patched it and you could flip untill you hit the ground and flop magnificently) but now the fun is taken out and only lets you do one flip which makes it hard to crash in fun ways if the fixed these issues i would play all the time again but they didnt so i guess maybe a 5/10
13261	This is a terrible port. The in-game menus are counter-intuitive. No easy way to change key bindings in-game without going to main menu? I was so frustrated with it after only playing 5 minutes I decided not to play any more. Wow.
13262	DJ Atomica is a â¥â¥â¥â¥
13263	This game has none of th arcade fun that made burnout revenge fun. I would avoid it.
13264	Warning! Game activates your webcam on default without asking for permission!  It is probably benign, but you have no way of knowing so!  
13265	DO NOT BUY - IT'S A SHAM! Pretty much all of the DLC has been discontinued and cannot be activated by any means. Criterion Games has abandoned the game entirely - so you can't play with your friends, either.
13266	well since my account apparently doesn't exist, even though i have 90 hours in game. I'm going to have to say this game sucks due to the fact that every time im about to win a race or something the crashes, however if i lose the game is fine. of course thats only when it remembers that i do have an account. So â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. and i know its a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ review.
13267	This game used to be more fun than I remember but driving around a world where you have to drive to get EVERYTHING feels annoying without fast travel. Depends on what experience you want. This game feature an open world, I prefer the old Burnout games without the open world. But still a fun game.
13268	Don't buy this game. Just an other bad console port. And if you buy the ultimate box you don't get the extra's because EA has closed the servers for that content.  Menu is awefull, driving is bad. Multiplayer is no fun.  Only the music amused me.
13269	My experience with Burnout Paradise has been a bit underwhelming. The graphics are really pretty, and the racing parts are good at getting the adrenaline pumping. It's an open world racing game where your objective is unlocking new vehicles and finding collectibles. If you like that, then this is your game.  What kills it for me the most are the moments that interrupt the flow of the game -- specifically, the slow-motion scenes every time you do a stunt or come close to wrecking and the unskippable voice-overs. Keep in mind, all of this is my opinion, but the way I see it is this: In a racing game, game flow is everything. When I'm driving a race car, I want the drive to flow smoothly because driving fast and passing opponents are what I find rewarding. I get into the zone, so to speak, so every time that flow is broken, it feels like a punishment.  In Burnout Paradise, there are game elements that are meant to be punishing (crashing, being taken down, failing a stunt, etc.) and there elements that are meant to be either helpful or rewarding (explanatory narration, slow motion cinematic for taking down an opponent or completing a stunt, etc.). However, since both the rewards and the punishments interrupt the game flow, all of them feel like punishments. To be specific, changing both the camera angle and the game speed is disorienting and takes me out of the zone. There have been a handful of times where I would takedown another racer only to crash into a wall myself because my concentration was broken while admiring the slow motion carnage.  What's more, it's pretty clear from the awkward interface design that this is a console port. At the time of writing this review, I haven't yet tried Burnout with a controller, so it's possible that using a controller will make the game feel much better.  The gameplay itself is pretty fun. That feeling of adrenaline you get when screaming down the road in a race car while taking down other racers is very thrilling. Unfortunately, I feel as though I spend just as much time, if not less time, racing as I do watching dramatic slow-mo shots, listening to some guy's voice, or fiddling around in menus.
13270	I want to enjoy this game, I really do, but everything feels too clunky. Controls aren't exactly the greatest and getting into the settings menu was tedious. Settings are not easily accessible, nor are they easy to find. Not much for customization either.
13271	Its really annoying to handle,especially on PC. Also,the graphics don't look good and the sound is waaay too loud.  Besides,there is completely nothing to do in the game itself. If you really want to buy this game,wait for a sale or look at the humblebundle.
13272	Bad; -no special cars or toy cars come with this. This is not 'Ultimate' at all.  -can't buy them as the store is perm closed -no one is online to play
13273	Quite possibly the worst PC port ever concieved. EA have truly outdone themselves with this disaster, and I have sympathy for anyone who paid full price for this. A complete mess.
13274	Repetitive and boring.
13275	So much to do and none if it is any fun. There's no point in playing a racing game when all of the cars handle exactly the same- like really fast hover-busses.
13276	I never thought racing fast cars could make a game crash this much. The online is also pretty shabby
13277	This is a very different game from the other Burnout games that I've played. It is very free but also very little structured and you often feel confused on which way to actually take and is this shortcut good or does it take you to somewhere you don't want to go. Special cars needed to take down aren't marked so you have no idea if you've passed it several times driving trough the town. It feels like you reeeeally need to drive around for hours before you have gotten a bit of the map down to know which roads to take in a race. The effect of this is that it feels extremely easy to pass event when you do take the right path or do what you are supposed to. It is fun to just drive around going on jumps and finding stuff but it feels like the novelty of that kind of driving would pass after awhile. After all, it is the events I want to do and when you have to drive around to find them and can't restart them without a big hassle that I feel like this cross betweem GTA and Burnout doesn't really work for me.
13278	Got this as part of the origin humble bundle. Firstly, on the driving game scale this is about 99% arcade and 1% sim. It's fun at first but overly easy, which rapidly makes the whole thing feel meaningless. Controls are okay (except for the menus, which are a pain to navigate) but it's obviously all designed with a game pad in mind. The whole 'one seamless world' thing is just annoying. It seems to me that they've essentially replaced a nice simple menu system for choosing your next event with a big map that you drive around randomly, trying to find something you want to do. It's not really a bad game, but it's very throw-away. I doubt I'll be spending any more time with it.
13279	if you love unskipable and constant cutscenes, annoying and constant narating, and a game that's only goal is to play minigames to unlock more of the same minigames, buy this asap.  honestly it has good driving mechanics, and looks rather nice. it's fun to drive around in the city, expecially with a controller (the keyboard controlls are pretty dumb, not listed anywhere, and not customizable) but the in-game music you can't turn off, a person who's always telling you pointless info, and VERY frequent moments where you just have to wait for the cinimatics to finish, it's a bit annoying to play.  p.s. it also doesn't save your game progress online with your EA account, so I lost all my gamedata when I reinstalled windows :(
13280	another poor pc conversion , alot of the items fromt he online stroe can not be added either   save a tenner or just play it on ya gaming console :-)
13281	Start it 10 times, 9 times stop working
13282	where the f**k are my dlc's, its a box set
13283	This game is a good game. It has a large map, decent graphics (considering it's not exactly next-gen), and interesting cars. However, the flaws that the game exhibits makes it difficult to play. The menu and UI is akin to something one might find in a nightmare. The map is, at times, convoluted to the point of insanity. The worst, in my opinion, is the complete and utter lack of racing guidance within the game. During a race, you are given the task of getting from point A to point B, and you must get there first, ahead of all the other opponents you will race. The issue lies in the fact that there is no glowing arrow telling you which route to take, and the world is 100% open during said race. So, while racing, I can garauntee that you will spend 90% of your time watching the map, the compass, and literally every other piece of HUD that MIGHT tell you which way to go. Because one wrong turn, and the race is over for you. Now, I know what you're thinking. 'This guy's lame, he doesn't know how to race!' Well, that may be true. Except that as you progress in the game, the speeds increase, and reaction times grow short. The AI knows EXACTLY where to go, and you are busy navigating. So would I recommend this game? No. Because you will not spend your time racing, you'll spend it navigating an unnecessarily complex and open race track.
13284	Compared to the Xbox 360 version, this game is a complete piece of trash. WOW. You do not know how hard it was for me to say something negative about a PC game.
13285	The mechanics of the game did not work for me.
13286	A prime example of why the racing genre is dead. More inbred than Charles II of Spain.
13287	I'm extremely outraged at the developers of this game, in that they've decided not to show us the person inside the car. ARE WE NOT ALLOWED TO CHOOSE OUR OWN IDENTITIES WITHOUT YOU OPPRESSING US? As a tri-gendered multi-ethnic pansexual vampire stock car driver I was looking forward to being able to customise my character and instead you fasCISts decide not to even allow us that? Check your white binary-gendered straight cis human privelege!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13288	I want to like this one. I really really want to like it, but I don't and cant recommend it. The graphics are nice, good soundtrack and good controls. Where this game is broken is the open world - drive to the next race/competition. It removed what made series unique and fun . The races occur in the same open world that you just drove across. Burnout: Takedown is one of my favorite games and this is a poor substitution.
13289	Would not reccomend, loved the racing aspects, but the techincal issues just made it absolutely unplayable. Ended up being unable to sign in via my 'persona' ended up registering the exact same one several times before I hit the persona limit and walked away. Got a version that let me by that, and ran into the fact that DLC is preinstalled, but it dosen't let you use it until you pay for it, as if I wanted stuff I didn't have on my hard drive. Add in the clunky interface and it just made me walk away in disgust.
13290	I really tried to enjoy this game because I had heard a lot of good things about it but in the end I have an empty feeling.   It isn't really bad but it doesn't do many things right either. The handling of the cars feels loose and similar to an old saints row game. The city is devoid of any life or character which makes it extremely tedious to repeat the same races in the same locations. The menu's are ugly, the radio announcer annoying and who thought it would be a good idea to show me replays whenever I perform a jump? Oh and don't get me started on the annoyance when you take a wrong turning in a race due to the inept map system.   It's irritating because a solid effort has been ruined by poor design choices. The more I think about those six hours playing this game, the more I wish I had just started playing Grid much sooner. Save yourself the time and money and get Grid.
13291	This game may have burnout in the name but it feels more like a need for speed game to me. The Burnout series has always been about battling for number one against the other cars. This game took away from that with fact that you now choose your own path to the finish line. It gives you a notification when you're supposed to make a turn; however, if you're like me you end up missing some of those turns taking a completely different route to the finish never seeing the other cars again. It does still have road rage and boost, but in normal races I end up taking people down at the starting line then never seeing them again. It lacks the arcadeyness that made the series awesome. It does have a lot of events though since every intersection has another event. It also has a lot of collectibles (crashing into billboards, through gates, jumps) which will give you something to do but in the previous versions all your collectibles were just achievements, like getting a takedown off a mountain road ('gone fishin''). So, in conclusion if need for speed (minus cops) mixed with burnout sounds good for you then you should buy it, otherwise don't waste your money.
13292	Open wolrd racer with burnout license.  This game throws everything that definse burnout out of the window aside of the boost mechanics, instead it tries to be a Need for Speed game. If you expected a clasical burnout, dont buy it.  The ability to ride bikes in this game feels attached and is incredibly unenjoyable, so if you thought that might be cool you are mistaken. While the actually driving is well done, the game is very repetitive and the whole open world mechanic doesn't really work for Burnout. The best part of the game is its main menu theme (paradise city), just buy a guns and roses album instead and be happy. 'nuff said.
13293	Made by Ea. Origin accounts on a steam game is very annoying.
13294	I fell asleep when I was driving. Gladly it was a game.
13295	Horrible game , 90% waiting for cutscenes and loading , 10% rubberbanding , 0% fun.
13296	Burnout has definitely taken a turn off the main road with this installment. Although the taking-out of cars is still a thing, it's not focused on at all in this game. I dislike this game for that matter. Otherwise, this game is meh and I wouldn't recommend this to you. You'll have more fun with any other game for this price.
13297	I got this game in the EA Humble Bundle. I was very excited for it at first, as I enjoyed the previous games in the Burnout series and this game had a great metascore. However, this game ended up letting me down on every level.  The game design is bad, the difficulty as you progress becomes cheap and unfair, the menu interface is terrible, it sneakily tries to make you create an account for the game, and the open world is incredibly confusing and can screw you over if you take the wrong turn during a race.  I had nothing but frustration with this game. I still beat it, since I want to beat every game on my backlog but I highly recommend that you not get this game if you haven't purchased it yet.
13298	This game is trash, I mean it.  I played about 20 min and I cannot stand it. If you really want a driving in an open world. Get a game like GTA, SR, or Sleeping Dogs. Those have way better driving experience and you will have a lively city in those games instead of a ghost city- you see no people in this game, even in your driver's seat.  Buy it only if you cannot spare a bit more to buy a uptodate urban simulator such as GTA5 or SR. It is a cheap (I did not mean price but its quality) alternative if you just want the driving part maybe you can consider this game.
13299	It's alright for 15 minutes but it just becomes kinda boring
13300	I fell asleep when I was driving. Gladly it was a game.
13301	Don't Bother
13302	If you don't mind EA and their policies butt-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing you at any given chance they get, then sure, go ahead and pick this up.
13303	This is rly â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't buy it
13304	the emphasis on free-roaming ruined this game.....worsened by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ menu interface
13305	There's only one thing I wanna say about this game:  MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHH!!!!  No, seriously... why would you make an arcade-racing game, where you have to wait for like 10 minutes until you can drive a car?
13306	Meh, all I can say about this one.
13307	Mixing the fast paced action mechanics from the previous installments with an GTA-like open world setting was a terrible idea. You have to drive through a boring designed town to find races and when you find them you constatnly have to be aware of the mini-map for not loosing track and thus fail the the race. Furthermore it's heavy-handed to restart a race and browse through the confusing menus. I really have no idea about the good reviews, I was an average fan of the previous installment but I wouldn't recommend Paradise even as a discount.
13308	I just don't like the concept. Way too arcade-y and the city concept just doesn't work.
13309	Horrible game , 90% waiting for cutscenes and loading , 10% rubberbanding , 0% fun.
13310	I fell asleep when I was driving. Gladly it was a game.
13311	I bought this game to relive the fun I had playing for hours on my PS3, but I could not have been more dissapointed. The controls were awful with terrible controller support. Everything takes ages to load on a decent system (i5-4690K, 8 GB RAM and R9 390). There are tons of screen for content that is no longer available. Tons of content from the console version is not present and never coming out (I know this game is pretty old at this point).  For someone having played this on a console before, don't bother as it can't live up to past experience.   For a new player, give it a try, it can't hurt but this is one purchase that I quickly refunded.
13312	It's alright for 15 minutes but it just becomes kinda boring
13313	I don't recommend buying this. It's very buggy and no multiplayer. The controls are trash and it's very hard
13314	if it is a gift it is equals the â¥â¥â¥â¥
13315	-10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
13316	I have no idea how this game got such high reviews. Got it for a buck in a Humble Bundle, downloaded the save game to unlock all of the cars, and proceeded to play. Terribly monotonous. Even during its peak (if it had one) I'm sure my opinion would have remained the same.  - A Burnout game without a classic crash mode? Immediate disappointment. - I saw all of the damage a vehicle could take within the first 30 minutes of driving around. - Crashing (or performing certain jumps in single player) always resulted in this annoying, slow motion effect. Always. - Annoying pop-ups in the middle of the screen blocked my view. - DJ Atomica. Enough said. - Playing 'Paradise City' so much I almost started to hate it. - Camera angle wasn't adjustable to fixed positions; I had to hold up on the right joystick just to get the view I wanted. - Cars felt like they were made of paper sometimes. - What's worse was how often my little ricer car could take down a truck three times its size and mass. - No speedometer. - Sometimes, if I got hit by another car (e.g. during Road Rage), I would brake to stop from crashing, but the game overrode the brakes and I swerved and crashed, anyway. - Lack of VoIP options and no text communication.  There were some positives, but they were always balanced out with a negative. I enjoyed the size of the map, but disliked the overall layout. The online minigames were fun to play with friends or even strangers, but all it took was one or two people to not complete the objective to kill the fun.  3/10
13317	3/10 would not burnout again.
13318	Great game, shame it stopped working.
13319	Stops working every now and then...
13320	Well.... I burned my eyes out after playing 30 minutes of this game.... 1.3745/10
13321	Store servers down. No hover car. Killed myself when I realized. Do not purchase under any circumstances.
13322	I was fun on the PS2. Not here. And it will never be.  The game itself wasn't really planned to be on the PC, but I digress. It's amusing, time wasting if you're on a laptop waiting for the plane to land or..something? Not worth my time, though.   Ehem! The only reason I have this game is because my friend had a few extra bucks from a deal and got me this from Humble Bundle. Not the best from the site, but sort of beggars can't be choosers, now can they.
13323	This is nothing like the old Burnour games which were all soooooo much fun. Unfortunatly they never made it to pc. I personally really do not like this game as there are soo many others like it but better...If you want the old school burnout..this is not for you
13324	Burnout Paradise, a good game spoilt by EA, is made by Criterion Games.   The Good:    Fast, this game really shows what a racing game should be about. Fast cars, and in this game even the slowest cars are fast, and they feel fast   Open World, if I have to drive around in a car, at least give me an open world map that I can explore.    The Mediocre:    Screen Furniture, there's too much stuff on the screen, I would like to see a little bit less.    The Bad:    Origin, this game is published by EA, so of course, next to the DRM that steam has, you also HAVE to have Origin DRM on the game. For the people who don't know, Origin is basically like steam, but just bad. I can't even log in, which means that I can NOT play the game at all.    The Verdict  You people might enjoy the game if you can get through the DRM, but as long as EA has the DRM on the game, which makes it impossible for me to play this game, I will not recommend this game.
13325	Haven't gotten very far but probably won't. Pretty boring and apparently the same thing over and over until the end.
13326	Regret buying it, not like how I remember Burnout Takedown was on PS2.
13327	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ XD LETS TAKE BURNOUT 3 AND MAKE IT COMPLETE â¥â¥â¥â¥ BY ADDING OPEN WORLD AND SICK GRUNGE EFFECT MENUS AND SPAM THE PARADISE CITY SONG 24/7
13328	Could never play it because I could never get my EA account to work. What collosally incompetent â¥â¥â¥â¥ing morons. If you ever give any money to EA, you deserve to be shot in the face.
13329	Not the regular burnout in the past as this is usually just about timeattack or lap attack so i dont really recommend this game anymore .
13330	So much wrong its hard to know where to start. Avoid.

13333	Where to start... well the online features (and therefore certain dlc and such) have been gone for years so that's something, the game butchers a lot of good songs and for some reason chose gnrs most annoying track to play every time you launch the game, you can't fully turn off the opera music that they put into the game... sure it has humour value to put that into a game like this but allow us to fully remove the crap if we don't like it... you can turn it off when you're actively playing but leave the room for 5 minutes to grab a drink and it's gone into a cinematic mode with bach or some other operatic junk playing which is almost as unforgivable as the teribly cut apart versions of good songs they've used in the soundtrack.  The icing on the cake is that as a racing game it has issues with some official 360 pads when it was a 360 title... if you've somehow made sure that the pad you have works with it properly then sweet buy it if you want but be warned about the music and maybe play it muted with winamp in the background instead of the damaged music and operactic noise they put in.
13334	I don't recommend buying this. It's very buggy and no multiplayer. The controls are trash and it's very hard
13335	if it is a gift it is equals the â¥â¥â¥â¥
13336	So much wrong its hard to know where to start. Avoid.
13337	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ XD LETS TAKE BURNOUT 3 AND MAKE IT COMPLETE â¥â¥â¥â¥ BY ADDING OPEN WORLD AND SICK GRUNGE EFFECT MENUS AND SPAM THE PARADISE CITY SONG 24/7
13338	Why should there be a limited amount of lives in Road Rage mode? :(
13339	do these people make serious games anymore, or ever made? it is like playing car pinball ...
13340	add achievement in steam,,, it will be great,,,
13341	Boring, pointless, and stupid. Don't let nostaligia force you to buy this.
13342	such a waste
13343	Absolute freaking garbage of a game. Controller support is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game has no way of skipping â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ prerecorded ea crap 10/10 dont buy
13344	this game sucks 0/8
13345	Why are there no people in this game to run over. 0/10
13346	This game when it first came out was amazing,Its still fun to play...Then criterion decided NOT to release the DLCs for this game,It was only released for consoles and NOT PC..So dont bother!
13347	Ultimate Box comes with 2 fairly useless DLC. In-game store doesn't allow me to purchase additional DLC.  Game runs fine, no fps dips or stuttering, but a lot of times I find my car almost uncontrollably veering to one side, as if I'm turning hard in that direction.  Fun for a while but you'll find yourself bored rather quickly.
13348	I have many peculiar interests that people often laugh at, but despite the fact I'm not losing heart and continue to like the things I like. I must apologize for the use of a bad word, but I feel this is the most proper way to get the message across:   I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LOVE BOXES.  So when I saw the title of the game - Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box - I was very excited. Finally not only someone has noticed a niche of box lovers like me, but also made it a ULTIMATE BOX. This suggested that in this game I'll be able to deal with the best, the most unimaginable, wonderful and perfect box the world was has even seen. I bought the game in a heartbeat.  Upon launching, it turned out it's not that easy and I have to drive a car to get the box. Well, nothing is easy in life and I couldn't be simply given the most ultimate of all boxes. Not only that, it seems that there are enemies that compete with me for the box. I decided to take up the challenge.  I've spend days trying to find the box. I've got through all the levels and challenges and in the end all I managed to find was bitter disappointment: despite the title the game does not contain any boxes. I only got a driving license at the end, which doesn't even make sense, since I driven the car through all the game. How can you drive a car without a license?  At this point I don't even know if the main hero is a guy, girl or a sentient car. I'm thinking you're a guy, because girls couldn't drive that well (the game has too much speed) and what use for a box does the car have, even if it would be sentient? Car wouldn't be able to use box, even if it was ultimate. Developers couldn't even use basic logic.  Overall I give this game 0.2 out of 88. I think that developers should finally learn their lesson and stop misleading honest games like me with inaccurate and plain lying titles. Do not buy this game: you'll get as heartbroken and burnout as I am.
13349	Do not buy this game if you have or ever intend to have a webcam or any kind of livestream program installed on your computer. It will not work. This game will not run on a computer that has either of these two things installed on it. It doesn't matter if they're enabled, and it doesn't matter if they're running. If they exist on your hard drive, the game will not boot up.  This is a documented problem with many users and one that EA has flat-out refused to fix. This is because EA are swindlers and thieves. Do not purchase this game.
13350	DO NOT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME. Not even worth a single penny, first off online doesnt work, dlc doesnt work, making a online account doesnt work, and the damn game doesnt save your stuff I went through all the super jumps or whatever and got my carbon car and then bam the next time i launched it its gone, just dont buy it
13351	As much as I want to like this game...I can't. I love the Burnout series. But there are so many problems with this one. First off is the multiplayer...that's completely down so you can't get anything. Second is the graphics, while some people think they look good I find them not to be...the pictures you see make the game look prettier than it really is. Third is the mechanics. Drifting is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ because once you go into a drift it's hard to get out. The flow doesn't feel as smooth as it does in the other Burnout games and turning corners is more irritating than fun. Not only that but the physics don't feel realistic enough either. The 'DJ' of this game gets VERY annoying very quickly and there's no way to turn off his repetitive comments of how you can win. The races are literally just point A to point B. At most you make maybe one or two turns in a race and you can get to the finish line. Sure you can take shortcuts along the way...but the shortcuts also feel too repetitive and conveniently placed. I also feel like the cars in this game are a joke. And while I appreciate almost all types of music....all there is is rock and alternative. There's really no real different genres. Personally I find this game sad. 5/10 -Frillin
13352	While the game mechanics are interesting... This game is still lacking something. I don't understand the whole fuss about it.
13353	ultimate box? no  there's micro transactions
13354	Burnout 3 on PS2 was fun, this game is pretty empty and boring. Refunded after 15 minutes.
13355	To be honest it falls too much into the traps of your typcial racing game, personally I found it simply repeatative.
13356	Great Game. :D
13357	LOL - Ok so the game is a 'real driving' game? If the physics of the game were any worse it would be in a 2D, top play, GTA 1980's game.
13358	GAME IS BAD.
13359	It lacks everything a racing game needs.
13360	This game was fun or the first 45mins but after that you start finding it borring
13361	It's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ full of wanky mechanics, I highly recommend buying this game if you are a â¥â¥â¥â¥tard my friend Rob007a recommended this too me and now I hate him. Thank you very much EA if you dont accept my refund request I will delete all your games and personally see too it that you are all sacked.
13362	GET nfsmw instead.
13363	worst piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
13364	It's fun... But I wouldn't go as far as to say it's my favourite racing game. I'm much more of a fan for realistic racing simulators. For example, Forza and Gran Turismo.
13365	With the apparent lack of police enforcement of any kind in Paradise City I would recommend looking else where for you home and auto investments. Unsafe Neighborhood / 10
13366	TAEK ME DOWN TO THE PARADIS E SICTYU HATYRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
13367	After sitting through the very long, unskippable intro video several times, the game crashes on me before actually getting to play. After the 3rd time I just unintalled it. Windows 10 Pro.
13368	This game has decent riding gameplay but it isn't that great in single player. Multiplayer is basically dead. It has nice crash animations 4/10

13370	THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS. DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN IF YOUR FRIEND KEEPS TRYING TO PERSUADE YOU TO BUY IT AND SAYS IT IS AWESOME, DO NOT LISTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13371	Hello, Fred Fuchs here. As you all know I am a very esteemed game reviewer and critic, and I would like to give my review about this game. As I was walking throughout my 2,5 million dollar mansion, I happened upon something quite curious. I saw a box, the title of the box being 'Burnout Paradise'. I immediately looked at the box, and what I noticed made me kill myself on the inside. I went out to the patio and had a long deep thought about the meaning of life, when suddenly I saw a Lamborghini Veneno, the man inside of the car was throwing â¥â¥â¥â¥ at my mansion. I gripped the box firmly in one hand, and I threw the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing away as far as I could from my beautiful mansion, before it could corrupt the purity and beauty of my expensive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ mansion.

13376	Upon recieving this game from a friend i have come to the conclusion that this game is complete and utter S***. Granted it is a 2009 game and not that good, seriously? Is this an actual game? As soon as you get into the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game you just hear guns and roses, then again once in the game at 100% volume which then since i couldnt find the audio options i have to alt tab just to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing turn down the paradise song in my head. Then the multiplayer, where do i begin. You see party.. nope only single player. its almost like false advertising. I guess if you want to spend the 5 bucks for it go ahead. or than that pls no buy :( 0/10 - IGN
13377	I would thumbs it up but after all the hard work to getting some of the best cars and losing it all. I wouldn't really bother.
13378	â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥ game i go left and the game puts me right i hit the break but you know what THEY DONT GIVE A FLYING â¥â¥â¥â¥
13379	Awful cringe inducing announcer, driving around is insanely boring, I don't consider this a Burnout game.  Really disappointed, pretty boring game.
13380	Complete and utter â¥â¥â¥â¥
13381	Mildly entertaining racing game that gets old really fast.  For a 2009 game the graphics still hold up fairly well, and it performs smoothly at 1920x1080 resolution. It's fun to race and take down opponent cars by slamming them into obstacles, but the experience grows stale too quickly.  The environment is limited to one city so you'll see the same roads and scenery over and over again. The cars all handle pretty similarly so there's not much variety there, either.  Where things get really frustrating is the user friendliness. The game doesn't do a very good job of showing where to go, so you can easily get lost while trying to race ahead of your opponents. Who wants to constantly be looking at the map while driving? It's easy to lose races because of this, and when it happens there's no way to quickly retry. You have to drive all the way back to the beginning, which can sometimes take a good 5 minutes. Given how repetitive this experience is, the game feels torturous and you feel like you are getting punished for not memorizing the city's layout.  There are cars that you can't unlock because the online servers are dead forever, so they're just there to tease you.  There's really not much here to recommend, to be honest.
13382	Oh boy, let me just start this 'review' (If we can call it that) by warning you to stay away from the PC version of Burnout Paradise! No, not because of its gameplay and/or visual quality (I owned this bad boy a few years ago on the X360 and it was indeed a fun ride), but because this game is the absolute definition of garbage on the PC!  ...and why is that you might ask?  Well, where do I start?  First off, I cannot for the life of me start this game up by conventional means without it crashing instantly, and trust me, I'm not the only one experiencing similar problems, browse it on the internet if you must.  ...but of course, such could be fixed easily, just give the game a try in 'compatibility mode', and you should be good to go right? Wrong!  Running this bastarâ¥ in compatibility mode for 'Windows XP Service Pack 3' (the recommended) or even going as far as adventuring your self in the ancient ruins of 'Windows 95' will in fact boot you up past the start up screen, but good luck playing the game for about 10 or so minutes without it freezing dead on its tracks! On top of it by running it in compatibility mode you can kiss your steam overlay tab good bye.  I didn't gave up though, upon some research, I discovered that many other things could cause the game to crash such as programs related to your Webcam, which you obviously shouldn't bother with if you don't have one, that is unless you happen to have 'Dxtory' (which is kindda like good old 'Fraps') installed, as for some odd reason 'Dxtory' appears as a Webcam, and yes even if it's turned off it'll affect the game (I heard 'XSplit' might cause the same symptoms as 'Dxtory', but I'm not sure), uninstall it and see if it does the trick.  ...but it could maybe even be related to your multi-core CPU, which if so, it could supposedly be fixed by doing as it follows...  - Right Click 'Burnout Paradise' &gt; Properties &gt; Set Launch Options &gt; (type in) -multithread (and press OK).  Of course, such didn't work for me either and sadly, as of now, I can only play the game 10 minutes at a time, on top of that, the game does not support classic 'Window Mode', which might not seem like a big deal, but sometimes you might need to do such because reasons...  As a final verdict, do NOT waste your greens on the PC version of this game (unless you're still rocking little old Windows XP, wich I think might play Burnout Paradise withouth any problems, but I'm not sure of it), it's simply not worth it, have a good one.
13383	This has not aged well and the so call Ultimate Box does not contain all the DLC.  The gameplay is dull the the driving physics have no relation to a car IRL in the slightest. Far better race games out there to spen chash on
13384	Just getting into this game is the worst experience I've ever had in my life
13385	The more I play the more it makes me wish Rockstar ported Midnight Club LA to the PC.  No customization, empty city, no name cars, no cockpit view.
13386	This game is simply not very interesting and it gets very repetitive very quickly.
13387	How can I play the multiplayer mode ? =((( Can anyone teach me?
13388	Take me down to the paradise city Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty Take me home (oh won't you please take me home) Take me down to the paradise city Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty Take me home (oh won't you please take me home)  If you can listen to this song on repeat for every second you are playing the game, then this might be for you!
13389	This game comes without the one thing driving games used to be about - two player splitscreen. Thus for me it's useless. If you're looking for a good racing game to play locally with our buddy you're in the wrong place.   I didn't think that a Burnout without the most integral part of a racing game would be possible, so I bought it without looking it up. Yep, guess I wasted my money.   If you're looking for something to play alone or against people on the net read some other reviews, I guess there are people that enjoy this game. I don't
13390	  You won't be able to play the game if you forget your password or username and you can only make an account once since the product key will be bound to the first account you make which is really dumb
13391	Open world racing is awful.
13392	The more I play the more it makes me wish Rockstar ported Midnight Club LA to the PC.  No customization, empty city, no name cars, no cockpit view.
13393	  You won't be able to play the game if you forget your password or username and you can only make an account once since the product key will be bound to the first account you make which is really dumb
13394	This game is simply not very interesting and it gets very repetitive very quickly.
13395	Sad part is that there was no Box.
13396	This game is bad. Like really bad, EA did a great job of ruining a series of games that I had always loved. Don't buy it
13397	I don't like this game.
13398	I get most of my games for free. This is a really...obnoxious game. If you want crashes or whatever this game is famous for, play a Need For Speed game.
13399	No crash mode... wtf
13400	this game is not good, BAD! THE GAME IS BAD DONT BUY IF YOU EXPEKT LOW LOQ QUALITY. this game is so ugly, its 144p or less, cant play fov is 30 dont buy
13401	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game its so â¥â¥â¥â¥ doing a race guy passed me but crashes just befor finsh line still counts him as wining lol the â¥â¥â¥â¥
13402	It was not as good as Burnout 3. I didn't feel the open world environment added anything.
13403	2 hours in and Guns N Roses is already ruined for me. Forever.
13404	I probably haven't played enough of this game to really give the best judgement, but I've played it enough to know that I don't really like it, and have NO clue how the game managed to get an 87 metascore.  Cons - the choice of soundtrack for this game might cause suicidal thoughts and tendencies, or incite violence towards others (translation: WORST soundtrack to a game, ever) - not every game needs to be open-world...you would think a racing game could work in an open-world environment, but this one does not, unless you just like driving aimlessly in a virtual world through what is more or less an empty city. - the previous burnout games seemed to be substantially more fun; this makes this particular iteration of the series seem like a hollow cash-grab - HORRIBLE and ANNOYING user-interface - due to the repetitive nature, this game gets very old, fast  Pros - you get to drive fast and wreck into things - I could see multiplayer possibly being a little fun, but I haven't played it that   This game is terrible...just plain terrible...
13405	Very disappointing. The game looks good enough, especially with ENB, but that's about all it has going for it. Criterion purport the idea of race events on a free roam map as something new, 'unlike any other driving experience', even though Need for Speed Underground 2 and Test Drive Unlimited had both done similar things prior to its release. All events are extremely easy, and with no difficulty option (at least not one I could find in the ill-conceived labyrinthine menu system), the game soon becomes very dull.  In-game advertisements are a spit in the face from the developers. Perhaps it would be understandable if the game were free to play, or if it were trying to emulate a 'real world', but it's not. These were clearly only put in for profit, not an attempt at realism, since the game is set in a fictional city and none of the cars are licensed. I paid for the game I don't want to see Burger King and EVGA advertisements while playing it.  Various elements of the game are at cross-purposes with each other. Events are put at every intersection, supposedly to cut down on monotony and so there's never an event too far away, but the races aren't gated and the route isn't highlighted on the map as with other arcade racers, which means you have to open your map at the beginning of each race and spend time planning your route. You can't jump to events either, which, in the case of Burning Route events, often means you have to drive halfway across the map just to begin a race.  On the topic of Burning Route events; the game boasts a range of 75 cars, when in actuality, in terms of unique vehicles there is about half that, with the other half being practically carbon-copies with different paint jobs which are rewarded after completing time trials. By the end of the game, you'll only be using about 3 of the cars anyway (the best in each category; stunt, aggression and speed), since the others are relatively useless.  The soundtrack is awful. For reasons unknown to anyone but the developers, there are 3 different styles of music in this game; pop/rock songs, instrumental songs from the three previous Burnout games, and classical compositions. The loudness levels are not normalized either, which means that some songs are barely audible while others are quite loud. The 'CrashFM' DJ is obnoxious and detestable.
13406	this game sucks
13407	Bad soundtrack, repetitive missions, terrible crash mode, great linear racing from the older Burnouts replaced by open world racing that doesn't always work. Buy 3 instead.
13408	 I HATE F*CKING RACING GAMES AND THIS A GOOD EXAMPLE WHY!!  What a piece of sh*t! Not only is it from EA, but the general controls are f*cked! Instead of WASD and Mouse to drive &amp; look, its A and Z with the ARROW KEYS FOR GODS SAKE! ANOTHER F*CKING CONSOLE PORT!  Anyways, after not being able to change controls AT ALL IN ANY MENU, YOU ALSO CAN'T QUIT THE GAME, I HAVE TO ALT+TAB TO GET THE F*CK OUT OF THIS CR*P! WHAT A LOAD OF SH*T!  And zOMG! It's called Paradise City! So the ONLY SONG they play is G&amp;R Paradise City, and f*ck that gets OLD!  F*CK THIS GAME, AND F*CK ANYONE THAT ENJOY IT!  0/10
13409	Honestly, like what does this game even offer?  A bunch of weird made-up cars  Big-ish city with challenges half-hazardly littered everywhere with no rhyme or reason  There's not even a driver inside your car, it's literally empty  Half of the game's content is locked behind DLC (which isn't even being sold anymore because EFF YOU)  This game kinda summarizes everything I hate about racing games - it's just self fulfilling and pointless. There's nothing driving you (lol) to do the challenges, and that's all this game has to offer: a ton of challenges to complete. It's just a giant unrewarding chore. I don't think that's a meaningful experience.  If you do want to pick it up, look up the Vanity Pack mod online. Otherwise, pass.
13410	the cars woant go fast enoug h
13411	It's an open world racer (of sorts) that overcomplicates the racing elements while over simplifying all the customization options.   PROS  -A fairly large &amp; open world to explore -Collectibles -Lots of different cars -Online Modes   CONS  -The world is confusing &amp; easy to get lost  -Steam Version is incomplete &amp; has DLC cars that can't be obtained -Online Modes have Cheaters -Requiares EA Account Log-In   GAMEPLAY &amp; FEATURES   I guess you could call this game an open world collectathon with races &amp; challenges as your objectives. It's a very good concept but some parts weren't really executed properly. For one, it's hard to figure out where exactly you are in the world &amp; where you need to go in races. Most racing games have you on a set track but this game all the tracks are connected &amp; if you mess up by making a wrong turn you're pretty much screwed. To actually race you need to memorize the world map for the best routes to take in each race &amp; it's just not worth it for the minimal rewards you get for doing it. Each race is set up so you drive to the starting point, press a button &amp; start the race. The problem with this is you have absolutely no idea where you're going or the routes you need to take to get there. It will take you several tries just to find &amp; win the simplest of tracks because of the huge lack of direction you're given. The game does try to help you by using the blinker on your car to tell you when there's an upcoming turn at least but it's not nearly enough. I constantly find myself trying to do races &amp; getting lost during them simply because of how lack of direction there is in this game.  The plus side is the Road Rage races, where direction is not really needed. You just need to take out as many other racers as you can within the time limit while reaching the set goal. This is probably the best challenge in the game since you don't need to figure out where to go &amp; just drive.   There are also things in the world to collect &amp; find such as hidden pathways, cars to take down that add themselves to your collection &amp; bill boards. I don't know if you actually get anything for doing 100% since I don't care enough about this game to 100% collect everything in it. Most of what it seemed relatively pointless, honestly, with the exception of the car unlocks.  You can customize certain cars but only the type of color &amp; paint job, e.g. Metalic, gloss, etc. The motorcycles let you pick between Male/Female riders but that's about it. That's really all you can do cuztomization wise.   ISSUES   There's also an abundance of cheaters in online modes. Just recently I had a game with at least two cheaters who were both using cheats that gave them instant take downs &amp; made them immune to take downs. Basically, this means that whenever they just barely tapped my car or anyone elses we'd be taken down &amp; even if we rammed them through a wall they'd never be taken down. Their takedown score was around 10x what everyone elses was the entire match. And trust me, I played with these two long enough to know they were cheating. I only wish I was recording at the time so I could show all the BS that was going on.  There's also a small amount of people who actually play online now. I played this game for several hours recently &amp; got into about 4 games but each game I was in one of those two cheaters were always in one. So, in the end I just accepted that I wasn't gonna be playing to win &amp; just ended up goofing off with the hackers for a few hours. There also is no report system in the game so if someone is cheating you can't do anything about it. The only thing you can do is try to deal with it or leave the online mode.  You also can't get the DLC content through Steam since EA is a bunch of D-bags. They cut off the EA marketplace so even though you're buying the 'Ultimate Box' you're getting an incomplete product. To make matters worse the online shop will constantly pop up every time you boot up the game, but it will just load a blank white screen. So, it taunts you saying, 'Yea, this game is missing features. Thanks for buying it, sucker!'    OVERALL   Overall, this game isn't bad but it's really not worth anyone's time anymore unless you just want a driving game to goof off with. The online modes have hackers &amp; the whole game takes too long to figure out &amp; memorize. If you want a real racing experience that doesn't just involve driving around in an open world where you just crash cars you'd be better off trying something else. If not, then feel free to try this one cause crashing cars &amp; driving around doing random nonsense is the best part about this game.
13412	you play alone ... no one is ever online EVER !!
13413	Weird game. Very strange driveability. If you want to buy a good racing game, don't buy this one.
13414	Burnout without the thing that made Burnout fun in the first place.
13415	Take me down to the paradise city Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty Oh won't you take me home?
13416	Not very fun, weird graphics and annoying music. Only get in a humble bundle. The menu is also really weird and confusing.
13417	Not very fun, weird graphics and annoying music. Only get in a humble bundle. The menu is also really weird and confusing.
13418	Good luck getting this game to run without crashing.
13419	If youre going to play this game, youre going to have a bad time.  *GL trying to make this crap run...*
13420	Crashes everytime i try to sign in!! Haven't actually got to the game yet!
13421	  If flatout 2 and FUEL have a child, this would be the hideus result  This is suppose to be a racing game right? well that is what at least try to market, a game with cars that just happen to go fast isn't a racing game. The focus on this game is to get from A to B wrecking every oppponent on your way, like seriously, it doesn't get any better than that.  Oh also something important.. traffic &gt; you, you'll be crashing every 5 minutes against either a wall or a traffic car crusing the intersection which it will be EXACTLY where you'll be if you dont change your speed or direction taking you 5 valuble seconds which makes you loose the race. Every time you crash you need to see a 5 seconds animation which you CANT skip.   The car is totally unresponsive to start needing 2/3 seconds to be able to start using the boost, same applies if you have being going on reverse and then you need to go forward again.   The menu is the worst thing you can imagine, its absolutly and disgustingly crafted, if you want to the options menu you need to go like 3 other menus, everytime you hit the pause button because the 'main menu' is just stats of what you found.  Also the game doesn't teach you how to stop an unwanted race so I need it to go and join the online servers in order to do so AND JUST WHEN I DO IT THE GAME FINALLY TEACHS ME HOW 'If you want to stop a race just stop in the place till its over' oh that would have been great to know like 10 mins before when I was trying to figure something out..  There a 3 disciplines of cars: stunt - speed - strenght, everyone represent how they get boost and how it works, stunts you may already figured, strenght by hitting other cars and speed by driving alone, but here's where the desing goes even worst. A game like racing demands fast reactions and tools that you need to know how they work and that you can trust (cars you know how they steer, how they drift and they acceleration) the game totally fails at giving you any of that, there are several cars that feel just horrible and next to impossible to use it in a real scenario (i played 'arcady' racing game many years of my life and play with a gamepad so it's not me the problem). The best of all is that the speed cars are only able to use boost when its full, and if you get enough while using it you may still use it but the amount of traffic this game has is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS so is absolutly unreliable and also its unpractical because you cant get from it what you need when you need it  Closing notes:  if you want a GOOD open world racing game just go and play any need for speed, from the top of my head 'most wanted', 'underground 2', 'carbon', and just to mention a few.   If you want something hard that you will die every five minutes but its actually fun and challenging go for any dark souls.  if you specificaly want a racing game where destruction is the focus go with flatout 2 (it even has a derby mode and many other fun games)  TL;DR: this ain't a racing game just a derby with the objective of going from A to B with a lot of horribly mechanics for the cars and unhumanly possible amount of traffic that will F*** you up. Also the game isn't challenging at all, the traffic and bad camera is punishing creating this pseudo-hard gameplay
13422	I paid too much for this game....
13423	If you've ever played Burnout 3, then you will know that this game sucks horribly compared to it. Sure, for a generic everyday 'me is srs gamR' type of person it might be fun, but having played Burnout 3 for so many years and then try to play this monstorosity is like trying to eat rock after eating cake. I'm guessing that they went like 'Oh, you know all these things that made Burnout 3 one of the greatest and most fun racing games ever? Come on Steven, you know what I'm talking about; the aftertouch, the takedowns, the crashes. Yeah all those, let's just remove them and make something that makes our fans cry their tears out'.  At this point I am literally speechless(hence why I'm typing) at how bad this turned out. I tested it when I bought it from the Humble Bundle, and I tested it today again, but it just didn't work out. At best I give this game 3/10, because it has okay music and the enviroment is pretty nice looking.
13424	What a complete failure. I can't even begin to understand how Criterion Games could make such a piece of garbage after the masterpiece that is Burnout 3: Takedown.   This game is a complete joke. I literally deliberately TRIED to crash my car, and to succeed at that, I needed to crash into a heavy â¥â¥â¥ truck. A normal car wasn't enough.   The open world aspect only hurts this game. It is not fun to commute from A to B just to get to an event. The occasional stunt jump along the way does not make it sufficiently fun or interesting. It would be much better to simply select a race/event from a menu.  If you want to play a good Burnout, play Burnout 2, 3, or Revenge, and avoid this trash.
13425	open world racing but no GPS or hint which road i should take when in race. How do you expect me to play this game?
13426	Maybe back in 2009 this was good.  The game burns out real fast.  Soundtrack is actually decent though.
13427	Terrible console port, deleted it after five minutes of gameplay once I realised how poor the UI and controls are (press A to accelerate by default?!). Cancer.
13428	thanks for ruining burnout for me. fair warning to everyone that loved BO 3 to death: watch it on youtube what you liked is probably missing. it was for me.  soundtracks nice though.
13429	0/10 stupid game.... waste of time .... After this game you wanna kill game developers and whole world :@
13430	PLEASE DON'T! NONONO IT'S VICE CITY BUT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR IT'S BAD THERE'S NO FUN
13431	I personally didn't like this. I had high hopes when I got this from the Humble Bundle but it really wasn't what I was hoping for.  The controls are clunky, you would think WASD would be simple enough where W is accel and S is brake/reverse but it's some weird controls like X to accel or something like that. Why?  I'm really good at racing games (most of the time). But I can't even beat the first race in this.  If you're a fan of Burnout, go for it - but me personally, I don't like it.
13432	  if you have ANY streaming softwere that is picked up as a camra this game will refuse to work, not worth buying or playing in that case since I'm not removing streaming softwear for it.
13433	This game is way too simplistic, repetitive and too long for its own good. You donât feel real progression throughout the game. The driving feels like a dumbed down version of burnout 3, there isnât really any challenge in the races themselves and the cars all feel and handle the same. What ultimately kills this game for me is the lack of variety in the activities you are doing. You are doing the same sh*t throughout the same areas of the open world map hundreds of times.  Here are some ways to prevent a racing game from feeling repetitive.  1. Feeling real progression as you are playing e.g. NFS Most Wanted 2005 2. Introducing new tracks and different visuals and locations 3. Car customization and upgrades  4. Depth in the driving mechanics All those points I mentioned this game lacks. This open world is just so boring to drive around, it just feels so lifeless, uneventful and bland visually. This open world is no need for speed underground 2 thatâs for sure. I know it sounds like I am a NFS fan boy but it is honestly the best comparison I can make because this is the only burnout game that tried to pull off an open world like underground 2 did from underground 1. They should have honestly just stuck with what worked like burnout 3. There are also just so many small issues with the game that all build up together making the experience less enjoyable like the overall navigation and the overall time it takes to travel between each event. I was so bored after just 3 hours I couldnât play it anymore. I have played so many better racing games throughout my life, this game is worse than even the average racing game.  4/10 (Mediocre) 
13434	Not in 2014! Started playing this game with my hopes high couldn't get me hooked on.
13435	Unskippable cutscenes for long lengths of time. Dissapointed w/ gameplay.
13436	If you can get this piece of garbage to actually run you might have fun with it, no such luck here.
13437	muliplayer is broken can play over internet
13438	You only get to use the Steam Key once
13439	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
13440	Ever wondered what the child of Satan and Hitler would be like? Well wonder no more, this is the result.  This game is so bland and generic, watching paint dry is super fun in comparsion. The moment you start up this abomination you just feel the urge to gouge your eyes out. Avoid this as you would avoid a rabid chainsaw wielding midget on crack. I would not even gift this game to my worst enemy, hell it would be nicer to just send him out in space alone.  However if you are the martyr kind of person and enjoy endless agony inflicted upon you, then by all means play this torture device.
13441	this is quite possibly one of the worst racing games i've ever played. it's slow, awkward, uneventful and the soundtrack is horrid. i got about 20 minutes in and uninstalled. luckily i got this from a humble bundle or i'd be pretty damn dissapointed.
13442	That's one boring game actually;  1st hour or so you'll enjoy it (might be just me..but then again carma and flatouts are games I did enjoy); and don't forget that this 'ultimate' edition doesn't include every thing.  Conclusion - buy this game only on sales, it's a money-well-spent game if bought for minimum price  PS: I actually refunded it eventhough I got it for minimum-price  PPS: before I get more idiots on board, don't consider my time played on steam - I played it on origin
13443	Nope
13444	  Geforce 930m + i5 skylake ram 4GB with 2.8GHZ cant run . ROFL
13445	PLease, do yourself a favor and don't buy this game. It's nothing like the first Bournout and even on his own this game is anti-fun.
13446	It's exactly like all the new 'open world' ea racing games. So if you like the classic EA formula with very few actual crash events....  This isn't even Burnout.  Added insult to injury, the 'ultimate Box' doesn't include all of the DLC's. It only includes 3 of 8 or so.  It's a perfectly lukewarm game, therefore, I can not recommend it.
13447	This game was my favourite :c. But im reset my PC and steam automaclly deleted. and so im install steam, download burnout paradise city and i type my login - username and password. AND IM TYPE MY PASSWORD!!! AND THIS NOT WORK! I Have reached a lot of achievments!!! pls repair this game 
13448	I just bought this game and we are tight on money thought it would be fun to play with my friend with ALL the dlc so we bought it and installed it to only find out we only get 4 dlc packs not all of them i would like my money back or the dlc keys cause i paid money for this!

13450	worst racing game I've ever played, and racing games are my least favorite genre. of any medium. I hate racing games more than I hate rap music, or vegan icecream, or tween-fiction 'novels,' and this was my least favorite racing game. Just think about that before you buy.
13451	  Graphics no bueno
13452	This game is so pathetic it's not even funny.   Instead of playing this game I'd rather hang myself
13453	this isnt so much a reccomendation as a warning as i hate this game
13454	I don't recommend this game, the race is confused because u don't know where u must go.
13455	Even when having received this game for free, it's a nightmare and waste to my steamcollection. Freakin another EA failgame forcing me to scroll more to my favourite games.  So what is wrong with this game? - Each time when launching the game you are auto-redirected out of the game to a news page. - The newspage is totally blank... - The settingsmenu is hidden - The pre-configured inputkeys for keyboard and pre-configured controller setup is mindbraking.  * keyboard left and right arrowkeys are inverted  * controller wheel steering is configured to go back in the UI menu. Meaning you can not discover that a settingsmenu exists. I had to unplug the wheel from the pc to be able to go to the settingsmenu, plug it back in to adjust all keys, X and Y axis, etc.  - There is no decent force feedback support (a core part for a racegame) - There is no option to modify deadzones of controller-input (a core part for a racegame) - There is no hud cam (a core part for a racegame) - The driving experience is arcade to the bone. After having driven a kilometer ingame I'd seen enough of the entire game. There is no challenge to be found in this game.  On a scale to 10 I give it a 0 for a pc game. The game is made for the console and should have stayed there.
13456	This is a typical example of a game developer taking a fairly decent series and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing it up with a change of gameplay. While there were some things that were good about the open world system (such as creating a crash when and where you want) for the most part it is absolute crap. The game is clearly optimized for gamepad use ONLY and the UI are frustrating. Furthermore the lack of in car graphics, speedometer and tachometer show that this was clearly a rushed or ill planned game. If you want a racing game (Why is another question) you should stick with the original burnout games (Most of which were good) or get gran turismo.  Long story short. Don't get it. unless you wish to waste money.
13457	Pretty good, don't get it on PC though, get it on PS3.
13458	After playing Burnout 1-3 on Playstation this part was a huge disappointment, especially after noticing that the main part of Burnout is missing.... the huge crossway crashes for points/money. Yes, the game looks nice and does have some beautifull cars etc. but it just isnÂ´t the same game anymore... trying to copy a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ need for speed underground gaming style. Hope they go back to the roots in their next game.
13459	This game is awful.
13460	So many races, so little fun.

13462	This should not still be advertised on steam as a Multiplayer game as all the servers were switched off years ago. Single player is decent but gets very repetitive. Unless you see it 75% off, it's not worth buying.
13463	5/10 Meh. Graphics are terrible. Gameplay is weak. Requires an EA account. Actually, 4/10 because of that. Will not play again.
13464	Gorgeous, but the gameplay just gets so unbelievably boring. Huge disappointment compared to Burnout 3.
13465	no external controller support which sucks.
13466	I didn't like Burnout Paradise at all, the game has one of the worse menus I have ever seen, not sure if it is even a menu, handling is slightly better than NFS games but still crap, not sure why I even bought this POS, I didnt bother finishing it.
13467	This game is very EA. It holds your hand and tries to be cute with not a lot of content. I was wanting a racing game, instead this is like kiddie-fied bumper cars. If you're looking for something that would compete with the old Need For Speed games or Gran Turismo, this is NOT for you.
13468	fun but the walls have magnets in them and the fact that theres no gps ruins the game
13469	you have to have an EA account and until i get a new computer i can play. It keeps shutting off on me
13470	Open world car games are difficult to get right, in the case of Criterion's Burnout Paradise they unfortunately get it wrong.   Long gone are the fun car crash game types that have you destroy as much property as possible, instead replaced with a straightforward racing game that feels like a diluted version of past titles.   The cars drive just fine, although playing with a controller is almost a necessity. The gameplay falls short though, as takedowns feel limp and winning races doesn't feel satisfying.   If you're looking to just roam around and play a few races here or there this might be some fun, but it doesn't have lasting appeal like the older Burnout titles did.
13471	Eventually, EA ruins everything.
13472	A poor console port of what looks like a decent game. It's clearly made for a controller. Otherwise, its just your average need-for-speed-type racing game.
13473	So much better on xbox.   terrible controls :(   3/10
13474	- No quit button (seriously)  Ain't nobody got time for that. 
13475	Very short and repetitive game. Only would be worth it if you are out of games to play or buy. Don't buy unless it is on a serious discount.
13476	It'd be great if the cars weren't made of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing glass.  Other than that, I WOULD recommend it, but since all the cars are prone to crashing just by touching something, I don't really recommend it. Although it's fun, sometimes I'd hit cars when I wasn't even that close to be able to touch them.  I feel like it's a good game, but if they fixed the part where the cars are made of glass and the physics/collision problems, then I'd play this game a lot more.
13477	Good game, except that the events are trivially easy and figuring out a route from A to B is not fun. The game also seems really paranoid about you not having something to do so it constantly throws timers, counters, events, achievement notifications and cars at you.
13478	Why get a game called the 'ultimate' box if you cant have any or most of the DLC. I was dissapointed the fact that the DLC was almost a tease
13479	I can't stop it from playing Guns and Roses, I'm out.
13480	not as good as need for speed...
13481	i want my money back i cant get any of the dlc 
13482	Great game, but cant purchase any of the add-on vehicles or big surf island, so if you think you are getting everything with the purchase of this game...You are not!! Why you cant purchase the add-ons is a mystery since support for the game is lacking. Do I reccomend the game? YES! but not how it is sold as the ultimate box since it ultimately comes missing the DLC of the game
13483	Did you like the Burnout games? Probably really liked the crash point counter and the strategy of getting the biggest pile ups and combo points right? Well they took all that out of the game and now its just a racing game. Its really bad.
13484	This game just isnt what i expected. it didn't have that unique Burnout feel to it like in Burnout 3: Takedown. The game itself felt like it wasn't made with the most intention to satisfy the player. They could have made the game have so much more like increasing customization options but they didn't, that's a huge loss itself. The game got boring very quickly as it felt like the races were all the same. I definitely do not recommend this game if you have played Burnout 3: Takedown.
13485	Mediocre at best, and that's being nice. Racing games should thrill you and make you want to drive fast. This is by no means a sim style racer, it's arcade through and through but there are so many better titles out there that do arcade racing better than this. Avoid!
13486	It's okay. A bit TOO open.. not much direction or inspiration. I miss the old Burnout formula. Still, crashes are nice, controls are decent. Not worth a purchase though, too shallow. It's saving grace is co-op madness with friends. But with no progression, it's just a sandbox. 4/10
13487	The game itself is quite fun, however the DLC servers are all down, so your 'Ultimate Box' turns out to be the regular game. Not worth buying if you can pick up a $5 copy for a console.
13488	if need for speed had a baby, this would its long lost cousin
13489	there are actual ads in this game. like on the billboards. like when you're driving there are ads in your face.
13490	It is a bad game. It is a hassle to find all the races. There are only 3 types of race. All the good things about the previous burnouts are ruined by this game. Shame on you.
13491	you have to have an EA account and until i get a new computer i can play. It keeps shutting off on me
13492	There's so much I love about this game, the freedom, the thrills, the variety, the distruction, the speed, I could go on and on and very nearly have. So why can't I recomend it? I'm afraid the list is just as long, bad controller suport, bad PC optimisation, clunky menus, online BS, loading, loading and loading. If you want to play this game (and if you love this sort of thing you do), play it on one of the consoles which it was designed for by clever people with a love of fun driving games, and not the PC where it was ported by some lazy people who care little for gamers or the games we love.
13493	I can't get this game to run on my PC. It seems there are a lot of other people who have the same problem, but there are also people for who this game runs just fine. I guess you can't really know until you try this game. Buy it when it's on sale if you really want to try it, that way you won't have thrown away much money on a 2009 console port.  Also: unskippable cutscene's.
13494	Open world car games are difficult to get right, in the case of Criterion's Burnout Paradise they unfortunately get it wrong.   Long gone are the fun car crash game types that have you destroy as much property as possible, instead replaced with a straightforward racing game that feels like a diluted version of past titles.   The cars drive just fine, although playing with a controller is almost a necessity. The gameplay falls short though, as takedowns feel limp and winning races doesn't feel satisfying.   If you're looking to just roam around and play a few races here or there this might be some fun, but it doesn't have lasting appeal like the older Burnout titles did.
13495	It'd be great if the cars weren't made of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing glass.

I feel like it's a good game, but if they fixed the part where the cars are made of glass and the physics/collision problems, then I'd play this game a lot more.
13496	The menu on PC are not user friendly. And there is some issues in the gameplay. For instance, each time I pass a driver liscence they want me to take another webcam picture. Sounds are not that great and driving experience a bit dissapointing. If you have like old NFS games like Most-Wanted or underground 1-2 , If you liked Flatout 1 or 2 well do not buy. If it is your first experience at arcade racing game, you could give it try while it's on sale for less than 10$.
13497	Meh........thats all i got to say about this. it`s just kinda meh............
13498	Stop working everytime after the intro movie, can't connect to EA server, damn this was a waste of money :(
13499	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ doens't work i want a refund.
13500	Somehow I just never could like this game. The annoying, hair-metal soundtrack and repetitive missions made it somehow very non-engaging.
13501	fun but the walls have magnets in them and the fact that theres no gps ruins the game
13502	This game is terrible, you dont even get the joy of watching your character smash into on coming traffic at 200mph... It's like the fire services coming before you manage to pour petrol over the sleeping children.
13503	The name is misleading, There is no DLC included other than the free stuff. So basically this is just plain old 'Burnout Paradise'. Very disappointing but its my own fault for not reading more about it before I bought it. Still a great game regardless. You can no longer buy any of the DLC so I would suggest getting it for Xbox 360 or PS3.
13504	after the third day of playing all mycars were deleted and my account was destroyed my email was filled with crap abouit buying the game and i am not restarting something like this i had just unlocked class a racing when this happened so you can imagine how upset i am
13505	lightly grazed the talelight of an npc driver npc driver accelerates forwards and begins turning frantically in the middle of the road he crashes into a wall after I basically had nothing to do with it I get a takedown  10/10  would drive carefully and cause massive destruction accidentally again
13506	Bad bad game. Poorly designed world, lack of challenges, inability to skip cut-scenes, horrible menu interface, and all around grindy same-yness. A weak sound track and a lack of the intensity previous installments have had make this a weak installment of the series.
13507	It's like someone took several elements of arcade racing, mashed it up into one game, and hired a team to make it 'open world'.  Keyboard users, take note! This game is not designed for a keyboard, but it can be re-mapped (for instance, I re-mapped the vehicle[s] to work with the WASD controls). Once I did that, it was actually a joy to play.  One big gripe I have about this game is it looks, plays as, and feels like an HD reboot of a PS2 game. Hell, I'm even forgiving the bad port from console to PC in that one. Initially, the game looks great, but after about a half hour of playthrough you will want something else to happen.  But it doesn't.  It's basically a bad HD reboot of a PS2 game with lackadaisical reformatting. $5 is pretty good for this game, and you'll get some good mileage (no pun intended) from it for $5, but not much else.
13508	dont buy this game, why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ would you wanna play this boring game? bikes are fun for an hour. â¥â¥â¥â¥
13509	It's not very ultimate.
13510	Great game itself, but the controls are confusing, hard to find what you are looking for ingame. and crashed a lot
13511	Glitchy as â¥â¥â¥â¥
13512	Overall: 0 / 10  This is by far the most boring game I have ever played.
13513	Literally no race tracks, all open world. I hated that concept and how it was put into practice. Maybe its for you, but I hated this game, all the races and other events that they put in were boring and annoying for me. Race across the map to this location! Great now you're in the middle of nowhere...now race back to the city! Game also made me sick of listening to the damn theme song, I can't listen to it anymore. Not worth the dollar I paid in the humble bundle for the frusturation is caused.
13514	Not only did it have a graphical issue, even though my laptop blows the sysreqs out of the water, and it not deteact my official Xbox 360 controller, but the music listing sucks! I was able to forgive bad controller detection and playing in subpar graphics, but I'll be daarned if I am forced to play a racing game with crappy music. I can't get jiggy with this!
13515	I recommend reading forums about how often this game crashes. I've found forums as old as 2009 of gamers not being able to get passed the intro. I got farther than that but it crashed on me after just about every race, challenge, or car crash. One of the blue screen crashes corrupted my save file and I had to start over.
13516	While Burnout Paradise is a relatively good game from the Burnout series, this PC port is beyond awful. It seems like EA has made no attempt to patch the game upto date to fix any kinf of errors, and more than half of the people who've brought this are unable to even run the game because of game breaking crashes.  Its Hardware requirements aren't high, but actually getting to gameplay will require an unholy amount of faith on the 'once in a blue moon' gods.  Basicaly, don't waste your money on this port. Buy the game on the PS3 or Xbox 360, it's far better on console.
13517	Feels kind of aimless and unfocused to me. Might just not be my thing.
13518	is not complete 
13519	not that good tbh
13520	Base game: Great. The 'Ultimate' Box: just the base game, with it having been advertised and priced as being a GOTY package.   This is why you're so high on the list of most hated companies, EA.
13521	Full bulls*it of intro, how to, tutorial, be very patient for first one hour of non-skippable videos, tips, tooltips and popups but probably what else can be expected from EA..
13522	'The Not-So-Ultimate Box'
13523	If you want this 'ultimate box' I'd recommend just paying for it on console. You can't even get the add on's on here. Which it's just disgraceful for EA to do.
13524	simply not designed for PC even with a steering wheel.
13525	Pure garbage. Uninstall programs and disable webcam for it to work. First of ~100 steam games where I actually feel cheated. I'd much rather play Stunt Car Racer EGA than this console â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can't think of any positive thing to say about this game. Someone might enjoy it, but $5 is waaaayy to pricey. Uninstalled after 25min. Time spent trying to get it to work was more enjoyable than actually playing the game. First and last time I ever touch anything Burnout.
13526	Dumpster fire of a game. Starts with EA asking you to login to some nonsense system. Not web-based, so you can't use a password manager. Not Origin, for some reason because that would make sense. After each field you fill, you can't just click to the next, you have to click enter, then maybe you'll be allowed to click to move to the next field. Oh, and you already used that email address, so here, let's dump you back to start with no further direction.  Eventually you figure out that you can just skip the login if you aren't playing on line. Now you're treated to a few minute long, slow-moving pointless intro video. CAN YOU FEEL THE ADRENALINE YET?! Then you finally get to the game. Sweet! I remember playing that gamecube game in high school that looked like a racing game but was actually a crashing simulator. Except this isn't that game. This is an open world sandbox game, presumably because they don't understand what people like about that genre or what they liked about Burnout. So instead of getting in races where you can make rad bullet-time crashes, you get to drive around a mostly depopulated city looking for MacGuffins that allow you to start a street race. Oh, and there's no race course, just use your map to get around the city; you love commuting, right? Oh and no slow-mo crashes either, that would disrupt the flow of the open world gameplay. You can hit the other cars sure, but then they just sorta stop moving and you're mostly fine. Don't hit a wall head on though, then your car will be wrecked and you'll start over from down the street. No, the wreck won't look cool, haven't I explained yet how much this game hates Burnout?  Oh what's that? You want to quit playing? Just try it punk. Protip, to find the save and quit button, press ESC, then press F1 three times, then save &amp; quit. I am not kidding.   I don't remember when I got this, and it might have been free with a humble bundle, in which case I still paid too much for it. Not just bad, but actively desecrating a game I had fond memories of.
13527	I had never played this game before but I had played 100s of hrs of burnout takedown. This game is OK, but takedown was leagues better than this. I was kinda dissapointed.
13528	The sandbox mode feels like a bad GTA clone and the races require less skill in car control and more in interpreting the GPS directions. I found myself pausing in the middle of races just to plot out my course.
13529	This is EA being an enormous pile of garbage again. lets ignore that 'The Ultimate Box' gives you nothing outside of the normal game. EA actually just wont let me sign in to their crappy account system. I tried using my old account from when I played on PS3 'Wrong password'. I tried resetting the password which seemed to work. but when I then attempted to log in with this new password it said it was wrong again. So finally I made a new account, tried to log in 'Wrong password'. I'm assuming this is EA just not caring about this game because its older. But tat's a new level of lazy, not having a functioning sign in system, thats neccessary for me to use Multiplayer and buy your DLC. Why EA why!?
13530	First played this on the console ages ago, and now I'm back in the seat... behind my PC. Everything from flying debris to furious burnout chains down the motorway; it all brings back memories. ...But now I realize I have to unlock everything all over again. Poop.   The Pros:
13531	It Is tooooooooo boring 
13532	Cant play this game - game cant see my xbox windows controller. Disappointing.
13533	The game gets boring really quick. There is no story or anything. You are just racing and unlocking cars/bikes. And while there are a few racing modes, it still get's pretty monotonous. If you're going to play only single player mode, I wouldn't recommend it.
13534	Imagine a mix between GTA and a racing simulator. Burnout doesn't do anything really great and I found myself either playing GTA V or GRID. The gameplay is ok, the car mechanics are decent but overall I found the game to be more blah than anything else.
13535	The game great. The advertising terrible. I thought it came with all the dlc but it dosent plus if you want a load more content to play the game with you cant as they have closed the store on the game because EA moved over to origin because they're a bunch of greedy money grabbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Well done lads GG 11/10.
13536	Is there any DLC with this package... i dont think so just a market ploy to get money...
13537	Hastle to set up to actually work, ok but not great game
13538	game is so much boring.
13539	Do not buy this game.   It just quite simply doesnt work. I'm not allowed to start it up because my 'EA ID has too many personas attached', and as per usual, EA does not give a single flying â¥â¥â¥â¥ about having problems.  It's not even worth the price on sale since you will never be playing it anyway.
13540	Can't get through the authorization / login screen no matter what I try (tried numerous tips / solutions online to no avail) and if I skip login I am always met with a black screen only solved by resetting my computer.  Worst Â£1.50 I've ever spent :)
13541	This is one of my favorite racing games of all time. I lost track of the hours i have spent playing this on my Xbox 360.  Unfortunately EA never released the best DLCs for the PC version (Big Surf Island + Cops &amp; Robers) and this kind of feels like only half a game...   If you want have the full Burnout experience, try this game on the Xbox 360 or PS3, if you aren't really concerned about the missing DLCs, then for the low price it is currently on Steam you will be a happy gamer.
13542	Decent car game and at the right price would be worth buying i could not justify spending more then $5 on a game like this. It is a fun game to mess around. I would give it a 6/10 because after awhile it gets very boring and tedious.
13543	Good game, except that the events are trivially easy and figuring out a route from A to B is not fun. The game also seems really paranoid about you not having something to do so it constantly throws timers, counters, events, achievement notifications and cars at you.
13544	No online support left for this game. You'll find yourself driving around and doing linear challenges for the first few hours of discovery and then you'll be like me, uninstalling the damn thing. Lucky for me it was purchased on Humble Bundle and I didn't spend actual bucks on it.  Rating: 6/10
13545	Pathway markers are your friend.
13546	This game looked cool, but doesn't work. At all. My friend has it, and it works sometimes and even then, in game, it doesn't behave well. I can't even get past the cutscene, and from doing some digging, I'm one of many.
13547	Big Load Of Nope!
13548	Full bulls*it of intro, how to, tutorial, be very patient for first one hour of non-skippable videos, tips, tooltips and popups but probably what else can be expected from EA..
13549	If you want this 'ultimate box' I'd recommend just paying for it on console. You can't even get the add on's on here. Which it's just disgraceful for EA to do.
13550	terrible username/password system,
13551	Unless you know how to re enable the dlc you dont get whats advertised, I own the game on origin and its easy to do so... the dlc pages are dead Im shocked you can play multi, but there is a russian guide on steam on how you unlock all the cars
13552	Get it if it's cheap. It's fun, but something's missing :-(  I paid 1.5 Euro for it, and while I don't regret it, I think the money could have been spent better.  It's an unrealistic stupid funny racing game where you can and will crash often but it doesn't really matter. Cool cars, good music, fast races.  The main problem with the game is that they don't explain anything that would be important. You get the info that one key is for starting. Then realize it's also for accelerating. Maybe at some point you get the info which key is for (emergency) braking, or reversing/braking.  But overall? 'Just figure it out' seems to be the attitude. Especially when it comes to online racing - there is no real help in-game, and it seems that when you join a race, you stay where you are and have to find the others first. And figure out what exactly the race is about (time, stunts, specific courses, etc...). Just to be clear - 'find the others' means you may have to drive across the quite large map for a minute or more (depending on your driving skills) just to catch up with the other players. Who may already be engaged in some sort of activity.  To be fair, the game does give you a lot of information - but it doesn't explain it to you. While I was within a group of players, I saw constantly changing scores - 'Air time', 'crashes', 'take outs', etc... - I had (and have) no idea what exactly they were counting. Is there an overall score? No idea.  When you try it, give it some time. It takes time getting used to the way the car behaves, the way the camera shows you only a little bit of what is in front of you, and especially the way the braking/boosting works.  Bottom line? It's fun, but every time I play it I get frustrated with the way it works - or rather doesn't work. Join an online game - and realize you're five minutes away from the next player. Try to get there - only to have them cancel the game. Yay. Ride a bike and think about going online? Sure, but only with a car - not that the game will tell you so. You'll know when you're in your car instead of your bike.  All in all, if what you crave is reckless driving - go for it. You might want to take a peek at Nail'd as well, that doesn't have online mode anymore, unfortunately. But it does have progress (tournaments) of sorts.
13553	The port to pc is the single worse port I have ever played. Audio settings wouldn't save with a mouse, you had to use arrow keys to get them to save. The standard keybindings were awful. All the settings were menus in menus. The facecam is turned on by default as well as the mic. My friend said he could hear me before I was in any game only the party and it had no notice letting me know I was outputting. Also I couldn't turn it off, the settings would never save.   Literally the worst game I've played in the last 5 years. 0/10
13554	this game didn't age well at all, but in 2009 real time crash physics like this was unheard of. So as a nastagic trip i'd recommend this, but for completion it's unbearable. There are just way to many things out there that are better then this relic from 2009.
13555	'The Not-So-Ultimate Box'
13556	if you forget your user and pass there is no way of ever playing this game
13557	'the ultimate box' may â¥â¥â¥ no DLC at all and the DLC is no longer available glad i only paic Â£1 for it in a humble bundle  not to mention the incredablely poor menu layout
13558	Crushing, Smashing, Crashing. Destroy cars in slow-mo. But does get boring after a while.
13559	nty ps2 ones were better.
13560	I really don't know if this is good or not. It just crashes my computer. Tried all the listed fixes. Every now and then I forget and redownload, then it attempts to destroy my computer. I wish I could remove it from my list.
13561	literally one of my all time favorite games, but DO NOT BUY IT.  The game literally dosent launch correctly 80% of the time, even when using work arounds like compatablity mode and such. The optimization is terrible.  And as a side not, even though it says ultimate edition it has no DLC, and no support is existing to purchase DLC.
13562	This game has nice visuals for 2009 and a good soundtrack but for me that seems to be all the positives. The actual gameplay is so boring. It's just drive from A to B taking a straight road and that's pretty much all the missions/races involve. The minimap doesn't rotate to your orientation. There isn't even anyone driving in the vehicle. When you look in the car, there's no driver. I mean really? It's not hard just to put a model in there with a few animations. The physics are absolutely awful. You can literally crash into things on a motorbike at like 100+mph (might I add there is no speedometer) and nothing happens. You don't fall off you just get a little bump that pushes back into the road. Even if you do crash head on you just get respawned nicely anyway. There is no depth in the game, for example you just drive through a place and your vehicle is automatically repaired. Above all, there is no skill to the driving. I didn't feel like I was actually driving and needed to think about speed and positioning. There is literally no skill. I was just flat out holding the accelerator button for all the races. Having said all this, if you're into an arcade like driving game, not based on realism you might like this. But if you want a skill based driving game that requires you to control your speed and positioning and things like that, then I would stay away from this game.
13563	city viewed from a car simulator  1/10
13564	Play this if you miss the feeling of consoles on PC. Unskippable cutscenes, poor mouse support, horrible menus, and hey, why not make you sign in to your EA account without allowing @ to be used in your username?
13565	Great game but so much of the actual 'Ultimate Box' content is missing and not even available for some reason.
13566	Bought for the Delorean. Deleted because you can't acess it.
13567	'Live fast, die young, crash spectacularly! That's pretty much what this game is about. Participate in races, crash into people, or just cruise around the map. Lots of fun to be had, especially with online multiplayer.'  That's what I said about this game when I first got it. Frankly, that review came from when I played it on Xbox. The Steam version of the game? That's a different story. I have the ultimate box. That is supposed to include all of the DLC for the game. What does it include? Nothing other than the vanilla game and party mode. Aside from that, you can't play any of the special cars or events. How do you fix this? Apparently it wants you to use Origin. That means buy the DLC (again) and hope the keys work. Some of the DLC doesn't even work and the game itself is no longer supported. I got this via Humble Bundle. If you're just looking to buy it, don't bother. There are plenty new and old games that have the same replay value as Burnout. Such a shame. Another great game ruined by EA.
13568	Why get a game called the 'ultimate' box if you cant have any or most of the DLC. I was dissapointed the fact that the DLC was almost a tease
13569	Did you like the Burnout games? Probably really liked the crash point counter and the strategy of getting the biggest pile ups and combo points right? Well they took all that out of the game and now its just a racing game. Its really bad.
13570	This game just isnt what i expected. it didn't have that unique Burnout feel to it like in Burnout 3: Takedown. The game itself felt like it wasn't made with the most intention to satisfy the player. They could have made the game have so much more like increasing customization options but they didn't, that's a huge loss itself. The game got boring very quickly as it felt like the races were all the same. I definitely do not recommend this game if you have played Burnout 3: Takedown.
13571	Great game, but cant purchase any of the add-on vehicles or big surf island, so if you think you are getting everything with the purchase of this game...You are not!! Why you cant purchase the add-ons is a mystery since support for the game is lacking. Do I reccomend the game? YES! but not how it is sold as the ultimate box since it ultimately comes missing the DLC of the game
13572	The game gets repedative really quickly. The open world is big and all. But it lacks variety. You will drive around the city looking for cars to smash in order to unlock. Plus there is micro-transactions btw.
13573	Can't even run this game for some reason, and no it's not cause I have a underpowered pc.
13574	Who Puts a mini map in the middle of the screen? game is completly ruined by it and If you know how to turn it off or change it let me know.
13575	I've always loved the burnout series but was disappointed to learn that none of the bonus 'legendary' cars can be unlocked in this version due to the online store being taken down. What's the point of selling a version of this game with content you can never access?
13576	I have only played burnout for a few hours. Now to be fair these off the wall racing games are not really my cup of tea. I loved burnout 3 takedown. This is nothing like that. This is more race driven game from what i can see. The multiplayer is a bit confusing to get started. I strongly recommend a controller or steering wheel to make it easier. I love most of the NFS, Forza and Dirt games. However this is not like that. If you are a Die Hard burnout fan then this may work for you. But not really my thing. Maybe if i gave it more time. Something tells me that that will not help.
13577	The menu on PC are not user friendly. And there is some issues in the gameplay. For instance, each time I pass a driver liscence they want me to take another webcam picture. Sounds are not that great and driving experience a bit dissapointing. If you have like old NFS games like Most-Wanted or underground 1-2 , If you liked Flatout 1 or 2 well do not buy. If it is your first experience at arcade racing game, you could give it try while it's on sale for less than 10$.
13578	This game was fun when I first got it, however there really is no big motivating factor to continue playing aside from obtaining more cars. Repetetive missions, long loading times, and content that was more novelty than anything. This is one of those games that you would enjoy at first, but will regret buying in the later days. 5/10.
13579	In order to start this game, you have to manually locate the XLive launcher as per  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=719235  to install the right libraries. The game itself is a crappy console port that tells you to 'Press A' and 'Press B' when they mean the space bar or enter. No thought was put into this. Avoid at anycost. That I had to play 5 minutes to even write this review was painful enough.
13580	Got this game in a Humble Bundle farly cheap, but the game it's self has a lot of issues. I had to uninstall my Dxtory in order for the game to actually run.  If the publisher had made a patch to fix this issue i would have enjoyed the game a lot more, At times it felt like the publisher had released the game then forgot about it.
13581	Well, where do I begin? How about the good stuff? Burnout Paradise is a perfect racing/crash test simulator. It graphics, while outdated in the current time, are consistent under high speed races and give the general 'sullen' look of the city. It doesn't really take much to get anywhere and all you need is a stunt car, which you are given at the beginning of the game, to have fun. The races are logical and the idea that you can travel on any path is uncommon amongst most simulators today. The cars are nice and some are screen accurate, and in my opinion, the dlc cars are the best.  This brings me to the faults, of which, they are prominent. The online mode is completely broken. In my experience, I can niether connect to the EA servers, nor access the extra DLC in this edition, which is very unsatisfying as I basically bought this edition to drive the 'legendary cars'. My problems do not stop here though. As of now, there is no way to sync a playlist of my own, something that was allowed in the console versions of this game. Instead you are limited to the default songs, while are nice, are repetitive after less than 10 plays and do nothing to really experience the fast-paced action of extreme racing. The handling as well, is something left to be desired as simply push a button does not simulate the increase in speed as effectively as a controller. In my honest opinion, I loved playing this game, on console that is, and I'd recommend that anyone who wishes to purchase this should buy it on a console as it appears to be truly made with controller support.
13582	Well...  A friend of mines last words were 'Once you go on, you never come back' while playing this game...  He never came back
13583	0/10 to many cutscenes
13584	could this be the worst game going?
13585	Worst controlls EVER
13586	An irrelevant game with GTA 5 now available.
13587	I hate it!
13588	This game is a slap to the face of any arcade racer fan. Its menu alone is a mix of puke and excrements on your face. The gameplay is stiff not even trying to have any physical resemblance to the real world and makes no fun at all.
13589	Waste of money.  I purchased this intending on playing it, how wrong I was.  Since the day I purchased it, It hasn't worked once, I use a somewhat decent computer but this crashes after a few seconds and idols in the background as even attempting to close it in the task makager only breaks it and have to hard reset the pc.  
13590	Well, I managed to get to the Elite License, at which point all that's left to do is re-complete every event and unlock the remaining cars.  First thing right from the start that still bugs me is this new fasination with making racing games open world cities. It's a terrible Idea because it makes people preak the flow of the game to look at their map all the time! Even as far in as I got I STILL had to check my map several times! There's no way that's gonna work in online play.  Another issue I found was that certain Speed cars had issues. You'd hit the gas from a standstill and you'd lose control of the car. The tires would spin and force you into a drift. This was really frustrating.  Another was with the way you start races, by hitting Forward + Brake/Reverse at intersections. This is also how the game does Drifting, so you can see the conflict here when you just wanna roll around town practicing your Drifting.  Another, which if mostly and issue with DRM and EA's usual bullsh*t, is that you have to log in to a server with an EA account just to play the game, even in 1 player mode. That's bad business.  Ultimately, this isn't the same burnout people loved on the PS2. It's far too easy to take cars out, a few of the races feel impossible to win unless everything's perfect and you take every shortcut, and the color customization has it's limits.  The soundtrack is still garbage. The only songs worth listening to are My Curse by Killswitch Engage, and Collapse by Saosin.  I was plating Need For Speed: Undercover at the same time as this, and gameplay wise that is a better racing game. ONLY get Burnout Paradise if you're really that into smashing people into guard rails and taking sweet jumps just to fall into a river.
13591	How to fail by Crierion and EA  Provide a PC port of a console game that does not support the XBOX 360 controller correctly.
13592	So many races, so little fun.
13593	Gorgeous, but the gameplay just gets so unbelievably boring. Huge disappointment compared to Burnout 3.
13594	5/10 Meh. Graphics are terrible. Gameplay is weak. Requires an EA account. Actually, 4/10 because of that. Will not play again.
13595	This should not still be advertised on steam as a Multiplayer game as all the servers were switched off years ago. Single player is decent but gets very repetitive. Unless you see it 75% off, it's not worth buying.
13596	It's okay. A bit TOO open.. not much direction or inspiration. I miss the old Burnout formula. Still, crashes are nice, controls are decent. Not worth a purchase though, too shallow. It's saving grace is co-op madness with friends. But with no progression, it's just a sandbox. 4/10
13597	If Burnout: Paradise were just about puttering around an open world and making your own fun it would be decent. The real problems lie with the missions. It has a few inspired elements, but each of the designers' good decisions seem to be matched by at least as many baffling oversights.  None of the cars are based on real-world vehicles and as such they're free to dial up the performance to ridiculous extremes. Cars can accelerate to incredible speeds and stop practically on a dime. Power-sliding with the e-brake is difficult and often results in spinning out. Drifting doesn't feel as satisfying as other racing games but is rarely necessary due to the incredible grip that most cars seem to have, even at blistering speeds. At least I assume they're blistering based solely on how fast the trees and buildings go by, because one of the most egregious of the oversights mentioned earlier is the lack of a speedometer.  The map is a good size and the roads are nicely varied. You can't set waypoints and there's no fast travel, but it only takes a couple of minutes to drive from one end of the map to the other in most cars. The east is mostly dense city, laid out in a neat grid with a highway wrapping around the perimeter. The west is more rural and mountainous in the north. Blasting through the mountain passes and around the hairpin turns is a good fun, but you can only do it so many times before it gets stale. Scattered all over the map are hidden paths marked by breakable yellow signs. Finding all of these is an okay diversion; mostly they lead to shortcuts and jumps, but occasionally reveal hidden play areas not seen on the overhead map full of ramps and race tracks free of any other traffic.   Everything mentioned so far is just noodling around on your own steam. The missions dotted liberally across Paradise City provide the intended meat of the gameplay, but they're lacking in variety with only four very similar mission types. You'll always find yourself going from point A to B as fast as possible while trying to smash the other cars and avoiding getting smashed yourself. Each car also has a unique mission to unlock a special alternate version of that same car, but that too is just a timed race. Lack of variety wouldn't be a problem on its own, as a small amount of challenging missions would still be engaging. The problem is that they're not challenging in the least.   Burnout: Paradise excretes leniency out of every pore of its body. AI opponents seem to always hover a short distance in front of you no matter how poorly you drive, though they're fairly happy to stay behind once you pass them. Races are easy to win with a good chunk of time to spare. Even wrecking your car goes virtually unpunished, even in the 'marked man' missions where the whole point is not to crash.  The idea of the game is great but the execution is lacking. It's fun to drive around for a little while on your own, and you could probably lengthen your enjoyment with a friend in co-op. Even then I can't recommend it unless you've exhausted your supply of otherwise superior racing games currently available.
13598	Make yourself a favor, don't buy this game. I got it in a humble bundle so I didn't really mean't to buy it, but I was a bit excited to try though, as the last burnout I got the chance to try was the third, which was an awesome game for it's time. I have to warn you, the only thing this so called burnout inherited from the franchise is the name. It is ugly (even for a 2009 game), it's not enjoyable to play, and it is going to get off my hard drive as fast as it got in. The only thing that is good in this game ? The intro song, but don't bother install the game to hear it !
13599	This game is very EA. It holds your hand and tries to be cute with not a lot of content. I was wanting a racing game, instead this is like kiddie-fied bumper cars. If you're looking for something that would compete with the old Need For Speed games or Gran Turismo, this is NOT for you.
13600	So many races, so little fun.
13601	This should not still be advertised on steam as a Multiplayer game as all the servers were switched off years ago. Single player is decent but gets very repetitive. Unless you see it 75% off, it's not worth buying.
13602	no external controller support which sucks.
13603	5/10 Meh. Graphics are terrible. Gameplay is weak. Requires an EA account. Actually, 4/10 because of that. Will not play again.
13604	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. An action game where you have to pause the game to check the map, becaus eyou have no indicator for what route to take. Game breaking.
13605	i payed for this game to get toy cars to have fun and the burnout store has closed so you cannot download them. i wasted my money on this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't buy avoid !!!!
13606	Don't buy this game, EA thought it would be funny to just remove all of the DLC even thought I paid for it... This kindda crap is the reason why I've chosen to boycott games from EA.
13607	Nope.  The Ultimate Box does not give you all DLC's.. The store is closed down so you cant even get all DLC ingame. Huge disappointment. I owned it on XB360 and thought i would get all the DLC in the so call 'Ultimate Box'.. Now i just feel sad. Save the money, buy something else. If you have to own a game from EA, buy something good like Mirrors Edge.. Or just politely tell EA to go frack themself. :D (BSG FTW!)
13608	I didn't like Burnout Paradise at all, the game has one of the worse menus I have ever seen, not sure if it is even a menu, handling is slightly better than NFS games but still crap, not sure why I even bought this POS, I didnt bother finishing it.
13609	This game is very simple, driving feels like the computer is doing everything, it has one of the least intuitive menues I've ever seen and the environments look badly made and repetitive even with the settings maxed out. This game doesn't have anything special and once you've driven five kilometres, you've seen everything there is in my opinion as far as gameplay is concerned. On top of that, the environments feel like they were made exactly for a couple of specific routes because a lot of 'shortcuts' seem to have been made just by running a bulldozer through the finished city, so you wouldn't have to make any real turns while taking them. I surely wouldn't reccomend it.
13610	Is there any DLC with this package... i dont think so just a market ploy to get money...
13611	- No quit button (seriously)  Ain't nobody got time for that. 
13612	Very short and repetitive game. Only would be worth it if you are out of games to play or buy. Don't buy unless it is on a serious discount.
13613	So much better on xbox.   terrible controls :(   3/10
13614	Great arcade driving ruined by an annoying 'open world' map-reading mechanic. The majority of the challenge comes from trying to avoid taking the wrong route.  also does not support  f.lux/windowed  mode
13615	Do not buy this game.   It just quite simply doesnt work. I'm not allowed to start it up because my 'EA ID has too many personas attached', and as per usual, EA does not give a single flying â¥â¥â¥â¥ about having problems.  It's not even worth the price on sale since you will never be playing it anyway.
13616	Can't get through the authorization / login screen no matter what I try (tried numerous tips / solutions online to no avail) and if I skip login I am always met with a black screen only solved by resetting my computer.  Worst Â£1.50 I've ever spent :)
13617	Avoid it like the plague! While it might bring you some sort of fun, it's still gonna manage to frustrate the hell out of you! Car jandling is quite terrible, the soundtrack is abysmal with maybe only 5 decent songs in there and the AI is basically non-existant. And even thought it's 'open-world' it's still very constricting.
13618	I loved this game when I had it for PS3. I saw it for sale on steam and immediately picked it up, seeing that it had all the DLC. However, Critereon Games no longer supports it, so you cannot access the DLC you paid for. The game is solid, and can be modded to get all the DLC, but it's kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that I can't use what I paid for. Still a good open world, arcade style racer.
13619	Even when having received this game for free, it's a nightmare and waste to my steamcollection. Freakin another EA failgame forcing me to scroll more to my favourite games.  So what is wrong with this game? - Each time when launching the game you are auto-redirected out of the game to a news page. - The newspage is totally blank... - The settingsmenu is hidden - The pre-configured inputkeys for keyboard and pre-configured controller setup is mindbraking.  * keyboard left and right arrowkeys are inverted  * controller wheel steering is configured to go back in the UI menu. Meaning you can not discover that a settingsmenu exists. I had to unplug the wheel from the pc to be able to go to the settingsmenu, plug it back in to adjust all keys, X and Y axis, etc.  - There is no decent force feedback support (a core part for a racegame) - There is no option to modify deadzones of controller-input (a core part for a racegame) - There is no hud cam (a core part for a racegame) - The driving experience is arcade to the bone. After having driven a kilometer ingame I'd seen enough of the entire game. There is no challenge to be found in this game.  On a scale to 10 I give it a 0 for a pc game. The game is made for the console and should have stayed there.
13620	This is a typical example of a game developer taking a fairly decent series and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing it up with a change of gameplay. While there were some things that were good about the open world system (such as creating a crash when and where you want) for the most part it is absolute crap. The game is clearly optimized for gamepad use ONLY and the UI are frustrating. Furthermore the lack of in car graphics, speedometer and tachometer show that this was clearly a rushed or ill planned game. If you want a racing game (Why is another question) you should stick with the original burnout games (Most of which were good) or get gran turismo.  Long story short. Don't get it. unless you wish to waste money.
13621	Pretty good, don't get it on PC though, get it on PS3.
13622	After playing Burnout 1-3 on Playstation this part was a huge disappointment, especially after noticing that the main part of Burnout is missing.... the huge crossway crashes for points/money. Yes, the game looks nice and does have some beautifull cars etc. but it just isnÂ´t the same game anymore... trying to copy a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ need for speed underground gaming style. Hope they go back to the roots in their next game.
13623	I didn't like Burnout Paradise at all, the game has one of the worse menus I have ever seen, not sure if it is even a menu, handling is slightly better than NFS games but still crap, not sure why I even bought this POS, I didnt bother finishing it.
13624	Nope.  The Ultimate Box does not give you all DLC's.. The store is closed down so you cant even get all DLC ingame. Huge disappointment. I owned it on XB360 and thought i would get all the DLC in the so call 'Ultimate Box'.. Now i just feel sad. Save the money, buy something else. If you have to own a game from EA, buy something good like Mirrors Edge.. Or just politely tell EA to go frack themself. :D (BSG FTW!)
13625	This game should have never been ported to the PC. I got it in the Origin humble bundle and installed it first because it was only 2 gb. Graphics are jagged and the default controls are absolutely stupid! Hold A to accelerate and the arrow keys to turn. Wtf, seriously, who came up with such stupid controls?? Luckily you can change them.  This is a console game, not for PC. 5/10 (good game, but it should stay with consoles)
13626	Just to give fair warning, purchasing this game will not give you access to the DLC that the Ultimate Box supposedly comes with. THe in game store has been shut down and it is impossible to actually download the DLC whether you own it or not.
13627	0/10 to many cutscenes
13628	Who Puts a mini map in the middle of the screen? game is completly ruined by it and If you know how to turn it off or change it let me know.
13629	could this be the worst game going?
13630	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Dreadful
13631	Such a disappointing game from the Burnout Series. It takes all the fun and mayhem that you have grown so very accustomed to, and throws it out the window for what becomes very repetetive uneventful race events. It is almost a barebone racing game that allows very little customization and even less of a feel of progression. I had bought in on sale, and that is the only redeeming quality: I got what I payed for.  If you are in to racing games without tuning your cars and like the world to be shiny (and small), this might be a game for you.  3/10 - Racing stripes doesn't make your car a race car.
13632	Well, where do I begin? How about the good stuff? Burnout Paradise is a perfect racing/crash test simulator. It graphics, while outdated in the current time, are consistent under high speed races and give the general 'sullen' look of the city.

In my honest opinion, I loved playing this game, on console that is, and I'd recommend that anyone who wishes to purchase this should buy it on a console as it appears to be truly made with controller support.
13633	Well, I managed to get to the Elite License, at which point all that's left to do is re-complete every event and unlock the remaining cars.  First thing right from the start that still bugs me is this new fasination with making racing games open world cities. It's a terrible Idea because it makes people preak the flow of the game to look at their map all the time! Even as far in as I got I STILL had to check my map several times!

I was plating Need For Speed: Undercover at the same time as this, and gameplay wise that is a better racing game. ONLY get Burnout Paradise if you're really that into smashing people into guard rails and taking sweet jumps just to fall into a river.
13634	Well. I haven't played much out of it, but... It seems pretty dull. Especially when you have really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sense of direction, this game becomes 'find your way around town and don't smash yourself into the wall' instead of racing game.
13635	Waste of money.  I purchased this intending on playing it, how wrong I was.  Since the day I purchased it, It hasn't worked once, I use a somewhat decent computer but this crashes after a few seconds and idols in the background as even attempting to close it in the task makager only breaks it and have to hard reset the pc.  
13636	Meh. I prefer the originals. Designing a crash and beating the online totals was the whole reason I loved this game. They made it more like need for speed. Another open world driving clone.
13637	finding the options and such is too confusing.... junk
13638	The only reason why you should own this game is because you got it on a $1 humblebundle
13639	If you are reading this review in 2014 or later don't buy this game. First of all graphic is really outdated, and gameplay is not much. Physics are also kinda funny. You can find better (newer) game for the same money.
13640	Highly not-recommended due to the fact this 'Ultimate Box' is NOT at all Ultimate in ANY WAY If you want this game buy it on ps3 at least then you can access Big Surf Island more cars etc
13641	I can't get this game to run on my PC. It seems there are a lot of other people who have the same problem, but there are also people for who this game runs just fine. I guess you can't really know until you try this game. Buy it when it's on sale if you really want to try it, that way you won't have thrown away much money on a 2009 console port.  Also: unskippable cutscene's.
13642	Avoid this like the mother-loving plague, even if 95% off on sale.  BAD console port with interminable loading times, and frequent crash-to-desktops, not to mention having to jump through hoops to login to EA's servers so it can save your play stats and races and whatnot properly.  Truly an awful non-PC game here.
13643	Beautiful graphics in this fully fleshed out sandbox without the requirement to break peoples kneecaps. There's always a place to go, and you'll never feel like you're hauling around yet another corpse, because you're going there insanely fast. The crashes are entertaining and different, and there are a ton of game modes. The voice overs are well done, and aren't repetitive. It's easy to learn, and fun to master, but not terribly difficult. One of my favorite racing games ever.  Update: EA dropped the servers and decided not to let anyone else take over, so many of the achieves are broken and there is now no multiplayer. 3/10.
13644	Avoid it like the plague! While it might bring you some sort of fun, it's still gonna manage to frustrate the hell out of you! Car jandling is quite terrible, the soundtrack is abysmal with maybe only 5 decent songs in there and the AI is basically non-existant. And even thought it's 'open-world' it's still very constricting.
13645	Gud game, make a account. 1 Year later. HMM what was my account stuff. Well i dont mater ill make a new account. (PRODUCT LICENCE ALLREADY REGISTURED WITH ACCOUNT CONTACT ONE OF THE WORST SUPPORT SYSTEMS EVER IF SOMTHINGS WRONG. (game closes)  Now ill never be able to play with my friend.  EA u suck.
13646	'It's not a bad game, it's just a game for dumb people!' - Drew Credico
13647	Quick points for why I think this game is terrible:  - You drive around the same stupid, small city for the whole game. Sandbox? More like litter box. - It is wildly unrealistic, even for a Burnout video game- makes most arcade games feel like racing simulators by comparison. - Cute slow-mo action shots when you take jumps. Would be awesome if I was 8. - During races, you get a terrible GPS arrow guide that won't help you see where the next turn is. Unless you want to pause and go to the map screen, then unpause back to the game. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Hated the layout and configuration. - Shortcuts are confusing and worthless. Racing felt like it had more to do with navigation than focusing on driving.  All in all, I hated this game and am surprised that it got such high scores. I could have pointed out some positive aspects of Burnout Paradise (there are a few), but my disappointment has clouded my vision. Maybe I need to lower my expectations. You could find better racing in many, many other games. Do not buy this game.
13648	Feels kind of aimless and unfocused to me. Might just not be my thing.
13649	is not complete 
13650	Not the best game. But still pretty good.
13651	Extra content does not work, the graphics are mediocre and the gameplay is laughable at best.
13652	The game gets boring really quick. There is no story or anything. You are just racing and unlocking cars/bikes. And while there are a few racing modes, it still get's pretty monotonous. If you're going to play only single player mode, I wouldn't recommend it.
13653	Pure garbage. Uninstall programs and disable webcam for it to work. First of ~100 steam games where I actually feel cheated. I'd much rather play Stunt Car Racer EGA than this console â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can't think of any positive thing to say about this game. Someone might enjoy it, but $5 is waaaayy to pricey. Uninstalled after 25min. Time spent trying to get it to work was more enjoyable than actually playing the game. First and last time I ever touch anything Burnout.
13654	 Pro's   Great at what it does.   Con's   What it does isn't great.    Arcade racing is dead...long live the arcade racer...   With sim driving games becoming ever more accurate, entry level driving games becoming more sim-like with every iteration, and the floaty arcade 'physics' of the truly arcade 'arcade racer' now almost completely a thing of the past, Burnout has basically...yep, you guessed it: burned out.  It's a shame since Burnout Paradise, save for a few muddy textures here and there (namely actually the mud textures) still looks great and has the overall structure of a really excellent arcade romp but what's aged most seriously and most detrimentally is specifically the car handling.  The cars are tuned to be able to corner more or less perfectly at ridiculous speeds (a requirement dictated by the earlier Burnout games) and as such have handling so far removed from real-world physics that even by today's standards, for the arcade-racer end of the driving game continuum, they feel counterintuitive, unwieldy and ultimately really just broken.  For instance if you tap the break it should give you more traction and better handling rather than destabalise the car, as it seems to do across the board without fail in Burnout Paradise.  If someone could get into the guts of the thing and just make the power, speed and handling of the cars actually just vaguely realistic, adjust the camera placement etc., I'd happily play through the entire game, but as it is, even paying only Â£4.99 for it I still feel like I paid too much, as ultimately, I feel like I bought something that looks great and has a huge amount of promise but which is simply just fundamentally broken at its core.  Burnout Paradise is to today's open world driving games what the Afterburner jet would be to the arcade flight combat games of the Burnout era: confusing, unwieldy and ultimately unsatisfying. Video game driving has moved on; Burnout has been left behind.
13655	Well, I managed to get to the Elite License, at which point all that's left to do is re-complete every event and unlock the remaining cars.  First thing right from the start that still bugs me is this new fasination with making racing games open world cities. It's a terrible Idea because it makes people preak the flow of the game to look at their map all the time! Even as far in as I got I STILL had to check my map several times! There's no way that's gonna work in online play.  Another issue I found was that certain Speed cars had issues. You'd hit the gas from a standstill and you'd lose control of the car. The tires would spin and force you into a drift. This was really frustrating.  Another was with the way you start races, by hitting Forward + Brake/Reverse at intersections. This is also how the game does Drifting, so you can see the conflict here when you just wanna roll around town practicing your Drifting.  Another, which if mostly and issue with DRM and EA's usual bullsh*t, is that you have to log in to a server with an EA account just to play the game, even in 1 player mode. That's bad business.  Ultimately, this isn't the same burnout people loved on the PS2. It's far too easy to take cars out, a few of the races feel impossible to win unless everything's perfect and you take every shortcut, and the color customization has it's limits.  The soundtrack is still garbage. The only songs worth listening to are My Curse by Killswitch Engage, and Collapse by Saosin.  I was plating Need For Speed: Undercover at the same time as this, and gameplay wise that is a better racing game. ONLY get Burnout Paradise if you're really that into smashing people into guard rails and taking sweet jumps just to fall into a river.
13656	Played a few hours. However, this game could not please me. Not recommended for the real race-gamers. However still a decent casual racer.
13657	Why do you guys not know how to patch your own game to fix crashes. Why do mass amounts of people have to do it themselves because these people are too Incompetent?
13658	You drive and win, easiest game of your life
13659	I have really enjoyed Need for Speed: Paradise. There was no car tuning, no police chases, but the car destruction was awesome. Did I say Need for Speed Paradise? I meant Burnout Paradise, whoops.
13660	Even when having received this game for free, it's a nightmare and waste to my steamcollection. Freakin another EA failgame forcing me to scroll more to my favourite games.  So what is wrong with this game? - Each time when launching the game you are auto-redirected out of the game to a news page. - The newspage is totally blank... - The settingsmenu is hidden - The pre-configured inputkeys for keyboard and pre-configured controller setup is mindbraking.  * keyboard left and right arrowkeys are inverted  * controller wheel steering is configured to go back in the UI menu. Meaning you can not discover that a settingsmenu exists. I had to unplug the wheel from the pc to be able to go to the settingsmenu, plug it back in to adjust all keys, X and Y axis, etc.  - There is no decent force feedback support (a core part for a racegame) - There is no option to modify deadzones of controller-input (a core part for a racegame) - There is no hud cam (a core part for a racegame) - The driving experience is arcade to the bone. After having driven a kilometer ingame I'd seen enough of the entire game. There is no challenge to be found in this game.  On a scale to 10 I give it a 0 for a pc game. The game is made for the console and should have stayed there.
13661	This is a typical example of a game developer taking a fairly decent series and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing it up with a change of gameplay. While there were some things that were good about the open world system (such as creating a crash when and where you want) for the most part it is absolute crap. The game is clearly optimized for gamepad use ONLY and the UI are frustrating. Furthermore the lack of in car graphics, speedometer and tachometer show that this was clearly a rushed or ill planned game. If you want a racing game (Why is another question) you should stick with the original burnout games (Most of which were good) or get gran turismo.  Long story short. Don't get it. unless you wish to waste money.
13662	If Burnout: Paradise were just about puttering around an open world and making your own fun it would be decent. The real problems lie with the missions. It has a few inspired elements, but each of the designers' good decisions seem to be matched by at least as many baffling oversights.  None of the cars are based on real-world vehicles and as such they're free to dial up the performance to ridiculous extremes. Cars can accelerate to incredible speeds and stop practically on a dime. Power-sliding with the e-brake is difficult and often results in spinning out. Drifting doesn't feel as satisfying as other racing games but is rarely necessary due to the incredible grip that most cars seem to have, even at blistering speeds. At least I assume they're blistering based solely on how fast the trees and buildings go by, because one of the most egregious of the oversights mentioned earlier is the lack of a speedometer.  The map is a good size and the roads are nicely varied. You can't set waypoints and there's no fast travel, but it only takes a couple of minutes to drive from one end of the map to the other in most cars. The east is mostly dense city, laid out in a neat grid with a highway wrapping around the perimeter. The west is more rural and mountainous in the north. Blasting through the mountain passes and around the hairpin turns is a good fun, but you can only do it so many times before it gets stale. Scattered all over the map are hidden paths marked by breakable yellow signs. Finding all of these is an okay diversion; mostly they lead to shortcuts and jumps, but occasionally reveal hidden play areas not seen on the overhead map full of ramps and race tracks free of any other traffic.   Everything mentioned so far is just noodling around on your own steam. The missions dotted liberally across Paradise City provide the intended meat of the gameplay, but they're lacking in variety with only four very similar mission types. You'll always find yourself going from point A to B as fast as possible while trying to smash the other cars and avoiding getting smashed yourself. Each car also has a unique mission to unlock a special alternate version of that same car, but that too is just a timed race. Lack of variety wouldn't be a problem on its own, as a small amount of challenging missions would still be engaging. The problem is that they're not challenging in the least.   Burnout: Paradise excretes leniency out of every pore of its body. AI opponents seem to always hover a short distance in front of you no matter how poorly you drive, though they're fairly happy to stay behind once you pass them. Races are easy to win with a good chunk of time to spare. Even wrecking your car goes virtually unpunished, even in the 'marked man' missions where the whole point is not to crash.  The idea of the game is great but the execution is lacking. It's fun to drive around for a little while on your own, and you could probably lengthen your enjoyment with a friend in co-op. Even then I can't recommend it unless you've exhausted your supply of otherwise superior racing games currently available.
13663	Make yourself a favor, don't buy this game. I got it in a humble bundle so I didn't really mean't to buy it, but I was a bit excited to try though, as the last burnout I got the chance to try was the third, which was an awesome game for it's time. I have to warn you, the only thing this so called burnout inherited from the franchise is the name. It is ugly (even for a 2009 game), it's not enjoyable to play, and it is going to get off my hard drive as fast as it got in. The only thing that is good in this game ? The intro song, but don't bother install the game to hear it !
13664	Why get a game called the 'ultimate' box if you cant have any or most of the DLC. I was dissapointed the fact that the DLC was almost a tease
13665	omg the controls are bad for this and rebinding them seems to be broken
13666	dont buy this game its bad
13667	Lacks the fun the other Burnout-games had, its just boring and confusing.
13668	not what i expected bought it for all the dlcs that was available for consoles but not available any more on the pc. Its realy not worth the money.
13669	Too many technical issues. I couldnât get it to work properly with my wireless controller and there is no way I was playing a racking game on a keyboard.
13670	Did you like the Burnout games? Probably really liked the crash point counter and the strategy of getting the biggest pile ups and combo points right? Well they took all that out of the game and now its just a racing game. Its really bad.
13671	The name is misleading, There is no DLC included other than the free stuff. So basically this is just plain old 'Burnout Paradise'. Very disappointing but its my own fault for not reading more about it before I bought it. Still a great game regardless. You can no longer buy any of the DLC so I would suggest getting it for Xbox 360 or PS3.
13672	Decent car game and at the right price would be worth buying i could not justify spending more then $5 on a game like this. It is a fun game to mess around. I would give it a 6/10 because after awhile it gets very boring and tedious.
13673	after the third day of playing all mycars were deleted and my account was destroyed my email was filled with crap abouit buying the game and i am not restarting something like this i had just unlocked class a racing when this happened so you can imagine how upset i am
13674	not as good as need for speed...
13675	the game dosn't let my use the dlc's how do i fix it?
13676	Online never worked. Couldn't unlock any of the cars. could only use the ones provided. Soundtrack sucks, i don't know what the other reviewers listen to.
13677	You cant play coop together, this sucks
13678	Different type of racing game. Cars are cool though, as a money spending I bought the extra stuff just to make the game a but funnier when playing against my friends.
13679	Not really my kinda game, especially since the multiplayer functionality got removed but If that was still present 10/10 would recommend, but still a good game if your a petrol head like me :P!
13680	This game is awesome. Literally it is the best sandbox racing game till today. BUT! The 'ultimate box' is just a name. If you want to play this game with all add-ons buy ps3 version. This one is just a standard version.   9/10  Still better game than need for speed
13681	First played this on the console ages ago, and now I'm back in the seat... behind my PC. Everything from flying debris to furious burnout chains down the motorway; it all brings back memories. ...But now I realize I have to unlock everything all over again. Poop.   The Pros:
13682	This is EA being an enormous pile of garbage again. lets ignore that 'The Ultimate Box' gives you nothing outside of the normal game. EA actually just wont let me sign in to their crappy account system. I tried using my old account from when I played on PS3 'Wrong password'. I tried resetting the password which seemed to work. but when I then attempted to log in with this new password it said it was wrong again. So finally I made a new account, tried to log in 'Wrong password'. I'm assuming this is EA just not caring about this game because its older. But tat's a new level of lazy, not having a functioning sign in system, thats neccessary for me to use Multiplayer and buy your DLC. Why EA why!?
13683	I had never played this game before but I had played 100s of hrs of burnout takedown. This game is OK, but takedown was leagues better than this. I was kinda dissapointed.
13684	simply not designed for PC even with a steering wheel.
13685	Pfft! Total rubbish
13686	Base game: Great. The 'Ultimate' Box: just the base game, with it having been advertised and priced as being a GOTY package.   This is why you're so high on the list of most hated companies, EA.
13687	The game is good but I was looking for the experience that I had back on PS2 (Burnout 1). This one is one is... not it, and the music good as well but gets old very fast.
13688	it's pretty cool, if you can get it to run that is. For a game about cars crashing it seems to graps the concept too well since it crashes in loading most of the time...
13689	Mediocre, repetitive and has some infuriating lacks in game design such as restart event function missing, unshuffled playlist and civilian cars that send you flying to the moon from scratching them.
13690	I'm not a racing fan. I have heard that Burnout was suppose to be this great accident game. This looks and feels like a racing game. Time to move on
13691	Warning: must love racers. I can see how this might be fun for a true racing aficionado of yester-year. But post-GTA/Saints Row, a world of blowing up driverless cars by running into them with other driverless cars seems odd and hollow.  It would be something else with some awesome real-world brands and bling, but this ain't got it. Bought it on sale, and should have just put money into a better computer for Assetto Corsa.  A thumbs-down that might become a maybe, but I wasn't impressed. Not one of my preferred PC ports. 
13692	EA is so desperate to get you online the game sickens me it is so consolized.  Avoid it if you can.
13693	worst driving physics ive ever used.
13694	So, I installed this on my new computer cuz i played it heaps on my old, and the Code isnt working, DO NOT BUY if you intend on installing it more than once.
13695	Game crashes as soon as the song take me down to the paradise city plays after launching
13696	If someone can tell me how to use controller I'll upvote as I love this game but the fact I have to manually do it makes it very unenjoyable
13697	Feels like a very generic subpar racing game. *going back to rocket leauge*
13698	Cant play this game - game cant see my xbox windows controller. Disappointing.
13699	Keeps crashing all the damn time when starting up, haven't been able to play the game at all
13700	The options in this game are the most strangest i ever saw, you need alone 1 Houer to fnd the Multiplayer , and just to find out its impossible to use a Joypad ! LOL The Game himself is just 1 Island and nearly all the streets looks same! The gameplay is a Horror because you have to play a consol-game with Keyboard just because someone had no intresst to spend some minutes to add the possibility for Joypads ! Wasted Money and the most worst Titel of Burnout !!!! 8 was playing Burnout 1 + 2 and i was loving it ) This one is just poor and no money worth, belive me and spend it for something else :)
13701	This was a great game.  This was one of the best driving games of all times.  But now they decided to remove all the DLCs EVEN IN SINGLEPLAYER and make the savefile disappear every week.   Oh, and in February 2016, boom, 'the product key is not valid anymore'.  This was one of the best driving games, and as â¥â¥â¥â¥ing always, they ruined it.
13702	Plays like a version of GTA V without the beating people up on the streets and shooting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that you've partaked in.
13703	Boy do I sure love paying for DLC I can't use. Never again EA
13704	I had never played this game before but I had played 100s of hrs of burnout takedown. This game is OK, but takedown was leagues better than this. I was kinda dissapointed.
13705	Keeps crashing all the damn time when starting up, haven't been able to play the game at all
13706	Imagine a mix between GTA and a racing simulator. Burnout doesn't do anything really great and I found myself either playing GTA V or GRID. The gameplay is ok, the car mechanics are decent but overall I found the game to be more blah than anything else.
13707	This game is awesome. Literally it is the best sandbox racing game till today. BUT! The 'ultimate box' is just a name. If you want to play this game with all add-ons buy ps3 version. This one is just a standard version.   9/10  Still better game than need for speed
13708	First played this on the console ages ago, and now I'm back in the seat... behind my PC. Everything from flying debris to furious burnout chains down the motorway; it all brings back memories. ...But now I realize I have to unlock everything all over again. Poop.   The Pros:
13709	This game is very much on rails for an open world driving game. I don't recommend this game even though the graphics are solid and the game has fun jumps. Overall, it feels like you have very little choice on where your car goes other than left or right on different streets. Essentially, the car drives like you are going 400 mph, and you can't make uturns very well. The car should jerk a little more easily, but doesn't.
13710	It was way too arcadey of a game for me, but a lot of people hold the game in high regard. You may like it, but I did not.  I was never played any of the previous Burnout games either though, so that's probably why I didn't like it.
13711	EA is so desperate to get you online the game sickens me it is so consolized.  Avoid it if you can.
13712	Feels like a very generic subpar racing game. *going back to rocket leauge*
13713	Game is good but terrible account service. If you forgot your password, you basically can't go online. They didn't spend any time on the online sevice. 4.5/10
13714	Game crashes as soon as the song take me down to the paradise city plays after launching
13715	So, I installed this on my new computer cuz i played it heaps on my old, and the Code isnt working, DO NOT BUY if you intend on installing it more than once.
13716	Don't buy it. its dead.
13717	Don't mind about play time, I actually played this game a hella lot before, and dont ask how. The thing is that EA is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. It ask for an EA account, set one up. next thing you know, the game froze, leaving you here wonder what has mankind done wrong that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Satan off so bad that he created EA just for the sake of treading onto your souls
13718	It's a fun game.. on the xbox 360, where it actually has DLC working.... the steam version is a pure ripoff, claims it comes with all the dlc... at least I didn't pay full price.  EDIT: apparently multiplayer still works. also fixed the grammar a bit.
13719	After one session of playing and exiting and then coming back to play i had to log in even though i checked remember me and now youre saying im not using a proper product code, wont let me play and ive tried to contact them multiple times about this issue but no response
13720	I bought this seeing that out of all racing games around Burnout Paradise was quite possibly the best I ever played. But save yourself the cash and go get the PS3 version, EA and Criterion have no DLC for the PC version nor do they plan to migrate it to this one. They've completely abandoned the game. Biggest waste of cash so far. And I loved this game... EA I want my money back.
13721	Game is good but terrible account service. If you forgot your password, you basically can't go online. They didn't spend any time on the online sevice. 4.5/10
13722	I used to play burnout 3 and burnout revenge and love the arcade style racing game and gave this a shot and its the same basically and I love fast paced racing arcade games. Edited: Terrible login but A decent game.
13723	Fairly cool game, brings back some nostalgia however apart from that it is fairly bad. The biggest thing were the controls which, to say the least, were diffrerent from any other racing game i have ever played before.
13724	'ultimate box' needs to be taken out of the description. You cant access any of it now that the EA servers are shut down. Still a good game if youre ok with the basic cars and what not.
13725	The game's racing part at the core is great but it's the things slapped onto that that made me regret having bought it: - for one is there the typical EA games soundtrack that never shows which track is currently playing when you go to the menu for choosing which tracks it's playing so you gotta remember what the name of that craptrack was you just wanted to kick from the playlist or you can as well forget about it, I never got this design decision for their games, just show the damn thing in the playlist too... - then there's DJ NeverGonnaSTFU who constantly yapps into your ears, especially after you messed up and have to try again he has to rub it in even more, and nope there really is NO way to turn him off aside of turning off ALL sound, great idea... - and then there's track introduction which you have to watch each. single. time. you. do. a. race. This wouldn't be that bad if this wouldn't also include the re-races which you do A LOT since every license upgrade unlocks old races again, and makes you watch their intro's again, each time, even when retrying due to messing up or whatever else. - did I mention the inability to skip cutscenes of any type yet? Yeah no way past that. - there's also the DLC cashshop whatever stuff that's still advertised ingame even though said stuff is not even available anymore  It's sad that the racing core of the game is actually pretty good because there's so much crap nailed on top of it that outright kills it that it's just not worth it in the end.
13726	How much can I recommend this? I suppose it depends on how much you played the original. Dino Run DX, for all that 'Deluxe' implies, feels like an exact port of the old flash game. Glitches, visual bugs and all. These are things we were happy to put up with when it was free, but to pay money for an edition that doesn't really improve on it at all is disappointing. More notable is the failure of multiplayer- indeed, it's essentially dead now, and all the 'players' you'll see there appear to be kids using it as a chatroom. When I say dead, I mean DEAD, by the way. I haven't played a single online game yet, and doubt I will.  Another negative thing about the game is the bizarre controls. For some reason, your little dino doesn't control very predictably. Jump height varies seemingly randomly, and goes off in strange directions, so leaping for tantalizingly placed eggs can be an exercise in frustration. The result is that simply moving around isn't as fun as it should be. To be fair, this is a problem with the original game as well, but it's a surprisingly big issue, as it cuts down on the replay value immensely for me.  What can I say that's positive? Well, it's cute, it's charming, it's lovely to look at. It sounds pretty good, to boot. The pixel art is a blend of the old and new - the pixelation and limited colors we might associate with old Atari games, but without any of the limitations, like those on sprite count or scrolling. Dino Run is, well, a modern game in a cute pixel style, but it is important to note that as a 2007 release this game (and the studio that made it, Pixeljam) actually pioneered the style before most other indie titles. There's a ton of hats to collect, eggs and special eggs to find, and it can be fun. But it's hard to overlook its shortcomings when you're paying for it.  Look, I'm a longtime fan of Pixeljam. I love their art, music, and their games. I'd like to see their games come to other platforms (Gamma Bros. on 3DS would be sweet - just sayin'). But I'm not really happy with the state of this Steam release. I'm happy to have supported one of my favorite studios, but unfortunately this will be finding its way into my 'uninterested' game folder.
13727	For a game that is supposed to be the successor to the Flash game, Dino Run, this game sure doesn't offer much over the original. The controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor, with your dino quite often going the opposite direction or getting stuck in places that it realistically wouldn't. I've found myself buried into the ground a couple times, or phasing through boulders and walls to get through obstacles. The sound track embodies old Atari music in all of the worst ways, with all of the horrible repetitiveness included, and the art style is really the only thing that can be complimented.   For something that costs real world money to download and play, it's quite disappointing. Definitely just stick to the old Flash game.
13728	It's not a bad game per se, but there are some luck-based shenanigans that rubs me off the wrong way; the dino doesn't feel like jumping at times, thus holes are death traps, stegosaurs and triceratops on steeper slopes are very annoying to pass by, and I would be near the goal, and some meteorite from offscreen land on me and I get caught by the doom.  There's not much of a learning curve, and it's possible to get some fun in short bursts, although, I'm not really fan of its simplicity and, again, there are quite a lot of moments that kills the fun for me.
13729	So much advertizing and positive buff I just had to buy it from discount. Was it worth 2â¬? Unfortunately, not to me. I can understand this game has some 'retro' value for those who had played the original flash game at early age, but for newcomers, the game has pretty much nothing to offer. Gameplay is very, very simple and it didn't get me addicted at all. I don't mind the poor C64 graphics and music that much since I grew up on that era, but in this game, its too artificial without any lets say, style. Controls are also quite poor and the dino just doesn't jump and move very accurately or responsively. Surely that was the case in C64 era but today, I won't let it slide easily. 15 minutes of gameplay and you have pretty much seen it all. Will I ever return to play this? Maybe, because at least it loads fast and runs in windowed mode as default. It's quick to start and quick to close. Perhaps this is a good game while you are waiting some big file transfer to complete or something but I've played much more addicting and better indie games like, lets say Limbo or Obulis that were definitely worth that 2â¬.
13730	the people in this game feel like they should chat instead of playing the game resulting in only being able to race once in 76 minutes. it's just omegle now minus the people trying to get laid. if the devs add a timer for how long you can sit there and waste peoples time before they get kicked then that would be great and i'd buy the game again.
13731	Dead multi. Like deader than the walking dead. Asked for a refund, got it. Do not buy it because of the nostalgia factor.
13732	Less than 5 minutes of fun for the whole family.  Talk to strangers online!!!  No really, talk to them.  That's at least 40% of the game.  Talk to absolute strangers and beg them to race you, because without them racing you, you can not level up, you can not develope your character further.  This game was better in like 2009 when it was just a free browser game with an entire communtiy that was built around vast friendships and acceptance.   Except that one pedophile that sexually harrassed like 15 users on Skype and took child pornography images of them via screenshot and forcing them to, 'Impress the head admin' after picking them up from the chatrooms of your game.  Hope you fixed that bug in the game.  There is a lot of room for improvement here. Stop beating the dead horse and trying to make money out of something you already destroyed years ago.

13734	Sadly one of the weaker pixeljam games. Feels like it should be a free flash game. The only thing you do is hold right and jump at times. A mocking upgrade system fakes the illusion of free choice but if you do not upgrade speed every time, you will just not be fast enough to survive. A little bit fine tuning would really helped the longevity of this game
13735	There's not really anything to this game
13736	Exceptionally litte content for $6. You race a very short (like 2 min) race to the end, and then that's it. The old online version was far better than this.  Not to mention there is DRM.
13737	I managed to get 40 minutes of gameplay out of this, and that was with two playthroughs. I only purchased it because of nostalgia from my childhood days of being too poor to play anything but flash games. This is absolutely identical to the flash version, I honestly do not know what they changed. This has randomly generated levels I'm pretty sure (it's hard to tell since you don't really interact with the environment all that much) and the original didn't, but that's a pretty useless feature in a game like this, so whatever. You COULD replay this enough to get your money out of it, but then you'd be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crazy person or bored out of your â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13738	I loved this game when I was a kid but there isn't any thing to do, no one is ever online and they don't teach you how to make a online game or it's bugged
13739	Horrible game, mulitplayer is DEAD, just a few people who script and don't even play in chat, music is like something from atari, Controler does not work in multiplayer but does in single player, no local multiplayer or split screen. And gameplay is dry, I regret spending money on this, and will now and forever bad mouth this game. A poor lazy excuse for a game.
13740	Ah, yes. Another pixelated platformer. This game is charming, but isn't worth the price. There is basically no multiplayer community and I completed the whole game in an hour.
13741	you can get this for free on the internet... i dont recommend it Edit: too much â¥â¥â¥â¥ing comments that i had to change it
13742	not worth the 5$ it hardly has any levels its really easy and just not that much fun
13743	I honestly can't recommend this game. In the beginning I was enjoying it but the time exposes the weak gameplay and campaign.   Starting with the principal, I didn't like the gameplay, cars behave strangely and even by customizing options of difficulty and assistance I couldn't find a better way to get used to the drive mechanics and physics. The campaign started promising but became frustrating, there are a few extra goals that are impossible or don't make sense, and thus those who like to leave the game complete is frustrating, win races isn't enough, by the time I gave up and I just collect the stars needed to get to the last level and beat the game.  I positively highlight the licenses, there is a wide variety of vehicles and good circuits, although because of the gameplay and frustration with the campaign I could not fully enjoy this aspect.  I also emphasize that it's impossible to play on the keyboard, joystick or steering wheel is highly required.  6/10
13744	If you like having a huge dead spot in your steering, that you can't get rid of, this game is for you. Personally, I like a nice tight wheel. Like all of the rest of this series, this one is also next to impossible to control. Especially with a force feedback wheel. The only one in the series, that was half way decent, was the original. Every one since has had a lacklustre handling profile that takes any actual fun that might be had, and makes it a chore just to keep your vehicle going straight, or turning into corners, when you turn your wheel.   My suggestion is to save your money and buy something that IS NOT produced by EA Games. Remembering how responsive the original NFS was, this is a huge disappointment.
13745	The Need For Speed devs tried to make a racing simulator. It didn't really work. Pros: -Pretty graphics + lighting -Nice soft-body damage -Many upgrades for cars Cons: -Physics-not good -AI are like on rails, they pretty much go through the player -Not as wide of a selection of cars that Forza Motorsport has (inb4 pc master race) -It's a bit too easy, even with difficulty to max  Honestly, I can't recommend this game. But, if you're looking for a cheap Forza-like game that's on steam, this is for you. But, if you have a bit more money burning a hole in your pocket, get somthing like Project Cars when it comes out or Beam.NG (Beam.NG is not really a racing game, but still a really fun vehicle sim)     
13746	Some of the worst physics I have ever experienced in a racing game. The series turned to garbage as soon as EA turned it over to new developers. There are much better racing games available for the same price or less.
13747	Great game if you like destruction derbies.  Awful game if you wanted anything resembling a racing game, be it sim or combat.
13748	controls are so damn unresponsible, its a joke. i bought this back a few years ago and didnt bother playing it very much because the cars reaction to my steering inputs always seemed ways to delayed to control it in a decent way. i thought it was because my laptop was too slow. but i got a new faster pc and tried it again and guess what? the control is still delayed like â¥â¥â¥â¥ which makes it almost impossible to keep your car on the ideal line, even if you are on a straight. only buy this game if you're into delayed and incredibly difficult control!
13749	I bought this game and Shift 2 Unleashed when they were on sale years ago, and I was eager to see how they look and run on my new 144-hertz gaming monitor. Dirt 3 and Grid 2 run at a silky-smooth 144 fps througout, but I was looking for a more sim-like racer, so I gave the Shift games a shot. I figured they should run great, since they were both released over 5 years ago during the last console generation. However, Shift 2 somehow struggled to maintain a mere 50 fps on my 8-Core, 4.2 ghz processor and GTX 970. A 360/PS3 game.   Okay, fine, I figure. Bad optimization. I'll try the first Shift game instead. This game might be great, but I'm not going to play it the way it looks for me. The graphics options can't be changed from the default 60hz, medium-detail, no-AA settings, no matter how many times I save the game or try to edit my config file. You have to restart the game to change graphics settings, and those settings inexplicably reset every time you restart the game. Apparently some other Steam user who had this problem was able to work some kind of witch-doctor scheme to get his graphics settings to keep from resetting every time he launched the game. What he described did not work for me, and my patience is spent.  EA, it is not my job to get your awful 5+ year old console ports working and running like they should on my enthusiast-level gaming computer. Say what you will about Microsoft, at least the Forza Motorsport 6 beta looks and runs great on my PC. So Microsoft gets my money in the future instead of you.
13750	Summary. A bad balance between realism and arcade.  The Good. Great graphics. Fun for the first few hours.   The Bad.  Menu with a controller is extremely clunky. Because, unlike other NFS games, SHIFT doesn't bother to change menu buttons, like '7', for 'X'. It thinks you want to navigate the menus with your keyboard and mouse, instead of the obviously hooked up XB1 controller, because I'm driving with that.  Controls are just â¥â¥â¥â¥. Unlike most other 'realistic' racing games, SHIFT thinks that you want to go into full lock when you're at top speed, instead of progressively lowering sensitivity the faster your speed is. No, what this game does, is force you into a dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥ slide, as your TCS activates, because apparently it thinks you want to... you know what, I don't even know what the game thinks you're attempting to do, because that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing TCS goes on constantly, because your car is constantly out of control at the slightest steering input. It's probably easier if you have a steering wheel, but there's no reason for the controls to be this bad on what a majority of users would be using, which is a XB or PS controller.  Physics are questionable. Rear ending cars with another car, in real life, doesn't cause them to get shot 20ft into the air. Flipping, sure, but even that isn't simulated right in this game. Cars flip, because some part of it digs into dirt/grass, or they are really sideways when their tire suddenly gains a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of grip. In this game, it's like the cars become cardboard boxes once none of their tires are touching the ground, as in they have no mass, so they just get launched 20 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ft into the air when you bump them right and it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb.  And then there's the handling between these â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and questionable physics. Apparently, when you go into a banked corner at 'just the right speed' your car bottoms out, as evidenced by the long trail of sparks underneath the car, which causes your car to go out of control and not accept any sort of steering input. I don't know what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ suspension these cars use, but you can't adjust that at all in the game. I have never seen any racing cars just absolutely bottom out through the entire corner, unless it had no wheels. In fact, this is the first game I have ever played that does this. It's not like the cars doing this are F1 or other low ride height cars either, they're just tuned tier 1/2/3 cars, which should never have this problem, ever.  Game Modes â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DRIFTOOOOOOOO â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb, because the controls and CAMERA switch, randomly, between 'oh, you want to corner' and 'DRIFTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO'. As if the car wasn't hard enough to control already, there's a whole new dimension added with drifting events. Instead of a linear transition, or you know, a complete physics/control system, this game has a very strange camera and control transition between the start of your drift and what it considers a 'drift', which makes it unnecissarily difficult to do these events. In fact, it felt so clunky and stupid, that I totally lost interest doing any of them.  Camera OH MY GOD, I can't complain enough about this. Okay, I get that crashing hard will disorientate you, I've had that happen in real life, but this game goes overboard with it. Tapping another car or kissing the wall does not do that in real life, yet this game does. It was fine at first, but gets extremely annoying after the 10th race with â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI drivers that decided to randomly ram you or brake check you. and like â¥â¥â¥â¥ I am going to hit the brakes for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI getting in my way. Oh, hey, do you like simulated frame drops? This game does that when you hit things. At first, I thought it was my PC, but turns out, that's a feature effect this game has. And if you want to point out that I can just drive smoothly, I do when I can, but the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing controls and handling become â¥â¥â¥â¥ on some courses, that I can't be bothered to drive smoothly around the AI.  Map LOL. A map that tells you if you've 'mastered' a corner or not, it's nothing more than a distraction. Mastering a corner doesn't mean â¥â¥â¥â¥, you just have to finish in first place, because there is no smooth cornering in this game, just the disappointing sight of smoke coming from all 4 tires, because the game thinks you want full lock instead of minor inputs.  Progressing through the game Don't like to do some events you don't consider to be fun? well, too bad. Unless you do those, you're not going to be able to progress through the game. And that's where I said 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game' and went ahead and uninstalled it. I don't care about drifting events in this game, it's done terribly and I want no part of it. Racing is fun, until you get the go-kart map with nearly zero opportunity to overtake. Time trials, didn't even bother with those, I want to race against other cars, not the clock, especially when the controls and handling are so clunky. Endurance. LOL, a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing '8' shaped course for endurance? that was the most hilarious â¥â¥â¥â¥ I've seen. Battles. Just choose the OP car, there's no point in using the â¥â¥â¥â¥ one, because it's going to lose 100% of the time.  Concluding remarks NFS: â¥â¥â¥â¥
13751	Overall this is a great racing game. It got a good balance between realism and arcade feeling with lots of customization to fit your own perfect race style.  The only issue I had with it personally was the AI. If you are like me and want to play on highest difficulty to get a sense of accomplishment you will just waste your time. The AI is extremely hard and they don't play fair. You basically need to drive 100% perfectly on every track and even that wont be enough when you get rammed on every single corner.  So since the sequel have released with improved physics and AI there is no real reason to play this one.
13752	Mordern hardware has rendered this game unplayble for me due to the known issue of major stuttering during collisions. Especially bad in a racing game like this in which slamming into other cars and running them off the road is not only neccesary to win some races, but is also rewarded with xp and money.
13753	Great game if you like destruction derbies.  Awful game if you wanted anything resembling a racing game, be it sim or combat.
13754	Fun to play. If you actually get to play it that is. Started crashing like a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ in mid-July 2015. I don't know what it's related to but I can't load up any race.
13755	To put it simply, there are much better racing games out there. Play the GRID series if you haven't already, they're a heck of a lot better than this.
13756	Cars handle like bars of soap, the AI is braindead and will run directly into you, not even trying to avoid you at all, and when you start it up you will be deafened every time.
13757	This game is difficult af.
13758	Compared to Dirt 2, a game relased in the same month as this game, it is quite obvious which game is superior. While Dirt 2 might lack in customization and varitety, the handling and controls in Shift are so poor that the game is unplayable on the Medium difficulty. This is quite a step backwards, even for the Need for Speed series.
13759	 Need for Speed  Shift has the title of not being a Need for Speed beside his name on the store page Why this is not a Need for Speed?  Customization Why in the world is impossible to tune Tier 4 cars? This is unacceptable. Let's not talk about the customization, instead let's talk about the driving. Is it good?  Hehehe, of course NOT I know, i know... It's a racing simulator right?  Well tell me if you car JUMPS EVERYTIME in each turn or going 200 km/h in a straight line?  In short: +Cockpit view in every car +Nice detail on the tracks +Somewhat rewarding driving +When racing there's no music, i guess for more realistic felling? Well some some realistic feeling?  -  NO CUSTOMIZATION ON TIER 4 CARS   -Fast cars for some reason FLY instead of remaining on the road which makes braking almost impossible when you have to turn -No Xbox controller support -Drift mode is unplayable -Sometimes the game crashes for some reason  That's all i have to say... Well this is 2008 i can't say anything but i suggest you to avoid it  I give this game a 5 out of 10
13760	This game.... is total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, i know i'm kinda going against the current here doing a bad review when most of the people who've written a review on this game thinks it has an awesome driving feeling and is SOO much better than Forza and Gran Turismo. However, anyone who's driven a real car knows that this is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, the cars behave... so bizarre, the steering is impossible to master, the car itself is like a soap with 2 wheels in the front and 1 in the back, This game is the most HORRID piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ i have ever played, and i have played a LOT of driving games.... Btw. I played this game on the xbox for lots of hours on it's release and decided to give it another chance to prove me wrong about my previous experience, it failed..
13761	At the beginning it was fun to play, but than when I try to play on advanced or pro setting the AI and physic become one big mess. The game has bugs. car start bouncing and are shot to the air, than game crush: this happens when your car is on gravel or is hit by other cars.  Predefined settings for wheels are not working as they should, you need to use the manual setting for custom one. Drift is uhhm.... what to say, frustrating not fun at all (you just need to press the throttle on 100% and spin the wheel like insane and you gain the points. Dream on about to perform precise drift sliding). Some cars keep drift setting also for common tracks which makes them unplayable.  Game (40-45% process finished) was deleted and will be never again installed!!!!!
13762	Hate it the cars drive like tanks on ice. Slow and you slide all over. The perception of speed it extremely off. The cars look like they are going 20mph when the speedometer says 150 you approach the corner at what you think is very slow and completely slide out of it with the feeling that the steering wheel is doing nothing at all. The only way to win a race is to go really slow and super careful. A racing game should be exhilarating, fun, and challenging. Not slow, boring, and challenging. DO NOT BUY!!!
13763	theres nobody playing on the servers
13764	I spend half of my day to try to run this game - without success. After that I de-instelled it.
13765	I keep crashing right after the beginning cutscene and its driving me nuts! just bought this today and i already verified the license.
13766	No wheel support and feels kinda cheap
13767	Wow. No...Just no.  Cars drive like bricks  On screen controls are keyboard...Because I'm totally going to play a racing game with Kb+M
13768	the game/ driving felt very stiff, heavy, and unresponsive with a keyboard and the cinimatics were short and boring. the only fun part was upgrading your car parts. if you are looking for a fun track racer with a carreer mode based on tiers, try Grid 2 instead.
13769	I chose to pick this up while it was on sale so I could have a decent racing game to use my G27 steering wheel on. I had played this game on PS3 when it came out and I remember it as a fun experience. When I booted it up on PC, however, I could tell that functionality for this PC port was not one of the Developers' priorities. I struggled through the settings menu to fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ default graphics and to set up my G27. After about 20 minutes of closing and rebooting the game for the settings to be applied, I finally got in game to the prologue, I guess it could be called, or the tutorial. The forced practice lap after a forced two minute long cutscene. It was almost imposible to control the car! Even without other AI vehicles on the track! Once I finished the lap, it gave me the settings I wanted to adjust, by the way there isn't a settings option when in-game, the assists. I turned them all off. I finally get into the actual first race and the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing behavior of the AI was god damn horrendous. The car didn't respond to my inputs. For those reading and preparing a lecture on how cars actually work in real races and how I know nothing of the real world phyisics, please spare me. The mother mcfreaking car would. not. turn. Then when it would, it would over steer. It was like there was still another sneaky mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing drive assist that I couldn't turn off.  Not to mention the freezes, crashes, and glitches that occure damn near constantly.  I really wanted to like this game because of the nestalgia but it didn't live up to any expectations.    This was almost the worst $4.39 I've ever spent. This game is not worth it.     Thank you, and good day
13770	This is the only Need For Speed game I've played that I didn't care for, and I've been following the franchise since the days it released on 3DO! 1994, was it? Anyway, this feels as far from NFS as it can possibly get. Sure, it's an ok game, but the NFS standard has been raised so high for it to be dropped on its head like this.  Maybe it was better back in the day, but it pales in comparison with other NFS titles, mainly NFS: Hot Pursuit (whether you're talking about the new one from 2010, or the older one, NFS3:HP from 1998). The handling of the cars is atrocious, and other reviewers have done a far better job of explaining its shortcomings than I ever could, but steering sucks, acceleration sucks (AI can always accelerate faster than you even when you're in the same cars, and they can always corner better than you can by supplanting the physics of the game and taking curves without sliding; you aren't allowed to do that though!). Touch the steering wheel at the wrong time and you spin out. Run off the track for more than a second, and you get a warning and your time doesn't count. Run off the track too many times, and it's race over for you! Come to a complete stop and then wait about 5 seconds for the game to register that you can drive again. Hate a particular trial? Too bad, you have to master it to continue. Forget overtaking your opponent on most of the time trials...unless you get in front of him somehow in the first turn, he's gone and you can never catch up; you have to get right in front of him and stay there, blocking him from passing the whole time. Not fun!!  The unacceptable cons of this game make it unenjoyable to me. Pair that with racetrack only driving and it's not enough to keep me interested.  Sorry to say this is my least favorite NFS game I've ever played, and I have played most of them with the exception of maybe Undercover, Rivals, World, and The Run. It never offers anything fun and exciting, just frustration and more frustration.
13771	I used to enjoy NFS releases. Don't have big expectations with neither one of them. This was a change in the series and I wanted to give it a try. I'm not very good at it and find the tracks a bit difficult to complete them with a good final time. However I still progress through the game. I find that a bit insulting and ultimately it affects my desire to complete the game.   Got the game on discount and is the only way you should get the game now. You have much better alternatives for this type of races.
13772	To describe this game in one word is that it is TERRIBLE. And I say this with pain in my heart because this game has a lot going for it but let me explain. The graphics are awesome and it has nice tracks and cars with cockpits, but it destroys all of this with all kinds of blurring effects and worst of all the collision blur, which causes your vision to impair for 10 seconds by even the slightest contact. Another problem this game has is that it's unplayable with gamepads, there simply aren't good settings to make steering with a gamepad not feel like your a corddancer who's walking on high heels. Then there are the AI cars which are very aggressive, personally I don't like that, certainly not with the aforementioned collision blur. The last straw are the menu's which are awfull to wade through with a gamepad, though they're somewhat passeble by controlling it with a mouse.
13773	Junk won't start up.
13774	Said it was a Simulation, its not a Simulation.   It could be a fun arcade game but not in anyway what I was looking for.  But got it for cheeaaap on them steam sales so whatever.
13775	The controls suck and you cant even change them ingame so you have to go back and forth to the menu. waste of my time.
13776	i do not recomend this as it suck in every way it can grapics are low ai is stupid controls suck you never have the realy onder control sinds you cant realy turn of driving aids
13777	I cant play this game i dont know why 
13778	this game SUCKS!!
13779	I really like the intro movie, watched it about a dozen times. That is because i can't get past it without the game crashing, i tried everything i found on the internet. what else to expect from EA uh?!
13780	Car customization is just plain dumb. Can't even mirror your vinyl to the other side like almost every other NFS game. Racing is ok until Tier 4, then it just seems like you're driving on ice. Pretty dissapointing compared to the other NFS's.
13781	The game itself isn't that bad, considering it's quite old.  Due to some really annoying flaws, however, which I'll list below, I am not recommending it. Note: I'm using a Thrustmaster T500 RS wheel + Thrustmaster TH8A shifter, which are not supported, but they work, and the controls are alright.  1: In the menus you can't use any of the wheels buttons. It's a standard layout, with a D-Pad and 4 buttons, much like Playstation and Xbox Controllers. Even though it's not officially supported, it's a complete joke that those won't work in the menu, especially if they work with any normal key bind you can set in the menu.  2: The optimization is downright awful. i7-4770, GTX 760, 8GB RAM merely get you a 60 FPS on 1080p on MEDIUM settings, that is WITHOUT motion blur and texture filtering at MINIMUM.  3: The option menu, specifically graphic settings are another huge â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. This is one of the games where you have to restart the whole game whenever you change most of the settings. That's pretty bad already, but it gets even worse if you are testing different settings to reach decent quality/framerate ratio.  It even offers me 144 hertz mode, even though the game doesn't even support it. It'll just go back to 60 hertz upon restarting.  4. Some of the cars have 7 gears, just like my TH8A shifter, but you can even shift into the 7th gear on cars that don't even have 7 gears. It will display that you're in 7th gear, but it won't accelerate any further. That's just ridiculous and shows how much the programmers thought about what they're doing.  If you have one of the wheels that are supported or use a controller, this might be a good game for you, though it's quite hard to play with a controller if you don't use assists at later stages in the game.
13782	It really feels like this game was nothing but a bad attempt to clone a Grid game. The controls are bad, the physics engine is a joke. Frankly, I was quite dissapointed - I was hoping for an arcade racer with NFS style controls and gameplay that would just let me race around tracks and circuts with no crazy storylines or weird gameplay modes. I had high hopes for this game, and I really wanted to give it a chance but after just over an hour of play and a good thirty races under my belt I just wasn't having any fun. This is the first time I have ever requested a refund from Steam.
13783	What a disapointment, cant belive the makers of motorcity online couldnt do better than this
13784	Its a very good game, intresting game play very realistic, BUT  WHAT HAPPEND ??? TO mY SAVE??? ? CRAP ! NEED TO RESTART ALL OVER AGAIN..
13785	Not very fun. It is unrealistic you almost need a controller to be decent at graphics are not that good and the previews are missleading.
13786	this game reminds me off old crappy corn bread
13787	Buy Shift 2 instead. The only reason this game still sells is nostalgia. And i can't blame them.
13788	this message goes out to steam my game keeps crashing idk y but i speent 19.00 on this and feels like i got robed what do it do know  
13789	After SO many hours this f***ing s**t LOST ALL MY PROGRESS! Profile loads, but career is ZERO. Nothing left, nothing can be done, except staring anew. WTF? Devs and publishers are d**bass b***hes, I wish you burn! So much effort wasted, I was so wrong to trust EA, worst publisher ever - they never give a s**t about their games.
13790	Yea! *Cars look great *Great sense of speed *Races do not get too long  Meh! *Track graphics are very mediocre, you have no idea what tracks you are on unless you go into theactual race details. This should at least be included in the loading screen *After race results only show total time. Would of been nice to see the car driven and best lap, as included in most other racing games *Controls are not shown with proper Xbox button prompts *Sound is insanely loud, had to turn everything down to 15, even with windows at 50% volume  Bleh! *AI is awful, constant crashing into you and in turns, braking in straightaways *Menus are awful. Changing graphics is difficult as it goes by some random 3 digit number, some stuff is buried in odd places *The car turning and traction feels off to me on anything under tier 3, they are way too lose and feel like your driving on ice even when fully upgraded  Verdict: All and all its a very mediocre race title, better then most of the newer NFS though. THe lower tier cars having awful handling kills it for me, along with a AI that acts more like a 16 year old with their permit, instead of 'pro' level drivers that they are suppose to be
13791	No. No, no, no. SMS did NOT know what they were doing. (Which also shows in Project Cars. Oh, the irony.)  The menus don't work half the time. Save corruption happens 8 times out of 10. 90% of the cars steer like boats in a sea of molasses. Textures are just plain trash. SM64 had better textures than this game. The game itself runs like absolute trash (Locked at 45 FPS on my PC for some reason), often dipping below 30 FPS. The AI is plain broken and the rubber-banding is REAL. This is even worse than Mario Kart's AI AND the Goron AI from the Goron race minigame from TLoZ: Majora's Mask.  A Golf can keep up with an S2000. That's how bad it is.
13792	Launching this game resets my PC's personalization settings; the wallpaper, color scheme, notifications, sounds, to everything they were upon my PC's very first shut-down over 7 months ago.  And I'm still finding more stuff it messed with. Ugh.
13793	  I bought this game on the steam sale because I've always been a fan of need for speed and really enjoyed prostreet. Prostreet was fun with decent physics aside from the bs car damage model. I thought since this was the next need for speed track racing game that it would improve upon all the things that made Prostreet great. Nope. I spent $5 on this game and felt like I wasted my money. I wouldn't play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ if it were free. The physics and handling are absolutely awful and unless you like spinning out every corner, unrealistic phyiscs, and a bigger sense of dissappointment in EA than you already had, don't buy this game. If you can handle a lower frame rate and worse graphics but much better car models, play prostreet and you wont be dissappointed.
13794	Unless you have a gaming pad, or a steering wheel you simply can't play this game. But even with, the game is insanely hard to control.  This game is completely unplayable. On a totally reasonable machine the frame rate is awful. The steering takes forever to respond so you fishtail off the track constantly. And the worst part is, you can't skip any cut scenes and you cant modify graphic settings or control settings in game, and there's only career mode when you start. so you have to watch all the cutscenes (which bug out and play 2 to 3 times in a row) at the begining of the career, find out the controls are still impossible, and then you can't even quit back to the menu, so you have to force quit and restart to change your settings. and being an EA game they make you watch their stupid logo every single time you turn the game on and warnings about driving. I've done the first and second race a bunch of times now and i can't find a way to even control the game.   I've owned hundreds of games in my life, dozens of racers, and Ive never been more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that a company has the audacity to sell this.
13795	I'd rather play forza motorsport 4 or grid 2.
13796	it is bad 
13797	Absolute rubbish. A cheap port from consoles to PC that's totally unplayable.
13798	I played through several Need for Speed, needless to say, this game didnât really meet up to my expectation from NFS series.
13799	Incredibly difficult and weird handling. It's a mixture between the old NFS and the new ones, and it sure as hell isn't good. The bugs just add to the frustration that is playing this game!
13800	What the **** have they done to this franchise? EA should know already that the perfect NFS title should be the love child between Underground 2, Most Wanted (2005) and Burnout Paradise. There are already loads of titles that focus on realistic driving and physics, people want a true arcade racing game, with a proper fast and furious style of driving.
13801	Utter, complete and total â¥â¥â¥â¥. This game has the by far most incompetently designed user interface, I ever saw. You can't adjust steering while pausing a race, you can't interrupt or cancel a race. No way out, other than a hard reset. I don't understand which kind of completely brainless morons design this kind of an user interface.
13802	This is probrobly the.... WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! 1.the game dose not run well. And I have a preatty powerful computer. 2.the loading video never ends. 3. set settings to lowest dose not run. I bought this game on sale for 4.99 USD it is not even worth that. much less 19.99 USD
13803	Instead of telling you guys in a paragraph about this game, I felt that it would be better to give a pro and con list.  Pro's:  - It's like Forza, I enjoy a game like that - Graphics are nice - Any kind of Gamer can play this game  Con's: - Badly Optimized, The Crew runs at 60+FPS and The Crew is a bit more demanding - Long; Unskippable; Boring Cutscenes - Motion Blur is annoying in Racing Games  Neutral: - Not Like Need For Speed Games - Better then most of The Need For Speed Games - Forza or Gran Turismo like game but on PC  Overall The reason I don't reccomend it is because the con's really effect the actual gameplay, espeacially the poor framerate, and I tryed setting them down to minimal and it was still getting (MinFPS: 12 MaxFPS: 45 AvgFPS: 24) which was horrible, I'm used to playing any other game with atleast 60fps and this game just destroyed optimal gaming. During Testing I was using a computer that is considered medium end (Nvidia 750ti, 16gb DDR3 Ramm, AMD FX-8350 5.0GHz) so I was expecting to atleast be able to play it without lag. If it runs it runs but on my side, it wasn't very good. Buy at Your own risk
13804	Honestly, Im of the people who miss the Underground days of NFS. And after I played Pro Street (on Wii regrettably) I decided to give the series quits. And the game was on Sale a few months ago, and I reminisced about the Thousands of hours I spent on my PS2 on NFSU and NFSU2, I bought the game.  The game plays like a NFS game, good controls, Easy interface, Car Customisation. But its a Racetrack racer similar to Pro Street. But I preferred this game to NFS prostreet.  However, that doesn't mean i'd recommend it to anyone other than a Die-Hard racer. Any Gran Turismo/Forza will do better if you want a Race track racer, and If you want customisation. Both GT and Forza have Customisation elements, but not like NFS. And there is a Xp 'grind' that gives the RPG like rewards and challenges, which I honestly did not enjoy.  Overall. Better than Shift 2 that I played on PS3, but still not like the Innovation that NFSU brought. Only get if you're a Die-Hard racer type, or a Fan of grindy-Racing games (Just get Forza 5). Otherwise save your money.
13805	Ehhh.. I dunno about NFS SHIFT This game has some major flaws that keeps me from wanting to click that Play button. I'm running windows 7 and while in full screen mode if I alt-tab out and try and come back.. it's done crashes every single time, time to restart.  Controller support is terrible. I have a wheel that I play with sometimes.. and a game pad I play with sometimes. If I set the custom wheel up.. then go to switch to custom gamepad.. Bye bye settings, I have to remap all the buttons for either.. so you are forced to pick one and stick with it, there is no way to save your mappings.   Gameplay has been fun so far but it's hard for me to want to play when I know that I'm going to need to remap or that if I change focus to check e-mail or chat with someone quick that the game quits.
13806	yes don't buy this game if you are using a G27 wheel, EA say it don't support steering wheels for this PC game.  Let get real E.A. I don't drive my real car with Xbox controller, I use Steering Wheel.
13807	This game is full of bugs. I tried everything and still same crap. Physics reinstal and still crash crash CRASH before the reace on the same spot. EA how could you release this crap and after so many years still full of BUGS!!!!
13808	GREAT GAME CRASHES WHEN I ATTEMPT TO START CAREER 5/5 WOULD NOT PLAY AGAIN
13809	Terrible controls, slow response, unbelievably bad shaky camera, another half-a$$ effort from EA
13810	I never thought I can be such a badass........Driver...And by badass i mean terrible. I crash into walls every 5 seconds.
13811	Unfortunately, my configuration seems not to meet the game's requirements. With my GeForce GT240M the game provides very uneven frame rates rendering the game unplayable. It is a major disappointment as even newer games like TrackMania Canyon, Burnout Paradise or NFS Hot Pursuit played fine.
13812	the controls set for the game are not changeable and the defaults suck this game would be worth my time if i could have actually played it, it was a waist!
13813	Couldn't wake me up inside.
13814	The Henessy Venom reportedly is the fastest production car in the world. Going flat out, it will give the Bugatti Veryron SS a run for its money. However, this game is old, and despite the presence of the Veyron in the game, the fastest car is the Pagani Zonda R.   How could this happen you ask? Well, NFS Shift is a racing simulator, so its main focus is on stuff like horsepowers, downforce, grip, and coachwork damage. When you add up all those numbers, the only outcome can be that the track-optimised Zonda R is the best. It is light, has a stupidly big wing on the back. Points and fins sticking out to maintain that perfect racingline. The Veyron is too fat, the GTR too weak, the Reventon is too silly and the Vette is too uncontrollable. And the game knows this. No matter what race you drive in higher tiers, the one in first place will be a Zonda R, or you...in a Zonda R.   The game is a Zonda R sim then. It tries to emulate the laws of physics on the track, so it is imperative you understand the properties of traction. You can't floor it and shoot off. You'll spin in place. So you need to gently feather it. That is, if you turn all the assists off. The game offers you assistance with everything; braking, accelerating, turning, the works. However, the point is that it controls like a shed on an ice rink. Turn right = either going right too fast and spin, or go right slowly and go off.   You can like this kind of realistic driving, but I favour a more arcade approach. I like exotic supercars and doing 200mp/h on the straight, but this game, just is too narrow, too scarce. It is brutally overshadowed by newer, more inclusive racing games. On top of that, the game's soundtrack is a collection of nails on chalkboard. Luckily you don't have to hear it because the engine noise is overly loud. The coolest part though is your ability to paint your car in some funny ways. Unfortunately, if that is the staying point of your game, then you need to reevaluate your priorities.  
13815	i do not rate any game thats keyboard and mouse
13816	Soooooo dissapointed..... Yea. This SHUCKS.
13817	Crashing on startup. Dont know the reason. :/
13818	Ea published it so nope
13819	Will not run past first loading screen despite all attempts to troubleshoot. 0/10
13820	i can not play this game. do not buy
13821	Didn't work on my Windows 8 Computer.
13822	Bought this game and i can't even play it, gg EA. won't ever buy another product from you.
13823	The Game is not playable on win 8.1 so no review
13824	Absolutely horrendous handling. Completely unplayable. Tried every different combination of controls.
13825	i love the game play but lately i cant even get the game to run. it keeps crashing. and i dont know why.
13826	I just deleted this game and I regret buying this. The driving mechanics sucks a lot. Like the other guy said, the car is like a tank and the road is pure ice. When you are 150KPH it seems like 40KPH... WTF. If you are thinking about buying this game, play some demo or take a better look to prevent frustration. Geez, this game suckssssss................
13827	I was really enjoying this game until I finally got to the more difficult levels. Once you unlock the faster cars, the driving just stops being fun. It's a bit weird, since in most racing games one is most anxious to reach the high-performance tiers, however here it just feels like you are riding the brakes constantly, since most of the courses are very tight.  Also, there are a bunch of bugs in this game which start to get rather annoying. High-speed collisions can result in a car being 'stuck' halfway inside of the pavement. The drift races are not much fun at all and actually rather tedious to complete. It feels like the drifting was added in as a last-minute feature; it should have just been left out of this game entirely.
13828	This game looked very promising when I looked at the reviews and trailers, but when I got to the gameplay I was hugely disappointed.  Here is the good points about it: great graphics, cars behave fairly realistic (driving cars is challenging but you can still have fun cause its not a full on simulator)  The BADDDD :((((( It seems like the NFS Shift was not meant to be played on a PC at all, cause when I tried to change my key mapping it would only allow to use certain buttons instead of the whole keyboard. Once you start the gameplay, you can't change any settings or go back to the main menu; so I had to use alt+ctl+del or alt+F4 to exit out of the game, and then I had to start the level all over. After a frustrating hour of trying to make this game work properly I deleted it.   I feel like this game might be great on a gaming platform like PS or an Xbox, but on my PC this half-â¥â¥â¥-NFS-conversion just doesnt work properly. Stuff like that happens - some games just dont work - but if you are paying $20 you shouldnt have this kind of issues!!!
13829	Graphics are still pretty good, great attention to detail in car interiors and great selection of cars to choose from. All of the menus are a load of crap and the cutscenes are too long, sometimes they repeat for no reason and there is no way to skip past many of them. Really the only problem is with the menus, which are flawed in several ways. For example, you have to complete your first race before you can change any settings or view the controls. You might have to do it in hurrendous lag with no knowledge of the controls. (The game is reasonably optimised though.) EDIT: game has stopped opening completley. I have no idea why but there is no game now, sorry! EDIT: game now works again, but would not reccomend still as it took a long time to get working.
13830	+ the controls are usually ok (but you need to fiddle with the adjustments a lot to get it rolling with the gamepad) + would be probably the best need for speed for a wheel (without the drifting events)  - no story - weak feeling of involvmenet in the career mode - no real cutscenes - the controls are completly changed for drifting events which make it completly unplayable unless you start messing around with your upgrades installed to lower the power of the car (it feels like they shortened all the gears to the max and you just can't accelerate without spinning out)
13831	I read all the positive feedback before buying the game, and now I have to say I am disappointed. Everyone is talking about a sim-like feel to the cars and driving, personally I think this has nothing to do with reality. It's like trying to steer cookie dough shot out of a cannon at 250kmh, or something. What I'm trying to convey here is I think the steering feel of untouched and tuned cars alike is extremely elastic, and there is little to no feel about steering inputs. Don't know if GRID 2 can be considered anything like a simulation, but there is loads more feel to balancing the cars' steering inputs and acceleration/braking in it. Not much time with the game yet, and frankly I don't think there will be too much more. These thoughts are based on playing with a keyboard. Yes, a keyboard, I've played all my racing games on a keyboard.  Edit after a little more time: definitely cannot recommend the game, the physics of it all have nothing to do with actually driving a car fast or slow. On some cars some weird bumps on the road send you bouncing like a rubber ball? And again the steering and acceleration/braking inputs and feedback are very bad.
13832	â¥â¥â¥â¥
13833	Its really not what i thought it would be....  
13834	Don't bother with this get Shift 2 or most wanted.
13835	Wish I could get a refund. Controls (keyboard) feel clunky. Game is more of generic driving simulator. Only reason I play this over a specific 2nd gen Euro Trucking Simulator is that it provides more action. Reward wise, I wish I invested more time in the truck game to get a longer chassis. Or if there was another racing sim, I'd be playing it over this.   Can not recommend. Brings nothing new to the race sim genre.
13836	-Horrible UI/UX -Lots of aliasing on the text, even with AA cranked up  -Many of the graphics settings are controlled with a 'resolution' number that appears to be completely arbitrary. You can edit an XML file with the settings instead, but it is incredible that a company as large as EA thinks that this a sane way to control the graphics. -Control setup is done by selecting a profile number, which also appears to be completely meaningless. Why not put a text label (e.g., Xbox controller, Logitech G27, etc)? -The game clearly detects the Logitech G27 wheel by default (I had to unplug the wheel in order to use the menus), but it ignores it in the game itself. It's possible to use the wheel with the game, but what a PITA.  -No ability to alter controls when you're in game. You must switch back to the main menu -No ability to skip cutscenes (I watched the one before the qualifying race 3 times in an effort to see if I could get the wheel working). No idea why idea why EA hasn't taken the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hint already that cut scenes should be skippable.   I regret purchasing this game even at a greatly reduced discount.
13837	A disastrously terrible game. Menus are at best awkward to navigate. Every time you start the game you have to sign in to an ea account (it doesn't even remember the email address for you). Setting up the options is a nightmare. Graphics settings are arranged as a preset of resolution + refresh rate + anti aliasing, resulting in over a hundred presets you have to scroll thru until you find the one suited for your system.  Input is sluggish, even on a modern 8 core system with upper midrange graphics.  Actual gameplay is akin to modern codemasters games, just worse.   ps. fun fact - if you don't pick a language upon launch, which you have to do every time by the way, the intro video will eventually just start rolling as if you picked english.   It's utterly marvelous how badly they've managed to port this software. Hurts my brain to think I paid money for it.
13838	Beat every race apart from the NFS Live Finale tournaments and then the game corrupted my save. Apparrently it does this for the lolz no matter your platform sometimes so make backups. As for the game itself it was better than earlier need for speeds but I really found that the tournaments at the end got old rather fast.
13839	Graphics settings reset to defult every time I load up the game. Fine if u have a 60hz monitor and dont mind the defult, but for someone with a 144hz monitor and the hardware to push better graphics this is disappointing. Also the menu system is very clunky if you are using a controller.
13840	This game crashes on load screen every time. I have to go into task manager to delete the process to get back to my desktop. Deleted all local content in case i click on teh icon. I do NOT recommend this game on PC. BTY I am running Windows 7 Pro, i7 3930 16 GB RAM and a EVGA GTX780ti Superclocked. I thought I would be OK running this. Guess not.
13841	I've played this game prior to actually purchasing the game because the concept of the game made perfect sense to me: Like ProStreet but with better visuals, streamlined tuning and an updated physics engine which allowed for better handling. So imagine my disappointment when I found the controls so messed up that every car was nearly undrivable - so bad to the point which I shunned the game for several years. Fast forward to a few months ago when I saw this on sale a few months back, as part of the EA pack which was sold dirt cheap by result of a sale, I was willing to give this another chance, given that they have had several years to patch the handling issues and the fact that driving with a controller was now an option (in the absence of a wheel). First impressions were okay, but not outstanding. Updates were definitely made to improve the handling such that cornering was now less of an oversteery affair and thus manageable, but it wasn't as precise as I would have liked or expected of a game with an emphasis on simulation (Think Colin McRae: Dirt and Race Driver: GRID). I also took note that with my Xbox 360 controller, every car I used seemed unable to travel in a straight line - slightly drifting to the left or right as though I was driving a car with either alignment problems or an extremely bad case of torque steer (A problem further exacerbated by the rather imprecise controls). These went mostly unnoticed at first since it gave me a greater challenge than previous driving games which I've played. As the game progressed, however, it became increasingly more noticeable and thus more annoying as trying to follow the racing line became more and more difficult, with many attempts resulting in an unscheduled trip off the track and never returning to the track ever again as though its been sucked into some sort of vehicular black hole off the track. This was extremely frustrating as this mainly happened on the straights, because (as previously stated) of the car's ability (or lack thereof) to maintain a straight line.  Then I reached the drifting competitions. Oh god the drifting competitions. These were impossible. Never has any driving game I've played made drifting such a tortuous act that I've had to avoid them. To put the problem simply: Inaccurate throttle response (A flaw from using a controller that isn't really noticeable in normal racing) + Inaccurate handling = Undrivable Spinout Central. Looking back, I'm amazed that I even managed to win one of those because the car was so eager to either spin out or understeer due to what i assumed to be actually proper braking. Customization-wise, the game seems extraordinarily dull. Sure, you get the standard selection of paints, vinyls and rims, but its all put in a way that seems slow, tedious, restricted (in some cases) and ultimately not very fun, especially when they give you a bunch of preset liveries for each car which look much better than what can be done by yourself. What is commendable though is the AI, which at times seem realistic as you see drivers lock up as they miss a braking point and occasionally spin each other out and run into the gravel trap. Other times, though they can be extremely unreasonable, taking corners at speeds which I couldn't possibly achieve and lapping at a pace which, given cars of similar power and weight, cause me to call â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t on them. Overall, I didn't like this game. My experience of this game now was certainly much better than it was years ago, but the difference is like comparing a mosquito bite to a bee sting - it still hasnt made it a good game. Sure, having a wheel would have arguably made my experience better, but good driving games don't need players to have a wheel in order to have fun or allow players to drive properly - good driving games allow people to have fun even when all you have is a keyboard. This, among many reasons is why NFS: Shift is not a good game nor a good driving game which I will not reccommend to anyone, not even the hardcore racers.
13842	Do not buy this game if you have a Nvidia GT750M. The game does not work and crashes on start up. Even after clean intall of GPU drivers and re-installation of the game still no avai.
13843	OH you don't have a steering wheel and peddles peripherals? Well then you can't play!  if you don't have them don't bother or go buy them for a couple hundred dollars and play...
13844	This game sucks!
13845	for some reason this and 2 will not play in windows 10 help
13846	Pros: -great graphic -decent collection of licensed vehicle and super car -real world race track -close to real life performance -you can complete the game without finishing all the event Cons: -cheap AI  -unfair rating and matchmaking -AI is kinda annoying and will always need to play dirty in order to win -cheap physic simulation -drift event is close to unplayable  5/10 and I wish I can have my money back
13847	Very arcadey physics.   All cars more or less behave the same, minor adjustments for stiffer suspension and 4wd, but really, no big difference in handling between them except for speed/grip. Most cars have a tendency to bounce occansionally, at 1-2 Hz, regardless of suspension.   Oh well. It does provide some close pack racing which can be fun, or frustrating. Many starts are just random safe or hit-the-wall, as speed differences are quite big. (With AI on medium)  If you play with controller, remember to lower deadzone to a few percent, not the default of 25 (or 33) %.  Maybe worth 5â¬ today, not 15.
13848	When you turn up the AI ability the only thing it does is make them more able to do things that aren't possible and allow them to take you out and off the track . So I found myself just bashing my way through and getting in the lead and racing by myself over and over again. The game should have an AI that allows the car to drive along side and race you cleanly. These are mostly a waste of time and after racing a forcefeedback steering wheel for 10 laps and then getting rammed off the track ..... over and over again well that gets not to be very fun and if you run it on low ability your out in front by the first turn. Any of these car games where the sole aim of the AI is to knock you off the track in officall races are a waste of time..... I deleted mine Im done putting in alot of time and then just getting wrecked.
13849	Okay you want a review? let me tell you how I feel about this game and why I gave it a down-vote. so you might be thinking 'wow this guy has so many hours in this game, why would he down-vote this game?' well the game itself is fine. let me break it down for you.  9.5/10 game. 1/10 community. 2/10 ranking system.  Back when this game first came out I would 10/10 recommend this game. nobody really knew what they were doing and it was just as much of a party game as mario kart or gang beasts, etc etc. it was a blast and super hilarious... then people starting getting good. eh no biggy. we're still just as silly but now we actually see ourselves getting better. as time goes on the community gets more and more competitive. now its at a point where if you buy this game and you're playing it for the first time, you probably will just get frustrated that you are so bad compared to everyone else and corrupted by the mindset of the community. its about like csgo. but if you have the patience to fight through that and find the good people, go for it.  the next thing i want to address is the poorly designed ranking system. its OK, but could be A LOT better. now i don't want to complain but if you want your players to take your game seriously in a competitive scene, its only fair to them to give them a fair chance. so let's say you queue up for a match, and you're like lvl 20 ish level, rank prospect 2 in the new season. the problem is, the ranking match ups are all over the place. its like, win 4 matches in a row 'oh man you must be a god at this game, lemme just go ahead and match you against people 5 ranks above you' then you get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you twice and you're back down to people 2 ranks less than you etc etc cycle goes on and on. and besides, you shouldn't even be getting matched against these people in the first place.   I was all-star level last season, i've played this game since launch and have had a ton of fun. but i have so many issues with this game as far as ranked and community goes. but the game itself is fine.   SO TL:DR... don't get this game unless A you're willing to work very hard to get good because god forbid you ever just play for fun, or B, you have good friends to have good times with in the game. i'm telling you, its toxic. don't go in there. also the AI is trash. k bye.
13850	Game was fun, this last patch has destroyed the competitive mode. Its randomly throws people in it. They have forced bad maps into the competitive matches and its just ruined the spirit of it all. They have changed the POV settings and the speeds are off somewhat as it was during Seasons 1 and 2.
13851	the matchmaking is just so horrible.
13852	Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook 'easy to learn, hard to master' kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't 'like it'. Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that.   Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system Ã¡ la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as 'advising and consulting' these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get.   But with this new upcoming system, it's  literally  going to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, 'lol he uses the word literally wrong'. No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped 'free' randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. 'We don't want it to make prone to exploitations', they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.  This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments.
13853	This game is without any doubts one of my favorite games ever played, I'm playing it since it was released and I enjoyed every second of it with my friends but in the last few months competitive mode has been completely ruined, probably by the last patch. As soon as you play private games with your friends this game is pure FUN for hours, but if you ever want to take a break like trying a 1v1 competitive match, your fun will end there. In the first match, if you are veteran, probably you will find a semi-pro that you will just overwhelm 3-0 after 10 seconds and he will forfeit. In the second match (talking as a veteran) you will surely find a legend or so with at least 400+ hours than you and of course you'll never be able to win. This game just needs improvements on the matchmaking, then it will be just perfect, but as it is now I can't recommend it to everyone.
13854	I absolutly love this game. FLipping rocket cars playing soccar is so much fun. The new rumble update is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I Sadly cannot recommend Rocket league because of an unwelcome part of the rumble update. Previously all cosmetic DLC was the fair price 0f $2-4. In the rumble update they have added TF2 style crates you must unlock with keys. You cannot recieve the crate items in random drops. Car skins from crates have already skyrocketed to $15 worth of keys if you want to trade with other players. What would have been $2 if sold by Psyonix as one car, is now $15 unless you open a crate and the rng gives you the car you want (You could easily spend more then $15 opening crates and reciving nothing you want). Even if you were the luckiest person ever and recived every single item in both of the current crates for 1 key each, it would cost $30: Significantly more then the most expensive DLC you can purchase for the game, which is the soundtrack Vol. 2 at $6.  As long as this anti-consumer system is in the game I refuse to purchase any Psyonix products. I would have purchased the new cosmettics as a DLC pack, even if it cost more then all of the other DLC.
13855	Uninstalled.  New EULA is a joke and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all over us, introduced Microtransactions because they couldn't make any decent DLC. There's a huge stigma about microtransactions in games, especially in a game you paid for, it's understandable from a F2P game, they need some sort of income to keep the game free and to keep making content, But when a game you buy decides to pack up some little DLC's into various crates and gives you the chance at getting the particular DLC you want, that's dirty. What could've become more DLC is now locked behind a freemium gambling paywall, with the real DLC I could chose what I wanted and happily pay for it, now I'd have to buy a key, then use that key on a crate, and hope that I get the item I wanted, if not, I'd have to buy another key, potentially spending more money on useless items, than I would on an actual DLC pack I actually wanted, not fun.   This game was fantastic, the graphics, the feel, the cross-platform, now it's just another soon-to-be F2P money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   To sum up the EULA, Psysonix has complete control over you, they can sell your data on, They can take the game away from you and deny you access for life if they see fit. I'm not even going to mention that they deny access to the game unless you agree to their new EULA... oops. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Psyonix.  Absolutely Disgusted.   EDIT: I made a few mistakes when reading the EULA, review has been changed, the game is still going in a bad direction though.
13856	Best matchmaking ever! My team: 100 hours overall. I'm semi-pro, my friend is pro. Opponents: 1600 hours overall. There are rocketeer and master.
13857	Rocket League is one of my favorite games ever released. The depth that the game involves is absolutely incredible. But, the game has major flaws that 'patches' have 'addressed'. The biggest one being the â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor ranking system in the ranked game modes. You win 3 games, still same division, you lose 1, down a division. This attempt at a ranking system is so god awful that it makes me and everyone i have ever discussed it with want to jump off of a bridge. And yet the devs release this huge patch claiming to fix everything by resetting everyone, when really all the patch was, minor fixes and then covering up the flaws with new items and personlization â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. gg psyonix.
13858	Althought incredibly fun this game has two huge issues.  The matchmaking is poor, facing the same opponent or having the same teammates in ranked is awful! Especially as one of the communities many trolls is always the one you get put with twice in a row (this occurs frequently).  Onto the trolls... The report system is obviously fake. The game is full of them and running into some of the same guys constantly proves no banning takes place.  They could at least not matchmake you with someone you just reported...
13859	Game is Great. The EULA is stupid. In this day and age the publishers that be think that template EULAs should be used on all platforms.  Publishers, The EULA, that was added on 2016/09/08, states that  I (the consumer) cannot use the license on more than one PC even though I own a license to use it on the PC platform. Compare section 2(1) against section 5.1.b. In otherwords you are trying to make the license be bound to 1 computer. Section 2(1) makes sense in that I have a license on/with a single platform. But section 5.1.b does NOT make sense in this day and age. Espectially when the distribution platform is Steam. Steam controls/limits only 1 active/running game at a time. AND when the game is paired with Steam Cloud which easily migrates saves between one computer and another I cannot believe that you added section 5.1.b. *  #2) is that a EULA was added POST-SALE. I was not presented with a EULA at the time of sale therefor one CANNOT be added after the fact especially when it bans my use of the software if I don't agree to the license. e.g. I should not be able to use the newly patched version but I should be able to use the version prior to the patch that added the EULA in-game. Also I have no recourse, on the Steam platform, to use the previous version that did not require the EULA. (Steam's backup system doesn't work like a traditional backup system.)  #3) Also Psyonix in section 6(7) says they can decide if your account loses access to VC/VG with no mention of any recourse the consumer can take to refute the claim. e.g. they are the police, judge and executioner.  #4) Lastly Psyonix is specifically removing a right Californian's have. See the bottom of section 8. Thus this cannot be good for the consumer if they are removing a consumer right.  All in all this was a bad move by Psyonix. It is a bait and switch licensing in terms of #2. You cannot even exit the software without agreeing to the license (unless you use Task Manager. You cannot even use Windows' ALT-F4). That seems a bit illegal doesn't it?  *Post updated on 2016/09/09 0207 because I re-read the EULA and it indeed says 'at the same time' I swear it wasn't there the 1st time I read it. I apologize.
13860	Well, its fun. I wont deny that. But... Its not enough, that the dlc`s with different hitboxes on their cars cost by now twice as much as the original game. No. They have to go CS:GO and sell you keys for 1$ for crates you will rarely see with content you dont really need. so if you just drive your car, its a good game. but if you're a person who wants a full game, if you buy a full game, you should definietly keep your hand off.  Pro: fun with friends you have flying rocket cars  Con: Expensive DLC's Expensive keys for crates only 5-10% of new content is availiable for 'free'
13861	 I used to love this game and play it daily until the Neo-Tokyo patch, and here's why:   I'm ranked Expert in this game currently, but am only really as good as most Veterans.  I got my girlfriend the game in the summer sale, and play it with her on a smurf account that is ranked Pro, she is Semi-pro currently.  Unfortunately matchmaking is so bad that we can't have a good game and she doesn't really get the opportunity to play with people of a similar skill level to the learn the game, as the big recent patch appears to have completely f*cked up matchmaking. We will join a usual 3v3, and will end up with a team that is Me (Pro), her (Semi-Pro) and a random (Veteran etc.) and then will be against a team with an Expert, or a Legend and an Expert, and even Rocketeer ranked people.  Just now I was playing this with her with our team comp as Pro, Semi-Pro, and Veteran, against 3 Veterans. We were winning 3-0 as our teamwork was pretty good. One player leaves on the other team, and someone hiding his rank replaces him. This guy then proceeds to juggle the ball 3 times in the air before scoring and just generally being very skilled in the air, and then goes on to beat us 4-3 (all the while my girlfriend is still only just learning to hit off the wall and very occassionally has the guts to try an aerial). So thanks to matchmaking the opposition gets an insanely good player who carries them, and as such we lose the game.  Now this is not just some system that recognises that I am very good for my smurf rank and so giving me decent competition. Even when I play on this main account (as I said earlier I am expert rank), I have very often been put against teams made up of semi-pros and pros while having veteran team mates, and the newbies have been absolutely slaughtered, making me feel extremely guilty that they have had to come against such an unfair team.  All-in-all, if you are already experienced at this game, you will tend to have fun, maybe have some stupidly easy games thanks to poor matchmaking. If you are new to the game or looking to get it for the first time and will need to learn the ropes of wallcrawling, aerials etc. then just don't bother until matchmaking is fixed, as you will just get annihilated and frustrated that you aren't being given the chance to learn the game amongst people of a similar skill level.
13862	I played this game for over 70 hours just wonderfully. Then after some update in late 2015 it became unplayable for me. Constant disconnects and rubber-banding plague every match I've tried since then, and I've tried many hours as my time played shows. I have tried every method I could find to remedy but nothing has worked, even tried a different ISP and couple differents routers (even though I play many other online games without any problems). The problems lie with the game and poor servers, as many many people can attest. Once the game is playable for me once again and this won't be a negative review.  P.S. Microtransaction BS is BS and should be handled like BS, flushed away and forgotten.
13863	I love this game SO MUCH! But last update just COMPLETELY RUINED RANKED. Just cant play with two semi-pros in a team, which will just leave in the middle of the match...
13864	Was good and recommended game before but now when they added tokyo map in ranked all went to hell.
13865	While it is a fun game, I am finding that the casual game arenas are very very unbalanced. While it is uncompetative, I have been going up against some unfair opponents. My second game was 3 rookies vs veterans. Didn't make the experience too fun. I still plan to play a little bit of the game, but I have a busy schedule as is and this game doesnt sit high on my game list.
13866	With the latest update named 'Rumble', Rocket League got a new microtransaction system, yeah, because we love microtransactions in a game that we paid for, with this new system you can't only purchase the items that you want, you need to pay to open a crate and hopefully you will get what you want (you can view the drop chances of the crate before opening it), if you don't get it, keep purchasing more keys to open more crates like in a F2P game.  I would be more than happy to select what i want and pay for it without problem.  Also they now require you to accept a stupid eula to play the game that removes a lot of rights that you have as a consumer.  Yeah, it's a good game, but psyonix shouldn't be doing this.
13867	this game would be so much better if they fix matchmaking. also lately 80% of my games i join i instanly lose because either i join at 0:01 left or my teammates forefeits and it actually counts as a loss to me which should not happen because i didn't even drive 0.0000000001cm
13868	Playing this game about 500hours right now and what i can say is, that the ONLY 3 Things are important to play:   THE NEW MATCHMAKING GETTING YOU F*****! GUYS surrendering after 1Minute! And the best of all: Everyone watch the Scoreboard. There are so many moves not giving you any points while saving the goal by stop the ball in the midfield. BUT EVERYONE calls You a NOOB! So, donÂ´t play this game, if you are a peaceful, not flaming Teamplayer. You will get sad!  And the Story never ends:  Playable Guys ---&gt; HIGH PING! Unbalanced Match ---&gt; NORMAL PING!!!!!!!!!!!  FU GUYS FROM PSYONIC!!!!!!!  DID YOUR JOB VERY WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!
13869	They got rid of breathing underwater. will make positive when this is fixed
13870	Good game but matchmaking is horrible.
13871	Great Game, but after an update new terms of service gives away personal data. Cannot go back to non-data hoovering version of the game.
13872	Cool game ruined by match making.   Pros -Lots of fun when you're evenly matched -Easy to get started but difficult to master -Lots and lots of stuff to earn -Nice leveling system with cosmetic rewards  Cons -Match Making is awful -Did I mention how bad the match making is?  -Constantly queued against people who are leagues ahead of your skill set. One really good player can completely wreck a game of newbies.  -A high level player can queue with his brand new friend and it puts them in the low players MMR so the high level player just wrecks everyone. Results in really lopsided games.  -No penalties for leaving games so people quit constantly resulting in lopsided games with AI controlled players. Seriously people quit after the first goal is scored when there is still 3 minutes left in the game. So weird.    Until they fix the match making and punish leavers this game will continue to be extremely frustrating.
13873	Yeah, nobody asked for microtransactions.   I don't need another gamble simulator in my videogames. The way it was handled before was fine. Took one update and one stupid decision to make me drop one of the bests games out there currently.  Shame on you guys. If you're into stupid online gamblin and silly hats that nobody ever will pay attention too, this is your way to go now, next to CSGO and TF2.
13874	Solid game but ranking system is useless. It's not much fun going up against pro gaymer neckbeards when you might only want to play for a couple of hours week
13875	Love the game but today they added microtransactions - loot crates that you are forced to buy keys if you want to open (they do NOT drop but the crates do). It's pretty silly that the die-hard RL flockers are trolling my review saying that I can just shut the system off - except for the fact that you still run into people all the time who have too much money to blow with decals and other cosmetics that I know for fact i'll never own without shelling out my hard earned cash. It's sad that Psyonix has resorted to a forced gambling system to make extra cash and I will no longer be playing until the keys are included as rare drops.
13876	Matchmaking is terrible. They tried to fix it, but just made it worse. I don't understand.   Also don't forget the Linux and Mac release that'll likely never come out.
13877	Awarded for most balanced game of the year. 50 hours ? Doesnt matter! UR ENEMY OVER 1000!!!! ALWAYS
13878	This WAS the best game ever made. Then the rumble update came along and added a crate system.  Tl:dr IF you dont give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about your money? And not about Companies that are trying to rip you off? Go ahead and get this game its great! IF you do? Stay away.  I have been completely overrun by the reddit community for bashing this games Crate system.   For anyone who does not know about it?  Drop crates. Buy keys get items that are Crate exclusive and look way better than anything in the DLC will probably ever look like.  Dont see the problem?  1 key costs 1.49â¬!Â§$)(/!Â§ what ever currency. You get ONE item. And you have just like in CS GO a rare chance to get what you actually want.   One DLC currently containing a car and its rims costs 1.99â¬   So whats there to yell about? You can trade right?   RIght.. This system is not intregated into the steam market. So you can only trade keys (obviously)  So to get that great RARE item you want? That is only rare due to a rigged system made by the Dev of this game. You are probably going to lay down 5-10$   5-10$ for one item you want. VS 1.99$ for two, for 1.99 you also dont need to look for a trader that has it. And you wont possibly be scammed Ever.  So why am i getting bashed for this opinion? Simple.   THE system is Optional they yell at me! No it is not. Optional would be if you can turn it completely off. AKA not see other peoples great skins from this rigged to â¥â¥â¥â¥ system.   You can turn off getting crates (WHY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ WOULD YOU? That also gets rid of items you can trade! WTF?!) And the buy keys button. You will still though see all the cool â¥â¥â¥â¥ you now dont have access to unless you pay into the RNG system and pray to RNGesus.  ALSO The team making â¥â¥â¥â¥ for this system actually could have worked on more great DLC that they previously sold too! Instead we now have crates that will get good â¥â¥â¥â¥ (cause it makes them money) And probably if we even get DLC it will never reach that quality standart! AWESOME! MUCH OPTIONAL!  I like to have my games complete. And since i actually paid for this game I feel like i have a right to complain over a system that makes it impossible for me to complete the game unless i pay Triple A title prices for DLC.   Lets talk this through.  There are about 15 items in a crate  thats already IF you have insane luck and never get duplicates about 15$ taking a key price of 1$  BUT you wont have that luck. Lets say you need to spend twice as much cause RNGesus was still nice to you. Then we are now at 30$ for 2 cars. Paintjobs. A rim and a 'surprise' item.  OH what if you trade? As already mentionened Just like in CS GO rare â¥â¥â¥â¥ wont sell cheap. So you are looking at probably 10$ or a little less for JUST THE CAR!  THIS is not a F2P title I paid for this game. So why in the world do i get systems that even got hated on when they released on F2P MMOs!?  Overwatch did it better already. We have an example how to make crates suck a little less. And yet they still go for the worse system  Why? Appearently to fund Esports. Though we have no actual numbers of how much goes into the esport scene. And nor does this in anyway make this system better since they could create normal DLC instead and still make money.  Psyonix. I wish i could refund the entire damn game and get my time back i wasted in it.
13879	Random Match:  &gt;me + friends: 10 hours, semi-professional &gt;enemy team: 200 hours, expert &gt;tfw  this game is very funny but the matchmaking system is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥

13887	The Matchmaking in this game is awesome,in the very first game I made I had 2 enemys being expert and one pro..that's just the very best game experience I have ever made.
13888	worst matchamking ever invented , you can find it in this game , not only there are players out there who think they are pro and cant hit 1 ball even if it hit them in the face but also the RANKED matchmaking does it 'better' for you : welcome to your solo que your team composed by 2 rookies and a veteran = me ....their team almost always composed by experts 3man premade or smth like that ....WORSE GAME TO PLAY! too bad cant get my money back cheers spend money on it and later you will regret you ever did this mistake.
13889	EDIT: Having attempted to find a fix again, and attempted to play the game again, I've decided to change my recommendation. I can only go on my experience and, in my experience, the game is broken. Unplayable. Shame.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Recommend with a HEAVY caveat. There's a bug that some people experience (it's out there on Google) that's been around for well over a year and doesn't seem to be getting fixed. It causes the game to act severely laggy no matter how good your connection is. When I say 'literally unplayable', I'm not mis-using the word 'literally'.  The game is super fun. I got a couple weeks play out of it before it started acting up in the aforementioned way, teleporting and rubberbanding to the point where the game is worthless. I have no connection issues, packet loss, and the game registers a decent ping. None of the fixes Google has turned up have sorted this issue.  The game is definitely worth the price *IF* it works for you. If you get this bug, however, you may as well throw your money out of a window.
13890	Great game, but i,m uninstalling out of priniciple.  The reason being, they have just monetised it in the last update.  You can now buy keys for what looks like certain a combination of car, decals etc.  So you have to buy the game and then also have the option of buying keys.  Come on developers, get a grip, do one or the other, not both.  Either release the game as free and have the in game buying, or revert it back to how it was.  I feel cheated having purchased this, and had I known this was going to happen I would not have bought it.  I would also like to add, this will prevent me from buying another Psyonix Inc game, congratulations guys, I suspect I will not be alone.
13891	New updated â¥â¥â¥â¥ed the game. Dont buy unless like getting buying keys with real money to get skins.
13892	I wish there would be a 'mixed' button but because theres not i have to go with 'not recommended'. Dont get me wrong, its a great game...but since their last update they brought crates and keys in the game...what a surprise. And with this....economy. i know that it is just cosmetics but still having gambling crates in a 20â¬ game is not really great where you have to spend a lot of euros just to get that one item. And i also know you can trade them but then....economy: people already trading their csgo keys for those crates so what will people want for those mystery decals for example ? Knives? Even without steam market ppl will try to make money with it and im worried about it. We dont need more currency or rng-based crates...sad
13893	fun game, but the lag issues make it unplayable
13894	fun for the first 10 hours then it gets boring
13895	Okay let me be honest here, the game is amazing, the gameplay is perfect and it very competitive. The developers keep adding great features and follow feedback, but I will still downvote this game due to its community.  I have never ever seen such a toxic community, even counter-strike has a more helpful and supportive one. The people here are extremely harassing and ruin the experience of the game completely. I'm sorry psyonix, but please have that harassement report button do something.
13896	Would really love to recommend Rocket League (9/10), but this game has connectionbugs which i havent seen in years.  Living in central europe with a speed of 70up/25down and no lag/packetloss in any multiplayergame i play, Rocket League seems the exeption. Heavy Rubberbanding in almost every game with an ingame ping of 20-30ms.  Even driving a straight line seems impossible, the car is jumping left and right like crazy.  So either the Servers are potatoe and are located somewhere in a thirdworld country and not in europe or the game does a terrible job of routing connections. Both are equally bad and one of it must be the case, since i can definitly say its not on my end. All drivers are up-to-date and can easily handle the game. Therefore NOT RECOMMENDED 
13897	this game gave me assburgers
13898	  SO BAD I PLAY RANKED AND ROCKET LEAGUE STOP WORKING AND I GET BAN â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU

13902	The game is fun, but multiple friends had unexplainable FPS problems, while having more than sufficient system demands. After sending multiple threads to the helpdesk about this they never got any reaction and there aren't fixes on the internet that work. I don't recommend buying this game, because if you have this same problem a lot of people have the game is unplayable and you wasted your money.

13907	It's ok I guess...
13908	boring
13909	boring
13910	Rocket League is an amazing game with great potential, that is ruined with terrible servers. Even with low ping, the server will spike you with huge amounts of lag, and it's not just me that's having this issue. It'll be the entire server at once, which although hilarious (when everybody misses a stationary ball multiple times, you will laugh).
13911	Matchmaking is cancer ffs... im Veteran (= about lv 30) and got matched with legends and masters... for example 20 matches in 100 are balanced... (and there are still smurfes)  this games is cool but. there's no fun if u play without the chance to win. playing only with frieds is the only way to have some fun at least.
13912	Nice game some bad servers, Rocket League team lies to customers on forums and no changes happen even after acknowledging their mistakes.   Because of that its a 1.5/5 I would have given it 4/5 if it was not for the devs and staff actions along with some server performances.
13913	This used to be a great game to play with friends, but the latest update means that if you're not the same rank then there's little point to play. The new change means the highest ranking person on your team denotes the matchmaking party. So a new guy, an avg guy and a high ranked player get matched against 3 high ranked players for example. This just means you get stomped on most games. My friends and family have since stopped playing and we used to game regularly each night. I regret buying all the DLC now since I can't play with my buddies. Real shame.   Casual mode suffers from the same problem, even worse so since if you score a goal most of the time someone quits the game, so someone else quits and its mostly playing with a mix of AI and new players as they enter.
13914	Love the game but â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t dlc is making me write this. Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together psyonix
13915	Added ball but no physical
13916	This Game has to be one of the most fun games I have ever purchased. and it was fairly cheap.  +Graphics are good +Physics are good +Cars and special effects are good +Menus are easy to navigate +Finding games is quick and easy  Remeber, this is really only an online game, although there is a triaining mode.  -No local servers to South Africa  playing with 200ms - 300ms ping, is such a disadvantage it takes all the fun away.  -------Absolutely no response from developer on adding local servers.

13918	Please, Psyonix, can you please remove this strange map from ranked matchmaking? It's oval and does strange things with the ball. This map is even worth forfeiting over. I don't mind if the map is available for play, just give us the option to disable it, even better remove it from ranked at all.
13919	Nice game some bad servers, Rocket League team lies to customers on forums and no changes happen even after acknowledging their mistakes.   Because of that its a 1.5/5 I would have given it 4/5 if it was not for the devs and staff actions along with some server performances.
13920	Rocket league is the only game where additional content hinders more than it helps every single time. The game itself is perfect, the boost, the cars, the ball motion, hit boxes, etc. But they keep forcing players to compete in silly stadiums designed by people who dont play the game. It was fine when you could choose to play at these quirky levels, but they just integrated them into the normal game modes. They added a like/dislike option to help control which maps you are prone to playing, but guess what, IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL. So, once they stop forcing me to play at wasteland every other game competetive or not, i will recommend this game again. Til then, suck my balls psionix. - Someone who has actually reached Champion rank and has over 800 hours in this game
13921	The game is good, really fun and enjoyable... But the community is where it all falls apart.  Let me put it colorfully...  If the seabed was Rocket League, then the community would be the stinking trash that we dredge up... There's nothing wrong with the seabed itself, it's beautiful! But the garbage scattered all across it pollutes it and makes it ugly.  It's for that reason that I can't recommend it, as my overall experience has been frustrating due to the rudeness and aggression of the community.  But hey! Maybe i'm just getting too old!  Game - 8/10 Excellent! Community - 3/10 Very Poor Sportsmanship!
13922	New update pools legends and ulow beginners in equal measure for matchmaking games.   Enjoy playing on Prospect II versus former All-stars, Superstars etc.
13923	Now with skin gambling! (Crates)
13924	Don't buy it yet if you are from the Middle East, it lags like crazy at the moment and I wish if there was a LAN mode atleast so we can compensate the lag and play in a LAN party while they fix it.  not worth the money at the moment until they fix the lag.  Edit: the lag is worse if I choose the nearest servers (Middle East) and still with my Cable connection in the city, 100Mbps. I know my ISP is really bad (Etisalat Telecomunications) but comparing the latency between Rocket League and Overwatch for example, I always get a consistent ping in Overwatch opposed to what I get in Rocket League. It is an amazing game but with really crappy servers for the Middle East.  Edit2: Game still suffers from online lag, I am still waiting for a strictly LAN mode.  Edit3: After almost 200 hours, my level was reset to 1, now I am a smurf! Thanks Devs for your crappy update style!  Edit4: Forget Edit3, they restored my level, but now I can't log in, when you can't log in to rocket leauge servers it doesn't matter what level you are cause you can't FREAKING PLAY!!  Edit5: This game is now just too random, most of the time, No servers online, later if it was possible to join, I stay at joining forever, this last update ruined the connection.  check this screenshot  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822049852   Note: I think the more I complain, something happens that makes my account unable to que or join games.... hmmmmmph I wonder why.
13925	Only purchase if you have friends to play with and have fun. Otherwise, it's not worth a penny due to the quality of matchmaking. CS:GO is a delicacy compared to this game. Even with the terrible community.  Won a match and downranked:  https://i.gyazo.com/5ba9d1afbbbee9aa0d2c185a20871eb3.png   https://i.gyazo.com/c4aea9e8bac37e27a4aa113ce7b4b3b5.png   And it doesn't just end there. No matter how good you are within a team, you will rise or fall depending on whether you win or lose. Carried a game with 3 goals and 1000 points but lost? Too bad, you will downrank because of your teammates. And you can't really blame them. This leads to incorrect ranks and horribly unbalanced matchmaking. Ranks should be determined by YOUR skill, not your teammates'. The ranking system is an absolute 0/10. Imagine a ranking system consisting of two rows of code:  lose_elo (when you lose) gain_elo (when you win)  Because this is Rocket League. Worst matchmaking I've ever encountered.
13926	Crates &amp; keys :@
13927	You blocking my country ip and now nobody cant play rocket league from iran ! give back my money â¥â¥â¥â¥ing theft ! Shame on you
13928	I love this game. Played it while it was free. SO. MUCH. FUN.   But I can't recommend it, particularly for Iranians, like me. This game won't work for you. Rocket League blocks their servers in Iran. It can't connet unless you're using a proxy, which will increase the ping to uplayble levels.   So, if you don't live in the handful of countries who are boycotted by RL servers, by all means, buy this game, it's awesome and fun! But I won't, and never will, since I can't play it in its current state, unless they allow Iran to use servers.
13929	Its a good game, but unfortunately matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken
13930	At First I Would Have Gave This Game A 1^ But... They Recently Added Keys And Crates. JUST WHY??? This Game Was Unique And Awesome, Had Fun Elements. But Now It's Just A CSGO/H1Z1 Rip Off. I Will Still Play This Game, Although I Will Probably Not Be Engaging In Any Crate Openings. Than You Psyonix For Ruining My Gameplay Experince. -From, DJ
13931	i loved this game but managment is destroying it with this csgo skin buying â¥â¥â¥â¥  if you want more money bring in extra features where we will happely pay for  i bought al the dlcs with love  but this â¥â¥â¥â¥ makes me wanna demand a refund trough court and quit this game al together  how the hell is it oke to gife a crate after a good game zo they can get you to pay for a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing key to get a ffing low en skin  if i pay for â¥â¥â¥â¥ i wanna know what im buying  i dont want a chance i buy the good stuf  i dont go to a cardealer to trow a briefcase with money trough a window and hope i get a ferari  while me chances of getting a fiat are waaaaaay bigger  this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is ruining the game  atleast for me it is... i was so happy with phyionics and how they do stuff but this is going the wrong way  whats next ??? buying boost time ? paying for map rotation ? why not just make it pay to win  insted of a purely skillbased game  i HATE psyonincs for pulling this crap  im a fan of rl from the beginning and with over 400 hours in i can truely say this is ruining the gaming experiance for me  this is turning in to a cashgrab  what a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥ers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13932	Crates? Really? â¥â¥â¥â¥ you
13933	This is a great game but I wouldn't recommend picking it up now. The community is growing worse and worse, by that I mean they are 'toxic'. Lots of abusive messages when you make one slight mistake, which you will make from time to time, following by deliberate own goals etc.  Psyonix have a report system in place which does absolutely nothing it seems. It has no effect on the match you are in, sure you can mute the chat but you still take a loss and rank down. If the system is retroactively banning players then you don't notice a difference. There are more people wanting to ruin your fun by the day it seems.
13934	the worst match-making system ever. i'm getting crazy all the time. it's even worse than cs:go
13935	This is a very good game and very fun but due it's poor matching maker I can't recommend it...
13936	I love this game when I can play it. Right now the net performance is so bad I can't play in western Canada. If you buy it I'd recommend watching your play time and confirm the network performance is good enough in your area before you cross the 2 hour mark and can't return it to Steam anymore.
13937	yall need to fix the hit boxes and the latency issues!
13938	1/10 edit to 3/10  review will stay this way till  -matchmaking is fixed  -gravity is fixed  -player community gets better than CS:GO (still have seen inprivement there, not that I expect it tho.  Have just about nothing good to say about this game anymore than private games with just friends. played 50 ranked games won 30 lost 20 and ended in a lower division than when i started? Makes no since and would have to mean i go down on wins.. fix game. Then it might be worth a re-review.  Edit: Seemes to have improved to get better matchmaking (more even experince) but you alaways go down a rank if not 2 when losing but half the tiime you do no rank up for a win? Still seems unbalanced. Overall it does seem to be getting better tho.
13939	This game needs to remove any non basic maps from ranked, seriously.
13940	Great game, fun to play. Do not agree with loot crates in a pay to play game however. Lost a lot of respect for the Devs for that.
13941	Okay, let us be honest. The game mechanically? Pretty much flawless. While it has a seemingly infinite skill curve, you are quite able to jump in and just enjoy the game. There is no problem there.  Where my issue enlies the community. It has what I would describe as your typical eSports community . . . which means it is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and people that make you wish you were playing with them in person so you could bash them over the head with your keyboard. You will be accused of AFK botting while having over half the team's kills, people complaining that you didn't block a single shot when they've never defended all game, all sorts of bullcrap. Since the single player has little to offer, having to deal with the hassles of other people is the only limitation to enjoying the game.   So basically, here's the question: If you would be willing to recommend a game like League of Legends or DotA2 to people you know based on the community, would you? The answer to that is no, I couldn't, and the same applies here. I may play it every so often because it is mechanically beautiful, but the community reminds me why I don't stay around long.
13942	What is the point of Cross-Platform multiplayer when you can't invite them to a party to play with them?
13943	This game has a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking system!! And you only get in the lobby with the noobs on your team and the pros on the opposite side!!
13944	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up ranking systems since 1999
13945	This game has the most terribles matchmaking I have ever seen in a game ever.   As a new player, every single match is againt experienced players where my precence on a team means that it automatically loses.
13946	The new content in the recent update is aweosme, but the skill reset has made it really boring. Most games are a gross mismatch of level, and skill, which means either team wins by a huge margin. I used to love playing this every day, but now most games are super frustrating or really easy.
13947	Worst physical engine i have ever seen.
13948	its a fun game but the matchmaking is pure cancer! if you are trying to play SOLO standard you will still end up with 2 prospect 1 in your team eventough you are challenger 2................ great experience 10/0
13949	Well.....Rocket League is a game that asks you to give your soul and ''some time'' from your valuable life to reach Î± decent Rank. So far, we're good and i'm satisfied with the game BUT if you win 9000000 ranked matches and lose ONE only ONE the answer that you get when the match is over is DIVISION DOWN!!! and this is not the only one, to get a DIVISION UP message you have to play....well i lost the counting but who cares.  In other words my opinion for this game except the ranking system(if they fix it then i will change my review) is positive but because of the previous NO!
13950	This game inspired Lucio Ball.
13951	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
13952	This game sucks it gave me cancer.
13953	game is 2 expensive realy bad network dont play with iimo3ez horny / isreal / mahdi t5lem 5bear / she3e
13954	This game is PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥ and HATES JEWS! NAZI GAME! 3 WINS NO RANK UP ONE LOSS DERANK! The Game SUCKS and the servers even MORE!  No Israel's Servers so its â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers! 1000 ping almost every game and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t game even more then CS GO! NAZI GAME! Hates JEWS!
13955	Rocket League is all of what you can see; rocket-powered RC cars playing soccer, and recently, hockey and basketball.  When teams are balanced and everyone knows how to play, it's amazing, challenging and loads of fun. Sadly, this is a rare event. Most of the time you'll either be assigned the world's derpiest team, or the opposition will be comprised of super saiyans and jedis. If you're particularly unlucky (about 15% of the time for me), you'll end up with both.  Speed boosts are awesome and essential for high rank gameplay, particularly when 70% of players above Pro Rank fly around like birds and I'm flopping like a dying fish. When I use it, boost seems rather underwhelming at 24 or less, and getting more can be painful due to the nodes littered around the arena don't respawn fast enough for the gratuitous use they get.  Getting to a higher rank is rather tedious when you get to semi-pro, and worse when trying for veteran. Experience requirements seem rather high for no reward other than getting a higher rank.  But what truly ruins the fun of the game, is the completely broken match-making system. Team balancing in Rocket League is simply 'put players in here till 3 each team'. The game will FREQUENTLY put much higher ranked players into the match, obliterating the hopes of the opposition and spoiling the fun for their team.  TL;DR: If you're looking for a fun and balanced multiplayer game, look elsewhere. If you want to play against players with loads more experience than you, on a team with no goalie, for little reward; then welcome home.  Until the developers fix the boost respawns and overhaul the match-making system, I don't reccommend this game, as it's very frustrating.
13956	Pretty entertaining game but its match making is truly horrendous
13957	First of all I would like to say to all the whiny â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es saying their matchmaking is horrible 'I get matched with higher rank'. You have no idea what bad match making is untill you play CS:GO.  A game should be easy to learn and hard to master and this is one of those awesome games.  If you dont like the challenge, you're most likely one of those sore losers that quit because they are losing and just simply wont get any better.. and here you are now.   *THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR ME AND MANY OTHER PLYERS IS THE COMMON LAG SPIKES WITH LOW PING*  Since I first started playing this game form a free weekend, I couldnt stop playing, it was that addicting and no dramas. Game ran perfect for 150 hours straight for me untill the new (Neo Tokyo) update came out.  Now I get (lag spikes with low ping) every day for the last week or so. Im not saying becasue of the update but as a reference.   Other players have also told me they have been lagging with low ping and nothing seems to be getting done about it so I hope the developers see this because it is now unplayable for me and many others. I honestly have tried everything to try and fix this but there is not much I can do from my end.     FYI this is on Oceiana Servers with Cross-Platform turned off.
13958	â¥â¥â¥â¥ neo tokio and westeland
13959	Match maker is a joke! :)
13960	Game lags out. Alt-F4 doesn't work. Open task manager to kill. Restart game. Try to reconnect. Says can't connect to server. Try to join matchmaking again. I'm banned for 15 minutes.   As much money as people are throwing at these guys you would think they could invest a little in their servers.
13961	Let me start out by saying this is literally my favorite game on Steam. I say literally because it's true; I don't have a game I like more than this on Steam. I would also like to mention that I haven't played this in five months. Okay, a review now.  This is my favorite game on Steam. It's so much fun. The new maps really make this game fun. (I'm willing to exclude microtransactions from this review. That's not the point of this.) So, a new EULA was rolled out overnight by an update. That made the community upset. And some arenas in competitive really shouldn't be there. The community doesn't like some maps in competitive. And the microtransactions. The community isn't too fond of that. So the reason why this review doesn't have much structure is because I wanted to show just why   I  can't give the game a recommendation. And it's very difficult to not start raging at the devs right now. I've sent them so many emails, not even recieving a reply, about my issue. Error 67. I can't connect to any games. All I want to do is play online, which I'm unable to. (It was working five months ago, then it suddenly stopped with the Xbox cross-play update.)  I should repeat something: This is my favorite game in my Steam library. But I haven't played in five months.  I would like to compare my . . . 'love'(?) towards the game to sugar. (Maybe Steam doesn't like what I should've put.) If you've been having sugar for a lot of days, or months, in a row, and then suddenly, all the supply stops, how would your brain react? It needs that sugar. But there's pretty much no way to get that sugar. You start to develop sugar cravings, commonly called addictions, since you   need  that sugar. As mentioned before, there's no way to get that sugar. That metaphor sums up my feelings towards Rocket League quite well. Five months without the sugar of Rocket League is becoming too much.  I will delete this review and repost it as a 'Yes' for recommendation when I'm able to play the game again.
13962	â¥â¥â¥â¥ neo tokio and westeland
13963	Match maker is a joke! :)
13964	Get Rid Of The Microtransactions
13965	the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ever , fix the f*king rank system.. semi-pro vs roketeer or veteran , are you f*king kidding me? idiots developers
13966	I really enjoy the game but the south american servers are getting down a lot.  Playing on other countries servers it's horrible because of the ping.  Awesome game, poor servers for south america. (Brazil)
13967	Love the game, amazing atmosphere, great competitive matchmaking, the most perfect game I have seen so far.  Only complaint is for psyonix to add dedicated servers in China; Japan and South East Asia are very close geographically, but the I never get under 100 ping and often spike to 200-300 likely because of the firewall, so matches are almost always completely unenjoyable.  And to make things worse, searching for a match often (but not always) takes way too long, probably because I live in China, this mostly happens when I'm queueing with my friend who lives in the same city, I often give up after spending 30-40 minutes training while searching for a match and switch to another game.  I know psyonix listens to the community and am still active on the subreddit, it's one of the many reasons I love psyonix, I love the game but I sadly cannot play it properly. I will leave a negative review solely for the purpose of making psyonix do something about this, in which case I'd change my review.  I'd absolutely recommend it if you don't live in the following places: China, North Korea, the moon, the ISS and any other place outside the earth's atmosphere
13968	There servers have become very laggy. The ping is good but there is still major desync causing the game to be unplayable me my friends and I on PC. Looks like they cheaped out on servers so they could put more money into their pockets instead of good servers.
13969	horrible game refunded after a measly 1 hour of horrid gameplay id say im just simply too advanced for its simply ui.
13970	â¥â¥â¥â¥ the gravity, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the physics. Boring repetive game.
13971	For the love of GOD get rid of the Tokyo map. It does not belong in matchmaking it belongs in Aids filled â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13972	me and my friends are suffering from lag spikes with low ping  we tried everything for like 6 months and couldn do anything about it  uninstalling it , what a waste of money
13973	The game is amazing but the new map is pure BS ..... it shouldn't be in ranked..
13974	The game is fun and addicting..............but the matchmaking is complete garbage. Pros: -Fun and Addicting - Great mechanics and idea -Lots of game modes and levels  Cons -Matchmaking ruins the experience for you by matching you with people two titles higher than you -Toxic community -SO MUCH DLC AND DLC ACHIEVEMENTS.  I would recommend this game but the idea of it being fun and addicting gets destroyed by the games you play being broken or the people being toxic.
13975	horrible matchmaking
13976	â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME SUCKS IT WONT LOAD FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥ WTF IS THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥TRY
13977	Love this game with a passion! But if you plan on playing this game by yourself and want to pair with another random expect to lose EVERY game. Their partner pairing is so upsurd it's ridiculous! Until they allow random matchmaking to be paired with other random matchmaking this game is virtually unplayable if you are solo queing. Other than that if you have a team of people and are talking via Teamspeak or Discord this game is right up your ally! If you are a solo player, avoid this game like the Zika virus! The game use to be amazing prior to the whole 'Cross Platform' was introduced meaning it's just a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ PS4 players drunk â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around with their friends. Avoid until they make it PC only like they should have from the beginning!  Being cross platform is a decent idea but if I can't communicate with the opposite platform is means nothing more than a frustrating lose. If you are going to add cross platform you need to make sure that they can communicate with each other. Until then, the game will fluster with single player players.  *UPDATE*  Since cross platform, there are VERY RARE times that I come across a PC player. This game has evolved into a PS4 game strictally. Pairing you with PS4 players makeing player communication an impossibility! You can't talk or chat with your fellow PS4 teammate.   Rocket League is a PS4 game now, do not purchase on PC you will be an excluded person with no control over communications with your fellow players.
13978	Latest update brings a visual item microtransaction system, it'll be f2p in 6 months.
13979	Before I reason why I do not recommend this game, I gotta say this game is amazing. I have been playing for an hour or so and although I suck complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ at it, the game makes me excited and the graphics look really good even on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ computer. However... the only reason I do not recommend this game is because of the online features for the following countries:China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria. Now I live in shanghai and I can play almost every game because of the decent internet here but before I purchased this game I had no idea online play was impossible in China. Rocket league uses google features and the all mighty great fire wall of China blocked Google a while back. I was able to connect to the servers using vpn but the connection simply wasn't steady. I was able to play a few online games with the lag and the games were still very exhilarating but I can still not hide my feeling of disappointment. I really hope the company does something about the servers just like many other gaming country has dealt with China because I know that without lag, this game can be more than exciting.
13980	Game is fun but its community is â¥â¥â¥â¥ Lots of mad and salty kids being afk Just deleted it
13981	Reasons why you SHOULD NOT buy this game  1. you can enjoy happiness  Reasons why you should buy this game  1. You think youre good. (you aren't) 2. You have suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 3. You don't really like when games work how they should. 4. You have a lot of money and it's just taking up to much space. 5. You think it will be fun with friends. (though it will tear your friendship apart) 6. You are just a damn moron.  No matter how good you think you are.... you aren't people are always going to beat you because of some stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥in BS. Can you control it? no... not even a little so don't even waste your time. I personally love to hate myself everyday when I hop on for a few rounds and get off beause I'm seconds away from a stroke. Just please for everyone take my advice and do not even try this game, dont even look at it, beacause it really hates you and doesn't even want you to play
13982	it isnt fun dont buy pls save ur muney and get csgo also prepare for plan takedown canook
13983	Game is fun but its community is â¥â¥â¥â¥ Lots of mad and salty kids being afk Just deleted it
13984	Hard to find a server with decent ping and teammates in my region and the single player Ai is a joke. However the gameplay is solid
13985	Great game, TERRIBLE SERVERS!
13986	11/10 would play again
13987	Unable to play the music while in game.
13988	The game is alright to play with some friends but like most games not fun alone. The servers have continued to be bad with lots of crashing as well as lag during most games. The only thing to do offline is play vs easy bots since all difficulty level is the same. If you are going to buy the game I would wait for a under 5$ sale because it is a good time killer with a group of friends. Thought I would add in that matchmaking for the game still seems off, lots of mismatches in most games.
13989	is gamemakers out of minds??? they forcing us to play NEO TOKYO on MATCHMAKINg (wasteland map also terrible but not as much)?? is like they can make STUPIDIEST change on gameplay and defend 'is good cuz variation and same for all'
13990	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS LAST UPDATE! completely ruined the game for me. i usually play solo when my friends are not online and now the ranked matchmaking is so god damn unbalance it makes me want to kill myself! why would you add a new NOT NORMAL map into 2v2. why didn't you creat a new ranked game called stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ games with unranked matchups you â¥â¥â¥â¥ suckers
13991	This game was fantastic when it came out, But asoon the inâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed the 'Mad Max' Theme it has not made the game anyway challenging but rather not rocket leauge main theme in match making, oh i didnt forget about the new map as a Japan type theme, I like the main Rocket leauge map for competive but now i cant stand it, People reading this will think oh yer he just bad and hates it, But go into rocket leauge forms and even go on twitch and ask pros about it.
13992	Everything about this game, as a game itself is perfect. The first game in some time that was able to keep me coming back, and did not stop being fun at any point. I was originally gifted this game, and went on to buy the collector's edition, as well as gifting the game to several friends.  That being said, I cannot recommend the game anymore after the latest update. The developers have added in a crate system which allows players to obtain cars and other items for your car based off a pool of rare items. Before the release, various community members convinced me this was not such a bad thing, since it simply allowed people to pay money for a chance to get an item they would like rather than waiting for the opportunity to get it from random drops, which happen at random after games.  I was content with this change until I read the details of the release notes. The crates contain items that are otherwise unattainable. Players must now spend money on crates for the mere opportunity to get the items they want. The DLCs previously released were enough for me, as I could be assured what I was getting in buying the DLC packs. But now, there is no consistency left. I cannot trust this developer anymore.
13993	Been playing since about a month after launch. Love, love love it, or atleast used to. At first I didn't mind the DLC packages, it was all aesthetics so there was no problems. Then came some bad maps, that were implemented in ranked for some reason, still not enough reason to be upset.   Then came the crates. What a great way to introduce a new form of toxicity to your game. To encourage people to pay you money to recieve things they don't even know if they'll want or not is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Good luck playing solo without running in to the countless people farming for drops.  Sadly for now, it's time for me to take a leave of absense from RL. I really hope Psyonix realizes their mistake. I don't want Counter Strike, I don't want TF2 hats, I wish they just continued to do free, non dlc, no paid money updates like when they were in their prime.   But it's all about the money. Remember that kiddos.
13994	Amazing game, one of my favs... But I cant lvl up, all my progress is reset afther restart the game... (Everything unless the replays I save) If I change the paint or decals or any other items, It roll back to my lvl 31. I would like to know if someone else is having this issue. Thanks...
13995	Everything about this game, as a game itself is perfect. The first game in some time that was able to keep me coming back, and did not stop being fun at any point. I was originally gifted this game, and went on to buy the collector's edition, as well as gifting the game to several friends.  That being said, I cannot recommend the game anymore after the latest update. The developers have added in a crate system which allows players to obtain cars and other items for your car based off a pool of rare items. Before the release, various community members convinced me this was not such a bad thing, since it simply allowed people to pay money for a chance to get an item they would like rather than waiting for the opportunity to get it from random drops, which happen at random after games.  I was content with this change until I read the details of the release notes. The crates contain items that are otherwise unattainable. Players must now spend money on crates for the mere opportunity to get the items they want. The DLCs previously released were enough for me, as I could be assured what I was getting in buying the DLC packs. But now, there is no consistency left. I cannot trust this developer anymore.

13997	This game was fantastic when it came out, But asoon the inâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed the 'Mad Max' Theme it has not made the game anyway challenging but rather not rocket leauge main theme in match making, oh i didnt forget about the new map as a Japan type theme, I like the main Rocket leauge map for competive but now i cant stand it, People reading this will think oh yer he just bad and hates it, But go into rocket leauge forms and even go on twitch and ask pros about it.
13998	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS LAST UPDATE! completely ruined the game for me. i usually play solo when my friends are not online and now the ranked matchmaking is so god damn unbalance it makes me want to kill myself! why would you add a new NOT NORMAL map into 2v2. why didn't you creat a new ranked game called stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ games with unranked matchups you â¥â¥â¥â¥ suckers
13999	Ranking system in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. season 2 i was all star and then season 3 it places me prospect... Wtf i won all 10 games in my promos? Also i won 5 games in a row with out a division up and then after i lost once it deranked me... â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. Just won 6 games in a row and then lost once and it deranked me 4 divisions? Okay?
14000	I keep playing with Experts, Masters and Legend. By the way I'm just a veteran, this ****ing ranking system is so ridiculous
14001	playerbase is cancer
14002	It has the network connection of a potato powered by lemons being taken care of be tiny parapelegic gerbils.
14003	playerbase is cancer
14004	when you drop 1200 points and your teammate drops 200, and you still lose, this game will make you regret being alive. dont buy it thank u time to kill myself
14005	Rocket League is a competitive soccer game with cars that have rockets. What more can i say?   PROS:   - Great graphics  - Fantastic servers  - Polished gameplay  - Car Customization  CONS:  - TOXIC COMMUNITY (2nd worst community next to CS:GO)  - ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKING   - YOU GET A 15 MIN BAN FOR AVOIDING ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKING AND MATCH THROWING FROM YOUR OWN TEAMMATES.  - MULTIPLE REPORTS GOING UNNOTICED ALLOWING FOR AN INCREASE IN ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKING AND MATCH THROWING FROM YOUR OWN TEAMMATES.  - STEAM USER BRICT FOR BEING THE CAPTAIN OF THE ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKING AND OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF RACISM THAT GOES UNNOTICED.  - MUTING LASTS A MATCH ONLY SO YOU HAVE TO MUTE ALL THE ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKERS EVERY TIME YOU START A MATCH.  - NO WAY TO AVOID THE ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKERS AND MATCH THROWERS. (IF THERE WAS A WAY TO DO THIS, I WOULD GET TO PLAY WITH LIKE 14 PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ALKING AND MATCH THROWING)  - ANOTHER CON ABOUT THE TOXIC COMMUNITY OF ENDLESS â¥â¥â¥â¥ TALKERS AND MATCH THROWERS THAT I CANT THINK OF CURRENTLY BUT IM SURE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM   All in all, the gameplay is fun but the community is absolute crap. with no way to rid this problem, I can no longer recommend this game. If you are an endless shitalker, racist, match thrower, and/or avid CS:GO player, then this game is for you.
14006	playerbase is cancer
14007	Game itself is really good but community went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. Currently it is worse han League of Legends and CsGo combined.
14008	it was good at first but i guess there cutting there funding nothing but server lag and crashes when it doesn't lag
14009	Great game, but some of the worst competitive MM I've ever experienced in my life. I nearly have a brain aneurism every time I try to go beyond unranked MM due to the amount of absolute stupidity that occurs in competitive MM. Every kind of scum comes out of it.
14010	Let me know when they fix the registry issues (constant errors in ball interaction off of walls and/or vehicles, vehicle hitboxes are also pretty terrible), and when they properly divide the matchmaking system into teams and solo queues, because right now you either play with a teammate like its your job or you and a random play vs a duo queue who actually play together, instantly starting you at a massive disadvantage. Pros: was fun before too many people starting playing and taking it way too seriously, so the concept is fun, the community is just overgrown the developers and they clearly have no idea how to make a functional multiplayer matchmaking system work.
14011	Never seen a more rigged game in my life, anyone stuck in challenger knows what Im talking about! Fix your matchamking and maybe I'll come back 
14012	As you can see by my play time, I have played this game enough to know what I am talking about. I played this game since it's release on steam, and I had a good ammount of fun playing it, with a friend of mine. Then I became good at the game, and started playing by myself. Here is what I have encountered for the past several months, on ranked:  - Players that join simply to rage or curse at other players, and either don't play the game, don't focus, or don't play as a team;  - Players that won't let go of the ball, even if they don't know how to hit it;  - Severely unbalanced teams, usually resulting in a 4-0, 5-0, or similar result;  I am a programmer, and I can think of several ways of fixing each individual issue. If not completely, at least partially. However, since release, game devs have added nothing but new models, maps, gamemodes, and textures, all coming with an extra DLC.   - The cars still lack proper costumization - if you ever played a game with as many sales as this one where you could tune a car, you know what I mean;  - The match making is really bad due to the basic simplistic way they use to rank players;  - The gamemode options don't make sense 1v1 (is as good as playing real football 1v1 - 1 small mistake and the other player is running off with the ball, if they are as good as you) doesn't have enough players, 3v3 has too many, but has a solo option that prevents parties from joining, which is great so you can play by yourself and not face 3 friends and lose instantly, however the odds of finding 2 players that dont match the play style you need on your teammates in order to win are very high, and 6 uncoordinated people is just a mess, and 2v2 is the perfect ammount of players, but you cant play 2v2 by yourself unless you want to lose constantly by getting crap teammates and facing parties of good players.  In short, this game could bee great, if the devs fixed the issues with the current game instead of filling their pockets with money by adding more of what's already in the game - with the small exception of the hoops gamemode, which was great until we realized it had no space for movement. oh yeah, saving also doesn't get scored properly. That's in all modes, but on hoops as well.  In extra short because I started to ramble, don't buy this game. Have fun playing something that is actually improved on constantly and doesn't have a toxic fanbase.
14013	Too many trolls in this game. Absolutely stupid matchmaking. Ranks? Don't matter at all.
14014	  Ok seriously this game is epic and fun and cool and awesome and radicals but they don't have a boat skin??????? what ?????? really ok actualy this game is bad dont' support these devs that do nothing but neglect the game.
14015	This game is simply amazing. The gameplay is nothing short of brilliant and every aspect of this game is loveable.   However, there has been a significant drop rate for cosmetics as of late. In the past, I used to get drops every 1-4 games which is respectable. Now, I get a drop every 9+ games and, yes, I have counted.  What follows this change almost immediately? Drops of crates. Why? Why psy? I already paid in full for your game. I bought all of your dlc. Why do you have to limit me and shove crates into my face like CS:GO? This isn't what I expected from you guys.  Maybe if the drop rates were the same and the only items obtainable without crates are Very Rare rarities? I could probably understand that. Then, you can change the max drop rarity for crates to be Legendary although that would mean you would have to add more content...  I don't have any say in the content of the game and I understand that, but this is not what I expected from you guys and it's really disappointing to experience this with Rocket League.   GG
14016	WHY is the â¥â¥â¥, do they put me in games that are losing 6-0, 3-0 etc ........................................
14017	The physics engine for this game needs a massive overhaul. It's far too generous to lucky rebounds.
14018	why I can't play rocket league? 
14019	The Latest Update Has Killed Rocket League for me. As you now play at the level of the highest person in the party you either have to play with strangers to be properly matched or your friends have to be the same level as you.  If you are levels higher in your party your pals get to play with people beyond their game. Not fun at all.  If real competition is what you want then this is great news. If you want to play with friends, forget it.
14020	Great matchmaking
14021	Ranking system in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. season 2 i was all star and then season 3 it places me prospect... Wtf i won all 10 games in my promos?

14025	taking the csgo/valve route and instead of actually improving the game, they add cosemtic â¥â¥â¥â¥.

14043	Hi Can anybody please tell me why we cannot get this game to work it keeps trying to synchronize and then goes to runninng, we have yet to get this game to work feeling ripped off. Need help to get this game to work. Thanks
14044	â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking. noone can play this game
14045	For some god aweful reason, Psionix decided I should be re-placed at Challenger III-IV after 4 months of no playing. Way higher than I've ever been ranked. Yay, now I get to reset and lose all my stuff or lose 50 times in a row before I'm down at my skill level. Thanks. Such a blast.
14046	unplayable, consistent high ping exclusive to rocket league in the last months
14047	worst game if you get salty easily.. very unfun if you are new. not rewarding to new. overall unfun expierience.
14048	-you join to a match where the score is 0-4 for opponents -PC master race can play with console plebs -many games with leavers, AFKers.There is no punishment for that. -Skin cases like in CS:GO, ofc you won't open this idiot, unless you are a complete moron to spend IRL money for few piexels
14049	fix i cant go in it said something went wrong with the program.
14050	CDN 21.99$... That's a lot of money for suicidal thoughts. But seriously though, this game is like an equivalent of the wheel of misfortune. You join a game, the servers spin a wheel seeing what they'll give you. You can get the awesome prize which is a semi-decent to a nice game or the most common prize, where you play with over 100-200+ ping, Against people who are 'matched' to your skill level, you can join a game with teammates who play like they don't have limbs, or you can join a game where physics will just get turned off and all hell will break loose. Most of the time the RNG gods come in and buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ your team and give the other team free unstoppable goals. I will say I have 15.3 hours on record, however I have played a lot more on the xbox and my friends account. Overall, if you want this game badly, save the money for something else unless this game goes on sale for like CDN 8$. Also one more thing, Europeans are the superior race because they sit on top of the servers so you instantly lose pretty much if you vs Europeans.
14051	do you like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ players?  what about intense â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics? or getting stuck in a competitive match with someone from Iran with 900 ping?  than this is the game for you
14052	COD is better
14053	DIDN'T LIKED IT, HONESTLY.
14054	absolutely horrid ranking system, lost one game, division down, win 3 games, division up. Ranking system is trash.
14055	This game is pretty fun to play casually but probably one of the worst games to play competitively which is primarily why I can't recommend. In theory, it should be a good comp game. The gameplay is mostly all skill and you have a pretty decent ranking system. However, you can't choose which map you want to play on so occasionally you get stuck with the weird ones that no one likes. The community is pretty terrible. Lots of insults are thrown around during the match and there is very little teamwork in the lower levels. Client and server desysncs can lead to a bunch of BS that you just can't account for. You may have made a solid hit but the server says nah. It's a pretty fun game if you can look past all this though.
14056	it crashes evertytime i play this its like it doesnt support apple even thogh it says it does someone help me
14057	It's a fun concept, but something is bound to come along and execute it much better. In an online game matchmaking is key. This is all over the place as far as randomly throwing all skill level players together. I have never found three fun games in a row. That kills it for me. Every time I have to wait to find another awfully mismatched game, it makes me want to turn the game off.
14058	has cancer crates
14059	There is no Chinese on the bad review, Japan and South Korea, these small places have translation, China actually did not?
14060	This game is really fun! However, their ranked matchmaking is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. They have no apparent reasoning for putting you against whoever they put you against, especially when it comes to rank. You'll have games with veterans against semi-pros and stuff like that. They need to rework the whole ranking system if it ever is going to be worth while.  However............ the game is still fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and when you do well, you feel like you could kick anybody's â¥â¥â¥.
14061	This game is fun on consol, but not fun on pc because, there is not as much stuff as there is on consol and also if you dont have great connection, then you will have trouble playing online.
14062	  I got this as a gift from a terrible person (we were friends at the time). I'm apparently really bad at this game; I'm always rank 0. The plus side is that two people can play on one computer.

14064	The match making sucks and getting people that can hit an open ball shouldn't be a problem with 'finding players near your level' does jack â¥â¥â¥â¥. Also, if the game is 'searching for player' in competitive, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing forget it as it will soon say 'not enough players to start a match' lol
14065	this game is awesome but it only comes in the 32-bit version and it messes me up 
14066	it is a good Game, But the ping in middle east is too high, I would buy it when the ping become better.
14067	if you're a solo player stay away from ranked
