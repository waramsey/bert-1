2639	1	a	Updating my review in line with release to be much more comprehensive, I'm going to use the spoiler format thing again since if people just want a quick look at one aspect of a review it should be easier to find than a wall of text, there's bound to be a better format but meh, it will do.  Rating: Look at my time it's kind of irrelevant what I say at this stage, right?  Overview of gameplay:   High speed elimination based race, up to 4 players compete to travel through maps as possible using a combination of a traditional double jump mechanic and a grappling hook mechanic. Game also has weapons which can be used to mess up your opponents.    Some gameplay tags: Very Fast-paced, High skill cap, simple mechanics, repetetive, addictive  Recommended Audience (my opinion):   1. Groups of friends looking for an easy game to pick up and have fun with (probably wont pass 30 hours gameplay if in this group)  2. People who want a competetive multiplay platforming/racing experience  3. Anyone (Seriously it's a damn good game, I'm far too lazy to write a review like this for most games :D     Pros: Easy to get into   I highly recommend learning the game initially with friends who are also new to the game, the start of the game has alot of just learning maps and can be very rough unfortunately if you are not partnered with friends/other newbies, even a few hours could give someone a massively unfair advantage over a new player and hurt the experience for them.   Very Fun Fast Paced High Skill Cap Live Update: New content / bugfixes regularly implemented Customisable graphics (Trails, characters and object mods) Not very resource intensive Pro-active Developers    This is a very important point, the devs of this game are constantly looking for feedback and, while I might personally disagree with some of their choices and initiatives, I think they deserve massive praise for their approach to the development. They listen to the community and always try to look out both for the experienced players and the newer players.....I just happen not to be in sync with the community on several discussions hence the disagreements.    Streaming and community content on front-page:    Not a big deal but just a nice touch, if you release a good video or guide you might be featured on the front page after the game opens and if you stream the game there is a tab which will show your league, your current viewers and give an easy link to your stream, just a nice little touch    Cons: Heavily repetetive:    It's basically a racing game with, imo, slightly mechanics and weapons, there's 35ish? tracks at the time of release that are curated or official and gameplay off of these is rare unless you personally go looking for it   Ranked System: (Due for an overhaul according to devs, will update this review if it is updated and improved) Extremely simple mechanics:   This is both a pro and a con, on the one hand it makes the game much better for picking up and playing, on the other hand it often feels like levels are all played the same, the techniques used for speed rarely vary and weapons provide most the variety   Speed Cap:   This won't affect your gameplay for a very long time after you start but if you go for long enough this becomes a big issue. You take routes or do tricks that should give more speed but still everyone ends up travelling the same speed making route variation pointless and suboptimal     Other comments: Soundtrack is only ok, not necessarily a con but worth mentioning  Doesn't handle latency amazingly well but vastly improved on this issue so no longer worthy of a con, I have no major issues even though I can't get wired net where I live.  Player count is currently a bit low which prevents the implementation of certain gameplay refinements that I think the devs would like to put in but this shouldn't put you off buying the game, games are always available and community is (mostly) nice

1897	1	a	If you like/love Mario Cart type of games this one should be in your list. great graphics, challenging gameplay.  The only problem with this that I can find is that Codemasters should really look into their multi-player code a little. Sometimes it is hard if not impossible to setup a game with a group of friends.

2795	1	a	A good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!  Speed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The  gameplay  itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters.   More or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few).   Levels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design.  Visuals  are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game.  Sounds  are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices.   Overall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!  Indie Rating : 7.6/10  EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.95/10       Gameplay   C+     Story / Campaign   N/A     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   B-     Overall    C+      PS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?
749	1	a	A game that makes full use of the 900 degree rotation on a logitech G25/27! This game is all about running your own trucking company - you can pick your cargo, destination, truck, other drivers etc. Build a company with a fleet of trucks and drivers to dominate the haulage across America.   There is something quite soothing about driving in this game - it removes pressure from driving that you normally experience in most driving games. It is replaced with different kinds of pressure - such as juggling sleep, not damaging precious cargo and even avoiding speeding fines).  It is reccommended you do use a wheel for this but not essential. Would imagine that anything else apart from a wheel would take away from this fantastic sim! There are even communities that have virtual companies you can work for!
2003	1	a	Great Game, had a lot of fun with the 80s vibe
1594	1	a	Ridge Racer: Unbounded was, to me, a very fun, yet repetitive racing experience.  (Be prepared to read a VERY descriptive review. TL;DR is at the bottom.)  The game's introduction is very simple, and explains to the player how Shatter Bay came to be, only to turn into a urban playground for the Unbounded. As a beginner, the player is convinced by the hashiriya master to join the Unbounded, and seeks higher recognition by moving up the ranks.  Now, if you've played any of the Ridge Racer titles preceding this one, you'll find that this particular title mostly leaves any traditional aspect of the older games in the dust. However, do note that Unbounded was produced alongside major game developer Bugbear Entertainment, the same folks behind the Flatout series and, most recently, Next Car Game: Wreckfest. Bugbear's role in developing Unbounded was one of the major factors in producing this game.  The single-player mode is very simple. The player has to race through the districts within Shatter Bay and dominate every one of them. These districts very in location and theme, from the lower parts to the docks to even the city center. Now, each district has a set of challenges that get tougher and tougher as the player moves from district to district. These events are filtered out into specific types, from the standard Domination Race to my personal favorite, Drift Attack. Unbounded also adds a ranking system to game, where you unlock more &amp; more features by gaining EXP and moving yourself up higher on the list. Now, from my playthrough of Unbounded, I found that these challenges often felt a little repetitive, considering that they all take place within their respective districts and can only offer so much in terms of visuals.  Gameplay is where Bugbear's changes come into light. The physics system is completely different compared to traditional Ridge Racer titles, with drifting through corners feeling more realistic instead of the old-fashioned 'go through a turn drifting at 300 km/h' approach. However, from my playthough experience, the physics of Unbounded are easy to adjust to, with a slight learning curve. There's new gameplay mechanics implemented into Unbounded, the most notable being Frags and Targets. Frags are the Unbounded equivalent of Burnout's Takedowns, where you can smash into another opponent in order to temporarily render them out of play. An awards system is also present, which gives awards to objectives you achieve as you're racing, such as hitting a particular Target or getting multiple Frags. Targets, however, pretty much lead me to my next point.  The game now introduces a destructive environment, where almost everything can be smashed into. DICE ain't got anything on the amount of buildings and coffee shops you'll be smashing through, as the amount of destruction the player will be causing to the city can put a smile on his/her face. And yes, there's explosions too. Small explosions. Big explosions. Michael Bay-approved explosions.  Aside from the carnage, there's a game mode that I'd like to recall: Shindo racing. This is pretty much the standard racing game mode, where there's no frags and no driving into buildings. Instead, you race against other Shindo class opponents around the city, with the winner being the first across the line. The game also features Time Attack, where you race against the clock in order to beat the timer.  One of the game's bigger selling points is the track editor. This allows users to build up their own personal cities for other players to violently smash through. Track pieces are unlocked as the player progresses through the single-player and multi-player. However, I found that making a city isn't exactly the best time-investing thing to do, but the option will be there should I choose to do so.  This game often goes on sale, and when it does, it's very cheap. I picked up Unbounded with all the DLCs for less than $4 during the Steam Winter Sale of 2014. The game made up the $3.74 I paid for it quite well, providing a solid single-player experience with the added addition of multiplayer (which, admittedly, I haven't gotten to yet).  TL;DR: Ridge Racer Unbounded is a game that I'd recommend as a means of trying new things. The revamped gameplay plus the added ability to create your own personal city to tear through offers a very entertaining experience for the racer fanatic. The single-player is a pretty decent experience, but it allows you to understand how the game works, so that you can begin dominating other players online.   
1806	0	a	Oh how the mighty have fallen...  What happened here? Why is the only racing franchise I liked now just a Burnout/Need For Speed clone?  This is as much a Ridge Racer game as Command and Conquer 4 is a Command and Conquer game, in name only, gutted of what made the earlier titles so great.   Such a shame.
1227	0	a	Brought the Flatout pack a few days ago and played this one first..... I shouldn't have done....  Graphics----Poor Gameplay---Poor Everything POOR  Please don't bother with this game.   I'm going to uninstall it now...

1296	0	a	Do not get.  If you want a racing game based around destruction then get flatout 2, because this game is not anything like it says. this game is TERRIBLE!   If you play the previous flatouts, you will understand why i hate this, this THING more than Ride to Hell.

1712	0	a	This is not a Ridge Racer game.  I can't even label this as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Child. It was made to cater and aimed to typical 'stereotypical western gamer'.   Explosive, destruction, lights like Michale Bay? All in this game. The traditional drift handling? All gone. Thrown out of the window.  This game wasn't even released in Japan. They won't even try to own this horrible abomination.  Ohh... Those reviews from top game reviewers? $$$??? Do yourself a favor. Play the ps2, ps3 or psVita version if you really want to play the REAL Ridge Racer.  P.S. This game was priced $49.99 originally. *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*

I robbed a bank, got chased by Mutant Ninja Turtles, stole the TARDIS, ran people over in the DeLorean with Doc Brown, went on a lucid dream rampage in a tank, got sent on a quest for a three-headed monkey paw, and that was just the first level.

852	0	a	This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played. If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).  The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements. In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.  So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.

1264	0	a	I own both Flatout 3 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, which is a improved Flatout 2. Flatout 3 was designed by a different team from original FlatOut series. And it totally destroyed the name of the franchise.  The control and the present are so bad compared to FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. Other cons I can't list here, it would consume all the storage of steam.  So don't buy this, buy FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage.

467	0	a	With Xbox 360 controllers there are huge mapping and acceleration problems, especially in split screen mode. This is a complete showstopper for someone purchasing this game for local multiplayer! Especially given that there is no option to configure controls. Also once someone has joined there is no option for them to leave the game. Otherwise a promising racer except for insane amount of bugs and early access feel. And the developer doesn't seem committed to fixing the issues with the game, so don't waste your money.

507	1	a	The second best Flatout game after Flatout 2.This Flatout has improvements from Flatout 2 like Deathmatch Derbies with power-ups,4 new drivers,new cars for Derby class.New modes.Some drivers from Flatout 2 has improve their skills like Frank Malcov.He still is the worst driver but he is trying hard to get the podium but sadly for him he get wrecked because of his bad skills and the other drivers (inlcuding me).Also i found stunts to be more harder in UC than in 2.Also CArnage you will get fun and nightmare with this mode for GOLD hunters like me.Only the con i can give is you need Windows Live to save your progress or at least an offline account.The price 19$ is too high for an old game,i got it in summer sale with 2,84$ and i was very happy to see it in sale.Also in game is achievements but it will only unlock if you have an ONLINE Windows Live account.In the rest the game is ok.Also the soundtrack is nice not like Flatout 2 ones but still a nice one. Final note:8.5/10

235	0	a	Once upon a time I played a flash game where you drove a motorcyle over ugly blocky terrain and did tricks and stuff to get through increasingly difficult levels.  This game isn't half as engaging as that flash game was, so I got bored of it pretty quickly. The levels I played were all just straight drives from left to right with slightly modified landscape. Boring.
432	0	a	NOT for children! While the childish imagery might suggest it's kid-friendly, it is NOT. This game contains a music track titled 'Slam Van'. The song is about the titular vehicle that is a sex-orgy-on-wheels.

There is a Paperboy level (NES). You can stomp on enemies like in Mario  Fun game, I wouldn't pay full price for it though. Get it on sale

694	1	a	First off, amazing racing game. The graphics are very decent, fluid, and the game runs well overall. The tracks and extra events are great too. It requires GFWL to run, though, which sucks but isn't a deal breaker for me. Every race is a chaotic mess of debris and hazards and I absolutely love it.  That said, the one thing that has always bugged me about this game is its *awful* music. They really couldn't have picked a better lineup of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bands. The worst offering is by Manafest, a song so horrible that I always have to devote some focus while going as fast as I can to changing the song. Fred Durst would have been a tender mercy compared to the lead singer of Manafest, who has a voice that I will sum up thusly: nails on chalkboard.  And I find myself spamming the change song button pretty much constantly, because too stubborn to bother with MP3s. However, you can turn the music volume down to zero, keeping all other game sound effects intact and allowing one to use the steam music player, which eliminates all bad in this game in one stroke.  Easily one of the best racing games on offer from Steam.

1688	0	a	Ridge Racer Type 4 has always been a favorite of mine, if not my favorite game ever. This game, however, does not even deserve the name Ridge Racer in the slightest. It's a cheap, weird clone of Burnout that does everything that makes it's source of 'inspiration' fun, wrong. It's slow, clunky, drifting is awful and the (crash) physics are just dreadful.  The only plus point I can give is that they put the Assoluto Bisonte from past games into the game, but even that is DLC. There's also a couple music tracks from past games, but nothing exciting.   Still waiting for a game that comes close to RRT4's greatness, Namco. And when you're at it, get me a new Ace Combat game that doesn't suck.

Pros + Good old school style gameplay + Excellent Soundtrack + Lots off funny moments + Tons of retro easter eggs including the cardboard box trick. + Surprising number of options given its art style. + Excellent Controller support allowing you to remap everything to suit your play style.  Cons + Difficult missions  The game is pretty well made, anyone who has grown up in the late 80's and early 90's will love this game. There's a lot to enjoy here, and its well polished. I haven't seen a single bug or glitch in the game which is rare these days. The only real set back is the difficulty of the game, it tends to spike quite early in the game, I'd have liked to see different difficulty options included.  After all this I highly recommend the game and the price isn't too bad either, but obviously expect it to come down in the sales.

3295	1	a	 the ranked game matchmaking is so trash that it doesn't work.  i'm beginner league, rank 2 (doesn't really fit for me honestly, because i joined in late), and i get paired with someone 3-4 ranks above me.  i lose most of the time of course, but even when i lose i gain ELO.  also half the time the 'winning moves' are really just exploits that weren't really planned to be used in the orginal map   pros:  - fun racing game with friends. - skill impacts (WAY) more than RNG, item drops. - made it out of early access, i guess that's kind of a pro.  cons:  - camera is literally so attrocious, it's a joke. and because the camera matters in win/lose situations, it's kind of a key element, and doesn't really pair well when â¥â¥â¥â¥ed in the other direction. - (VERY) easilly exploited. - matchmaking works half the time. - limited gameplay. - you can gain and lose ELO from playing workshop maps in ranked, which aren't usually played for obvious reasons, and to add insult to injury, you don't even gain XP from playing these maps in non-competitive modes. please remove workshop maps from ranked pool. - very small base of players (&lt;750 when i play, peak is usually 800).  is it a bad game? not entirely, more like a 'the community makes it bad' kinda game. it's definately worth the money, if it's on sale. also, if you don't have friends to play it with, it'll be way less fun.   are more cons than pros a bad thing? not always. like i said, friends make this game 10x more fun.  beta was a blast, release was somewhat underwhelming, and still kinda feels like a beta game, with several bugs.
2009	1	a	If you like having fun, and like a game that doesn't take itself too serious, play this game!  Retro City Rampage (RCR) originally started as 'Grandtheftendo', an unofficial NES port of the first GTA. Later, the author decided to keep the same spirit (retro, 8-bit looks and sounds) while expanding the game way beyond the NES capabilities. Then RCR was born.  It obviously looks and plays like GTA (the first one, with top-down view), but it is a satire of the old (and new?) games, and includes uncountable references to other games and movies and pop-culture and stuff.  It is not a difficult game, although some mini-games are quite hard. It gives you a smile very often, when you see something unexpected or absurd happening, or when the game throws yet another reference at you. And it is fun to play!

1819	0	a	Absolutely no reason to get this game.  Compared to all other racing games there is as good as nothing that is 'driving' you forward to play the game. At first its exciting, but that wears off real fast.     A)   No Story     B)   You don't own a car, you just pick a limited amount of cars from a list, and the list differs depending on the race type. Only car costumisation that exists are very basic colours that you pick just before the start of each race. (No Economic system implemented)     C)   Controls are odd : The game tells you to drift to aquire 'boost' (Its like nitro but also makes you invincible for the short duration) and has a special drift button for sliding.  Using this button however slows you down immensely and makes your car quite hard to handle. If you would drift just using 'reverse' (while accelerating) (I know, game logic) you get much longer drifts and retain more speed. So why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is that drift button there then ? The only reason why someone would use this button, is because it makes ur car turn faster (but lowers ur speed like â¥â¥â¥â¥), as every car in this game steers like a 5ton SUV.     D)   Even with more drifting oriented races, at the end, you need to be the first over the line. Considering that most curves (yes even in a drifting race) don't require you to slow down, nor drift at all to get through it, you are much better off to continue to accelerate and turn/steer. Even considering how slow all cars turn     E)   Every car looks quite the same, eventhough they may have different stats, or one has the shape of an Italian sportscar and the other of a muscle car, or an SUV, they all still look alike in some way? I know, just weird     F)   The music doesn't add anything extra. It didn't affect me what-so-ever, while in a racing game, it should try to assist in getting and keeping your adrenaline flowing, but not here.     G)   The crashes or 'frags' and demolishing obstacles may seem cool at first, but it wears off really quickly.     H)   Some might say 'But its an arcade game.', to sanctify the things that are missing in this game. That is true for points   A  ,   B   &amp; a lil bit of   D   (first over the line regardless what) that are elements of the arcade genre. However I still play arcade games from years past, and comparing those games with this one is in my opinion an insult to the older arcades.   Main reason why 'racing' in this game was so simple, was probably because I just couldn't last longer then 2 hours. It just doesn't spur you on. Maybe with faster cars, further into the game, the drift button will have its use, especially if you end up 2 fast to go through the curve without drifting / hitting the brakes. But what's the point if the game is sooo dull in the beginning you won't even get to that content ?  As a conclusion this game did not spur me on what-so-ever. I was sitting in my chair, unexcited, bored, expressionless and calm while playing a racing game .... Not worth getting even if it was on a big sale, its simply not worth your time, nor your money.  There are far better racing / arcade games out there.
1237	0	a	Flatout was one of those games that I found on GOG and decided to try. I didn't expect much, but there was a sale, and I picked the game up for $1.90. The instant I got into a race I knew that the game would be good. There was mayhem, car bits smashing everywhere, tires all over the road, explosions after colliding with barrels. The game was fun, and to this day the original Flatout is one of my favorite racing games.  So when I heard that there was going to be a Flatout 3 (Sequel to Flatout 2, which was also a great game,) I was excited. I waited the week until it came out, (I should've known something was up, they only announced the game a week before it was released!) and promptly bought the game off of Steam. Once it had finished downloading, I started the game up to see if it was a worthy successor to the game that I had loved.  The first thing I did was check out the graphics options. I have a fairly fast computer, so I maxed everything out. I headed into a race. There were several classes of cars to choose from, and one of the classes was Classic. The car looked decent, so I chose it. After a loading screen with an unmoving bar, I was in. From the start, I was shocked. I won't tell you the specifics of this race, I'll just break it down by category:  Physics One of the best things about the previous Flatout games was the tight sense of physics. It wasn't quite a simulation, but it was realistic enough that you had to be careful not accidentally hit something solid and crash. It also had excellent car damage, and the cars dented and crunched realistically. With Flatout 3, all of this was thrown out of the window.  Cars in Flatout 3 handle like they do in those racing games at the arcade. When you're driving them, you don't really have a sense of control like you do in a real car. They feel way too fast, and also very light. They are also very difficult to control. The cars in Flatout 3 have all of these traits. They just don't have the tight sense of control that previous games had. Instead, they feel like someone modded the game files to make things more hectic. Honestly, it just feels bad.  Gamemodes If there was one thing that I thought Flatout 3 had going for it, it was itâs gamemodes. It has a varied lineup that looks like it could be fun to play, but still manages to fail. The modes are: Race, Stunt Man, Big Battle, Battle Arena, Monster Trucks, Speed, Nightshift, Offroad, and Challenge.  Race is the obvious one. Race around a track, and the first to complete the predetermined number of laps wins. Nightshift is actually identical to race, the only difference being that all of the courses are at night. Race mode lacks depth, but this can be forgiven seeing as thereâs only so much you can do with a lap race. Even so, the mode really isnât very good. I wouldnât say itâs bad as it is, itâs just kinda boring.  Stunt Man is the classic minigame mode from the previous games. In it, you launch your driver through the windshield to accomplish various tasks. An example would be the high jump. You would drive down a long track until you reached a high net. You would hold down the nitro button to adjust the angle, then release to see how high your driver would be launched. It sounds horribly sadistic, but it really was quite fun in the previous Flatout games.  Not so in Flatout 3.  The reason for this is simple, and this is essentially the reason the game is so bad: The physics engine quite simply fails. You just can't launch your driver like you could in the previous games. It feels cheap, kinda like a bad iPhone game. The physics just donât perform like they should in the situation. It ruins it.  The next two modes are Big Battle and Battle Arena. In these modes, 8-24 cars are thrown into an arena. A car wins by destroying all other cars in the arena. This is essentially the Derby mode from the older games. This mode sounds fun when I describe it (and it was in the last two games), but itâs terrible in Flatout 3. The reason for this is (once again) the incredibly poor physics engine. Cars fly around as if they were made of paper. A car trading paint with you does 50% damage to you, whereas a T-bone collision only does 20%. And donât even get me started on the explosions. Unfortunately, this gamemode feels like a cheap knockoff of the established mode from the other games.  Monster Trucks is unique, and it is the highlight of the game. In this mode, your only cars are (guess what) monster trucks. You can then choose from five gamemodes. The first is Search and Destroy, which is a timed dash to destroy 40 barrels on the map. The second is Bring the Light, in which the goal is to bring 5 objects into a container. The next mode is Catch the Bus. In this mode, you have to knock over 5 double decker busses as fast as possible. The fourth is Royal Flush, where players roll a mine into the sewer. The final mode is Dude, Whereâs My Car, which is similar to Search and destroy, only with car wrecks instead of barrels. These modes arenât terrible to play like the other modes, and can actually be enjoyed. Unfortunately, this enjoyment is short lived, and it soon falls to the mundaneness of the rest of the game.  Speed attempts to play like a F1 racer. All of the cars are Formula 1 cars, and the tracks are similarly themed. However, this simply doesnât work. The combination between Flatout 3 and F1 2012 is a match made in hell, and the mode fails horribly.  Offroad is kinda interesting: The goal is to get from Point A to Point B in as fast as possible. Playing the game reminds me of an old game called Fuel that I once had. The premise is interesting, but thereâs so much junk everywhere on the track that its a nightmare to drive, especially with the physics engine that stubbornly refuses to go away.  The final mode is challenge. This basically sets up specific scenarios in the previous gamemodes with goals you have to complete. This could be something like a time trial, or a race where your goal is to deal a certain amount of damage or wreck x number of cars. It fails to impress, just like everything else in this game.  Graphics Sometimes graphics can warrant the purchase of a game. You may buy a game just to show off your computer, and thatâs alright every once in awhile. This isnât one of those games. The graphics are flatout terrible! (See what I did there!) The game just doesnât look good. The cars always seem kind of squashed when you look at them, and they're low enough poly to be in a GameCube game. In fact, the entire game looks like a GameCube game. Hereâs some examples to prove my point:   If the GameCube one were higher resolution, it would beat out Flatout 3 easily.  Sound Er, no. Just no. This game has terrible sound. The main theme gets old and repetitive. Cars sound like RC cars. Collisions have no force in them. And just about everything else sound really bad. It doesnât help that this game has no soundtrack, which means youâre stuck listening to crappy music that someone wrote in a day. Words canât describe just how bad it sounds. It really is pathetic.  Conclusion If you havenât figured out by now, this game is terrible. Unfortunately for the studio that made this, the reason I feel it was so terrible was because of the Flatout label. Everyone who had played the original expected it to be the same. It just wasnât. This game might have been decent it it wasnât called Flatout 3, but because it was, it is terrible. There really wasnât anything going for this game, and Iâm truly sad to see how a previously excellent franchise fell flat.  Graphics: 0/10 Horribly dated graphics manage to look worse that Flatout 2.  Sound 0/10 Just no. Almost like they realized they needed sound a day before it was released.  Controls: 3/10 Racing games should not be played on the keyboard. When a controller was used, cars randomly careened out of control.  Gameplay: 3/10 Very little enjoyment in the game.

1644	1	a	Before I say what I need to say what I need to say I want to say that this game is very fun. I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.  The game occurs in a place called shatter bay where you pretty much participate in races and other challenges to prove you're the best driver on the road. You can even make your own courses. But since the servers are gone you can't share them or race anyone online.  Now for my complaints  Very little variety  The cars have a very small selection of colors to choose from, 4 max. The DLC cars get no color change options at all. All of the areas look similar, but they each have something to make them stand out from the other areas. For example Ghost Bay (the final area) is just every area combined, but the area is a lot darker than normal. The gameplay is pretty much Burnout's.  Drifting  I think the drifting in the game needs work, a little too much force and you spin out of control and it's tough to get back into control without resetting your car's position.  Fragging  I know some cars aren't very strong but geez one touch and my car gets totaled at times in the game. I feel like strength doesn't even matter because I can take out one of the strongest cars with the immortal, which has the lowest strength in the game, with ease.  Not that many cars  There is a car that you can only use during the last event in the game  The DLC cars are just reskins of other cars, same stats, same look, everything.  Regardless I think the game is very fun. I don't suggest buying the DLC if you plan on purchasing the game.

It's deep inside the subconscious of a young child in pre industrial America where you are forced to thrive off of others in a anarchy like goverment, yet being deep in the past the gumboys predict the future with movements and smiles. What lies in the cores of gumboys is something that is deep and dark that is covered up with looks of pleasuring happiness...you must find this out on your own. Only you can learn the secret art of the gumboy. Find it...

26	0	a	Mediocre game, the racing part is poor and the shooting part too. I didn't expect an accurate simulation for the driving model, but even for an arcade game it is below average.  + neat gfx and layout, unfortunately that's pretty much all.  - poor sense of speed or acceleration, even with Nitro boost - average control, the game use absolute direction ( instead of relative to your car) - driving doesn't requires much skills, so you don't get any satisfaction. - only 8 tracks,  - the 'massive' campaign is only 7 races longs (less than 15 min) - What is really massive is the excessive grind required (smell mobile game) - dull gameplay, if you try to race from the 1st place you'll get destroyed by the opposition, best tactics seems to start from behind and kill as much opponent as possible, then use Boost to try to take the lead in the last turn.  Not so fun. There are much better racing games around. It is a mobile port and is just below average for PC

Flatout 3 features cars that have some of the worse systems of damage e.g. you trade paint and explode, you hit someone face on no damage. Maps that have the track missing in places e.g. a map where you have to jump across a black hole and never make it (including the AI). Zombies that should be road cones (they don't move). Graphics that are worse then flatout 1. Maps that have nothing in them called off road maps.  This game was not made by bugbear it was made by Team 6. Think Pizza Dude and Taxi Raser. It is the same quality

The drift mechanic is so damn finicky that I end up either spinning out or fishtailing at every corner. And to know that the devs abandoned this years ago...  Thank God I got this from Humble Bundle.

725	1	a	The 18 Wheels of Steel series has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in 2002. Tagged as Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel (which was a sequel to Hard Truck 2: King of the Road), it was the first that used the Wheels of Steel tag name as the game play differs completely from racing trucks delivering goods. Since then, there were another four instalments where, besides the graphical enhancements, many changes were made like Mexico being left out then arrived back, sleep timer comes and goes and so on. It seems that every game after the first, developers ValuSoft couldnât make up their minds what to leave out or to use. Well, the sixth game in the series, 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul, it seems ValuSoft finally made up their minds and just chuck everything in from all the previous series thus making this game the âfinal copyâ. And it certainly shows as this simulator will be the closest you ever get other than driving the real thing.  So my real purpose for playing this game is for the love of driving. America / Canada and bits of Mexico has a diverse range of landscapes to discover and thankfully, the gameâs visual aspects is quite decent. Nothing ground breaking however still pleasant to look at. In addition to the pretty decent physics, you have a good feel driving around with a massive haul trailing behind. For instance, delivering glass was pretty easy going however when I delivered those oversize tubes through the Rocky Mountains (i.e. from Calgary to Vancouver), with snow smashing on my windscreen, it got my adrenaline running as I need to be very careful dodging traffic as well as ensuring my truck doesnât tip over. And because you can play your own music using the truckâs radio player, itâs a great experience to have (yet the music needs to be on .ogg format).  So whilst the gameâs intent is to build an empire, I felt it failed in that respect as thereâs no competition at all. You can sit back, relax and listen to your radio channel whilst having the cash rolling in. Granted, the beginning is quite rough as you need to do some real repetitive jobs (X â Beyond the Frontier anyone?) however once you have the money to buy another truck, trailer and hire additional helpers, the gameâs difficulty level gets a lot easier. However, if you, like me, like to drive the open world and seeing vast landscapes, you will enjoy this game as America is a pretty country to see. With its majestic mountain ranges, endless deserts, Great Plains and of course, bustling cities, developers Valusoft chose the correct country to display all of this. However, because it also plays on as a business simulation, it missed the mark.  Full review:  http://www.gamespot.com/18-wheels-of-steel-american-long-haul/user-reviews/2200-12653156/   8 / 10

1598	1	a	The designer of this game obviously had an accident involving a bridge support and swore vengeance against all street furniture. So steel, brick and concrete all crumble across your car's bonnet like an elderly pensioner's bones. But on top of that you can activate power (or as I came to call it the Michael Bay button) and explode through other racers and buildings. The game is actually rather challenging but it is such gleeful fun carving a swath of destruction through the city that I didn't mind having to retry tracks numerous times. It has a very nice track editor to make your own tracks and play tracks created by other people. This is my kind of online gaming where you don't have to play against other people. The down sides are the terrible soundtrack and the online server seemed to be down quite a bit when I was playing. Also the crash physics were sometimes a little strange but that never really bothered me. In conclusion this is a very good, fast paced, destructive racing game.

Everytime the action gets going it comes to a halt for the story.  Yes if it wasn't for the story it would be too close to GTA 1 but it does feel like there should have been short elegant segways into the plot instead of the classic mistake of coming to a dead stop to explain stuff. You are a bad guy.. you hurt innocent people while doing bad things.. got it.

1658	1	a	Ridge racer unbounded is (as others have stated) an eye candy burnout copy. However for like a 10-30 min time killer it is good. It takes a few races to gain an understanding on how to control your car properly (ie drifting). It's a fun game, but I recommend that you only get this while it is on sale, you want a simple racing game, you have a pc controller (don't try the keyboard controls....) and you want to see cars and buildings go boom.

2258	1	a	OMG... where to start?  This is a gem... just can't get enough of this game. If you're more or less a gamer from my generation (I'm 33, started with the Atari 2600) you will love and get this game just as much as I did.  It contains many references and parodies from Atari and NES games references to 80's movies to early PC games (LSL anyone?)to Mortal Kombat and to basically main pop culture and gaming through the last 3 to 3.5 decades, done awesomely and hits you right in the nostalgic nerve.  Putting aside the nostalgic love it generates, the game is super fun and enjoyable, with an amazing gameplay, many many features and really fun and engaging missions from stealing TV sets to traveling with the Doc from Back to the Future to many other great and fun stories.  Definitely, a must have!!

459	0	a	It is fun and maddening at the same time.  Controls are really wonky for a driving game.  Was looking for a mario-cart replacement and this would have been wonderful, if not for the aweful controls.  Graphics are cute and nice to look at. Too bad it wasn't just that little more polished.
2548	1	a	Picked this game up during the sale, sadly it crashes ever 40 minutes or so on windows 10...   Am I going to ask for a refund? Hell NO!  This game's great! picked it up for like $2.00 CDN and it even has local split screen multi player which it doesn't even advertise! Had I of known the game had local split screen multi player I probably would have picked it up much earlier... The game is easily worth $5-$7...  THIS IS A MUST BUY WHILE IT'S ON SALE FOR THIS PRICE,  even with the crashing, I feel like I just robbed these poor developers...   Very good work guys hopfully you can make another one of these gems.

1856	0	a	I don't know what this game is supposed to be.  As a racing game it is unexciting, and as a destruction game it doesn't have enough explosions.  There aren't enough cars or tracks to choose from early on. Colours are limited. Everything has to be unlocked and winning is nigh on impossible. It is also a drifting game. I hate drifting games.

1899	0	a	It's Mario Kart but with an F1 twist!...is what I want to say, but Mario Kart is fun. The powerups are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, the damage feature is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t (get repaired, instantly take damage and have to do another lap at half speed), and there's such a limited number of tracks that it feels like they didn't even try with this game. If nothing else, it speaks volumes about this game that Codemasters have to continually give it away free as a prepurchase bonus for their newer games. They can't get anyone to buy it so maybe they can convince someone to buy the DLC by giving them the game.  Just avoid this game. It's terrible. It's NOT a game you really want to be playing. Especially since almost two years after initial release it's still Â£14.99. There's barely Â£5.99 of content in this game, let alone Â£14.99!

1059	1	a	PLUS  Very Arcade - for me thatÂ´s fun. You can use your keyboard or a controller - both works very well.  Clean graphics.  Nice Soundtrack. Gives you a feeling of speed - you seem to flow.  They use real persons as actors - gives the whole the right cheesy feeling.     MINUS:   The pictures on STEAM are quite misleading - thereÂ´s no blur at all.  No damage model nor do you take any damage - although you can also crash - but  either you go frontal into a pillar of concrete or you only are informed of it.  Not much to do. Story is predictable. You infiltrate the racing scene as a cop in order to catch some car thieves.

1105	0	a	Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.  The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.  Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.  Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.  If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.  In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.  As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.  There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..  Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.  While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.  There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.  Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.

517	1	a	I heard everyone talking about Flatout on the Next Car Game forums and I enjoyed NCG so much I saw a Flatout bundle for 8 bucks and wanted to try it. I was not disapointed. The racing is fun and competitive, Carnage races are even better. There are Demolition Derby's although not as fun as NCGs in my opinion. Also the stunt games are great. If you like nitro induced racing this is a good game. If you want realistic demolition derbys I recommend getting Next Car Game by Bugbear Games.
447	0	a	Has a very weird sound glitch. All of the sound is very low besides the music. The control sucks and so does everything else. It might be fun for ten minutes if you are a toddler though. It came in a bundle I got for something else and made me glad for the alt+f4 function on my keyboard.
1849	0	a	The music is ridiculously bad, the levels are uninspired, the engine sounds way to boring, the handling of the cars is just HORRIBLE, the game itself lags like hell and nothing offers any fun. I played for about ten minutes and I'm already wondering what unbelievable crap this game is.  And after the second race it quits to desktop with a strange error.
465	0	a	From the name of the game and some pictures of the game, I thought this would be some Micro Machines clone. It is not. Treating this as its own racing game, it just is not very fun. For most of the game the racing is not very entertaining, while at the same time being far too easy. Later levels get a bit harder, but that just means you need to buy a better car and some upgrades for it. If you want a 'toy car' racing game that is fun, buy Toybox Turbos instead.

1647	1	a	This is a brilliant racing game. The last ridge racer I played was back on PS1 and a lot has changed. Not being sentimental about the franchise I had no qualms with the very different feel this had in comparison.  Notable are the excellent graphics, considerable game modes, variety of vehicles, and the kinetic, over-the-top feel. It's can get quite nailbiting and got me on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions. Sound is good, although the techno dance soundtrack was not to my tastes.  I found this to be a challenging game that does not yield its treasures easily: it took me some time to master the drift mechanic and I found the opposition pretty tough. I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but luckily I persisted and I now am having a ton of fun.  As others have noted, there is no longer a multiplayer server which is a shame, but the single player is content rich enough for that not to matter.  I am very surprised at the low marks given on Steam. This is a high quality racer in my juddgment. Luckily there is a demo so you can try before you buy.  My advice is to not quit too early: once you get the hang of the drift mechanic there is a ton of fun to be had.   Highly recommended.

It can be fiendishly difficult in places, the controls are many and you'll need to adjust them to be able to play, but it's so refreshing to find a game that is genuinely challenging, rather than just frustrating and cheesey, or just plainly too easy.  I build RC rock crawlers. Playing a game based on the full scale vehicles is about as close to my dream game as I think it is possible to get. The complexity won't be for everyone, but it's definitely one of those games that when you get it right, it all comes together and you effortlessly get your rig over that difficult obstacle, you will find yourself cheering.

2751	1	a	People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D.  They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did.   SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents.   With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.  I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3
2571	1	a	Great little top down arcade racer which reminds me of my childhood days playing Skidmarks on the Amiga. You can usually pick this game up cheap and it is fun with nice looking tracks. The only downside is it doesn't have online at the time of writing. It didn't bother me but some find this a major downside as some of the games competitiors do have this feature.

667	1	a	Very good racing game. If you previously owned FlatOut 2 and enjoyed yourself, this is a nice little refresh which adds a few tracks and restructures the campaign mode. You get the same fun physics and chaotic racing as you did in the original, and despite being more than five years old, it holds up reasonably well graphically.  It can be a tad frustrating at times, with causing huge crashes and winning the race becoming mutually exclusive, but overall it's a barrel of laughs.  The soundtrack leaves quite a lot to be desired, however. You'll have heard most of the songs in the game within an hour of playing, most of which aren't particularly great, say for a few exceptions.

363	1	a	I'm a sucker for the arcade racing genre, so I purchased this game early on (it might have been early access, I don't remember now), and I pretty much immediately wrote it off. More than anything the chunky hit boxes and punishing reset mechanics made for an infurating experience. That said, I'm glad I re-downloaded and gave it another shot. It's still not perfect but it's a whole lot better. In some ways the racing experience is among the most satisfactory of the arcade racers I play (among them, Bang Bang Racing, Mini-motors EVO, Little Street Racers) because it feels like the AI cars neither cheat nor are handicapped in an unrealistic manner. What remains imperfect are the hitboxes on some areas of some maps, which occasionally will find you stuck on parts that should clearly be traversable. Also, the heavily-mined elimination maps in career mode are almost hair-on-the-tongue annoying, at least if you're the sort that tries to get first on every map. I would rate myself as mediocre at this genre, for what it's worth, so if you're an ace at driving games, this might be too simple for you.

It tries to be Burnout, but the drifting, boost-earning, sense of speed, and car takedown mechanics are too sloppy to compete. It just makes me want to play the real thing - Burnout Takedown or Revenge.  Also, the final nail on the coffin is the name of the game. Ridge Racer. To be clear - this is NOT a Ridge Racer game. It is Ridge Racer in name alone. The drifting I've come to love from the classic series is NOT here. This is a naming cash grab.

2390	1	a	Wow, They straight up lied to my face. There is only about 30 or 20 missions and 5 side missions and they said 60+ story missions! But because that is not important what IS important is the fact that this is a great game all together. Honestly this game is about 40 or 20 hours of gamplay. (Depending on your skill level) And about 30 or 10 of those hours are actually worth it. Like really! Half of the enemys and levels are tedious and boring. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Like, one of the enemys is immune to every single weapon you have and oneshots you. You have to make sure you pick up one of the strongest blast weapons to ensure you can defeat him. And then at the end of the game they put 120 (and respawning) of those enemys. Lucky I wasn't using a controller.           Good things about Retro City Rampage: The game serves hours of replay value and has way too many secrets. But FINDING those secrets is amazing. Like using that one gigantes car and finding it again later in the game to beat that guy in the race. Or unlocking the minecraft secret by finding the pipe. And those (Easy) boss battles. Okay bye.

1097	1	a	Sure this game doesnt follow the story of the original game in the Playstation version (not sure if it was on xbox or not), but the game still has the idea of taking down an illegal street racing crew. You the protagonsist, must venture and meet new friends and rivals as you tear up the fast streets and highways in a suped up car (gameplay progression of course). The car you start out with is your basic starter. A slow, but decent car with steady acceleration. As you play, you can get better cars like the wonderful Bugatti Veyron. The vehicles can go so fast you cannot control them (if you upgrade it that way).  The police are as typical as the police in the most well known game of Need For Speed Most Wanted (Early 2000's). The cars can be crashed into sending pieces flying off, and even using freeroam pursuit breakers to evade. Pursuit breakers are the objects around the map that allow you to smash and have the FEDS' vehicles be totaled.  Over all the game is fast paced and fun, and I really recommend you should play this game, (not to mention the crazy mods you can install on this game).

0	1	a	  Death Rally   is a top-down combat racing game. Arrested for a series of crime and illegal racing, you avoid jail by participating in the Death Rally tournament where you must attract the attention of a murderous driver known as The Adversary.   Pros : This is a remake of a DOS game by the same name. You race against six opponents (always including one champion) through desert canyons, frozen strips and urban centers. Maps are pretty varied, and some races will drive the track in inverse, other times you'll have specific challenges or handicaps that keep each race fresh. The money you make is spent on upgrading your car's speed, handling and armor, while additional car models, weapons and equipment are unlocked by finding loot drops from other drivers' wreckage during races. Each car has a different acceleration and upgrade cap, while each weapon has a different attack pattern, damage rating and ammo capacity. The game looks great, only some textures and occasional close-up will show this was ported from iOS. As for the control, it is smooth and spot-on (at least with a keyboard, which is what I used 20 years ago with the original   Death Rally  ). In true tradition of the original game, it has multiple cameos from other games.   Cons : Gaining levels and money for your upgrades will require you to race A LOT, and the level variety only goes so far, you might find a certain repetitiveness only fans of top-down racing games will tolerate. There isn't much weapon variety, and as soon as you equip a better weapon, you no longer have any control over you base machine gun. Until you master each race track (in either direction), you'll find it near impossible to win the hard races, even with the most upgraded car and weapon, so get ready to do hundreds of races before you can really excel and start climbing the level rankings. The story is nothing more than an excuse for the setting, the story-based campaign is something you're unlikely to repeat.   Verdict : âââââ - Next on your list!  I really enjoyed this game. Although a mobile port, it is still one of the most polished top-down racing games out there. This genre isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if it's yours, I urge you to give  Death Rally  a try!  âââââââââââââââââââââââââ   This was just my opinion.

1800	0	a	Fun for $6, but not much to this game. Had to use x360ce emulator to get my Logitech RumblePad 2 to work. Any version of the emulator should work, just dump the exe into your Ridge Racer Unbounded folder then create the profiles. It will create the following files in your folder: x360ce.ini xbox360cemu.ini xinput1_3.dll xinputtest.exe  Just not enough vehicles or custimization for me. My 2 year old gets a kick out of it when we play. That is about all it will be used for.
2305	1	a	Quite probably the best indie game I've ever played.  RCR features a classic GTA style gameplay coupled with clear parodies of 80's &amp; 90's games and films. The game features a wide range of activites to complete and a high level of customisation; from hairstyles to cars (even the game's graphics can be changed to suit anyone's style thanks to the array of colour palettes and borders included).  Furthermore, aside from the missions, there are side goals, rampages, challenges, a free roam mode and more...basically, there is something here for every fan of open world gaming and retro media alike!

1811	0	a	Terrible stuttering issues where the game slows down and speeds up with no apparent reason. Drifting is inconsistent and seems to not work consistently, sometimes you don't drift at all and sometimes you do a spin. Collision damage seems unpredictable, sometimes you'll wreck another car with a tap and sometimes you'll hit them at high speed while boosting and get nothing for it.  Also, too many obstacles that slow you down (rather than destroy you). The game tries to be fast paced, but obstacles that force you to stop/spin around/slow down massively ruin the flow. Seems like to get the pace it wants a collision should either wreck you, or slow you down a tiny bit. You end up wasting time trying to turn a sluggish-â¥â¥â¥ car around, wishing you'd hit the obstacle that little bit harder to get wrecked because then you'd get back in the race faster.

2501	1	a	'Back to the past!' 9/10  This game could not be more appropriately titled. Rampage you say? You're damn right it is and I couldn't be more happy about it. To picture it, imagine a mashup of your favorite 8-bit video games from the 80's with some early 'Grand Theft Auto' thrown in for good measure. Which is totally awesome if you ask me, and makes for one of the best retro gaming experiences of all time; in my opinion, of course.  Playing through this game, you're sure to pick up on various themes and obvious and also obscure references to old Nintendo classics such as levels taken directly from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (that damn water level, for instance), sounds from the Mega Man series, and the track design from one of the best racing games of all time: Rad Racer, to name a few. The plot is also a mash-up of sorts as it's basically taken directly from 'Back to the Future' with sprinkles of 'Ghostbusters' and other popular 80's movies as well. Can you imagine, both 'Ghostbusters' and 'Back to the Future' in the same game? It doesn't get much better than that, folks.   Actually, now that I think more about it, this game is just one big barrage of nonstop old-school references to video games and movies from the 80's. But as I said, there's nothing wrong with a little nostalgia. And if you grew up playing games like 'Link to the Past', 'Mario Bros', or any of those fantastic early NES titles, then this game will make you feel like a kid again; in a good way. You know, like having no responsibilities other than to wipe your own butt after using the bathroom, or brushing your teeth before bed, or doing your homework the night before, or...hell, just pick this game up already. You will not be disappointed. And even if you are, what did you expect from a kid?

The improvements Bugbear made to this weren't enough to offset the bad effect on gameplay that the more arcady feel has. Rather wait 'til Wreckfest to be released. Or better yet just go right now and play either Flatout 2 or Wreckfest, they're both made by the same guys who made this and are better.  A rare miss for Bugbear.

1703	0	a	Sadly, this game captures none of the elements that made Ridge Racer games so captivating. It wasn't the driving physics. Each track had it's own character - the scenery, the pavement, the layout, the music was hand-picked to match the track You will not find any of this in Unbounded.   What you will find, is explosions, slow-motion fly-by camera, destructive vehicles (including your own), destructive environment, litter on the street, samely brownish-grey color scheme, and indistinguishable and interchangeable tracks. It's neigh impossible to distinguish one track from the next, or even parts of the map. Following the course is a challenge in itself, since all looks just so alike.

2545	1	a	Bang Bang Racing doesnât want to be just another isometric racer.  Itâs design leans heavily toward that of classic arcade racing, uninterested the cartoony power ups and lightweight vehicles so pervasive in the genre, focusing its energy into crafting a very physical racing sensation even at the cost of neglecting everything else in the game.  And it definitely shows. Bang Bang Racingâs core racing experience is tight and fast, with cars that carry a deliberate weight as you spin around corners, and aggressive AI that holds tight to the line between challenging and unfair. The sense of speed feels amazing as you slam down on the boost and try not to wreck and your newfound velocity, something thatâs difficult to land when youâre viewing the game from the viewpoint of a trailing helicopter. Itâs some of the most engaging racing Iâve ever had in an isometric racer, but itâs also the first and last thing Bang Bang Racing ever excels at.  Though thereâs a clear struggle during races as everyone fights for first, often spinning themselves out in the process, once you leave a race progression becomes hard to track. You unlock tracks and cars in a linear order, but it doesnât feel like youâre ever advancing. Races come and go and I never got the impression I was driving better cars or racing smarter opponents from the first race to the last. The only difference between the four cups (which branch out into individual races) is the type of car you drive, but again thereâs little to differentiate them by. Muscle cars felt the same as formula one cars, and as each cup uses small variations on the same courses I never had to adjust my racing style for any small subtleties the different vehicles might provide.  Track designs are universally solid, but you can only go so long on a dozen or so tracks before they start to feel tired. I appreciated the small ways Bang Bang Racing changes things up between races, be it switching race modes or opening and closing short cuts, and it was never much of an issue that I was still essentially doing the same races over and over. But I imagine thatâs in large part do to the career mode lasting in the range of 2-3 hours, which works at keeping the sense of repetition at bay, but also meant I was done with the game rather quickly and found little excuse to replay races over again.  Most bothersome is a camera that canât keep up with you. Bang Bang Racing has two options for this, one being a fixed camera typically from the side of the track, and a dynamic camera that stays at the isometric angle but turns to follow the direction of your car. Both are extremely problematic, the former because it makes it difficult to drive in a straight line or see where youâre going, and the latter for all of that and the added effect of being nauseatingly mushy. It pans slowly and clumsily, often leaving you staring in the wrong direction you need to drive and sliding around so much that I often started to feel ill and had to stop for fear of vomiting over my monitor. It tends to be more usable than the fixed camera, but at the added cost of motion sickness which may or may not affect you (for reference, I almost never experience it).  Yet for all Bang Bang Racingâs problems I kept coming back for the immensely fun and satisfying base racing experience. That I was willing to endure physical discomfort to play it should say how much I enjoyed it, and it makes it difficult to recommend for or against the game in any large capacity. I can only hope developer Digital Reality gets another crack at it and can fix the problems present here, because theyâve got a great foundation to work with packaged together in a miserable shell.

My housemate can testify, there was much screaming and crying over the Theme Park level.   Took me for freaking ever to get the hang of those wall climbs. A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.   I might not be able to climb but I can DODGE  8/10 would make Piccolo proud again

I played this and it's a pretty good racing game, great damage physics and such as all flatout games have, ability to upgrade your vehicles with credits earned in games and special events.

For player's that knew the old version, Flat Out 2, it is even more depressing. As far as I can remember you could gear your car's up in Flat Out 2 and the Cars still looked made up, BUT not like toy cars. Even if I mix something up here, the physics are even worse than the car's look like. It so brutally Acarde that it should run under 'fun games for babys' .   Finally: I can't belive that this should be the next version of Flat Out 2. I totally don't get it. Even if you took the same graphic and physic enginge from the old game, and mix it up with a few new Racetracks and Cars and what ever, you would wind up with a better game than this.   I wish I had take on of the thumbs down more seriously before I bougth the game.   Good for Kids, but everyone who knew the old Flat Out 2 will be badly disappointed! And even Kids I would recommend to buy Flat Out 2. Is't simply the...no it is complete different game and defenatly more fun! Cheers, Shoot1stAskNxt

I can run most AAA games on my decent pc that meets the specifications, but this is in painful slow-mo with tons of lag. For such a basic game that is crazy. This is desite lowering the settings and resolution to minimum. If you have a much better pc than suggested its good give it a go if on sale imo. I have a new gaming PC, but still the demands for this game are way too high. The game itself is pretty good.

824	1	a	Redlynx Trials is one of those games which is easy to pick up but very hard to stop playing. You control a trial bike rider across a wide variety of indoor courses, some of them truly awe-inspiring in their complexity. You're supposed to get the rider from one end of the obstacle course to the other, but the endless faceplants, rashies, crashes and bashes are almost as much fun as safely navigating the course. Never have broken bones been so much fun. For added enjoyment, try playing this with a friend - you can take it in turns to see who breaks the most bones.

948	1	a	Let me get the elephant out of the room first, this game is what I would consider a 'REBOOT.' When a franchise is stale, it tries to relive the successes of yester-year (EX. Most Wanted (2005)) and sometimes it works, unfortunately for Undercover, the sales at launch say it was too late. Carbon had at least a 7 million unit sales DECREASE! Then ProStreet lost another 4 million unit sales at launch! Before you click away, this is NOT the same as bad, just for Undercover, it was a day late and a dollar short.  Gameplay:   The game tries to mesh ProStreet's engine, with Most Wanted's narrative format. This was an... INTERESTING result. We got control that was MILES better than ProStreet's, but still wasn't as great as Most Wanted (2005)'s. There are new modes such as highway battles and outruns. These do add some variety, but don't really feel, (to me), warranted. The car selection is the best of the series. We got your typical street cars like your RX-8's and Camaro's, but then you got LFA's and Pagani's, holy ****,. that is awesome!  Graphics:  This is to me, the game's key strength. The shaders look real, and the textures look superb. The car modeling and damage are so fun to see your hood fly right off your car and fly away to no man's land.   Music:  Eww, I know most people bash on this, but to me this seems like a sign of how the times can change over the course of 4-8 years. Where'd did the good jams go?  Verdict:  Yes, this game has some issues, plenty. But most are not game breaking and this game gets too much hate despite no one knowing how tight this game's development was. EA Black Box/EA Canada was split in 2007. one team made ProStreet, the other made Undercover. Knowing what they accomplsihed with only half the team makes me want to give this game 4.5 stars, but I can't. It tries to be Most Wanted 2.0, but fails in terms of gameplay design and music choices. I can only give this a 5/10, which is not a bad score, in fact, five is a middle ground. It's the most subjective score I can give it.

2381	1	a	Fun Game, lots of things to do! Great when you are looking for casual entertainement!
2266	1	a	I'm not gonna lie, this game is really fun, but has some setback. For example: since its supposed to be a retro game, it's pixelated. But because of this, I sometimes miss alot of stuff that goes with the background that really annoys me. Also the controls i keep forgetting, and the $14.99 price. I suggest waiting for it to be on sale. On the bright side, it's really fun to go on rampages, and even the story is a bit long.  3.5 outta 5.

132	1	a	If only this game got some working on and more levels(plus a whole lot more recognition), it would've been an even better title! I absolutely love these kind of parkour games with high speed, lots of mobility, strong vibrant colors, etc.  Basically what you do is try to get through a level as fast as possible in one of two different modes, time trail and sphere hunt. The game mechanics are built heavily around momentum and wall-jumping, which is most of what you do to chain throughout the levels in order to perfect your run times. The action takes place in a first-person perspective, but third-person can be activated by pressing G. Your in-game character can be customized with different colors and such, which is always a plus, especially for someone like me who likes to personalize along with my character. There really isn't that much more to it, so it's entirely up to you if you want to try the game or not.  Like most games built on the unreal engine, the framerate is pre-capped at 62 FPS with vertical sync on by default, which can be changed in steamapps-common-inMomentum-Engine-Config-BaseEngine.ini. There you can either change the maximum frame under MaxSmoothedFramerate(search for it with CTRL+F in your text editor), or remove the cap by changing bSmoothFrameRate=TRUE into bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE.  For anyone interrested in a somewhat similar game that's a lot more recent, have a look into Celaria, which is a game on Indiedb that combines this with a lot more elements from Mirror's Edge! It's free since it's in alpha, but I think it so far has a lot of potential!

1597	1	a	Excellent arcadey racer right here! The game is focused on five (give or take) different modes, with domination being the main one. You collect points on each race to unlock more races, coming first sometimes doesnât' guarantee unlocking later races (especially in the later game) so the game forces you to race aggressively which in my opinion makes the game really fun. Also the mechanics of the boost are really well made and add a layer of strategy. The game also has a track maker with a lot of additional player made content already available that you can enjoy once the main cities are finished. Overall I really don't understand how come this game isn't more popular, I got this on sale after I played the demo and I can easily say it's well worth the full price!

1544	0	a	This game is awful.  It completely veers off from the classic 'flatout' gameplay, and this particular game feels extremely arcade-like. There is no real storyline that is apparent or obvious, and the AI is pretty terrible as well. Loading times aren't great which is actually pretty surprising, and the tracks aren't even fun.  Playing just a race and a half, I would not recommend at all.

Steam has to be aware of this, yet they still sell the game, knowing that you will never unlock all of the best cars which take weeks of playing to aquire. I already have the CD of this game that cost me 5 bucks, but quit storing my progress when Windows Live shut down. Now I have the 20 dollar Steam version that does the same thing. Selling this game with no fix is BAD BUSINESS.

2130	1	a	Retry City Rampage DX copies the core gameplay loop of classic GTA, with lots of arcade style minigames added, along with references and inside jokes. Some of the gags had me laugh out loud, while many others had me cringe. The main storyline is deliberately bad, bogging down in collecting arbitrary parts for a time machine over and over again.  So while this is not a great game, I can't help but give it thumbs up because I honestly had a good time for the 6 hours it took me to finish. There is enough variety and unexpected challenges at every turn to keep you interested, and the whole look and feel is rather authentic.  This could have been a much better game if the developers had taken the storytelling aspect more serious instead of relying on the audience going crazy over excessive referencing of established franchises and indie games. It's definitely worth the price tag, and if you catch it on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it. You won't regret it.

1428	0	a	I once started playing Flatout (1) as a demo. This was car racing the way I like it! The stunt modes were fun, but not a part I find necessary in this game. It was the arcade style of driving, not too difficult for anyone. It was the focus on damage, so you could earn money for new cars even by driving the wrong way! The upgrading system is a bit RPG-ish and keeps you going for more. I have bought all Flatout games since then. Flatout 2? Better. Flatout, Ultimate Carnage? Better again. I still play it every now and then, it's still parked on my HD. Just because it's fun without restrictions.  So, everyone considering buying Flatout 3: DON'T DO IT!!  Go for the old one's instead, preferably Ultimate Carnage. Flatout 3 is everything the earlier games aren't. It's from a different developer and they managed to mess up everything that gave Flatout it's distinct quality. Racing arcade style is no fun anymore, there is hardly a damage model. It's a WASTE OF MONEY!  Keep an eye on Bugbear, they still exist. I do not pray, but for a good follow-up of the old Flatout games? I am on my knees..
328	0	a	Holy mother, this game is absolutely pointless and pathetic. The conrols are irritating, the music and voices are annoying, and you can beat it in less than half an hour. I only bought it because it was sale for 29 cents, and its not even worth that. Even if you think that you can 'appreciate' an indie puzzle game like this one, you definitely should not buy this unless it's for a younger sibling or as a joke gift to a friend.

I must admit the these were really funny and done well.    It's crazy how many options are there to tweak color scheme to mimic certain systems or create your own mix.

1745	0	a	Players familiar with older Ridge Racer games will not like this game. This is a very disappointing title in the series by getting rid of the arcade-y style racer in favor of copying the same style as the Burnout or newer Need for Speed series titles. One of the things Ridge Racer was known for is the ability to wildly powerslide in and out of corners with crazy speeds while allowing you to feel in contol with some realism (able have manual transmission to change gears, trying to approach the corner just right to get the most speed, etc). This game now dumb things down by having you press a button to try and start a powerslide. This game tries hard to to come off with a gritty story to explain it's darker tone but again, this seems too much like it was trying too hard to be a Need for Speed game. The original design of their cars are nothing more than copies of real world versions. Basically this games threw away what it's known for in favor of copying others and failing.

5917	1	a	My favorite game of the year!  This game seems simplistic at first but after a while, I discovered that the controls are soooo deep! You can literally spend hundred of hours perfecting your skills and you could still improve.  My favorite aspect is the weapons available. It feel a bit like Mario Kart and I love it!  The only thing I dislike is that workshop maps are part of the official ranked mode. The game should offer 2 different ranked mode: 1-Officials 2-Workshops  BUY THIS GAME

I made the mistake of buying both, only to find out that they are basically the same thing.  Also, GFWL is REQUIRED in order to save the game in singleplayer mode, or to play multiplayer at all.

You can turbo several times and take the lead only to be smacked in the back and get overtaken by several opponents, sometimes ending up last place. Driving is sluggish, the car is unresponsive and the collision physics make no sense. You can slam someone full on and get no points, or you can get slightly touched on the side of the vehicle to get blown up. It's juts... not recommended...

1852	0	a	A few years ago, a friend of mine talked me into this game. I did horribly and assumed it was because I was terrible at racing games (spoiler alert, I'm not THAT bad). I came back to the game for some entertainment while Dirt 3 is installing, and some poor entertainment it was. And I'd like to think I've got a little bit more racing game experience behind me at this point. The drifting controls are abominable, the boost mechanic is overpowered (rear-ending someone while boosting kills them). Also, I've heard tell that the multiplayer is down. And the car selection is pretty limited as well, even if you bother to go through and unlock things. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game.

1957	1	a	  Ok, for some reason, my long review auto deleted itself, so ill redo what i can do it again.  This game was gifted to me from a friend. It is quite fun, but newer gamers and millenials might not understand things in this game as they are parodies from the 1980's and upwards. Also, people who only care about graphics will not like this game either, due to the older look of the graphics in this. I really enjoyed this title.  Anyways, this game was quite fun to play and i recommend it to all my friends for retro gaming and funny game playing.

1034	1	a	I absolutely LOVE this game! The racing, at least for me, has the best overall performance for a keyboard-driven racer. The acceleration, the handling are superb, and crashing into the side of the road or wiping out is not a deterrent to continuing the race. In fact, the overall handling and performance is so good, I have to look at all the other racers I've bought through Steam with some disdain. For this game, which seemed lukewarm in reviews, to completely outshine games better reviewed, more expensive, even flashier racers, makes me re-think racing games. Most of all, in regard to this game, is the crazy amounts of FUN I find myself having...racing on crowded streets (or mildly crowded...you can decide this) and being chased by the police with a realistic feel and the rush that comes with it is astounding, and the fact I can continue the race or chase even when I hit a pole or other car or even spin out of control makes me look at all other racers differently. I bought this on sale, and have rarely been happier with a purchase. I'd pay full price for this, especially when it's priced lower than other NFS titles. But it's all about NFS for me, from now on! AMAZING value, AMAZING capability with a keyboard. I just wish Steam would pick up the NFS Most Wanted line-up and DLC's. I did get Hot Pursuit because of this game, and it's really good...but the handling is best with Undercover.

1450	1	a	Baddest game in Flatout series, I could say that plan of the game was perfect... all those ideas with zombiemode, monster trucks, offroading etc... but handling was worst , and in game graphics was just looking like in some cartoonish racing games. Offorading, Monster trucks and Speed racing was fun... but racing itself at 'Race' was just impossible... really... But there is just few good things too... Choosing characters including beautiful women, Lot of vehicles and their even looking cool at menu, but not in game, and ofcourse easy steam achievements... thats why i am playing it, i am achievementer. Also fun was offroading and monster truck missions, but there was just only few of them. I Would respect this game, if it would use Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage game engine with nice handling etc, but as it is right now... its just not worth... atleast not worth this price. Thank god i got it as extra for FlatOut Complete. It just should not own 'FlatOut' name.

The biggest issue with the game is one that writes the whole experience off: the physics are horrible. Cars don't FEEL right. Their acceleration, turning and collision feel simply horrible.

1839	0	a	Definitely a decent arcade-racer, but it gave me the same impression GRiD 2 did: It's not sure what it wants to be, and it just ends-up feeling mushy.  Drifting, as you'd imagine, is a central mechanic in games of this genre. And while they do require practice &amp; nuance to do well in Unbounded, they just never feel good to pull off, and feel wildly inconsistent most of the time.  After I figured-out the drifting was something I didn't enjoy (even when I got decent with them), I tried to just race clean &amp; fast, and take corners with an optimal driving-line instead. And surprisingly, it worked-out, and I actually got rewarded for finding ways to take tough corners at optimal speed (even just barely touching a wall can knock-off a lot of your momentum). Not something I expected from an arcade-racer, and I got some enjoyment out of that aspect.  And now, the issue of rubber-banding: Surprisingly, Unbounded does NOT have it. Or, at least, I couldn't tell if it was there. If I raced really well and maintained optimum speed on corners, I would usually be 2-or-3 seconds ahead of my opponents, and I'd stay that far ahead for the duration of the race - they'd only encroach if I messed something up. Although, courses with lots of straight-aways are another story: They usually inexplicably sped ahead of me during long stretches of track, even if I was way ahead of them on the last corner. Not a huge issue, but it can feel unfair when the AI magically speed past you if the finish-line is at the end of a long piece of track.  What I want out of a racer is either a) an authentic simulation that rewards good driving or b) a crazy arcade game that still has its nuances. Unbounded doesn't deliver either for me. Its drifting feels really bad, so that cuts-out the arcadey-but-naunced aspect for me. And the physics &amp; handling are too arcadey to make optimal driving-lines feel good, so it's not in the authentic category either. It feels like a strange game that has no identity.  Unbounded's definitely not a bad game by any means, but there are many, many other better racers out there. Play them instead.

1357	0	a	Racing games are easy to make. You put some cars on a track, make them drive around in a circle, and award the 'win' to the guy who completes the track. That's how almost every racing game works it's a simple formula.   You start at easy races, and then as your player gets 'skills' you continue to make the races harder, until he is racing almost perfect lines   Flatout 3: Chaos and Destruction doesn't seem to agree with this. It gives the player options of modes to play. There's a lot of variety here, that would be a good thing. The problem is the difficulty of this game is extreme. There's no tutorial, and the game just is very hard. If you turn the difficulty and number of cars down, the game is better, but still quite difficult.   There's no tutorials, which means there's no explanation of the boost system (it seem it awards boost for style points when near other cars, maybe?) and the AI is INCREDIBLY difficult. If you don't race near perfect on Easy, you'll lose. Even when racing perfect, you better be boosting. At medium, you don't have a shot, you probably need perfect boosts, and even then there's no rubber banding if someone gets ahead so expect to lose often.   The game has the following modes.  Race, (standard difficult race)  Challenge mode (Seems like race, couldn't beat the first challenge)  Splatout! (Kill zombies, race around the track for points)  Offroad NightShift (night driving?) Speed (Faster cars, easier to crash) MonsterTrucks Battle Arena (fight)  Big Battle (Bigger fight)  Stuntman (a variety of annoyingly hard challenges)   All of those would be amazing if done competently, but I would say none are properly executed on. Sad because I love racing games, and high adrenaline games are fun, but this does everything except get the blood pumping.   A shame but this is a very firm 'Do not recommend' If you like Racing, Dirt 3 is good, if you like carnage, Burnout Paradise is bar none the best. If you like killing 'Zombies' go play Carmageddon. But what ever you do, don't even boot up this game. It's not worth it.

1225	0	a	I really loved Flatout 1, then Flatout 2 and Flatout Ultimate Carnage (although they were pretty much the same game, the latter graphically a bit tuned up and 'more to do'). So, since I bought the FO1/FO2/FOUC/FO3 package, why not play Flatout 3 although I've heard some pretty nasty stuff about it. Note: one of my Steam friends told me to keep my memory of Flatout as it was: when I did install, he uttered 'don't play FO3, uninstall and never look back'   Naturally, I rejected his advice, because I wanted to form an opinion that I made myself. How I wished I had listened. The game has graphics worse than Flatout 1, driveability worse than Flatout 1, a damage model worse than Sony's F1 2005-2009 (and that was horrible) and looks like a game made in....1998 at best. No, even the Half Life 1 graphics were better. 1996, 1997? For the Dutch in my list, it looks like A2 Racer. The first one.  Just one race, but enough to scrape the pieces of my Flatout memory to what it was after Ultimate Carnage. Don't buy, and if you do, I hope you are buying the other 3 Flatouts with it, because this game should pay you to have you play it.

Absolutly the worst controls I have ever had to try and use in a racing game.  I luckly got this in a bundle for the other Flatout games which I hear are all really good. So I thouht I would try out the latest one first since it had steam achievements and had modern graphics.   Well at least I have the other games of the series that are actually FUN to play. So ya... If you get this game, It had better be beacuse you bought the Flatout bundle like I did. And when you do pick up the bundle (for cheap) make sure to hide this game in you're steam library.   Step 1: Find Flatout 3 in your Library under the 'Games' tab. Step 2: Right click Flatout 3 and click 'set Categories' from the list of options. Step 3: Click little box near the bottom left corner that says 'Hide this game in my library' &amp; finally Step 4: Have the peace of mind knowing you hid an embarassing game from your steam library. And people that may look on your Steam profile will never know you had this garbage amongst your collection of ACTUAL games. :-)

DLC are unreasonably expansive! Especially China Track which is the worst DLC Track but the most expansive (LOL). But Europe, India and Canada are rather good. But anyway they are very expensive. Buy it ONLY on sale.  Multiplayer isnât the strong part of this game â many players has different problems with online mode, but it works:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=316882599   For this you should link your Steam and Race Net accounts:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/203680/discussions/0/846959362244973673/   http://steamcommunity.com/app/203680/discussions/0/864951475503458740/   You should also learn some tips or it will be difficult to play it:  1) Watch videos of shortcuts (include locked ones):  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113147181   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113338734   2) Learn how to do start and jump boosts:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130374135   Eventually itâs your choice but for me itâs awesome.

The aim is to finish an obsticle course in the quickest time while also carrying lots of 'snugglies' in your trunk, so there is alot physics involed in not letting your truck tip over.  The game only explains the keyboard controls, however you can play with an xbox controller (and I recommend you do, if you play it).   User created levels will add replayability here, but don't waste your time playing.

1618	1	a	Ridge Racer Unbounded is like one of those arcade machine games that cost 25 cents a pop, and are high octane, slightly cheap races that you keep coming back to.  It's a great game, it plays great, it looks great, but like in almost all games in it's category, it has bad rubberbanding. You could be in front of a guy for 5 seconds and maintain a steady pace, but a minute or two later you'll be towards the back of the pack, even with frequent turbo's.  The cars also feel floaty, like in almost every game in it's genre. When you're drifting around corners, it feels like you're driving a hovercar which you may or may not like.  Being the only Ridge Racer on PC without emulation, I say it's highly worth buying. 9/10

In the tradition of Sonic All Stars racing or Mario Kart ... but be warned, this one is on steroids. Controls are smooth and intuitive with full support for an X-Box 360 wireless game pad controller. This game is really fun to play and comes highly recommended!  9.5 / 10

2579	1	a	A surprising little game. It plays and looks like a souped up micromachines game from days of yore. It has lots of nice little touches like oil slicks, sand, exploding barrels. And tons of unlockable paint jobs. Not to mention quite a few well designed tracks with the standard elimination, race, time trial options. The multiplayer bonus and shortcuts add to this and it's a shame more people aren't playing it.  The downside is the standard rubberband AI that you get with racers, but if you've played racing games this is kinda goes with the territory. It's not terrible with it, but it is noticeable. Especially in elimination races. The other downside is multiplayer is limited to unlocks, so if you plan to play with friends you may want to spend some time unlocking at least the extra tracks, modes, and cars.   I recommend this as a fun little party racer with a lot of nice little touches that nobody should be disappointed with. If you like unlockables, all the skins/paintjobs should keep you going for quite some time.

1859	0	a	Constantly tries to reach the online servers but the servcers no longer exists, so long wait for the authentication check, which happens several times in game, plus no multiplayer. Also the laziest console port I have ever seen - 1 variable in the display settings and no mouse use in game. Awful.
476	1	a	The game is fine, what is absolute crap is the Windows Live integration. Be warned. Like me, you may NOT be able to actually play what you have purchased!! Problem now solved, but I'm not happy with Windows Live.
1828	0	a	The music is ridiculously bad, the levels are uninspired, the engine sounds way to boring, the handling of the cars is just HORRIBLE, the game itself lags like hell and nothing offers any fun. I played for about ten minutes and I'm already wondering what unbelievable crap this game is.  And after the second race it quits to desktop with a strange error.

147	1	a	Snuggle Truck is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. From an objective standpoint, nothing else comes quite close to delivering the kind of experience that this game is capable of. If I were to choose one game in existence to prove to somebody that video games are art, it would definitely have to be this masterpiece.  Firstly, I would like to begin this review by asking the question: what is a video game? Some people would simply answer this by saying that video games are an interactive medium with the sole purpose of delivering entertainment to the players. Others prefer to give long philosophical answers which tackle every facet of this age-long riddle. After playing Snuggle Truck I can honestly say that any answer to this question is meaningless, and one only needs to play this game to fully appreciate the marvellous wonder of this pastime known as 'video games.'  With that said I would like to break the game down as much as possible within the limitations of purely text-based reviews; after all Snuggle Truck is a deep, complex experience which would transcend standard, traditional review formats. One of the most notable things I would like to bring to the forefront is Snuggle Truck's graphics and visual style. When I first loaded this game and began playing, I thought the game had crashed. Let me explain: I'm an avid fan of trucking in general, and as a result my desktop background is a constantly-changing slideshow of truck imagery. The visuals in this game are so incredible that I mistook graphical images for photography. The animation is also so incredibly smooth and lifelike that I actually started to feel brief motion sickness after only a few seconds of play.  This soon passed however as I quickly became immersed in the truly innovative and revolutionary gameplay found in this work of art. Snuggle Truck takes similar games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 and completely slaps them in the face with its own brand of hyperrealistic physics and gameplay scenarios which leaves a completely before-unseen impression on the player. Because of how intuitive, responsive and predictable the controls felt, I was very quickly able to adapt to how the game must be played; and it even left me thinking 'hot damn, this is so lifelike, I could probably do this in a real life truck.'  That's not to say the game is easily played, however. While the game presents itself as being extremely accessible through its controls and simplstic gameplay objectives, this game has a very steep difficulty curve which constantly demands the player to step up their game. The difficulty is fair and never feels artificial, and if you mess up, it's 100% your fault.  The audio in this game is beyond noteworthy. No lie, when I finished playing this game because I had important things to do - such as sleep so that I would have enough energy the next day to play more Snuggle Truck - I basically had to leave the game idling on the title screen because the music is so incredible. It's insanely catchy and would make great classical composers of past ages such as Bach and Mozart weep with envy.  With everything said, I believe it stands to reason that Snuggle Truck should be considered one of if not the greatest game ever made. If, after reading this review, you still have any doubts as to whether or not you should buy this game, you are probably literally Satan; though I doubt even the dark lord himself wouldn't get a kick out of this truly magnificent magnum opus.

2071	1	a	In the beginning was the NES, then about 12 years later the PSone and the game GTA. Now here's an amazing mix of the distant past, the even more distant past combined into a brilliant GTA (the first two) parody.  Normally I think references are bad writing, but less so the more well known classic (ninja turtles, bill &amp; ted, back to the future) 80's references which often just make enough of an apperance to keep things moving quickly. And considering it states right at the begining that it's a parody, it works in a beautifully ( parody is fair use under copyright law: ) cheeky manner.  RCR's gameplay absolutely thrashes the original GTA (and all the GTA's in my opinion, but I may be alone in that) that it is so closely based on. Especially the handling of the vehicles which is a joy and easier to both run down lots of pedestrians, and drive safely with traffic.  I've kept this review relatively short for the short amount of time I've actually played it, but I've played enough to know that I love it.  9.4/10 Oh, and the grim reaper mission just has me completely beat. I just can't kill them all fast enough.

99	1	a	I really enjoyed my time with this game, but now that I'm at the point where I'm no longer likely to spend any more time with it I find myself being disappointed.    Let me explain.    This game handles speed really well and pulling off a flawless run feels great. There's a decent amount of content to keep you occupied, and there are some pretty well designed levels that are fun to play over and over. The core mechanics feel solid and are satisfying. Basically if you're into speedruning at all this should be right up your alley.    That being said there is certainly a huge lack of polish on this game. The game advertises multiple game modes but only one of them is really worth playing. The difficulty modes are an interesting idea but there certainly doesn't need to be as many of them as there are and some levels are (while all beatable) clearly not designed for the hardest one. Additionally its also impossible (from what I can see) to tell how many rockets you have left on the harder settings.    I really wish the devs stuck with this game a bit longer. While I am mostly satisfied with what I got. I can only imagine how great this game would have been with workshop support or even decent alternative game modes, but it looks like we wont be getting any of that.

1953	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a wonderful homage to all things 80's. Expect references to 80's movies, games, pop culture, and much more. The gameplay itself is like a 2D, 8-bit version of the 3D Grand Theft Auto games, split between on foot combat, and vehicle segements. There are 62 story missions, 23 weapons, and tons of vehicles. The game has a pretty good difficulty curve starting very easy and building up to extremely difficult for the final sequence of story missions. The game is very generous with checkpoints so dying is almost never that big of a deal. Aside from the main story there are 14 'sprees' and 23 'second rate sprees'. The sprees involve trying to get a high score while under various effects such as drunkeness, invulnerablity, explosive sweat, normal stuff. There is one second rate spree for each weapon and they just involve killing as many people with that weapon as possible. There are also 70 collectibles hidden around the game world (similar to the packages, magnets, oysters, etc. from the GTA games) along with plenty of other hidden easter-eggs giving plenty of reason to explore the game's overworld. Overall the game was very fun, very funny, and highly recommended by me.

1000	1	a	I've not experienced a title as interesting as this within Need for Speed for a long time. Where do I even begin? The endless flaws and general glitchy gameplay? The hidden charm?  Let's start with the positives first:  + The smoke seems as good a place to start as any. It is gorgeous! In ProStreet, EA BlackBox (the developer) gave the tire smoke a new look and it was stunning as it wrapped around the tires in a drag race. It is the same here, with the smoke seemingly blurring your car amidst it. It even changes to brown if you're driving on dirt!  + Car selection is slightly more positive than negative I'd say. 54 cars in total with a great variety of muscle, exotic and tuner. There are no SUVs but I will never care again if they forget about SUVs entirely. They were terrible in Underground 2 lol. Each car can be upgraded (albeit with not a lot to choose from) both performance and aesthetic wise.  + Core mechanics. What I mean is the underlying gameplay, where you find the genuine fun of NFS Undercover. If you look at Undercover at the surface, you'll find something drasticly wrong with it. But scratch underneath that and you can see EA Black Box tried something a little different. The cars handle differently to any previous NFS before it, giving them an incredibly unrealistic but extremely fun feel! This is due to the 'Heroic Driving Engine'. It certainly gives the cars a slidy feel, but it's not to the point of feeling like you're driving on ice. You can do doughnuts easily, and then suddenly pull away. You can be driving at over 150 MPH and then suddenly veer off round a corner going nearly the same speed. You can pull off J-turns like nothing at all. It offers the chance to drive easily but with some flair.  + Graphical tuning. Undercover actually offers a pretty nice list of graphical fine-tuning for you to choose from. From anti-aliasing to texture filtering, adjusting the car detail to world detail, it provides some good things for you to match the game to what your computer is capable of.  + Photo Mode. I love taking photos of my cars! I've taken advantage of 'Photo Mode' in every racing game, not just NFS however. So an inclusion in this title is no different! The graphics are... average... but they provide enough for some sweet photos.  OK, I have to admit this is where the positives end.... erm... yeah, so on to the negatives I suppose.  - The AI is the most FRUSTRATING, BROKEN, IDIOTIC and UNDECISIVE piece of CRAP. I have never felt so angered than I have playing Undercover. Let's start with the traffic: what traffic?! If you're driving along on your own, or in a race, it doesn't matter because the world is dead apparently. Every so often it will breathe life into a race with a car or two, but that's it. The ONLY time you'll find a busy stretch of road is during a Highway Battle. That's it. When you're in a Circuit Race, the civilian cars will randomly drive THROUGH the barriers and suddenly smash into you as they come out, or they'll drive into the barrier and get in your damn way as they turn off! When they're changing lanes, I kid you not, they LOVE to do it when you're about to pass them! They'll suddenly veer off to be in front of you, and completely screw you up! I have even found them to turn a corner and actually come off of the road... for NO viable reason. They just swerve suddenly and come off the road. It's so broken it's hilarious. And they randomly crash too! I drive over hills or around a corner, and I find a small pile up of cars, or cars that have somehow crashed into the wall... As for the bloody racers? They're just as bad. RUBBER BANDING. Why the HELL is EA still allowing this kind of crap? You had rubber banding in UNDERGROUND 1! And that is 11 years old! I could be scraping the rear end of an opponent, I make them hit a wall, I then use some Nitrous to get away, and the opponent is somehow matching my speed. I mean, how is that possible? I know NFS is not realistic in any sense of the word, but rubber banding takes the biscuit. I detest it.  - Unbalanced difficulty. I guess this just relates to the AI again, but I feel this needs its own category. In a Sprint Race for e.g. I would be so far ahead of the competition that I could not even see them on the map. I didn't need to even think about them at all. And for the most part it would be like that in most races. As soon as I crash because of the poorly designed AI traffic, or my car decides to skid off the track, within seconds the opponents are closing in extremely fast! And because of the rubber banding, they can suddenly keep up with me. It's a joke. In other races, I've been struggling to even keep up with the racers in 1st or 2nd. I had a Mazda RX-7 with 'Street' level tuning, and I struggled to keep up with a Nissan 240SX. It was endlessly overtaking then falling back again. Eventually I would win, but not without difficulty. And what about the cops? Man oh man are they strange. As soon as I slow down they go nuts! They smash into me like there is no tomorrow. But when I speed up they trail off, leaving me to wreck the joint. One more thing: when I'm literally cruising along the street in my car, and I cruise past the Police, they suddenly go after me, claiming I'm speeding or whatever. It's useless and this just proves how messed up the AI is.  - Useless display of points. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but when you perform tricks etc. you seem to rack up 'points' for lack of a better word. They add up, but they add up to nothing. And I can't seem to figure out why there are points in the first place. There is no tactical advantage, no bonus, no unlocks for gaining a certain amount of points. It's the same when you smash a fence or hit a car and you see some money pop up for the damage. I understand you causing the 'State' money during a pursuit, but whilst cruising in free roam? What's the point in even having either come up?  - Unbalanced tuning. Let me put it this way: My Mazda RX-7 with 'Street' level tuning could OUTRUN a LAMBORGHINI. Lamborghini, do you even tune brah?  - Most pointless story I have ever come across! Again, let me put it this way: You're a typical nameless nobody with no voice or face. You are an undercover police officer trying to worm your way in to a drug-smuggling ring of 'thugs' (EA's terminlogy, not mine). It literally takes ONE race respectively to impress the top guys and you're suddely their new favourite pet lmao. And before you know it, within a couple of missions, you're already taking them all down by smashing their car's into a thousand pieces. Story writing at its utter worst.  - Also the shortest story ever. You'll complete it I'd say in 5 - 6 hours at best. If you put in maximum effort, I'd say possibly under 5 hours. What a joke.  Look, I could go on and on and on and on with this review, but the truth is, there are SO MANY NEGATIVES and things wrong with this title that I would never be able to recommend it.  After everything however, I can honestly say it has heart. This is a game aimed at the most casual audience possible. This would be enjoyed by young teenagers and children. But I'm 23 years old (today lol it's my birthday!) and I want a game waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more polished and fleshed out than this. There is some fun to be had with the driving thanks to the 'H.D.E.' and it will offer something to do for a few hours, but this will quickly dissolve into boredom. EA's more recent efforts with Hot Pursuit 2010, Most Wanted 2012 (despite what people say, it's a great game) and even Rivals (amazing first effort from Ghost Games!) is enough to keep you coming back. I'm not surprised EA Black Box was wiped away as even EA stated that they were being overworked. Here's to 2015, and hoping that two years worth of development time can give us the Need for Speed we've all been waiting for.  VERDICT: The police busted me for driving slower than the traffic. 5/10
819	1	a	PURE AWESOMENESS! Controls are a bit tricky but once you master the controls, this game gets very intense! I have WAY more time in-game than Steam shows as it is playable while offline...not many games offer offline play these days. I bought it back in the day on sale for $2.49 but would gladly pay the $9.99 standard price since the game is so much fun!
2214	0	a	I'd been looking forward to this game for a while, and bought it on a steam sale a while ago. I'd tried a demo before and it seemed like it would be funny and a lot of fun. However, it is most definitely not funny, and it's only moderately fun.   The game doesn't know how to tell a joke. Saying 'hey look, it's Solid Snake! It's Doc Brown! It's the TARDIS!' is not a joke. It's the same problem that Duke Nukem Forever had with its humor. I love a good reference, but references alone do not make a game. The gameplay itself is average, and certainly nothing to write home about, but the humor was clearly supposed to carry it, and the humor just doesn't have any effort behind it. It just tries to throw thirty references at you a minute and hope that it overwhelms you with nostalgia enough that you don't notice that there's nothing else going for it.  It might not have been so disappointing for me, had Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon not already come out before I tried it, since it did the 80's reference/parody game a lot better.

705	1	a	Insanely fun racing game, definitely recommended for everyone who likes their arcade racers with some BOOM. On the other hand, it's just a slightly better version of FlatOut 2 which you can get at only half the price. So why buy this one? Well, for once it looks a lot better than FO2 and is completely compatible with gamepads. It also has a bit more content to offer and the number of AI cars in races has been increased from 7 to 11 which causes a lot more of that chaos we all like so much.  But beware: This game uses GFWL to save. This is also what most of the negative reviews are about but it can be fixed with a small patch. You can just google it or add and dm me and I will provide you with the download. Plus, if you live in Germany I can also give you the link for an uncut patch so you don't have to deal with those ugly crash dummies.  So go on, buy it for the 2,50 bucks it costs on sale, you can't do anything wrong.

785	1	a	After years and years.... coming back to it made me feel like a kid again, that used to drive miles and miles... and never got tired of trucks along U.S. roads.  The map is just enourmous, deliveries can take hours, which makes it more fun while listening to some music, the game may look old and the gameplay can feel a little like driving a vehicle with bald tyres, but that doesn't matter because if you are that type of person who enjoys landscapes, long 'hauls' this game is a good fit.  My only cons is that its a bit annoying to stop the truck and you must follow every road procedure or else your wanted bar will increase more and more(it'll decrease when you play it cool), also plan very well the deliveries you don't want to run out of fuel right?  P.S: If you think you'll do repetitive deliveries like in ETS, you're wrong you can choose any delivery destination and any company to grab any type of trailer :3  10/10 Because nostalgia

1328	0	a	this game is one of the worst racing game I've ever played. Graphics is really bad too. First flat out have better textures than this crap.  Definitely don't buy this game!
2356	1	a	If you dont own this game and love retro 8 bit style games this is a must have!!! Hours of fun and laughs
3800	1	a	SpeedRunners is not a good consistent day after day game. However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.   Final thoughts:  - BUY THE GAME - If you want a good party game to play once in a while. - DO NOT BUY - If you want a game to play everyday.
2508	1	a	This game is amazing. Seriously. First of all, don't be put off by the 8-bit style. This is truly an open-world game, with great story missions AND side missions. The controls are great, and there are also several minigames ou can play if you're bored of the main missions. Since the game has old-fashioned graphics, lots of lower-end computers can handle it, and mine runs it very well, no frame rate drops. The setting itself is awesome, and I love finding the 80's and 90's references throughout the game, they really give a nice atmosphere. Honestly, no game is perfect, but this one is pretty darn fun. And that's what video games are supposed to be, fun.   8/10- An enjoyable experience.
887	1	a	Think of this game as the younger, try-hard brother of NFS: Most Wanted (2005).  It's like MW, but this time... - Cops don't go airborne when you hit a roadblock - It has oversteer and understeer. And everywhere-steer. - The heat system no longer makes sense - Crashing into traffic still counts as a 'near miss' (lol) - You can't get cars out of impound - It's got bad music - Physics are somewhat buggy when you do manage to get airborne - Multiplayer servers are completely shut down  ... however... + Feels like it's directed by Michael Bay  + Cool graphics! + Visible damage + Well-paced story + Not just racing; attempt to 'take down' (bust) racer criminals + Extensive list of 'modern' cars (more or less) + Minimal menu-stuffing-around  Cool game you can knock off in a short amount of time. Doesn't quite retain the feel of the edgy Most Wanted vibe, but it has its replay value. 7/10

2261	1	a	Remember all the games of the past 8-bit era such as TMNT, Contra, Smash T.V.,Bionic Commando,APB and others? Remember all of the NES chiptune and Commodore 64 wavetable music of the era? Remember all the nostalgia of 1980's Television &amp; movies? Good...because this is ALL going to come flooding back in a tidal wave of nostalgic bliss.  Now take all that concentrated awesome throw it in a blender with the original Grand Theft Auto ( back when they were known as DMA design and were better known for making Lemmings and FAR before they became Rockstar games.) add copious ammounts of tounge in cheek genuine humor a metric TON of 'easter eggs' and throw in a few cameo's from 'notable' greats and you have this GLORIOUS batch of insanity known as Retro City Rampage.  If you're an '80's kid' ( and not some wanabe hipster) you owe it to yourself to PICK THIS UP!

This will account for the extreme motion blur within NFS Undercover 2: Find or construct a table fit fit for a banquet  3: Get 1kg of cheese - the sliced pieces. Lay these out on the table leaving no spaces 4: Get 1L of Mountain Dew and pour this all over your beloved cheese 5: Now jump up onto the table 6: Start surfing across the table (whilst dabbing furiously if you generally use manual controls - this represents gearbox in game)   Enjoy !

1603	1	a	Get this game on sale, it's amazingly fun, highly optimized, quite replayable (if your memory for tracks is as bad as mine), rich lustrous graphics on PC, upbeat music, overall this game seems seriously underappreciated. This is one of the better games out there, wish there were some multiplayer folks willing to give this a try but everyone loves Wreckfest NCG these days (which admittedly has far more realistic driving and physics). But this is fun too! Especially if you don't have a G27 wheel yet. I guess I'll try and find some other players who like it as much as I do.  Pros: - Great sense of speed, as long as you don't run into anything 'non-destructible' in the environment, so it pays to learn the course. - Polished graphics, widescreen support via 'Flawless Widescreen' thanks to HaYDeN, super fun with three monitors. The nVidia 3D surround works somewhat, it's much better than EA's pathetic 'Need For Speed: Most Wanted' but of course nowhere near as good as it is in real simulation games like Assetto Corsa, Dirt or even Euro Truck Simulator (!).  - Tons of cars to unlock, althoughthey all seem to handle very similarly, the only thing that matters seems to be speed and acceleration. - The AI seems to be very 'rubber band' algorighm based, with somewhat suicidal tendencies (this could be good or bad, But overall the randomness aspect of it all keeps it fun, it's a bit like baseball -- 2/3 of the time nothing interesting happens, but when you get it right, it's a home run.  - Lots of destruction, which is rewarded, so keep a lookout for those targets and try to have your boost ready to go when you hit them. Hitting them without boost feels pretty silly, errp! - Great singleplayer, lots of crazy tracks, frag challenges with a truck, quite a lot of fun trying to hit all the destructible stuff. - Community-generated maps can be downloaded too, and there's a map editor. - Great multiplayer races (if there were any players).  Cons: - Upbeat music, easy to switch tracks. There's scanner radio chatter or in-game commentary so it feels a bit isolated from real life compared to Burnout or NFS where the audio is somewhat better and makes the game more immersive. - Doesn't seem to be any car customization, except maybe the colour of the paintjob (similar to 'NFS: Most Wanted'). - The initial logon to the server takes quite a long time, and doesn't seem to be bypassable if you only want a quick singleplayer game. - Weird controls, but seems possible to get them to work eventually. Not sure if this game even supports the Logitech G27 wheel, I need to try. At the moment, I've only played it using 'Better DS3' and a Sony DualShock3 (with a piece of elastic to hold the throttle/trigger down, otherwise my hand got tired accelerating all the time!). - It's kinda strange that bugbear hasn't provided any patch to fix the occasional crash when quitting the game, as they're normally amazingly careful about their code, you can see their thoughtful work on Wreckfest NCG.  Overall, it's well worth it, especially if you get it in a Steam sale. Would be worth every penny if you can get a few friends together and play the hell out of it without any of those loony AI doing weird stuff.
1245	0	a	I bought this with all the other FlatOut games for 5 dollars... still feel ripped off...

I will keep you up-to-date, when I have digged a bit more into it.  But you can't go any wrong with Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage. (Only Flatout 1 and 2 are moddable!)

136	0	a	(Rage)quit the game near the end of the second level after getting stuck for close to ten minutes. Should've probably just slowed down the time and taken it nice and slow, but I felt like trying to go fast. Perhaps too fast for my skill level. The (quite uninnovative and bland) tutorial also accounts for a large part of my playtime.  Might be fun with friends, but apart from that the multiplayer seems to be dead. The single player content (just speedrunning the game trying to get to the top of the leaderboards or trying to farm the achievements) also doesn't seem too interesting to me, although I like both of those things in games where the core gameplay resonates with me more deeply.  Had some problems with the movement (lots of it due to missclicks, didn't quite get used to space as the shoot button, but then again how should I rebind the keys otherwise when there are two separate jump buttons?!) or maybe I just didn't grasp the basic mechanics behind walljumping as sometimes it didn't seem to reset when I thought it would/should.   Honestly feels more like a platform for making a game / a playground rather than a complete project. Aesthetics were passable, but in my opinion nothing too special.

912	1	a	dull &amp;boring but enjoyable car racing game. predictable plot, not a whole lot that's original, races are very easy 2win on the 1st try. cops don't do much other than bang on your car and yell at you, and after a while they sort of fade away on their own. the game lets you instantly jump to the closest race, which i think provides a good incentive to make it through race after race.

2307	1	a	I saw the video about the optimizations behind this game and that already got my interest. This is the most awesome game done in years in the sense of coding and optimizations. This is what a true retro game looks like and how it is made.  Today I decided to go ahead and try the game. I was amazed at the details hidden in it. All the cool references to the old arcade classics, the different minigames and cool little easter egg type treasures. This is truly a great achievement. I would recommend this game for anyone who has played any 8 bit games and also to anyone who hasn't to see how would the best 8-bit game look and play. Also I would suggest this game to any game developer as there are a lot of things to learn from this masterpiece. Looking forward to next game from these guys.

1797	0	a	[Edited]  I've changed my mind, I don't really recommend this game, as it gets me easily bored because of unadaptive difficulty of the game. I would recommend you guys to buy the game when at its sale, since you might be a bit regret paying for it a full price. Ok so let's get straight to the pros and cons of the game.  pros: - Great graphics - Suitable physics for arcade games, (although the drifting physics is a bit sloppy, I don't really like it) - Track editor  cons: - Unadaptive difficulty of the game (it's hard from the very beginning of the game, but it doesn't get any harder each time you progress) - IMO, I just don't like the frag concept when you want to crash the other cars, and it's silly because when you're side by side with your opponent, and then your opponent suddenly activate the power, you'll get fragged (unlike burnouts). :P - A bit glitches (especially when you crash the other cars, sometimes you might just randomly crash into something, and it resets your car so it slows you down) - The game might sometimes crash for no reason  Let me get the next detail for you in the future, I'm still playing the game.

1659	1	a	I've never been a huge fan of racing games. I have enjoyed the less realistic ones like Need For Speed, Burnout, and Ridge Racer.   This game differs from the old Ridge Racers games I used to play on the PS2 back in the day. RR: Unbounded is like Burnout and Ridge Racer got together and had a baby.   Its not straight arcade racing like the past RR games and its not over the top crashing like the Burnout Series. Its a great blend of the two with some nice Drifting elements thrown in. Its by no means a cakewalk. Heck the very first track you play I had to re-do numerous times and then eventually had to go back and finish it again with a better unlocked car to get first place.   If you miss the old Burnout games (not the turd that was paradise) and enjoy the Ridge Racer series then this is a definiate must buy at under $4. Lots of great gaming to be had right here!!!

228	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a straightforward but fun physics puzzler. You've got a truck, there are things to snuggle in it, and you've got to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the rest of the world seems out to prevent that, as harmless as it sounds. The bulk of the gameplay is managing the bounce of your plush toy cargo since you couldn't be bothered to invest in a net or a closed truck bed, which is surprisingly more fun than it initially seems.  The risk/reward balance of Snuggle Truck is such that the game becomes a great deal more engaging than you'd expect. The first few levels, you'll screw up a few times, but learn what bounces where and how to recover when it does. As things ramp up, however, you start actually caring a bit about how many snugglies you deliver, until the game sucks you in for more levels than you expected. It's not super deep, but it's enough to keep you going for a session. You can also try your hand at making levels if design is more your jam; there are already tons of them out there, so you'll never be at a shortage for things to complete.  I'd say Snuggle Truck is worth it as a pick up and play title to keep tucked in your game library for downtime or when you need a good distraction. It's unlikely to rock your world, but it's hard to hate.

The only thing that is quite disappoiting is the online matchmaking, because it takes a really long time to find players, even in a private match.

2274	1	a	A homage to open world games, with the fun-to-play attitude of a modern game, and the wonderful playfulness of an retro game; both in graphics and sounds.  Also lots of hints to both old games and movies, makes this one a real joy to play; especially if youre an somewhat older gamer :D  Recommend very much!
406	0	a	Not recommend for most everyone. Recommend to those who are already big fans of racing games.  [I really don't like steam's simplistic yes/no review system; this isn't a bad game, but there are many better games in the same price range]  PROS: -Variety of cars  CONS: -Wacky physics -'upgrades' on the cars are pointless as they just improve the car. It isn't some type of loadout where gear is a tradeoff....you just buy each piece once and once your car is upgraded thats it.  -Invisible walls -Pointless weapons and poor weapon system (if you run over a box while already having one, it replaces your current item...this means the person in front will get all the boxes but at the same time if you want to save a specific item you have to dodge the other item boxes...) -Lack of HUD/UI elements (you seem to only be able to drift above a certain speed but that speed is...??) -Online playerbase is dead (no online games)

2019	1	a	THIS GAME WAS GREAT!! SPENT TWO HOURS ON THE FIRST DAY!!!!, THE CONTROLS WERE PERFECT!!!!, THE MUSIC WAS GREAT!!!, the only thing I have a problem with is that there needs to be an update with multiplayer, but other than that, ITS GREAT!!!, TOTALLY RECOMMENED THIS GAME!!!!
1904	0	a	Multiplayer doesnt even work! Server claims its been in maintainance but its already been 2 months. Unbelievable. Luckily i bought this while it was on sale at 3 bucks.
1944	1	a	  Woah! This is a good one. Only if you choose career mode. Seriously, in career mode you can unlock more game modes, not just plain driving, but slalom, exhibition, fuel and trophy mode. It gives game a second breath, makes it alive. With splitscreen - what more would you want?  The only negative is that settings are hardcoded, cannot be tweaked.
689	1	a	The game is good it really is, cuz graphics are good, gameplay is a bit easier, and the soundtracks will make you feel like a badass behind the wheel.  But its bad that Games for Windows LIVE had to exist and almost bricked the game.  I wish this game had steamworks, to make online racing on this one possible.

1838	0	a	While the game itself wasn't bad it had nothing to do with Ridge Racer. With the online component having been taken down sometimes (almost all the time) the game can't even get through the achievent check when the game starts. If you're looking for a racing game for the love of all look at something else unless you enjoy staring at a black screen telling you it's doing something (but doing nothing).
1799	0	a	Oh how the mighty have fallen...  What happened here? Why is the only racing franchise I liked now just a Burnout/Need For Speed clone?  This is as much a Ridge Racer game as Command and Conquer 4 is a Command and Conquer game, in name only, gutted of what made the earlier titles so great.   Such a shame.

1995	1	a	While this isn't a game that's based on an 80's franchise, I still highly recommend it to 80's retro junkies. There are so many 80's elements in this game and while the game pays homage to those 80's franchises, its done in a parody like way. The TMNT parody stuff is highly amusing, and then the A-Tem show up, and you'll come across the Burton verison of Batman which at the same time pays homage to the old campy tv series, and there are even some 90's elements like the moments where the game mocks Saved by the Bell. As for the main bad guy, the developer seemed to base him off the corrupt boss in Warrant's old music videos from their Dirty Rotten era. But like I said, there are a lot of 80's elements and Back to the Future is one o fthe big ones.  In short, this game has retro NES graphics, and plays like one of the original GTA games but is chock full of 80's and some 90's satire and tht makes it totally worth getting if one is an 80's/90's junkie. Th elead character, despite being an 8 bit character, is also pretty amusing.  In short, I highly recommend this game to my fellow gen x'ers who grew up watching all of those 80's films and are into violent games that are violent in an amusing way.

2269	1	a	This is my absolute favorite game of all time! Loads of stuff to do if you are bored, awesome references to retro NES era games. It's also the only T-rated Grand Theft Auto clone- all the swearing is done with symbols and there is no blood. This is exactly how you would want GTA to play out if it was made for NES. The controls are very comfortable with the Xbox 360 controller. This is the one game I would not mind buying for every system I own. The developer cares about the game and releases updates and allowed a modding system. This game also has steam cards, including the awesome Radioactive Plumber card.  The only thing that is missing is an Android port...

396	1	a	48 career races and a nice amount of cars, people keep complaining about this game, but i dont know why. its a fun mario kart spin-off for PC, and it looks and feels nice to play. You can easily get a couple hours out of this game, although, at full price, im not so optimistic about this game, but if you get it on sale for 3 bucks, i definetly recommend it.
59	1	a	This is the remake of classic game 'Death Rally' and it does all what remakes are about: better graphics and easy instalation for modern systems. Only problem in this game is death community and while computer AI is better than averange it still does not give the same kick as YOU would do! (Suomessa tehty)
2077	1	a	1-word-review: AWESOMETASTIC!  Buy this Indiepearl, free roam, story, minigames, cameos and lots of humour. This game was in development for years, I pre-ordered it from their homepage because it sounded like alot of fun, and now I can just approve this! Runs on all machines XD!
2007	1	a	I've been looking forward to Retro City Rampage for quite some time now. And now that it's been released I'm actually disappointed. Not because I enjoyed it so much, but because of the difficulty spikes that took away a lot of my enjoyment.   The graphics look sweet , there's a lot of passion in it. It's visible from the start. I also enjoyed the references to 80's games, shows and movies. All great stuff. Same goes for the music and sounds, nothing to complain here.  The missions, however, are a different story. Like any other game it starts off easy. Then suddenly missions become more difficult and even frustrating. And after that they somehow become eas(y)(ier) again. Wait, what ? There's no consistency here.  I finished the game in 8 hours (which should've been 6-7), but if you want to buy and play everything I think you can add a few hours to that number.  A decent game, nothing more, nothing less. Is it worth it ? You decide !  [Rating: 71/100]

1952	1	a	IfI had to recommend a great retro style game. This would be the one. It's like GTA 1 game married the references/pop culture of the 80's and 90's (and yes some other newer games too)! If you love the 80's and 90's you will find this game worth while giving a playthrough. With all it's 8-bit glory. Heck they have free-play mode where you have nothing to do but do what you want in this open world. Customizing the game look also is pretty radical! Be the way cool cat and get this game if you don't already have it.

1341	0	a	This is a FlatOut game in name only. It shares none of the good qualities the previous games had. The first sign I knew that this wouldn't be a quality title was the developer: Team6. If you know anything about the FlatOut series of games, you'd know that all of them were developed by BugBear Interactive. Still, I was stupid and went ahead with the purchase (only $7.49, but still, I could have bought a better game). Expecting something at least halfway decent, I got a buggy, crashing, and barely playable pile of mess dumped upon me. The physics are arguably the absolute worst thing about this game. Cars don't handle like cars, they handle like ice cubes lubed up in a messy bowl of KY His and Her jelly and butter. The graphics are just awful and look worse than the first FlatOut game, which, for reference, was released in 2004, a wopping 7 years before this pile of fail. I guess the only nice things I can say about it are the car designs themselves, the amount of them, and the amount of game modes included in the game. Other than that, avoid this like the plague. If I could get my money back, I would.  Rating: 1/10. Buy the other FlatOut games and BugBear's Next Car Game instead.

2053	1	a	If you are an 80s/90s kid you will fall in love with the hundreds upon hundreds of references to movies, tv shows, and even video games! suprise surprise!. A game that used to be planned to just be a fan GTA3 demake (named Grand Theftendo) but after it was shelved it revived as this game. The combat is pretty fun and funny at times (with mario style jump stomps) and the vehicles are pretty sweet too (from a yoshi motorcycle to kip from knight rider). Also some of the options in this game give you so much joy as some video filters can change the game to looking as if you're playing it in a Virtual Boy and even borders to look like different TVs (with one being an arcade cabinet with cool stickers of instructions). If you are an old school gamer that loves the times of 8-bit, chiptunes, and nostalgia then you definately need to pick this game up. so, are you a bad enough dude to play Retro City Rampage? I should hope so.
3105	1	a	Fast-paced, hard and fun. This game is amazingly fun with friends. It's time for a speedy run!
203	1	a	This title screams 'started life as a mobile game.'  It's mindless fun and probably worth picking up on sale and you want that kind of experience on your desktop. The graphics, music and level design are all competent. My main complaints would be the inability to distinguish obstacles from harmless background art and the 'baby fuzzy' mechanic is a little undercooked. I don't see myself going crazy unlocking all the medals but if you're a relentless completionist there's a lot of reasons to go back and replay levels. But if you just want to play all the levels it's certainly within your grasp, nothing about the game is frustratingly impossible and the learning curve is reasonable.

1008	1	a	PLUS  Very Arcade - for me thatÂ´s fun. You can use your keyboard or a controller - both works very well.  Clean graphics.  Nice Soundtrack. Gives you a feeling of speed - you seem to flow.  They use real persons as actors - gives the whole the right cheesy feeling.     MINUS:   The pictures on STEAM are quite misleading - thereÂ´s no blur at all.  No damage model nor do you take any damage - although you can also crash - but  either you go frontal into a pillar of concrete or you only are informed of it.  Not much to do. Story is predictable. You infiltrate the racing scene as a cop in order to catch some car thieves.

1697	0	a	Looks like a pop glamour FlatOut + Burnout without good style, good music and good controls. Cars physics is so arcade, that you CANT properly control your car in any cases. RESPAWNS AFTER CRASHES IS A HORRIBLE THING. You can be respawned and instantly crashed by enemy. And enemies respawns in the middle and YOU RESPAWNS LAST. Also enemy crash cam is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ because your car position after it IS A SURPRISE - you can hit the wall or you can STAND STILL! Map design isn't good. Sometimes some walls are destroyable, BUT SOMETIMES NOT! After the cool object destruction with slo-mo etc YOU CAN HIT THE WALL WITHIN 1 SEC! Better play FlatOut OR Burnout. Mixing this games isnt good idea.

723	1	a	I LOVED this game when it first came out. That said, I loved ALL of SCS's trucking games throughout the 18WoS series. The game has decent control, great economy and company management and brilliant truck ownership detail. Before I get ahead of myself, however, here's a real list of pros and cons to this game:  =PROS= - Decent graphics: This game may be old, and it does show it's age, but the graphics still look alright, if a little dull at times. - Good control: This game is no ETS2, but it definitely feels right. Its a bit slick at times, but you have to remember you are driving a heavy truck. - Company management: Manage everything from the trucks, to the drivers, right down to the contracts and companies. - Truck AND trailer management: ETS2 fans will like this... You can BUY TRAILERS. Just a little bit of extra management and a bit of extra content to buy.  =CONS= - AGE: This game shows it's age... alot. The sound is low quality, the graphics are dull as stated before... it's an old game. - Bugs: This game has its share of bugs and issues. I personally have problems with the fov not setting properly. I have to manually set it for it to look right. - Fatigue: The game's fatigue system is realistic to the game time, but the distances to game time are not realistic. I woke up at the edge of a city, and by the time I got to the other side, I had to sleep again. I suggest turning fatigue off in the config files. - Scenery: This game also shows it's age in scenery. It's a bit dull and repeatitive.  I enjoyed the game, and I still go back and play it occasionally. I would reccomend the game to anyone who likes other 18wos games, or trucking games in general.

Retro City Rampage is a spoof of all the old good games rolled into a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 scenario. You'll see parody's of Paperboy, Leisure Suit Larry and from the front cover it's quite obvious, Back to the future. I haven't finished the game yet put it's pretty good so far, the music is pretty cool too. a spoofy 8 bit GTA at it's best.

523	1	a	A great arcade racing game, definitely one of the best racers on PC. Even after 7 years since its release.  Lots of game modes, good physics, (almost) bug free, small learning curve, AI is challenging, brilliant graphics (for the time) are the fortes of this game.  Also, you still can play this ONLINE, the servers are still alive, I've just done it a moment ago.  The only (actual) cons are no LAN mode, and GFWL, but you could just simply went through it easily (only took me 10 mins to configure my account). I also wish it has Steam achievements, Live achievements is a nice thing to have but i can hardly show it to anyone..  Overall this deserves a: 9.5/10

1726	0	a	I got this game as a part of humble bundle sale, so I don't really mind paying for this rubish. However, If you're going to pay for this game, I implore you to look elsewhere.   Ridge Racer Unbounded (RRU) is a sad case example of how a great publisher like NAMCO BANDAI games has lost its identity in the contemporary video gaming world. If I would like to play Need for Speed (NFS), then I'll play NFS games. If I would like to play Burnout, then I'll play Burnout games. RRU is the very definition of identity crisis. It borrows the 'career' mode of most recent NFS, but the concept end up as very linear and boring with no story lines. It borrows the destructible environment from the Burnout series, however, it does not borrow enough to make it slightly fun. Unrealistic drifting was always fun factor and also the trademark of RR series, however it is undeniably toned down in an attempt make the game more realistic. As a result, RRU racing mechanics become something that is neither realistic nor unrealistic. In short, this game is just not good from any aspect it try to sell. The developer copied aspects from other games, yet failed to make it any good. Worse, they also droped many fun aspects which make the original series fun. This game is basically a fail reboot, akin to the fail reboot of the Fantastic Four (2015) film.    PS: NAMCO BANDAI games!!! If you, as a corporation, has allow any developer to bring your flagship RR series to fall this low, then how the mighty have fallen indeed.

Doesn't play anything like the rest of the franchise and the team that made this did it a disservice. It's like Blur played with Micro Machines driven on ice and everything is boxy and glitters. Several of the characters are obvious jabs at annoying celebrities, but they bring nothing interesting to the table. After playing and enjoying all of the previous games in the series back to back, I played half of one track of F3 and couldn't stand to finish the race. Every negative review of it is spot on.  This series peaked at FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage in terms of graphics and full controller support (finally), but was handicapped by requiring Games for Windows Live. Hopefully if/when Bugbear finishes Next Car Game, it'll be the FlatOut we've always dreamt of.

518	0	a	It's a great game but I can't recommend it because it doesn't run out of the box, and doesn't tell the user what's wrong.   To get the game to work on Windows 8.1 and 10 you need to manually download and install 'Games for Windows' from the official xbox or microsoft site. If you don't, the game will not start and not even pop an error message. If you installed 'Games for Windows' before, or if it was installed by a different game already, you won't have this issue.  Windows 8.1 has been out for well over a year. I cannot recommend a game where the necessary 5 minute fix to the installer has not yet been done.

1243	0	a	For me this is simply not a Flatout-Game. The whole feeling is different, the driving feels like another racing game, but not even a good one. I enjoyed the Zombie and Destruction Mode for a few rounds but that was it for me.
2107	1	a	I love dis game. There are so many reasons why you should play this game. To name a few, there are old-school references and many graphical settings. Any old-school enthusiast would love this game. Some references are parodies of things such as Doc Choc( Dr.Brown from BTTF). If you're looking for a cheap retro style GTA-like game, you've come to the right place.

198	1	a	This title screams 'started life as a mobile game.'  It's mindless fun and probably worth picking up on sale and you want that kind of experience on your desktop. The graphics, music and level design are all competent. My main complaints would be the inability to distinguish obstacles from harmless background art and the 'baby fuzzy' mechanic is a little undercooked. I don't see myself going crazy unlocking all the medals but if you're a relentless completionist there's a lot of reasons to go back and replay levels. But if you just want to play all the levels it's certainly within your grasp, nothing about the game is frustratingly impossible and the learning curve is reasonable.

It's a fun little game that'll keep you busy for a bit, but you'll only be able to play in single player mode, because NO ONE plays online. I've tried many times, and its not recommended to keep online mode on in this game because you'll lose the ranking you get working your way up in story mode.  Its not worth the $10. Now, while I haven't played the original or mobile game, I can say this version of the game sucks. I give this game a 3.2/10

1738	0	a	The game looks pretty I can't deny that.   However it suffers from a rubber-banding AI (which I am concinved sometimes outrightly cheats). The result is that even if you come first in an event it often feels more like you got lucky rather than earned it due to skill, tactics and learning the track.  If your not very good at driving games don't buy this, it is not for you as it does not have an easy setting, the first car you get is at best mediocre compared to the early AI cars.  Don't buy it at full price, do consider getting the original Grid instead as it is more satifying.  I'm giving this a no recommend as it is a game with such limited appeal and steam doesn't let me score it 3/5

866	0	a	Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.  Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.
3072	1	a	 Early Access Review
1596	1	a	Picked this up as part of the Namco Bandai Humble Bundle (which included all the DLC for the game), and I have to say, so far I've found it pretty dang enjoyable. After investing a large chunk of time into Split Second on my PS3, Ridge Racer: Unbounded felt immediately familiar, but different enough to make it stand out on its own. Split Second was super fun as racing games go, but I found the handling on the vehicles to be... not necessarily as advertised based on their stats. RR:U vehicles seem much more true to their description. Although a word of warning: A high drift score is, in my observation, not a sign that a car handles well under drift, even if it has a decent handling score. Rather, the drift score seems to indicate the willingness of the back end to swing out, so a car with max drift almost wants to drive in reverse after every single corner. These high drift cars require a delicate touch, and you'll end up facing the on coming field a lot until you get the subtleties down.  Continuing the Split Second/RR:U comparision: While I loved the destruction in SS, merely placing in many SS tracks required that you hit every single destructible. And to win, you often needed to having the timing of using the destructibles down just so, rather than just relying on your skills as a driver. RR:U gives you the option to destroy, and it's definitely encouraged both by adding to your score and it's potential for shaving a little off your lap times. And of course, it's just fun to do. But in the end, placing and winning comes down to what you do behind the wheel. There will be moments of frustration, like when you're in the lead and some AI jerk three positions back starts a chain reaction accident, costing you your hard earned spot at the top, but even that feels fun and exhilirating, and makes you want to try again. Gotta say though, the SS soundtrack was better IMHO. RR:U has this very generic bassy electronica that I would rather have than be without any music, but it definitely doesn't evoke anywhere near the same kind of emotional pulse pounding rush that the SS tunes did.  Many will complain about the death of the online server, and I can understand that. But when I just wanna pick up and race, I don't really care. My only gripe is that the game was never updated to stop looking for it, so you waste more time than is necessary when the game first loads up, as it looks for a non-existent thing. It'd be nice if they came back and fixed that, maybe rewrote things so that the player community could host servers so we could still play online. But meh.... it's a small thing in my book, and I'm not a ginormous fan of online gaming to begin with, especially when play is strictly competitive.   Havent' played with the editor yet so I can't speak to that, but I think it's a cool feature. Again, many will say it's nearly useless given the demise of online play, but I'll be interested to see what I can come up with anyway.  Overall, as long as you're not looking for multiplayer mayhem, I definitely recommend it, though you might be well advised to pick it up on the cheap, or as part of a bundle. Lots of single player fun to be had, as long as you don't go in expecting the world. Give the demo a shot.

1772	0	a	There's a lot of people saying that this game doesn't live up to Ride Racer standard, but is similar to burnout.  Now, I'm a fan of the burnout series, having played it on the PS2. This game is nothing like burnout either.  The environments in the city that you race around are pretty good by racing game standards, but it becomes quickly apparent that they are consistently re-used, and there's not much variety in them. Plus, nearly everything is destructible, which means there are virtually no hazards to avoid other than flat brick walls at turns.  The mechanic used to 'frag' other racers is just terrible. It seems as if it's trying to be like burnout in that respect [RE: takedowns], but it's so badly made. The only way to frag seems to be to rub up against the back bumber of a car, and magically they get taken out. There's no timing either, so unless you're in direct contact with a car [no pit manoeuvres here], they won't be affected.  To top it off, it is full of obnoxious dubstep music, which i'm really not a fan of.

2625	1	a	Alright, SpeedRunners is a fast-paced racing game that looks nothing like (and plays nothing like) a normal racing game. It blends elements from platformers and other genres seamlessly... kind of. The game has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs, but it's been improved considerable since I first reviewed this game and it's a much closer to flawless. There's a lot of glitches that I originally complained about, and I think the dev's edits and fixes to them has been phenomenol and deserves it's own mention. There's still a few issues, mostly with lag, but that's hardly a fixable issue due to poor ISP's and everything. That being said, the game is still an amazing game. I would play this 24/7 if it didn't have it's road bumps (and, as you can see, I've still played it religiously). From what I've seen, the 'Story' mode is mainly bug-free, and if you can't handle the lag from online players, you can always play with AI and friends in a custom lobby. There's a built-in solution for every issue I have found, so in reality, by the end of this, a LOT of people might be saying 'SpeedRunners is an amazing game and you're wrong!' and I'd agree, especially since it's much more tolerable than other games *cough* Monstrum *hacking*, and it runs at a very smooth framerate for a game of this size and quality (most games I can't play in a resolution above 800x600. This game I certainly can). Finally, I say buy this game for 3 main reasons: it has surpassed many MANY more games on the steam store, it's no longer Early Access, and it's an amazing game already. who wouldn't want to race their friends in a cartoon world of a guy in a unicorn suit, a cat, and a detective dog? I certainly do.

1205	1	a	I don't know about you, but I just tried this game and I really enjoyed the experience.  This is not a fast paced driving game. It's more than just accel/brake, and turning. You have to adjust tire pressure, trigger 4x4, use the winch, and more. It's about trying to sort obstacles, and deal with different types of terrains. Not for the short tempered. You have to be really patient sometimes to pass through a course...  I like the in-game music, and graphics are awesome. I do like the fact your car gets all dirty and muddy and doesn't remain cherry clean like it used to happen in many old off-road games back then. Also, runs wonderfully on my 2007 PC.  It has took virtual driving experience to a whole new level for me. I really recommend it to anybody looking for that!

989	1	a	It's not too bad, people who are expecting something like Most Wanted or Carbon would have been disapointed when it came out i guess. Plus it had a fair share of performance issues. For what it is, it's not that bad of a Need for Speed game but just a few pointers:  -Challenge Series is not available for Steam edition. But minor loss. It doesn't impact the main career mode at all. -While the Origin verison comes with the Challenge Series, the Origin version is horribly unoptimised. No matter what the Origin version will run at a significantly lower frame rate than the Steam version, no matter the settings. Not sure why, but it just is. A few threads on the internet from long ago mentioned the EA Download Manager (now Origin version) had performance issues, so it's a semi known issue.  -Setting affinity to a single core or just two cores can help smooth frame rate a little, but difference is minimal. Game runs fairly well on todays hardware, not as well as it should but it's playable for sure.

It seems to have identity crisis and it doesn't seem to be able to choose - or it wants to be NFS or Flatout. By not establishing itself - it competes with those titles while failing to deliver on par with them. I would definitely prefer a racing game without essentially useless (unpredictable) destructible environment and weird physics (on one occasion my car went into air after driving over knocked sign or some debris) or game similar to Flatout, but not this hybrid. At first - I was enjoying this game, but after playing more I will definitely not recommend this game as it is less than sum of its parts.

But as a homage to the early Grand Theft Auto games it just isnt as fun as the original. The missions seem like you are just running around doing random things and running around murdering everyone and trying to run from the cops just aint what it used to be.   It isnt a terrible game there just wasnt really anything there that could hold my interest. Let alone want to make me come back for more.

702	1	a	Racing + Carnage = Happy Rincewind! =P  Its just so satisfying to rip into a fence, power poles, and your opponent's cars... And Flatout is a game that knows its more fun to hit things on purpose instead of by accident ;-)  I originally owned this game off Steam, hence the low number of hours played.

1706	0	a	I eat arcade racers but I could not stomache this one. No option to change control mapping, and a vibe that screams this developer was late to the genre; Wearing an ensemble that loosely resembles something you like, but nothing like what it should be (Classic Ridge Racer) or could be (Any other decent arcade racer). I bought it for $1.74 and I'm still dissapointed.  Silver lining was the original Ridge Racer GTR lookalike is in the game, playable immediately. So at least I had a couple good memories resurface there. These memories promptly had me uninstall the game
5874	1	a	It is fun, and can get a bit frustrating.   *UPDATE MAY 2016*  A few years went by, got myself a gaming pc, and a controller, and started to play this again. I now remember how fun this is, very smooth, nice levels, and i like the OST. Bought this back when it was still Early Access, and TinyBuild has not given up on this game.

The only reason critics didn't rate it higher was because there isn't a number that could be big enough to accurately measure how good this game is. This is a game that should be owned by all people.

You can only become better by practicing and when everybody is good at the game, it's an amazing experience. Or you can annoy the f*ck out of your friends by playing way better than them. It's always fun when they rage and call you a hacker instead of admitting that you are way to good at the game.   Aaah... nothing better than watching your friends suffer.

This is just like the original GTA's but stripped down to the fundamentals, which is completely fine because the fundamentals are ALOT. The gameplay is smooth and works completely fine on a keyboard or Game Controller. There is alot of cool stuff to do while your just roaming around in Theftropolis. The city is small but not so much so that you get bored and have nothing to do. The music is crazy awesome and very nostalgic. There are heaps of references from the classics like Megaman, Sonic and Mario which is absolutely awesome, and the comedy is on point. Definately worth what you pay, and I actuallly think that this game deserves a solid 10/10 This game is a must play for anyone.

1220	0	a	Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts.  What went wrong?  Gameplay has lost this 'catchy' spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.  Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all.   I like SPEED Mode it has something good :)  The rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(  To be honest : Flatout 1 &amp; 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...
1391	0	a	Do NOT buy this game, it might say Flatout in the name, but it was not made my the same developer. Not that a different developer could do a good job, but in this case it is horrible. I bought this game back when it was new, because I blindly assumed I would be getting Flatout 3, not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ arcade racer made by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ monkeys.  Buy all the other Flatout games, 1 &amp; 2 they will give you entertainment. The original developer Bugbear was even so dissapointed with the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Flatout 3 that they are now working on a REAL Flatout 3 called Next Car Came:  http://nextcargame.com/

1813	0	a	even at the low low price of Â£2.99 with all the DLC I kinda felt like I had wasted my time and I know at this point I've not even cracked the 1 hour mark.  This is not Ridge Racer. smooth chaining of drifts rarly happen and it just does not have that same feel of speed. Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.  Also I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.  I was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game. This even at the hugly cut price was just crap.  This game tried to be a more edgy and aggressive game to go against other similar titles at the time and IMO Just buy Burnout PC its a far better game and looks just as good.

625	0	a	Ultimate Carnage is probably what second game should've been from the beginning. Comparing to the FO2, they made graphics look really good. They fixed water, tuned picture saturation, removed bad post effects, added normal mapping, improved overall detailing of the original tracks... and it looks seriously good.  The bad thing is that the core gameplay and physics are taken directly from FO2, which is boring BurnOut wannabe (unlike the original game). It seems like they actually tuned handing a bit, so the car is an actual car now and not a paper box on a wheel, but I bet it will get worse as you progress.   Honestly, I didn't play much, just a few cups, but it's just enough to say that the game is better than FO2, but still not good enough to get positive. It's funny how this game has 83 versus 92 of FO2. I guess that is related to GFWL used in this game, but you can create local account and I don't really care about multiplayer. So after playing 2 classic FOs, I tell you go play the original one. That one kicks yass.

2560	0	a	At first it seems like a fun little arcade racer game. You start off slow and then it ramps up the difficulty and speed. Unlocking the tracks and cars is a normal game mechanic of racers but it also lacks a key feature and has the dreaded racing game stereotype features as well.  Not having a map/course layout in the HUD is not really excusable, having to remember the tracks and half the time there are 'shortcuts' and half the time they are blocked is quite annoying. Also, BBR has the ever so popular 'Oh you are kicking our butts.... Let's have unlimted speed boosts to catch up' syndrome. If I'm winning by half a track it's because I'm doing well. I shouldn't have the whole pack catch up within seconds of the finish line! Whomever thought that was a great idea is the same person who loved playing Madden on the SNES cause they both be cheaters!  I really do want to recommend BBR but the minor yet annoying flaws make me not want to try and complete the game.

While it has some of the elements of the original, it is a completely different game. Did I have fun? Yes. Is it graphically awesome? No. Does it have a decent story? No, itâs horrible. Replay Value? No.  I would suggest getting this game when it goes on a cheap sale as it takes about 8hrs or so to bust through it. For fans of the original, don't go into this game with expectations as you will be disappointed.

1649	1	a	There are a good few hours of fun to be had here! It's as simple as a racing game gets; you go as fast as possible, drift around corners and smash others out of your way.  The game looks great, plays well (once you get used to the physics that is) and the soundtrack works well (despite not being my cup of tea generally)  The track creation and publishing is a great addition, and I'm sure that it will create many hours of extra play. I love it when developers pull that off well. Portal 2 is so much better for it, and this is too!   Pick it up on sale, and don't expect a serious game people.

1727	0	a	So, this here is a decent racing game. Handling's pretty good, action-filled gameplay, excellent track editor. Sounds like a good game, so why's it a downvote?    Ridge Racer  : Unbounded (keyword: 'Ridge Racer') is a spin-off, spun too far off track from the Ridge Racer project, as in not in the main series, and not made by the actual developers of Ridge Racer either mind you, but Bugbear. Yes, those people. Flatout. Wreckfest. What is a spin-off? Probably depends who you ask, but to me it's a game that strays away from the main series, maybe experimenting a little bit by changing up the main gameplay formula. And hoo boy, let me tell you... it sure changed.  That's my main problem with Ridge Racer: Unbounded, it strayed WAY too far off from what Ridge Racer really is. Ridge Racer is a high-speed, nitrous oxide filled drift-racing experience, and this game really just doesn't capture that timeless Ridge Racer feeling. The drifting is weird in comparison, it's definitely not as fast-paced and you're driving like a maniac. Now don't get me wrong, many a person could probably describe the way you drive in Ridge Racer games as a way a maniac drives, but in Unbounded you take it to the n-th degree by pulverizing your opponents, literally just smashing them off the track. It really, really just feels like a Burnout game.  It'd probably do great as a Burnout spin-off. But then again, EA games would probably never allow this much creative freedom. So again, it's not a bad game, it's just that it really, really feels weird knowing it's named 'Ridge Racer', because it's so much  but  Ridge Racer. Do I recommend it as Ridge Racer? Absolutely not! Do I recommend it as a game? Sure, it's alright.  I have to admit, it's a decent play once in a while, so play it if you're not expecting Ridge Racer.

1818	0	a	This game could be really fun. Could be. For starters, server's dead. So you load in after a slightly annoying wait while the game fruitlessly tries to connect to the server. So no multiplayer, that's fine. I can forgive that, I love singleplayer games. But to get into the game and spend over an hour trying to beat the first race, hell, even place in it. The drift mechanic is so damn finicky that I end up either spinning out or fishtailing at every corner. And to know that the devs abandoned this years ago...  Thank God I got this from Humble Bundle.

1432	0	a	DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was under the impression that Steam retailed reputable games, to later find out that this is total garbage, I have owned this game for a long time and have only been able to play it for a few hours, I can understand the lack of support because there are no micro purchases in the game for steam to make extra money off, I personally believe that steam should show some integrity and dignity by refunding or compensating the people that bought this game and were dissatisfied with the end product, Steam Credit would be acceptible,  The Fact that steam would sell such an inferior product goes to show a lack of integrity and poor customer support to the people who, at the end of the day, support them.  Be wise with your purchases people, just as with many retail/sales people/companies, they will promise you and tell you everythin you want to hear, but as soon as the transaction is done, any misleading information, inferior quality product will be left in your hands and you will be told that it was your fault for not researching the quality of the game or services.  If this was an automobile, It's a LEMON and just like car dealers, Steam does not care as soon as you drive off the car lot, they got their $$$$$ why should they care about you anymore?

997	1	a	Honestly, this is probably one my favorite games of all time. The graphics are fairly decent for the time, there is a good amount of cars, and for once, it's a NFS game with a partially decent storyline. I don't know why I love this game, I just do. The only problem I have is that gamepad support is abysmal. The sheer force of my thumb lying on top of the Joystick is enough to make the car always lean left. Also the AI is awful.  TL:DR Pick it up on sale if you are afraid of a bad game, don't expect perfection. 9/10
1157	1	a	A pretty fun, technical game. It not for those that enjoy really fast racing but rather for people who like taking a slow approach to getting round complicated obstacles.

And another things that made me like this game is that this game has a lot of easter egg of some famous movie like   TMNT, Rambo, Back to the Future, Robocob, and many more   The things that i don't like in this game is i feel some stages are too hard to finish, even though in the end i finished them. But overall this game is great I would rate this game 8/10

It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.

No other alternative, no LAN option, nothing. Dont support Bugbear and dont support Namco, they are the worst companies.

1611	1	a	In Short: If you are a huge fan or racing, adrenaline or destruction and the 'Burnout' series (which other than paradise, didnât make its way to PC), you will love this game. Definitely worth the pittance that it costs, fantastic game with a lengthy career, amazing track editor and plenty of Michael Bay to keep anyone happy.  One game mode in particular known as 'Frag Attack' is very similar to the 'Road Rage' events found in Burnout, except you can drive through buildings... and cars burst into flames in slow motion if you're an adrenaline junkie this is definitely worth your time.   You can even create custom events of all game modes with a fantastic track editor. A basic, but entertaining example of this is:  - Create a track with a lot of open space (this is done easily with pre-set assets) - Set game mode to frag attack. - Plant Petrol stations and explosives everywhere. - Let the destruction unfold.   Aside from this the game features a relatively difficult set of career events ranging from your bog standard racing to destruction based racing and drift events/time attacks, set out in districts of a city with the objective of which is to earn enough points to 'Dominate' the district - this is done by placing podiums, drifting, hitting objects, taking down opponents and smashing through buildings. If you like a challenge you should definitely give it a shot.   Closest thing to Burnout since Burnout. 10/10

117	1	a	My God what an amazing game for speedrunning! you should just try it for even a 'casual speedrun'!
1885	0	a	Would not buy. All of the devs must have been left handed as the default controls are WASD to drive, and they cannot be changed, this must be the first racing game ever made which is like that. It also CTDs when using 1920x1080 resolution

680	1	a	Best. Racing. Game. Ever. Well, since Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed anyway. The physics are incredible, from the weight and handling of the cars in general, to the way they drive on various terrain types. The audio is amazing, changing the sound from hard revving engine and squealing tires on asphalt to dirt and gravel hitting the undercarriage when off-road. The AI drivers are a nice mixture of fairly easy in the beginning to downright dirty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s at the end. The 122 hours I have on record at the writing of this review are all actual play hours (vs. the game just sitting, open and ticking). If you like racing games at all, this game should not be missed. Make sure you have a game pad or wheel. Keyboard can be done with reasonable success at first, but unless you have a gaming keyboard that allows more than the average simultanious key presses, you're going to hit a wall (pun intended) about a third of the way into the game.

603	1	a	This game is imho the best attempt to revive the Destruction Derby franchise in a decade. More games have attempted this succes formula, but more often than not the quality of these games is crap. Here it's fun to ram into vehicles and destroy the environment while the racers crash out of the cars. The racing mechanics are decent enough given the nature of the game. There's minigames too which are a fun change from the derbies. All in all a fun game that shouldn't disappoint.  Warning: you need to create a WindowsLive account in order to play, which is annoying but takes about 3 minutes.  PS: Don't think of getting FlatOut 3, which came out later. It's really bad.
1629	1	a	It's your average modern racer but with a track builder. I never got hooked enough to try that feature though. There's nothing wrong with the game, but it isn't anything outstanding.
1513	0	a	Unplayable. Obviously was not finished. Couldn't even navigate through the menu, objects floating in incorrect places, unclickable menu items. Never got a chance to play. Tried installing several times, thinking it was me, definitely not. Brings shame upon the Flatout franchise.

2074	1	a	Where to start : Pro's ; If you like me grew up in the age of the mega drive and the SNES then this game is what you wished you could of played, orignally a lovingly crafted demake of a certain open world game (GTA) after a legal case the name was changed and portions of the game were to however this detracts nothing from the game it's self. Packed full of missions and challanges A great retro sounding soundtrack ( what else do you expect )  Also you get an MS DOS prototype version and the orignal SNES rom with the purchase of this game fully compatable with game pads.  Con's  None that i can think of

724	1	a	18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul is a Trucking Simulator. You start off with a truck, which you will use to pick up and drop off delivery jobs you choose to accept. From refueling your rig, to stopping at weigh stations and getting some sleep, 18 Wheels of Steel is a pretty decent sim. Even on Easy mode, you need to be careful of how you drive and make sure to obey traffic laws, such as turn signals and stop lights. I started playing it thinking I would put in the bare minimum just to get a taste for the game so I could write about it, but found it to be mildly addictive. I have yet to complete my first haul, but I am confident I will get there soon.   18 Wheels of Steel does not have a playable tutorial, so you will learn on the fly. From what I understand of the game, the rigs you drive are based on real life trucks, so there is an element of realism the makers have brought into the game to give you an immersive experience. There are dozens of cities across North America, each with their own unique layout, making some of the deliveries an interesting challenge. All in all I thought it was a pretty fun game. If you like Simulators, this isn't a bad one.

1825	0	a	[Edited]  I've changed my mind, I don't really recommend this game, as it gets me easily bored because of unadaptive difficulty of the game. I would recommend you guys to buy the game when at its sale, since you might be a bit regret paying for it a full price. Ok so let's get straight to the pros and cons of the game.  pros: - Great graphics - Suitable physics for arcade games, (although the drifting physics is a bit sloppy, I don't really like it) - Track editor  cons: - Unadaptive difficulty of the game (it's hard from the very beginning of the game, but it doesn't get any harder each time you progress) - IMO, I just don't like the frag concept when you want to crash the other cars, and it's silly because when you're side by side with your opponent, and then your opponent suddenly activate the power, you'll get fragged (unlike burnouts). :P - A bit glitches (especially when you crash the other cars, sometimes you might just randomly crash into something, and it resets your car so it slows you down) - The game might sometimes crash for no reason  Let me get the next detail for you in the future, I'm still playing the game.

When i played it on my PS3, i was kist 8-10 so i didnt understand a thing. Lol. Alot of good and old cars like Dodge Charger R/T(1970) and SRT-8 and Dodge Challenger. Nissan skyline, BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini and much more. You can aslo customize your cars wich is my favorite! You can also customize your cars, which is my favorite! Good Sountracks too. It also was my first PS3 Game and i got the PS3 Early when it came out, still have the PS3 and the Stearing Wheel i used. Good times. 8/10 for being an old game and i played it at PS3 arround when it came out. had alot of fun in free roam :P

514	1	a	Not too many racing games grab my attention, this one is an exception. Leans heavily into the arcade side of racing games, it has gobs of debris and destruction everywhere as you drive (kinda like how they would lay out food in front of Jerry Springer guests for them to throw at each other). This game really succeeds at keeping you on the edge of completely wiping out at all times (challenging) yet not becoming frustrating. The races really can get your heart pumping esp the ones in the 'race class' cups.

490	1	a	The best racing game I've played, on any platform, in thirty years of gaming. The cars have weight, the graphics are clear and crisp, the environments are realistic and destructible, and there are enough game modes, single- and multiplayer, to keep you hooked for a long time. According to Steam stats I've logged up 400+ hours. 'Nuff said.

882	0	a	At the time of this review the price is currently Â£16.99 ...... whoever ramped up the price that high should be ashamed of themselves. This game is worth no more than Â£0.99 in sale.  Shame ...  Could have been up there with the Trials games.  It appears like the devs have lazily ported an app version of this game to the PC.  When booting the game, a config page is displayed, but selecting my resolution of 2560 x 1440 meant that all textures in the game were so garbled and messy I had no idea what was being said/displayed.  I read a fix for this which says to start the game at a low res like 1024 x 768, then use the in game resolution changer (NOT the 1st config page) to set the correct resolution. But, the textures don't seem to be optimised for higher resolutions like 2560 x 1440. The clunky way of clicking through every screen resolution before hitting the right one is quite annoying ... was it really too much like hard work to add a drop down selector?!  Not made for PC. Should be sold very cheap to reflect its value to the PC gamers.  See screenshot for textures issue - the textures display fine at low resolutions:         Monster Trucks Nitro&nbsp;
67	1	a	Death Rally is one of those legendary games from the past, back with a blast! Just like back in the day, it combines high quality graphics (genre considered) with fluid gameplay and a simple reward system that makes it oh so easy to hop in just for a few more rounds!  The only critique I have is for the menu system. For some reason I keep finding it behaving just a bit different to what I would expect. It is a small thing, and does not interfere with gameplay, but the UX design has not quite hit it's mark there.

1353	0	a	No. I can't belive they would price this game at $30!!! Ok here is why this is a negative review: It isn't anything like the other Flatout games, since it was a different developer, And it is very laggy. Also no one makes any multiplayer servers. Also it is really hard! So don't but this game! Go with the other Flatout games made by the other devs. Because this is not what your looking for!!
2033	1	a	THis game is like a retro style of GTA, but more cartoony and 8-bit, plus plenty of throwbacks to old games.  If you're a fan of retro games as well as a GTA style, then this game is a good buy.

1934	1	a	F1 Race Stars is, essentially, an F1 version of Mario Kart. The worlds are just as cutesy, the hazards just as interesting. I think about the only difference is that your cars can take actual damage and require 'pit stops'. You can play it online with friends or in a career mode. I purchased it on sale for $3, and have yet to regret my decision.  8/10. Purchase if on sale, I'm not sure I would recommend it so strongly at the full price.

2187	0	a	Retro City Rampage tries to do the whole GTA/Bethesda game/Ubigame thing of being a big open world that you get familiar with by driving around a hub, and that's a pretty modern convention. It also tries to do this while clumsily weilding about what they will assert is a very retro playstyle. The thing is, this ends up being a worst of both worlds scenario, strung with boring and repetitive combat scenarios spread across a pretty uninteresting city, with little motivating you to follow through with the dozens of side missions that show up on your radar. When I did try to do them, they felt like they were repeating the worst parts of the main campaign, which itself was largely juvenile in tone and design. They throw a million expendable cops, thugs, and soldiers your way, with a hundred invisible checkpoints and an infinite supply of lives so that you die a million times (97 by the end in my case) without losing a lot of progress. And I can't help but feel like that blind jab at 'difficulty' is what they believed would make their game justifiable as 'Nintendo Hard'. RCR is less a game and more a hamfisted, halfhearted, and mostly unfunny collection of cheap references and gags.

2135	0	a	One of the most overhyped games of all time. Most of the game is 30 second snippets of better games from the 80's. Until you get to the end of the game when the levels go on FAR too long. The difficulty balance is off too. Again, most of the game is a cakewalk, you can ease through it with no effort. Then you get to the last 10 levels or so (out of 64) and the game just becomes a bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ sandwich. The dam level of TMNT, for example, is considered one of the worst of the NES era. So of course this game makes you do it twice. Road Blaster is one of my favorite games of all time, but the end of the game forces you to do it 6 times, wrapping up with a boss that you can only beat with luck. He has a specific pattern, but he 'cheats' in that sometimes his missles go where you are going to be, not were you were when he fired them. Sometimes, but not always. It's a violation of the boss pattern and had me throwing my controller and screaming profanities by the end of the night. The graphics are cute for about 5 minutes, then you realize you can't really tell what the hell is going on most of the time. The chiptunes are pretty good, but once the loop is over, the game won't start a new song unless you trigger a cutscene or get in a car.
1133	0	a	5/10, this game is not worth the money, or the time. it is not 'true-to-life' at all. 1C should get their Ish together and make a decent game or gtfo. How do you expect us to play an offroad game where you can not go offroading? All you can do is follow the racetrack, that's it. physics are crap, suspension is not realistic by any stretch of the imagination, the sounds of the engines are too similar. Looks like they rebooted one of their old offroad games with fancy graphics. that's the only good thing about the game...the graphics.  My advice: go download rigs of rods (for free), if you want an offroading game where you can do some offroading.
733	1	a	One of the first games to tap into the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Citizen's Band (CB) radio craze, '18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul' is basically a movie-length car chase and a pleasantly insipid slice of late-'70's Americana. The tissue-thin plot has good ole boy pals running a load of fosters cross-country on a tight deadline while trying to avoid an assortment of less-than-bright cops.   The player jumps into the part of 'the trucker', a heart-throb for all white-trash trailer dwelling women, to a tee. SCS Software does an impeccable job of bringing to life the role of the backwards southern lifestyle. The soundtrack was an instant classic, combining folk, bluegrass and country, and leaving the player with an urge to recite the lyrics for days after. As you can tell by my gamer handle screen name, I love this game. I do regard this video game as an all time favorite, VGA material? Certainly not. But who cares. A must play for all serious game players.  2/10

696	1	a	I've only played 2 and a half hours of this game, But i am making this post to help anyone having problems playing this game with a controller like i had. ( At the bottom of this past i will leave a review of the game. )  How to fix:  1. You will need a program called better DS3 if you are using a ps3 controller. ( Not sure if the program will work with PC controllers. )  2. You go to the opions and find controller configeration, Click that menu and once you have done that, At the top you will see keybored, Go right and leave it set to Xbox 360 controller,   3. Enjoy the game  I really just gave up and thought that there was no controller support for this game. But after looking at what i wasn't doing rigt, I felt like a jackass. I hope this fixes any controller problems you are having.   Might as well review the game down here of course.   This game is easily a 9 out of 10 game. Being one of the last good flatout games, It really stands out on gameplay. It's a upgraded version of flatout 2. And it is worth the money. As long as you like slamming cars off the road and looking at damaged cars, This game is for you. The flatout complete pack is on sale right now. The only one out of the pack that sucks is of course, Flatout 3. But i think you already know that game was a failure from the start. But i haven't really got down to the pros and the cons of this game yet because of the fact that i only have 2 hours of gameplay from this game. So far it is a blast playing it.

1586	0	a	Alright wow, where to begin with this game? Whooo weee. Alright lets get started. The... Pros? To be honest, Its hard to really think of any, I got barely into the game before it started crashing so I guess this is off the list.. The Cons. Basicly this game is poorly put together, using the most generic looking models, the most generic music, the most generic AND I KID YOU NOT GENERIC sounds Ive ever heard, No joke that like 'Chink' noise you hear from like I dunno any youtube intro back in 2010? its all over the place. Graphicly this game is hideous, Everything is flat and rusty and low res. Lighting might as well be not there at all as its all this ugly yellow. Anything besides race mode crashes your game, first time I started racing the game dropped to 0 FPS for about a full 3 seconds only to shoot up to 80. and I am running a brand new high end GPU.  If you see the game don't get it, want a destruction derby style racing game? Get the first flatout.  Flatout don't buy.
2233	0	a	This game is really annoying to play. The layout and map is so forgetable that I can never find any shops where i need to. Also, if you want a vehicle, you have to run around for an hour just to find a car you want. Not that it matters though since essentially every car in the game is exactly the same. Retro City Rampage is an overall boring and aggrivating game. And not in the fun way.

Big replayability as you have to achieve TONS of records. Top-down perspective is nice, but camera fails at times and makes winning the race difficult. Does it stand out? No, but if you like similar games you will enjoy this one.

729	1	a	This game is an excellent precursor to the euro truck simulator series as well as the upcoming American Truck Simulator from SCS. It has few minor issues that may deter many gamers from giving this classic title its due.   The cities are not fleshed out. They are essentially hubs to drop cargo and get new assignments. The Fines for stopping too far over the line at red lights seems rediculously high, and the braking distance for a bobtailed tractor is a little far, but oh well. The meat of this game is spent driving miles and miles of bland landscapes sharing the road with what appears to be all students on their first day of drivers education classes.  Having said all that, however, I still enjoyed playing this game and finding out by trial and error what we were supposed to be doing, other than delivering and picking up cargo. If you enjoy simulation games, this may peak your interest. If you are more of the Need for Speed type, pass this by.

2582	1	a	Charming little top down racing game. The cars all have their own element in which they excell. Turning, top speed, boost, etc So you just pick the car you think will be best for the track/tournament and go for it. It isn't so that you will have a big advantage if you have the right car. The bots are pretty good racers as well. Sadly this game is pretty short. So pick it up when it is on sale.

398	1	a	Not long ago I came across a pathetic remake of ReVolt, it was even insulting to see a beautiful game like revolt copied in such a pathetic way.   But Super Toy Cars, is something else. It's fun to play. The tracks are Re-Volt-ish style, but are original.  Pros: I like the idea of building your own tracks and sharing them. The driving is very responsive, and definitely more realisting than some other games on steam. The soundtrack is really good, even though there are only a few songs.  Cons: Sound Effects are missing on some spots on the tracks. Multiplayer is there, but unfortunately nobody plays. The graphics may be improved, maybe adding more objects that drivers can interract with on the tracks. I think also that if not improved the price should drop significantly.  Even though the game can be improved I enjoy playing it, I'll definitely play until I unlock all the cars, paints styles and achievements. I can't wait to play this game with friends, I'm sure it will be a lot of fun.

However, the final game has some bugs that just could'nt be there. The collision system with some objects is weird. I thing is all about rectangular colliders and that's it. Also, I get errors in the HUD that could'nt be there... For example, everytime I finish a race I get two HUDs that overlap each other, present same shortcuts for different functions... It's just bizarre... Moreover, my achievements are being tracked/sync in Steam.

14	0	a	It kinda worth the sale price if you have some history with the 1996 version of this game. I wouldn't recommend it to new players though.  It's a rather boring race game with few tracks and half of these tracks are not enjoyable to play because of tight curves. Full upgraded cars don't make you overpowered, even against lower level races, so winning a race (or making money for upgrades) is rather luck for getting the right items from boxes than skill or hard work. Also, you can restart any race without penalties, which make the game less challenging.   This would make this a neutral review, but there is something that make the game worse. You can't beat the story mode. The game crashes when you beat the last boss and the story, which is not even a good story, has no end. 4/10 for 90's players, 2/10 for newcomers.

609	1	a	This crazy physics destruction derby arcade racing title provides more evidence that its developer, Bugbear, might hate cars almost as much as it loves making games about cars. The numerous ways the vehicles in this game can be dented, smashed, crashed, crumpled, and shredded may well make petrolheads weep tears of dismayed sadness, but then, that's the fun of it. The entertainingly visceral physics engine, that sees cars and environments alike torn apart violently at the slightest touch, provides a fascinating look into what the Burnout games might be like if cars were continued to allowed racing after the otherwise fatal takedowns.  It refines and expands on Bugbear's previous FlatOut game exponentially, which makes it slightly infuriating that there are unforgiveable surface blemishes on an otherwise impeccable arcade derby racer. The inclusion of Games for Windows Live has basically all but guaranteed that the online community for this game is dead as a doornail, but perhaps worse, in my opinion - and certainly more invasive - is an absolutely wretched soundtrack. Seriously, I don't think I've come across a worse use of licensed music in a videogame. The cheap, faux-metal pop-rock that found its way into this game's soundscape is utterly painful, and I had it switched off almost immediately. I don't quite understand how these music choices were made, save that they were the only they could properly afford. At any rate, the music is abominable, and while I must stress that, that is my opinion, I will also stress that my opinion is, in the case, unquestionably correct.

1124	1	a	Offroad drive is a real offroad game. it isnt traditional racing, it is time trials and u can turn ghosts on to see opponents while playing. When i say real offroad game i mean you have to use winch and watch the pressure so you dont break cable, you can turn 4x4 on/off and lock in hubs to get diff types of traction when/where you need it. It also has prettty nice mud and effects for vehicle interacting with it and making tracks and ruts and it affecting the physics of the vehicle. Mud washes off if you drive thru a clear water river or creek and can get muddy again. Overall fun game but different and captures real offroading pretty dang well and its obvious the ydid their research on this game. Its a shame the market for it is kinda niche cause they did a good job on it.

2129	1	a	Retry City Rampage DX copies the core gameplay loop of classic GTA, with lots of arcade style minigames added, along with references and inside jokes. Some of the gags had me laugh out loud, while many others had me cringe. The main storyline is deliberately bad, bogging down in collecting arbitrary parts for a time machine over and over again.  So while this is not a great game, I can't help but give it thumbs up because I honestly had a good time for the 6 hours it took me to finish. There is enough variety and unexpected challenges at every turn to keep you interested, and the whole look and feel is rather authentic.  This could have been a much better game if the developers had taken the storytelling aspect more serious instead of relying on the audience going crazy over excessive referencing of established franchises and indie games. It's definitely worth the price tag, and if you catch it on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it. You won't regret it.

769	1	a	This is one of SCS Software's oldest games. As such, it is nowhere near as good as their later offerings like Euro Truck Simulator 2. But for its age, this is a pretty decent game. You get the whole United States, some of Canada and some of Mexico. Steering is a little rough compared to ETS 2, but OK. The graphics are nowhere near as sophisticated as they are in ETS 2 (they resemble the graphics in Bus Driver, an SCS game of a similar vintage to this one). But for the era that this game was made, they're pretty good. Physics are not as good as ETS 2, but they're acceptable.  If you want a truly great truck simulator, buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. But if you want something a little more 'old school' and want to whet your appetite for the upcoming American Truck Simulator, you could do a lot worse than give this game a whirl.

2249	1	a	Retro city rampage is a great throw back to the 80s/90s and other things like that with a classic old school look, fun gameplay and aprox 9 billion refecenes from back to the future, sonic, minecraft, batman, metal gear solid and so much more. The only bad thing about the game (in my opinion) is the last levels because they are just to hard that you may break your controller/keyboard. This is also on: Steam, PS4, PS3, PSVita, Wii, Wii U, 3ds and xbox 360 (I'm not sure about Xbox one but it might come out an it). It's good, has an 80s themed sence of humor etc. and has a really funny breakfast ceral ad (the breakfast ceral is not real)
3108	1	a	Just recently getting into this game, I'll never be good enough to beat the veterans online, and maybe not even my friends - but I still enjoy every second of it.  Great stylized graphics (seriously, just watch someone else play and pay attention to the level artwork in the background). A catchy big band soundtrack that's totally unique. Snappy gameplay that allows you to get better, inches at a time.  The most fun you can have with this is to start playing along with three friends who haven't played before. Figure out the game mechanics together and accept your defeats gracefully.

232	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a relatively fun casual deliver x stuffed animals in x time game. It has a nice amount of content, levels and an awesome editor meaning the community can make levels giving an unlimited amount of playable content. However, the game itself has too many minor errors making it not worth the hassle and here is why:  Pros:   â¦ Decent Graphics and Sounds (These are alright for what it is, they are not amazing but fit the game) â¦ Medal Concept is Great (Unlocking medals for completing x goal in a level is nice as it gives you something to do in the level and adds a nice amount of content to the level) â¦ Gameplay is fun and works with minimal glitches (Driving through the level and delivering x stuffed animals in x time just works. It is pretty fun if you are the type that likes to be number one on the leaderboards and must complete all level challenges. If you donât like playing a game for leaderboards or completing challenges, then you probably wonât find this as fun as I did) â¦ Easy to 100% with Achievements (Has a nice number of easy Achievements which are mainly unlocked by just using features of the game and completing the game) â¦ Steam Trading Cards (This is always a bonus) â¦ Each level design is unique (This is nice as every level feels different and no two levels feel as though it is a repetitive copy of the last level) â¦ Decent level editor (Amazing level editor that allows anyone to create a level and upload for anyone to play. This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game) â¦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game) â¦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons youâll get your $5 worth)   Cons:  â¦ No Steam Cloud Storage (Iâve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I shouldâve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesnât make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldnât be on Steam) â¦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a â+moreâ menu. The â+more+ menu doesnât lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once youâve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didnât mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the â+moreâ menu) â¦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels donât always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesnât explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game)  â¦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you canât actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why itâs even called DLC) â¦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You canât close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing) â¦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work) â¦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable) â¦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you canât actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing) â¦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesnât act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesnât function properly) â¦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they donât function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is âTestâ which shouldnât be the case)  Overall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I canât recommend this game. I canât recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.

2481	1	a	Imagine an 8-bit Grand Theft Auto clone and you've got Retro City Rampage pretty much thought out. If you took a GTA protagonist and had them take a Forrest Gump-style tour through 80s videogames and cinema, the result would be exactly what you get here: A lot of thievery, swearing, ultra-violence, explosions and generally just a complete mess. But hey, you get the high score. The odd thing about RCR is that it's generally more fun then any of the games that inspired it, and manages to be much more forgiving in difficulty besides. Accompanying its relentlessly entertaining and reference-laden campaign is a series of bonus levels, including rampages that test just how well you can do what a GTA player does best- tear â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. There's also plenty of unlockables, including a number of extra playable characters, a huge variety of weapons and vehicles, and that chiptuny goodness you expect from one of these retraux titles. If you like virtually ANYTHING from the last, like, 35 years of nerdery, you're likely to find something in Retro City Rampage that makes you smile. I know I did.

889	1	a	One of the most underrated series of nfs. It has lot of cutscenes, and nice storyline to follow on. Only two problem makes this game underrated than it has to be.  First problem is the ridiculous difficulty on some races such as I need to beat SLR Mclaren with EVO. But it is not that big because you can get pinkslips as you clear other missions and easily collect money and buy a better car. The biggest problem is physics which breaks the game and makes player difficult or sometimes almost impossible to control the car. But overall great game with big open world, Which is the last nfs with STORY, COPS, TUNE UPS, and FREEDRIVE. See what happened to NFS these days. They are just burnout series with supercars. No more storyline, unique tune ups, and thrills which really suck.  ê°ë§ì í´ë³´ëë° ë½ì¤ìí ê·¸ëí½, ì¤í ë¦¬ë¼ì¸ì´ ì¢ì  ìµê³ ì í¹íì ë°ìë ê²ìì¸ë° ê±°ê¸°ì ìì ìë¯ êµì¥í ê°ì íì ì©ì ë¬¼ë¦¬ìì§ì ë³´ì¬ì¤ë¤ ì©ì ë¬¼ë¦¬ìì§ì´ íìì ì¤ë¥´ê²íì§ë§ ê¸°ë³¸ì ì¼ë¡ ë½ì¤ìí ëëê³¼ ì¤íìëê° ì¢ìì í ë§ì íë¤.

Also buyer beware - you must have an Xbox Live account to play the game at all or it simply won't launch.  Yet another game that requires you to have an alternate online account on some external website or program... I'm beyond sick of that.  The game itself would be fun but I'd recommend just getting it for xbox and not to bother with the pc port. People who say skyrim is a bad port should try this, this is just flat out terrible (yeah, bad pun)

It feels as if someone received instructions on how to code and design a 'racing game' via telephone, while having no prior experience in creating such.   Avoid.

1590	1	a	As with all Ridge Racer titles, the game play is fast paced, arcade-like, explosive fun. Once you master the art of drifting (some cars are much better than others), you can start scoring huge drift scores and unlocking new cars, new races, new districts, and finally city blocks for the track editor (that allows you to make your own race track and share it online for others to race).   You can even drive an American Truck and ram the police, and some of the time trials are nuts taking you through loop the loops, and insane angles. Despite all this, I found the game a bit too easy to master. If you liked Driftopia, you'll probably love this too.   Personal Rating: A bit too easy, but nonetheless good solid fun.

893	1	a	It does what any good arcade racing game does best. Amazing picture perfect graphics which take very little power to run, has free roam and a ton of awesome cars to choose from. The story mode is just what you need it to be,crazy chases, wrecks or just good old racing with long tracks spanning miles on end. The physics aren't as realistic but this is an arcade game, a great one at that.

2549	1	a	I was unhappy with it when i experienced crashes during carrer mode, making me repeat lot of races over and over. But apart from that this is really fun game, what i like is that even AI drivers make mistakes like crashing into walls when taking turn badly, spinning out on oil, or crashing under pressure from other drivers and player, sometimes they take shortcuts and in other lap they will not etc. Its great to see that, unlike in some other games where AI doesnt react to what is happening on track, even some triple A games dont have that so that is a big plus, makes racing more interesting.  It takes few races to get the feeling for the camera position, speed differences from class to class so you will at the final tier crash into walls more often until you get the feeling for the speed. You can select different cars in same class, some have better handling others longer nitro boost, higher max speed etc. and you can really feel the difference depending of the tracks you are driving on. Tracks itself are beautiful, have a lot of variations with shortcuts, hard turns or long straits, and traps like exploding, water or dreadful oil barrels that bring some tactics into racing (where one oil barrel in wrong time can make you lose few places in the race at the end). At the starting line in box you can refil your nitro and fix the damage on car. While you do damage your car you wount be eliminated for it if you total it, your car will only be slower until you fix it. Too bad the game doest have online MP cause that would be really a blast to play against other people. It offers a lot of replay value and for the price i highy recommend it.

1407	0	a	Flatout 3, looks visually better than Flatout 1 and Flatout 2, but the controls and gameplay are utter rubbish. This game is nothing at all like the first two and should never have been released. Complete waste of time.
1240	0	a	The biggest waste of 10 minutes ever.  No, seriously, is that supposed to be a part of the Flatout series?
1871	0	a	F1 Race Stars is  incredibly  shallow. For your full price you get a grand total of seven tracks with very little variation outside of them. It's a very fun splitscreen experience... that's better suited for a console. F1 Race Stars took plenty of chances but they didn't pay off and for full price you're going to be playing a flawed game that could have been more fun. This is made worse by the fact that the online is dead and the game has trouble reading multiple controllers at times. If you have four guys who'd like to play it and can get it really cheap on a sale, I'd say it  could  be worth a look at, but F1 Race Stars doesn't do anything for anyone outside of that small, situational demographic and that's just dissapointing.

1012	1	a	If you like your racing games to have even the slightest realism to it, skip this. This is a traditional acrade racer. The cars all handle the same, like they are on rails. The graphics have aged badly, the soundtrack sucks and the acting is terrible. BUT, if you can get over all that underneath is a pretty fun arcade racer. If you are a fan of Rage Racer, Over Rev, Daytona USA or any of those style games, be sure to give this a go. Especially for the price, you can't go wrong.
2482	1	a	Great!
1946	1	a	I say this game is pretty decent, but one question: Is it me or the mobile version gets more than this version?  I feel like this game needs more maps. Compared to the mobile version, it seems they get like, as said in the app's description, 40 tracks? What's this game, like 12? Sharp turns in this game is difficult, usually making the bots overtake me. But for the mobile version, it seems you can 'drift'? And the updates for this game! When was this game last updated because in the mobile version it got updated in 2015! Basically, what I'm saying is that the PC version has way less than the mobile vesion and here's a list of things from the mobile version that should be in the PC version:  -More tracks (I don't want to just play the same tracks over and over again.) -More 'characters' (I don't really care about this much, but who knows? Maybe I like characters that just wear only mask?) -Gamemode (Maybe? It was just something from the mobile version.) -Better multiplayer (???) -More powerups (I just wanted more lower chance to get good powerups because the amount of red balls thrown at me.)  And just because this cost money, don't give: -Energy (Just absolutely no.) -Microtransactions (Sure I want more tracks but please make some of the tracks free.) -Levels (I think the 1000CC and such are fine. What would levels bring? Unfair advantages?) -Power gates (It cost in-game money and it seems like a pay in-game money to win.) -In-game currency (As stated above, pay to win. Maybe. It depends how the IGC will work. If you can earn it easily. It doesn't cost money. If you can use it just for cosmetics. Who knows?  And that's it. I know this really isn't a review but hey. I think this game is pretty decent.  Please note that this is just my opinion.
2516	0	a	Hours of fun and time spent at breaking past levels that keep you crying. Would have been better if the missions are better designed. Definitely not my type of game. Buy this only if you are interested in the Metrovania theme with retro gaming elements. The game crashes at random points despite updates that have claimed to fix.  10/10 would remove it from steam library

1637	1	a	Wow, I though Bugbear were defunct, pity they relinquished rights to their Flatout series as Flatout 3 bombed. As for Ridge Racer Unbounded, if you like racing games with a difference this is yet another game well worth purchasing. Excellent graphics, with some destructible environments and a challenging race series. You score points to upgrade to new races and new cars. The game has enough variety to keep you entertained for quite some time.

1796	0	a	While this game offers it's couple of hours of fun, that fun is not worth the 10 euros you have to pay. I got this on sale so it was okay, I suggest you wait for a sale too if you are fan of flatout-style racers.  Forget realism, forget polished driving controls. This is arcade. This is not even remotely Need For Speed And honestly, feels like a bad ripoff of FlatOut series (probably because they hired the same developer..).  This game soundtrack is nice fast-paced electronic music, but having to listen old overplayed skrillex tracks is somewhat unbearable. But the music fits the speed and pace of the game, I'll give some points for that.  4/10 Buy FlatOut instead.
806	1	a	I started playing trials with Trials HD on the Xbox arcade where I would build my own tracks and try and beat top scores over and over.  This edition of the game is great and feels good when doing a perfect run. The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.  I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.

This game is NOTHING like the originals, the car handling is dreadful, the graphics are awful and the gameplay has none of the originality and all out fun of its predecessors. Avoid this title at all costs. To call it sh*t would be an insult to faeces. Instead buy the first three games and mourn the fact that we'll probably never see a sequel as good.

Meanwhile you will use lot of props to power up your character or stop the others. The thing that set the game apart is the 2D physics engine, the sleekness and polishness in the interface, and the good balance of the game. Also: it has a great kind community that, in my experience, tend to help the noob with words of advice, instead of bashing on his head :)

1696	0	a	I've been a Ridge Racer fan from the beginning. I purchased a day 1 Playstation together with a copy of Ridge Racer and put countless hours in that game. Winning from the 'devil car' as the final achievement was wonderfull. Even though the game had only 1.5 track(s) did not matter, because the layout of the track was simply perfect. Than came Ridge Racer revolution (ridge Racer evolution was a better name) and again I played that game countless hours. Getting the 'devil car' and 'angel car' took a big effort, but the game simply played as the perfect arcade racer.  Than Namco released Rage Racer and the series slowely started to loose it charm but still it felt like a Ridge Racer game. Ridge Racer Type 4, released after Rage Racer, included a remake of Ridge Racer 1, now with slightly better graphics, and 60fps.  Ridge Racer 5 for the Playstation 2, which included a remake of the orginal track, was the last game I bought in the Ridge Racer series, until this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't let the name fool you, this is NOT a Ridge Racer game. It doesn't play as a Ridge Racer game and it doesn't look like a Ridge Racer game. This is Flatout abusing the name of Ridge Racer. If you enjoyed Ridge Racer, than stay the hell away from this game.   I think I will hook up my old PS1 to play some proper Ridge Racer now.

1092	1	a	This is a fun arcade racing game. Graphics may be somewhat dated, but it looks OK on maximum settings. Very blurry and cool, you can feel the speed, especially in first person view. Music is okay, too (not terrible enough to turn it off).  The game picked up my gamepad without problems, which is quite an achievement (I've got a cheap Chinese gamepad, and not many games support it out of the box).  Cons: - it requires fiddling to run on newer systems. I am playing this on a Windows 8 PC, needed to set compatibility to Win98, and then it started in a 640 by 480 resolution. This brings back memories. Of dinosaurs and cavemen.  - draw distance is meh, on maximum settings cars manage to pop out of thin air a bit, especially noticeable when driving on a straight highway.  Recommended if you like arcade racing with physics of Disney's 'Cars' cartoon. (This is neither a bad nor a good characteristic, the game not realistic by any stretch of imagination, but it's fun at the same time, so why not.)  You will hate it if you don't know how to set up compatibility, or if you expect it to be a driving simulator.   Update for Windows 10: compatibility is fixed, doesn't require fiddling anymore.

1778	0	a	Worst. Ridge Racer. Ever.
1699	0	a	In an attempt to make Ridge Racer more like Need for Speed Underground and the Burnout series Bugbear have created a game devoid of anything remotely interesting, getting neither their strong nor interesting points right. Less than the sum of its parts Ridge Racer Unbounded (aka Ridge Racer in name only) oscillates between a lukewarm 4 and 5 out of 10. It's a perfectly functional game and anything but horrible but I somehow wish it was horrible so it would have a single memorable ingredient.  Everything you'd expect is sort of there; various generic game modes with sports car pastiches. A bit of drifting from NfS Underground, a little bit of Burnout's car combat, a bit of the destructible environments from Split Second, etc. all of it assembled robotically and efficiently without any creativity, passion or talent. Racing-light is the name of the game - less calories, no taste. For a racing game supposedly based on high speed and drifting neither is engaging and fun enough to keep you interested past the ten minute mark, the bland music doesn't help.  Apparently there also used to be an online multiplayer mode that is now non-functioning. Honestly I'd much rather invite my friends to an office meeting than Ridge Racer Unbounded so this point almost works in its favour but you have to admire the audacity of the publishers who really went the extra mile here, I applaud you.  In short, avoid. It's mindboggingly forgettable and generic, so much so my mind already blurs the select few hazy memories I had of playing it with memories of other, better games. A monstrous waste of time.

501	1	a	FlatOut 2 was a great followup to the original FlatOut. It didn't take itself seriously and had nice graphics and style to boot. In 2007 BugBear decided to tweak it, repackage it and call it Ultimate Carnage. It's basically the same game but with some added modes and upgraded visuals. There's better textures, water, debris effects and reflections on the cars themselves. On the audio side the soundtrack has been replaced with lesser known tracks but they're mostly good although it gets repetitive after a while.  This is kind of a tough game to judge. It's fun, entertaining and has a lot to like but if you've played FlatOut 2 before then you'll feel more than a little sense of DÃ©jÃ  vu. It has the same cars, same tracks, same game engine and even the same physic glitches. It's pretty much FlatOut 2 with some new paint and chrome which is more than a little disappointing. Fans of the series would eventually get a FlatOut 3 from a different studio but the less said about that the better.

2082	1	a	(Beta review) This is probably the greatest video game I have ever played. If you like a game with great humor, 80's and 90's references, 8-bit graphics with smooth, action packed gameplay, then this is the game for you! I am SO hyped for the sequel, Shakedown Hawaii! (Actual review) When I look back on every game I have ever played, I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that Retro City Rampage DX is the best video game I have ever played. I bought it on my 3DS a few years ago expecting fun, and I received a world of amazing, unbelievable content. This game has a very special place in my heart for its characters, story, humor, and everything else. I hope it wins something someday since it brought tears of joy to my eyes (really). The sequel will be undeniably amazing as well,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNmYyb7dCdQ

1930	1	a	Wow, that was a lot of fun. I recommend this game. Good controller ability or play with keyboard, your choice. Playful and light game environment. The light is green, go! 
1639	1	a	Made by Bugbear the creators of Flatout, and is a nice looking racing game. I've only made it through the first couple of races, and i like it already.
12	1	a	****Possible spoliers****  Quick PRO/CON list for anyone who doesn't want to read too much:  Pro: - Top down driving with good camera and controls. - Brings back memories of Death Race 2000 and Carmageddon - Variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock. - Graphics, for the kind of game, are clean and do the job despite being a bit dated by today's standards. - You can win a race by placing first (duh) OR by taking out the competition - and they occasionally take each other out. Or sometimes you.  Con - 'Meh' voice acting. Blame 'Tex'. - Weapons and vehicles unlocked through picking up parts. - Can't save money between races. - Some races inherently unfair. - Pick-ups during races come in sometimes hard to destroy boxes. This is due to a poor design of the main weapon that 'autofires' when it sees fit. - Randomness of pick-ups makes it easy to win some races, and frustrating to win others. - Unless you have a lot of armour and/or a really fast vehicle you probably don't want to be in front of anyone at the start of a race. Only mines fire to the rear and you only get 3 - and they never replenish during a race.  An ok top down racer with an extremely limited number of tracks and a rather dull story. But the game's not about the story as much as the race and at least most of the actual racing was fairly fun.  By the end of the game you'll be sick of driving the same tracks over and over and over. I was also very tired of whatever Tex mumbles. Tex looks like an oversized George Lucas, by the way.   Graphics are good, clean, and the vehicles and scenery look pretty good. The cars are responsive, especially if you work on the handling stat, and there are a number of extra weapons you can eventually unlock, level up and use - but only one 'special' at a time. Some are way, way better than others. The shotgun I found to be almost useless, for example, while the rocket at level 1 was far better than a level 9 shotgun. Unlock cars and weapons by picking up parts during races.  The 'shadow man' shows up once in a while (via phone call) to offer you advangtages on a per-race basis for a cut of your profits.  The end race against The Stig .. er I mean The Adversary ... was annoying and completely luck based for me. I'd have lost again if it wasn't for lucky nitrous drops at the right times, and a lucky bump that sent The Adversary into the wall just before my last nitro kick to the finish line.  This game os a 6/10 as it is. MAYBE a 7/10 if you really like this genre - and I mean *REALLY* like, as I like it but not enough to be generous and give it more than 60%. Still, gotta recommend it as it's not terrible.  It could have been better with the simple addition of longer, better tracks to race on. I didn't find driving the tracks in reverse to be much good for variety, although they do feel different in reverse. I don't mean longer as in more laps like the 42 lap marathon race without weapons - I mean slightly larger tracks. Some of them are so compact that you're at the final lap (Note that the final lap is usually the 3d, sometimes you're in a one lap race so that's SUPER short) before you've played much more than 70 seconds. Yup. 70. Seconds. Some one lap races last 20 to 25 seconds or so. Yup, takes longer to spend your earnings.  With better design decisions this could have been a 10/10 for sure. I'd pay for a simlar game that has no instant repair or ammo pick-ups during the race. It could have stats that can be improved for the driver and vehicles that are upgraded with parts you purchase with cash from your winnings. You could unlock different parts by making contacts or spending cash. Make it roguelike with perma-death *IF* you actually die when the vehicle is disabled and it would be even better. Improved ranking system, multiple places to race, larger vehicle selection, ability to mount weapons facing EITHER DIRECTION... *sigh*. I'll shut up now, y'all know what I want.
402	0	a	Super Toy Cars feels like a game that escaped out of early access with a reassuring smile and a lot of fundamental issues unaddressed.  As I was playing through it I kept having to double check that it was indeed fully released and not still undergoing development, with so many prevalent bugs and a general lack of basic racing necessities popping up as if I had somehow been slipped a beta build in place of the final game. But Super Toy Cars is indeed 'finished', or at least unlikely to receive any major future updates, so we're left with the game we've been given and it's a rather disappointing end result to something that started off with such promise.  Super Toy Cars wants to occupy a space between kart racers and somewhat more realistic arcade racers, with the handling and track designs of the latter and the zany power-ups and silliness so often associated with the former. In reality it adheres almost entirely to traditional arcade racing, with the inclusion of power-ups being rather unnecessary and pretty useless on the whole. There was rarely an instance where launching a missile or dropping an oil spill gave me any noticeable advantage, occasionally being a slight annoyance but usually something I forgot was even there.  I think a lot of this though has to do with how spaced out racers inevitably get over the course of a race. After the first lap I would often be so far behind or ahead of everyone else that there wasn't any chance I'd be able to hit someone with a power-up even should I want to, and even in the rare instance I was in the middle of the pack it so often felt like I was the only one driving. It's a mystery to me how so many racers can exist on such a small track and remain largely entirely separate from each other, but it definitely makes the game feel rather isolating when the only reminder that you're racing against someone is the fraction in the upper corner of the screen.  Again this is linked to another issue in the game, that being how unbalanced the different cars are and the laughably inept AI racers the game pits you against. Drift is by far the most important stat in the game, so much so that it means cars with a high drift rating will almost always be far and away the best vehicles in the game, rendering all but two or three cars impractical to try and drive. After only a few races I'd settled upon the Panther and found myself dominating every race despite driving like an absolute madman and crashing into things on a near constant basis. If the game starts out easy it trickles down to a virtual void of challenge, as I blew through race after race wondering if I had somehow been caught in a loop and wasn't actually moving forward in events.  Keeping with the trend of every issue being intrinsically linked to another, that feeling of consistent repetition is the result of an abundance of redundancies in track designs and event types. There are only twelve tracks in the game, and at least half of them feel almost interchangeable with one another, with the others being iconic mostly for their backgrounds and not any interesting track layout. The handful of different event types again double up on each other, with checkpoint and single lap time trials feeling nearly identical and the only alteration between elimination and evade being the obnoxious mines placed along the track. There's already a noticeable lack of content in Super Toy Cars, but having so much of it feel so similar to each other and stretch on so long somehow seems worse than if the game had just been half as long.  The monotonous grind of repeated events robs the game of any sense of progression. You aren't looking forward to new tracks because there aren't any; you aren't looking to improve your skills because the AI is never challenging you. There's no desire to buy new cars as so many are useless, and upgrades are needless and so inexpensive you can be fully upgraded after only a half dozen races or less.  And then there are the usual hallmarks of unfinished games: glitchy audio, constant collision issues, hitting invisible walls and clipping through solid ones, random frame rate drops, and a rather embarrassingly bare bones online mode (which doesn't even support private lobbies or inviting friends).  I like what Super Toy Cars is going for, and I think with a few more months of development it could have become a lot more than it did, but being ostensibly finished it feels pointless to hold out hope that its problems will ever be fixed, or that it's even in a state that could be remedied with a few patches. I'm not sure if it was pushed out the door early or its developers really thought it was finished, but the end result is still a game that's in need of attention it won't receive.

687	1	a	I've played 100s of racing games, but none keep me coming back to it like this one, my steam time does not justify the real game time i have on this game, I've spent 100s of hours on the 360.  If you want a fun racing game, with damage, this one is for you, i find simulation racing games very boring. I can play flatout for hours on end and not realise time has passed.  Probably the best destruction derby type of game on the PC.  Note: for people moaning about Games For Windows, you install it from googling 'Games for windows' takes you to an xbox site. You don't need to sign it, just needs to be installed then once you are in the game, you click okay once. No big deal.

1103	1	a	A fun low-budget multi-player arcade racing game similar to Mario Kart.  Surprisingly, it features many game modes, which not always involve racing per se. The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: 'EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA&lt;3' (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!  Unfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.  Buy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.
538	1	a	As a remaster of FlatOut 2, and being a FlatOut player for over 10 years, this game feels refreshing arcadey and VERY nostalgic.
2251	1	a	This game was everything I hoped it was. The developer threw in toooooons of easter eggs from games and movies of my childhood. I'm in my 30s and this made me feel like a child again.  I've typically been against the GTA style games, but this changed my opinion of them. LOVE THIS GAME!
1294	0	a	Wow, just... wow. I know people are saying this game is bad but you have no idea until you've played it. I honestly don't know what they're smoking to be charging Â£24.99 for this. It's just awful. You know a game is bad when half the recommended reviews are negative reviews.   The graphics, especially on the cars themselves are terrible, even for 2011 and on top of that it runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Ultra and I couldn't stomach what I saw when I turned the graphics down a few notches. I don't even think it has a licensed soundtrack which is like, 70% of what makes any racing game good (for me, I'm well aware the percentage is a lot lower for most). They should erase this game from existence and call Ultimate Carnage FlatOut 3. Unless you buy this in a bundle with the others don't ever let this one near your library. You will get a headache like Michael Flatley was dancing on your face.

356	1	a	And the long anticipated day has finally come, Super Toy Cars is fully released! Originally released through Early Access in March, Super Toy Cars has gone through months of updates and polish and is the better for it. It's definitely one of my favorite racing games on Steam, if not one of my favorite games on Steam, period.  The mechanics of this game are more influenced by physics than most other kart racing games I've played, and though it takes a little bit of getting used to, is very enjoyable once you get the hang of it. I'd highly recommend checking out the guides I've written to understand things like  the drift system  when you get started. It took me maybe two hours before I got proficient at it, though with the refinements to the system since I picked it up back when it was first available you'll probably get the hang of it much quicker.  Track design is pretty good, though the art for such is not as inspired or unique as something like Mario Kart (which of course has a long history of games to draw on). It's certainly by no means bad though and will keep you going as you progress through the game. Car design (and  here's the relevant guide on that ), on the other hand, is much more interesting, drawing on a number of real life cars, and providing lots of cosmetic options to keep you from getting bored. The cars also handle very differently and provide their own unique challenges, though they do fall into a few general categories. The difference between the light and heavy cars is far more pronounced than it is in other kart racing games, and some cars can really keep you on your toes!  The career mode is probably where you're going to be spending the bulk of your time. There are a large number of challenges to complete and it will probably keep you occupied for 5-10 hours.  One of my guides  goes in depth on each game mode so I'll spare you the details. Completing each one will take some work, especially in later levels, but is definitely do-able.  This game has both local and online multiplayer, with support for up to 4 and 8 players, respectively. Unfortunately I don't have anyone to test the local multiplayer with so I can't say if the game handles splitscreen well (for example, in the recent Mario Kart 8 people have noticed reduced frame rate with four players). Local multiplayer is also where you can choose any track or mode to play singleplayer. Online works well though, with no bugs in the netcode to speak of. Hard to say how many people you'll find online at this point, though I don't expect the player population to be able to match that of AAA racing games on Steam like Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. I have played online a few times and found it quite fun. There's AI to fill in for missing players, and it's generally pretty competent (both here and in singleplayer).  Now for some miscellaneous details. Steam Workshop support is a thing in this game, and there's a track editor that uses it. Performance is pretty good as well. My computer (a four year old mid-to-low tier laptop) can run the game at a stable 45 FPS at low settings, and the game looks pretty nice turned all the way up if you've got an actually good computer to handle it. The achievement list is fun, with a good balance of challenge, and it's one of the few games I've bothered to 100% the achievements in. The devs are great people and are very open to feedback, making this one of the best-handled (formerly) Early Access games on Steam I've seen. The price is fair, and if you enjoy kart racing games you can't really go wrong with this one. In short, this game is great!

The controls are well done, and causing havoc around the city is fun, but the crazy references to everything awesome about the late 80's, the 90's, and beyond are amazing. The plot makes no sense, but that's OK since you get to ride Donkey Kong, hijack the TMNT van, join the Ghost Busters, guest star in Saved by the Bell, and drive the Delorean from Back to the Future, among other stuff. If that sounds awesome, you should try it. It is awesome.

1530	0	a	I'd hoped they were all lies. Flatout created a format for success which the second one followed and improved on, but this, this cancer to the flatout series should be removed. It does not belong in such a series. The driving system in this game is worse than many flash racing games. Mario kart 64 handles more realisticly than this game by far. In addition, in the second race I ever played in this game I clipped through the ground. After that I just gave up on this game. THIS GAME IS BROKEN! Also, this game requires the highest hardware specs out of the series yet I think the turd I made this morning looks like a better racing game. I bought this game as part of a bundle. However, if you are just thinking about buying this game because you liked other flatout games in this seris, DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME.
1810	0	a	not even worth 3$ if you want a game that makes no sense has sloppy controls, gives you bad cars and acts more like need for speed underground 2 even though its not because that game was good then you want this game.. i have played almost every racing game ever made and this one is just utterly pointless and not even realistic.. the original ridge racer was good this one well lets just say the object is to wreck your opponents but somehow they spawn up right behind you.. so you continuously blow them up until your car blows up.. i have beaten almost all games as i will this one but it makes no sense to me.. the game is nearly impossible on the first ever race you play.. did i mention the handling of the cars is garbage? nfs underground is better than this and that was made 10+ years ago!!!!

1908	1	a	This is a great and fun game, haven't tried playing multiplayer yet but I'm sure it's great fun. Big change from normal Formula 1 games, more suited for younger people, also the requirements aren't as high as they say they are as my old PC couls run it fine in 1080p and I only had a intel pentium D dual core and a radeon HD 5450 with 2GB of ram. SO you shouls be able to play this on nearly any computer as long as your hardware is compatible. BE sure to check it out, remember there is also a demo so you can try before you buy. Just what I did.
699	1	a	GFWL Code entry and steam doesn't allow you to copy paste so you have to manual enter or copy to notepad and copy paste from there. Controller support is full but takes intermediate level setup. Not as fun as the console versions. Leaderboards are maintained by GFWL. Probably not going to log a lot of time on these games. If you are a fan of the series this is the only version actually playable with a controller on PC. Good for nostalgia and an example of a game with full potential but no love for the end-user. It's like sitting in the seat of a concept car. Great idea but it never comes to fruition.

2067	1	a	Do you like the old days of NES Games because your nostagia goggles are on too tight? Do you get off on stealing cars and outrunning the cops, army, and bionicops GTA style?  If you answer yes to either one of these, this is definitly a game you should pick up. Also, seek help from a doctor. Nostagia goggles cut off circulation to your head, and  getting off to stealing cars just isn't healthy.  8/10, on the count that keyboard controls are a tad weird to work with initialy and for 'Virtual Burn' giving me headaches.

1257	0	a	I'm a fan of the FlatOut series, and I bought this on release thinking it would be the latest and greatest. But this game is tough to get into, if not for the fact that the controls operate like your gamepad is begging for an immediate and swift death. The adrenaline of Ultimate Carnage is ill-supported here and the game lacks a lot of the punch that made past titles great.  Worth noting - this game was made by a third party studio, not the one responsible for the earlier games.

512	1	a	I bought this game in 2009 (cd version), and it was a blast, i always liked Flatout, especially FO2, this game brought a new life to FO2, making the best destruction racing game ever made even better, its perfection at its finest, the graphics were the best, and the addition of the carnage mode made existing modes more fun... the only thing that i missed was the LAN mode for multiplayer but online was good. After 7 years the game held up kinda well, the graphics continue to look good (needs a bump in refletions and some textures), but what made the game lose some of its goodness was Games For Windows Live, i can't log in with my old account where i had all my progress because many changes were made in microsofts accounts and GFWL is abandoned and never got updated to accept those changes, so i was forced to make a new account to be able to play online, not a big problem for me, but Games For Windows Live DRM will eventually disappear (in my belief very soon) leaving the game dead, one solution would be integrating it with steamworks but  Strategy First  doesn't do anything (tipical from this publisher), and the developer says they can't do anything because they don't own the rights to do such thing (similar story happened to FO2 when Gamespy closed and left the online multiplayer dead to this day)... but if you are not concerned about the future of the game and your pc supports GFWL (some w10 users report not being able to use it) i recommend getting it, as it is a great game and in my opinion a must-play game.

There's a very large variety of races/classes/vehicles.  It seems to work just fine even with the Windows Live Marketplace shutdown, I've had no problems and can even play online. You still get the XBOX (games for windows live, but it hooks into your xbox gamerscore) achievements, too.

5113	1	a	Speedrunners is exactly what it advertises: a cutthroat multiplayer running race where your only goal is to outrun everyone else. Mechanically, this game is pretty well made. Everything is predictable enough to where intense strategy can be employed in every map, and the simplisity of the mechanics allow for clever tricks to be hidden all over the place to maximize your velocity and ensure that you're speeding away to the top.  That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.

2209	0	a	Retro City Rampage is like the old GTA games but with a load of references that are crammed down your throat every minute. This game doesn't really bring anything new to the table. RCR had pixel graphics and 8-bit music which is nothing new. The gameplay is basically just a top-down shooter and nothing more. The entire story is based around fixing a time machine for a scientist who time travels in a delorean, which is great because we didn't have enough references. Some of the missions are an outright pain in the â¥â¥â¥. For example: There's a mission where you play as BiffMan (YAY MORE REFERENCES) and you have to swing back and forth over and over again to hit a button that drops henchmen. You have to time it right and grab the henchmen and then time it right to drop them in the tank of crocodiles. You have to do this multiple times all while on a timer. There are many more annoying missions but I guess if you're hardcore and want to power through it, you can. Also, some of the mechanics such as the police are irritating. If you run over a couple people or crash into people while using the game's mediocre driving mechanics, you get a wanted level. The only way to lose said cops is by collecting cloaking device coin things which are placed throughout the city or starting a mission. This makes doing things extremely annoying because let's say you want to explore the map but accidentally run over someone in front of a cop. Well now you have to drop what you're doing and go around town looking for one of the coins or carry on while being swarmed with police officers. The game also gets very boring after a while. Unless you're doing missions nothing much changes. It's just the same old thing for the most part. The missions are kind of interesting but usually have the same goal and continue to drown you in references. In the end I would say $10 is too much for this game. If you find it on sale for $5 or less like I did then maybe give it a shot. You might have some fun with it but you'll probably get irritated with the same crap I did and give up on it.

2050	1	a	This game is WAY beyond worth your money. It's fun and clever, with way more references to other games and 80s-90s culture than I could ever hope to keep track of. And it makes no pretensions about why you're really playing it--to go on completely implausible destructive rampages--so it lets you get right to it as soon as you start the game.
474	1	a	A timeless classic! There is nothing more to say. No other arcade racing game has such awesome feel and handling, at least no other racing game that i know of (and i know a lot). Especially in multiplayer mode this game is addictive.  In order to play FOUC you need to install Microsoft GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. You should be able to install WINDOWS LIVE by doubleclicking the exe [LiveUpdateLauncher] located in the game directory. The game directory is usually [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Flatout Ultimate Carnage]  BTW: We are still playing it online via 'Games for Windows Live'. The Microsoft announcement from June 2014 that 'GFWL' will be closed at 1st July was false. Microsoft told us that 'GFWL' will not close anytime soon.

1751	0	a	Wanna know the most exciting part of this game?.. Getting the refund!
1756	0	a	I want to start this by saying that I was skeptical of the reviews I had read, most of which were similar in theme to 'I liek Ridge Racer and this ain't no Ridge Racer!' ...I thought perhaps these were just fans of the franchise who were lashing out because the developer was trying to do something new and different to a series that they hold in high regard.  As it turns out, however, this just genuinely a bad game. I want to say that it only takes one mistake to cost you an entire race -- but the word 'mistake' assumes you have far more control over your destiny than you actually do. This game seems to roll a 20 sided die in order to decide if your drift mechanic will manuever you harmlessly around a corner, slam you into a wall, or spin you around like a top until you explode from the mechanical strain of the g forces you're enduring in your fiberglass sports car that can destroy buildings for science reasons.  ...This game COULD have been decent. Sure, slamming your car through buildings while taking no damage only to to later find yourself bursting into flames because some AI in a mustange sneezed a touch too loudly at you while trying to pass you inside a corner makes zero sense - but games don't have to make sense so long as they're fun. This game seems to have forgotten about fun (and play testing) in order to make room for a ton of explosions, meaningless DLCs, and a soundtrack of mainstream EDM that middleclass white people listen to when they want to feel less mainstream.  This game could even still be playable if you're willing to invest the work necessary into learning it's wonky physics, restarting every race as soon as anything negative happens, and meditating your way through the rage of working exeedingly hard to both get and hold 1st place only to have the game decide in the last quarter of the final lap that the damage to your back left quarter panel constitutes a legitimate risk of ICBM-sized explosion... Yes, the game is playable. If locked in a basement with only Ridge Race Unbounded, after 10 years I'd probably be pretty good at it. One of the best. Or I'd have decided that the assumedly cold embraces of death's infinite nothingness simply had to be less likely to cause me emotional distress, and gnawed my way through the computer's power cable until I tasted pennies.

403	0	a	Now, lets set somthing straight before we get started  I was raised on Re-Volt, Crash Team Racing and Mario Kart  Do you now what all 3 of those games have in common? They are all interesting with a fair bit of replayability   Re-Volt made you feel like you were handling actual toy cars, in addition to having an impressive selection of cars/tracks Crash Team Racing was just the best. Small-ish selection for cars and tracks. But the power-ups and the sheer uniqueness of the entire game made this a gem Mario Kart was the great grandfather of kart racing, and had a fairly large track selection and had plenty of multiplayer mayhem  Does Super Toy Cars do this?  Yes. For about an hour and a half. Then it gets *really* dull *REALLY* quickly  The number of tracks described in the description is slightly wrong, or at least pretty misleading. They mean there are 12 tracks TOTAL, and there are 4 different locations TOTAL. It doesnt mean 'there are 12 tracks in 4 locations for a total of 48 tracks' Moreover, the tracks are very simple affairs, nothing really unique about them at all  The cars are meh. Between the hitboxes being helariously random (as they collide with the track funkily, making drifting a chore when you clip a tube wall wrong, or get bumped out of a drift by a guy 3 feet away). This also makes ramming quite literally a hit or miss situation  Also, each car has stats that determine how they run. The only way to see these stats is to go into the campaign mode and memorize them, as you cannot see the during 'quick race' or 'multiplayer' modes. But again, unless if its an extreme stat (insanely high or low) you will not notice a difference. Without fail the high speed models (formula 1 car generally) will have a piece of cake for the races, where as the more maneuverable or more weighty models get lapped constantly with very little balancing  The powerups are lame. There is not much really to be said about them other than they feel weak because of the funky physics on the car's part. If a car gets hit with an 8ball (a very powerful weapon) it kind of gets spun a little... It also has the annoying feature of replacing your powerup whenever you drive over a new one. Making sure that you cant save them for when you need them  So in summary, I would give Super Toy Cars a 4/10  Its not a bad game, just a game done poorly. Pick it up if its on sale for 4 dollars or less, but dont expect much   TL:DR VERSION Ok racing game gets boring quickly. Spend 10 dollars elsewhere

1933	0	a	This game just isn't fun and that's really such a shame, because it's like it's almost there, and then it just fell short for no reason.  There's just no give in the cars, no drifting, and when you realise it's not possible it's just not fun. Corners are bland and witohut the Mario Kart style handling but with the MK styled tracks it just feels like a weird mashup that makes no sense. It's like they wanted to make a fun party racer, but decided the F1 cars should handle like F1 cars.  The majority of the power ups are so uninspired, most of them being carbon copies of MK powerups which is mostly the norm since, it's not too otherworldly, but everything is just, bubble. Red bubble, blue bubble, purple bubble. The only other power-up is a safety car which slows down the lead racer, but just slows them down.  I would appriciate this game more if the safety car was introduced as rubber banding, making sure that the lead racer can still stay first, but can't get to a point where they're unreachable especially playing a solid defense. Also if you could just drift, I swear if you could just drift this game would be fun.  Just don't buy this, Sonic and Sega Allstars is a much better game.

1826	0	a	While this game offers it's couple of hours of fun, that fun is not worth the 10 euros you have to pay. I got this on sale so it was okay, I suggest you wait for a sale too if you are fan of flatout-style racers.  Forget realism, forget polished driving controls. This is arcade. This is not even remotely Need For Speed And honestly, feels like a bad ripoff of FlatOut series (probably because they hired the same developer..).  This game soundtrack is nice fast-paced electronic music, but having to listen old overplayed skrillex tracks is somewhat unbearable. But the music fits the speed and pace of the game, I'll give some points for that.  4/10 Buy FlatOut instead.
1860	0	a	This game is not Ridge Racer, it is a generic Burnout clone with the Ridge Racer name on it.  Ridge Racer games are bright, colourful, with happy techno music and wide open streets where you drift round corners. The drifting mechanic is extremely simple to learn and is very well designed and implemented. It is Ridge Racer's trademark gameplay.  In this game we have only dark, tight streets, mostly annoying music (there are a tiny number of tunes from other RR games, 2 or 3 from memory) and worst of all, the drifting is terrible in this game. It is badly designed and you have to smash into objects in order to earn boost. It is the most ill-conceived and unintuitive game design I can remember. Some objects are breakable and give you boost, others will make you crash. The difference between these objects in appearance is not obvious so you have to either learn from trial and error, or hope for the best. Other larger objects can be smashed through when you have full boost, but not at other times. The game will take control of your car during this time, and often hand you back control when a crash is unavoidable. So the game basically forces you into crashing.   The game varies between easy and maddeningly difficult. Make no mistake this can be a very frustrating game indeed. I don't think there is any catch-up or rubberbanding, because typically if you let the AI get a lead and crash on the harder levels you might as well restart as you have next to no chance of winning. On the other hand, I have found myself with huge leads and I've even found myself stopping and waiting 20 seconds for the other cars to catch up, so I can try and score more points in order to unlock the next stage.   I have completed the career mode but in the end it was more for my own personal satisfaction than because I was really enjoying myself. I've recently been playing Ridge Racer 6 on the 360 and Ridge Racer 2 on the PSP, both of which are PROPER Ridge Racer games and are miles more fun than this game is. Loads of fantastic tunes, open roads, addictive drifting, colourful happy environments. Real feel good games. We still wait for such a game on the PC - this isn't it.  Oh yeah and it likes to crash to the desktop a lot (I'm using Windows 7) seemingly randomly.

A great thing about this game is that your car will keep driving around the track without having to turn, the walls will push the car in the right direction. My nephew is too young to understand the whole turning thing so he just holds down the accellerator and has a great time!   8/10

2576	1	a	Fantastic game, great mini racer with a bit too much rubber AI but i guess having other racers around you always makes it more interesting, split screen multiplayer is just plain oldschool endless fun. You get the choice of fixed or follow camera, whatever suits your style... if you're ever played the classic ironman, death rally or ignition, just get this game right now, else, if you're new to the genre, this might be one of the best starting points.

1669	1	a	I've never been a huge fan of racing games. I have enjoyed the less realistic ones like Need For Speed, Burnout, and Ridge Racer.   This game differs from the old Ridge Racers games I used to play on the PS2 back in the day. RR: Unbounded is like Burnout and Ridge Racer got together and had a baby.   Its not straight arcade racing like the past RR games and its not over the top crashing like the Burnout Series. Its a great blend of the two with some nice Drifting elements thrown in. Its by no means a cakewalk. Heck the very first track you play I had to re-do numerous times and then eventually had to go back and finish it again with a better unlocked car to get first place.   If you miss the old Burnout games (not the turd that was paradise) and enjoy the Ridge Racer series then this is a definiate must buy at under $4. Lots of great gaming to be had right here!!!

1488	0	a	Team 6 really put an effort into this game, unfortunately that effort was to make the game as unenjoyable, mundane, unsatisfactory, monotonous, tedious and lastly rage inducing (at having to pay a price for such disk clutter).  If you tried Flatout and compared it to Flatout 3, you would be hard pressed to notice any game play difference apart from the garish new graphics in the case of the latter (yes Team 6 developed both games, and it tells).  Yes you may say there is a lot of variety to the game, but its kind of like saying which style of shirt you would like to wear when you go and get a lobotomy.  In my opinion the title is a typo, a more apt title would be FAIL-A-LOT 3 : Clumsy &amp; Irritating

411	0	a	Looked like it might be fun, but the drifting/boosting mechanic in this game is over-the-top completely broken. With cars that have high enough drift/weight characteristics (tier 3/4), you can literally drift through the entire track and boost yourself almost constantly. Ruins it.  That and there's only a handful of tracks/environments.

1807	0	a	This isn't a Ridge racer game, but more like a mix of Flatout + Burnout + Split/Second.  The biggest parts of the gameplay are the fragging, track creator and city destruction mechanics. You gain power (which is basically your boost meter) by drifting, chasing/drafting behind opponents, catching air, etc. When your power bar fills, you can boost, frag opponent racers (essentially wreck them), and destroy targeted parts of the track. The track editor is a unique feature where you can use parts to create your own cities (You can even go online and race in cities that other players have created). The main game mode consists of a series of races across several districts throughout the city.  Unfortunately the game just falls too short.  The race types are pretty slim, ranging from destroying opponents while racing, destroying a set number of racers within a time limit, to time attack, to drift attack and normal racing without destruction. The handling is pretty bad. Gone is the drifting from previous RR games. It feels more like NFS The Run or NFS Rivals. A.I. is a bit unbalanced. Some of the track designs are pretty bad (like smashing through a shortcut only to fly straight into a wall and crash). The servers constantly disconnect, which is annoying when testing out one of the thousands of custom tracks online. No custom graphics settings. Literally, NONE whatsoever! Only two controller presets and controls cannot be customized.   Not recommended.

472	1	a	I've played the retail of this game, the not retail, the steam release on another account and a few times on this account..   So.. What is Flatout UC and what makes it tick?  Basically, an upgraded Flatout 2 with some chievs and stuff. But saying that isn't helping much so lets just do a list of pros and cons. Cons first.    Cons:  - uses GFWL - that glitch with rubbish on the road that normally should just bump from the car but that one critical time impales your car thru the middle and makes it vault into the air when you could have got that new lap record or won a hard race. - online races are either stomps or annoying - not the best graphics, but good enough - you might not like all the modes of the game. personally i think stunts are fun in between some normal races with friends. Not a fan of the derby mode, timerun or unbalanced online games. - way too much nitro as default   Pros:  - you can overshoot the bowling lane to spell 'BO...NG' - the commentator in stunts when he gets all excited  - seeing a ragdoll AI driver overtaking your car briefly as you hear the car had crashed behind you - half a lap behind when only 2 laps remain? NOT a problem. You might still win. - getting that flatout (doubletap throttle and hold) turn in the curve going exactly as you wanted  - playing close races with friends and then continuing racing online together against the world - old but still going strong. same applies to game. - more fun than many other racing games out there. the pioneer of derbylike racing games. - no clichÃ© storyline, just start racing and have fun.  - do you prefer to race on gravel, at racetracks or to demolish a shopping mall with your car? Look no further. - match options are ok and exist. typically put 100% upgrades, no bonus and half or less nitro + only half damage and it's pretty cool.   If you like arcadeish, not too serious derbyracing with some amount of destructive environment with a flair of stunts, sterotypical AI characters, non-copyrightinfringing carbrands and something slightly more than flatout 2 i'm not sure why you're reading this after watching the trailer, just put it in the cart already you scrub.  8/10

1929	0	a	The game's kinda fun but... No customizable controls and NO SUPPORT FOR 1080p resolution IN 2015?!?!? Unacceptable!
28	0	a	Stick to the original. This attempt at a reboot is horrendous! There's too much emphasis on power sliding (even with handling maxed out), and the enemy's stats scale with difficulty. The original was great because the progression was consistent and you struggled to break the power curve, the point at which you become a serious contender. There are 3 things I absolutely loathe about this one: Poor handling, poor progression, and ridiculous 'hidden' enemy HP. In the original, as soon as the life meter ran out, cars blew up. Here, they enter a 'red, flashing danger' mode and continue to take extra hits before getting knocked out. This puts the emphasis more on the racing, while the original gave you total freedom. Stay away from this one!

409	0	a	Originally voted for this on Steam Greenlight, but i'm dissapointed. I was aware of the bad reviews before I got the game, but ended up getting it in a bundle so tried it out anyway.  Like some reviewers have said, it's obviously inspired by Micro Machines &amp; Re-volt, but unfortunately the result is a game which has too many issues to be fun or even worth playing. I only actually played (and completed, the campaign is 1.5 hours long) the game for the trading cards.  Overall, it feels unfinished, and it's not really worth the time to play, unfortunately.  Positives + The models of the cars are decent quality. + The music is okay (at least the first few times it plays). + The micro machines-like concept of small cars in a big world is a good concept.  Negatives - Physics are clunky and floaty, in a bad way rather than a comedic way. This breaks the game for a few reasons:  The game's 'stuck prevention' mechanic will occour seemingly at random. I had occasions where I was in 1st and the game would randomly respawn me in 8th place for no reason. Other times you'll hit one of the many invisible walls and completely slow down, then be respawned way behind the other competetors. Or hit a wall which is only partially sold, get stuck and then be respawned in 8th.  The game has physics objects which act as obstacles. The only problem is that all of them share the same similar floaty physics, meaning that they will often stop you completely if you even slightly collide with them. It's also extremely difficult to avoid these objects as they happen so frequently throughout the races.  Essentially, the main issue is that the game is constantly slowing you down or teleporting you without reason.   - The game doesn't handle speed well, which is a common problem in racing games. At times it doesn't feel like you're really moving, but at other times you'll suddenly be going so fast that it will be impossible to control. Also it's another racing game which relies heavily on drifting to get boosts.  -It feels like there's a lot of missing sound effects. You'll constantly hear the same engine sound, and other sound effects like objects bumping into each other are missing, which sounds strange.  -Although the car models are good, the environment objects are really mixed in terms of quality. Most of the objects in the environment look either low quality, or very stretched for some reason. Also, the roads are way too reflective or shiny and it looks odd.  Minor issues: Boosting seems like it will occasionally not improve your speed at all. Drifting will sometimes get stuck and you'll still be drifting even when you're not holding down the button anymore (could be an issue with using the PS3 controller)

1382	0	a	I love the Flatout series..I really do love it! And I heard from alot of sources that Flatout 3 is like the unwanted child of the series. But I couldn't believe it..I looked at so many reviews and tbh I thought that the gameplay doesn't even look that bad. So I tried it just now..I never ever regretted playing a game that much.  This series was once known for it's incredible driving physics and its fun races including a partly destructable circuit..well forget about that in Flatout 3: Normally you would slow down when you aren't driving on the track but offroad..well here the speed is always the same and therefore nobody drives on the track. The car flips after every single â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the environment is non destructable. If you ram a stone then you have to respawn. Also respawning makes you stand still for a few seconds which is a huge disadvantage. There is no career mode and you have all the cars from the very beginning which sucks. There are a lot of modes, but they are either other car models or the challenge mode, where you have to complete 50 random challenges. Also the 'Stuntman' Mode is back, but because of the poor physics it is no fun.  The handling is so bad that it doesn't matter if you take a car with good handling and bad speed or bad handling and good speed, because the handling is exactly the same..utter bull****.  The Graphics are slightly better than Flatout 2 but because of the overused motion blur it looks stupid. And the best feature: If you finish below 1st in any race you automatically lose and have to start over the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ again..  DON'T BUY THIS JOKE OF A GAME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

1679	0	a	Ridge Racer Unbounded is completely unrelated to the original Ridge Racer arcade games. It managed to introduce a lot of new concepts, such as course construction set (with progressive unlock of building blocks), group racing, lots of cars, multiple modes, destructible scenes, and so on. However, with the shut down of the matchmaking servers in early 2015, buggy game (crash to desktop after several races), and odd handling (there is no tutorial on how drift works in this game) means the game, even at bargain basement prices, is not exactly a good investment.   As a new racer joining the scene in Shatter Bay, your task is to 'take over' multiple neighborhoods by doing well or very well in the various races. Each neighborhood has about 7 races. Winning the races (or at least, get into top 3) will unlock higher races, while accumulating score will increase your rank and gain you access to better cars.   There are multiple race modes, but most races will be 'domination race', where you race up to 11 other cars. Do the special moves like getting air, hit top speed, or drifting, will gain you boost. Once you fill the boost gauge, you can engage boost which allows you to smash through certain 'targets', yielding shortcuts that gain you more boost (usually involve getting some big air) but since boost has limited duration, you have to time its use carefully. Smashing other cars will cause them to respawn, albeit several seconds behind.   So what's the problem? Very weird drifting mechanism. Some guides advocate holding down the handbrake button during the turn, others insist on releasing the handbrake as soon as drift had started. The problem is there is no 'test track' for you to practice. It's always race, race, race.   The graphics are quite good, and as this is a Bugbear product (makers of Flatout series) the game has decent handling... except for the weird drifting. Sound is... okay, with a lot of decent soundtracks, again, just like Bugbear games like Flatout.   You were able to build your own race courses and as you conquer neighborhoods and raise your driver level you will unlock additional blocks to build the courses. However, with death of the matchmaking servers the courses are of little use now, as much of the fun is race others in MP games. In fact, the game is stuck for about a minute checking for nonexisting server when it starts up.   All in all, Ridge Racer Unbounded tried to do too much and lack of tutorial / test track made the game unenjoyable, and the shutdown of matchmaking server is the nail in the coffin. It's fast, it's furious, but it left an empty feeling.

Great for evading mines but the top end and short duration of the boost made it very difficult, at least for me. There was another car that i spent quite a few hours trying to win in, but i forget now. Once you do win with one of those cars though, it's like 'YESSS!' The devs, namely Barkley, has been here since day one and is still here solving any issues that arise and just letting the player base know that the game is being backed by Eclipse Games , the creator of STC. I am impressed and hats off to Barkley!

5926	1	a	Speedrunners is exactly what it advertises: a cutthroat multiplayer running race where your only goal is to outrun everyone else. Mechanically, this game is pretty well made. Everything is predictable enough to where intense strategy can be employed in every map, and the simplisity of the mechanics allow for clever tricks to be hidden all over the place to maximize your velocity and ensure that you're speeding away to the top.  That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.

688	1	a	The Windows Live thing is nothing to concern yourself with. When the game starts, it logs into Windows and then the main menu appears without a hiccup. The achievements you receive are actually recorded through Windows Live. So again, there's no problem here, you can play with or without it.  The graphics are NICE, man!  MUCH better, shinier and sharper than I would've imagined.  I have it turned all the way up on every setting. It looks gorgeous; much like the hi-res screenshots you see up top (not that video or any YouTube video you come across). It'll leave tire marks on the road when you turn sharply or burn rubber. When the gas station gets ran over, the fireball blast is really sweet. The car models were done with care. I love the junkyard body and paint jobs. Excellent lighting and visuals that can compete with any ENB+SweetFX modded Grid game. The collision damage is NOT on par with Grid, let's make that perfectly clear; but it does get the job done.  The framerate is spectacular.  There are no FPS drops and the game runs smooth as butter. Even Grid has a problem with this from time to time on the best systems (google it). Not this Flatout version, though. Every race has been nothing short of fulfilling track drama at the highest of speeds. Only Gas Guzzlers races are faster...and more...insane!  Customizing your ride is awesome. Every upgrade has its positives and negatives; but I didn't realize that at first. I tricked my first ride out with all the upgrades, thinking it would be able to just drift to victory with ease. Nope! It was too heavy and beefy to carry all the speed upgrades. So it turned out to be a general ride instead of the General Lee. It gets me 4th place with consistancy. Thank of it as an M1 Abrams in a muscle car frame...with speed enhancements.  The Tracks!  Here is where the game comes alive. The tracks run more like Gas Guzzlers Extreme; so you have variances throughout the race. I don't think I've ever made the same lap twice in a single race yet. Almost everything is destructible like in GGE but even more so in this game. I also like the fact that they incorporated ramps to lauch off of. There are times when I really do feel like Beau &amp; Luke Duke in the General Lee. My ride is flying 50 feet off the ground with my confederate flag license plate hanging on by a screw and mud spewing from my undercarriage. We race (and crash) through dirt, asphalt, water...highways, lumber yards, farms, back roads, suburbs, cities...with a combination of each at times. It's awesome, man.  Flatout: UC is what racing should be. Just a few good ol' boys &amp; gals racing cars meant to be raced! I still find glee in telling my buddies how I hit a wall, flew out of my front windshield, ragdolled on the cement, and got ran over by my own car moments later.   I love this game. You will too.

A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.   I might not be able to climb but I can DODGE  8/10 would make Piccolo proud again

1857	0	a	The slow-mo crashes look cool, especially since just about everything short of entire buildings is destructable. That's where the positive stuff ends.  For one, when you start the game it's immediately obvious that PC wasn't the lead platform. The options that you can change are minimal, so you won't be able to get rid of the disgusting instagram filters and nauseating overused bloom effects that make the entire game look like a trashy CoD killstreak montage video. And that's just one of the game's smaller problems. The physics are horrifying, and I don't say that from the perspective of some elitist sim-only race enthusiast; I LOVE arcade racers, and the games that Bugbear made before this one (Flatout 1 and 2) were both tons of fun. Ridge Racer has always been about speed and control, but something is definitely off with the handling model here. Cars feel like absolute tanks when you're driving in a straight line, but initiate a drift and suddenly your car will feel as weightless as a paper airplane. I know that's kind of how drifts are supposed to feel (in a very VERY simplified, vague sense), but it shouldn't be that exaggerated in ANY game. On top of that, in the time that it takes to get used to the handling model, you'll realize that you've seen just about every game mode that Ridge Racer Unbounded has to offer. It's extremely repetitive. I've re-installed this game on 3 or 4 separate occasions, and I've really tried to give it a second chance more than once. I'm disappointed every time.  Save your money. Bugbear's older games from the Flatout series are fantastic, and their new game Wreckfest (Next Car Game) is a little more on the realistic side but it's more fun than this. I'd skip RR:U if I were you.

Races rely too much on gaining and using boost to instead of good driving skills while the track design tries to discourage using boost because of an insane number of tight turns on the tracks.   Stick with any of the other previous Flatouts or jump into Next Car Game.

1983	1	a	Take me down to murder and mayhem city.. where the 80's are alive and the girls are all.. 8 bitty...  Saints Row 2-4 and GTA: Vice City have nothing on this game when it comes to paying homage to the 80's and murder and mayhem, but they do have better graphics, better soundtracks, and far more t&amp;a but who needs t&amp;a when you can kill the Turtles, the A-Team, and the Hoff? At least I think I ran over the Hoff. This game is just everything I wanted in a NES game in the 80's but never got, and I love the 80's.  In short, if you're a child of the 80's and you aren't a graphics junkie and can appreciate 8 bit.. graphics', this game is calling your name.... really.. really loudly.   And its dirt cheap so it isn't like you'll have buyers remorse even if you don't care for it.  Did I mention it runs under Dos, Windows, and that your cat can play it?

1936	0	a	Like most people I got this free, so Codemasters can give it away. If Iâd paid for this then Iâd be googling Steam refunds right now. This is a F1 themed karting game similar to Mario kart but without the fun, graphics, cool weapons or basically anything that would make you wanna play it. This really is terrible. The commentary sounds like they got random people from the Codemasters office to step in to save a few pounds. After half a lap even the most enthusiastic player will be thinking, âCodemasters what is the f**king pointâ. Iâd rather spend all day biting the toe nails of a tramp than load this game again.
2023	1	a	Like GTA, but it's actually playable. It really has a retro feel. It's like if GTA would have been made by something like Rare for the NES and it makes fun of everything like Mega Man and Duck Hunt. It's made with DirectX though, which sucks. Also, I got a Trading card when it crashed. Pick it up while it costs less than 1 euro!

231	0	a	It's not that Snuggle Truck is  bad  per say, it's just...not very good.  Taking the Trials HD side-scrolling rollercoaster arcade racing formula, adding a basket of fluffy stuffed animals, and polishing off any of the more challenging or demanding bits, it's biggest fault is just how obnoxiously boring it is. Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.  I wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.

1809	0	a	even at the low low price of Â£2.99 with all the DLC I kinda felt like I had wasted my time and I know at this point I've not even cracked the 1 hour mark.  This is not Ridge Racer. smooth chaining of drifts rarly happen and it just does not have that same feel of speed. Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.  Also I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.  I was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game. This even at the hugly cut price was just crap.  This game tried to be a more edgy and aggressive game to go against other similar titles at the time and IMO Just buy Burnout PC its a far better game and looks just as good.

2321	1	a	A great combination of NES era nostalgia and the now-obligatory free roaming, open world, whatever you want to call it structure that every game is required to follow today.  Packed with lots of silly references to your favourite 80s movies, cartoons and video games.  The developer deserves a lot of praise for the effort they made to develop a limited version for the NES as well. If this had come out when I was a kid, it would have been, no bougt, one of the greatest NES titles ever.
1965	1	a	It is basically like playing the original GTA, except packed with tons of references to old stuff.  Most of it will probably go over your head if you're under 25, you'll probably get most everything if you're over 25.    https://youtu.be/wxfiTrqWlFA

357	1	a	Fun little racer (pun intended). It's as the title indicates: you are a toy car racer. The tracks are set up in some kids bedroom, lol. Anyway, although this game isnt super intricate, the car upgrade system works well and the car choices present you with options based on your driving preferences. They all look like the Mattel or Tonka or wahtever...toy cars we grew up on, so points added there.  The music is catchy, the tracks look cool, and the cars handle well enough. There is no realism involved necessarily, but then they are toy cars, so why would there be? btw, there are power ups throughout the course which give you weapons or boosts. Those add another fun element to the races.  This is just simply a cute and fun little racer. I played a bit offline, so my total time is a little skewed, but yeah, easy to recommend this one.  One sad note though...while there are some cool tracks in the workshop for this game (and btw...creating your own tracks is super simple as is sharing them on the Workshop), the online itself is largely dead, so if you really want to play against other people, try to make sure you have friends with the game (and/or be a good friend and buy them copies).  All in all, good simple fun. I give this one 7.5/10

39	0	a	Within 15 minutes of playtime it becomes obvious that Death Rally was originally an Ipad/Iphone game. Following the story and having finished the available missions I would think that more tracks/missions would unlock. But that was not the case. There are about 8 tracks, and they are randomized every time you have played a level. The tracks remain the same, the objectives change from time to time though. These objectives range from killing certain boss enemies, racing a few laps, killing everyone in some sort of arena, etc. With the money you make you can upgrade your vehicle and weapons. During races you'll collect random parts of vehicles and weapons as well, and killing enemies always grants a certain part. But... the game is just so dull. You can tell it was meant for smaller devices. The graphics have been upgraded though, and other control schemes have been implemented as well, so it is a game worth having; just not for the full price.  [Rating: 57/100]

1693	0	a	This game is frustrating as hell  It's somewhat fun, but frustrating to the highest degree. IMO, needs a difficulty slider to make things more even and grounded. The rate at which your car gets 'fragged' becomes way too often apart from the AI cars, which are tanks compared to your car. It seemingly gives you no chance against other cars, and the speed system is rubber banded, so to speak,so it doesn't matter what car you have, the AI will always catch up, no matter how perfect you drive.  This particular game brings shame to the genre of arcade racing. I usually find them fun, and can play just about anything. Except this...the only thing I can use to describe it is abhorrent.  The game suffers, and I give it a 5/10, and I cannot personally recommend it to anyone. Not even at a $1 price point.

2527	1	a	Huh. They made the 80's into a video game? MOST EXCELLENT!!!
1678	1	a	This is a brilliant racing game. The last ridge racer I played was back on PS1 and a lot has changed. Not being sentimental about the franchise I had no qualms with the very different feel this had in comparison.  Notable are the excellent graphics, considerable game modes, variety of vehicles, and the kinetic, over-the-top feel. It's can get quite nailbiting and got me on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions. Sound is good, although the techno dance soundtrack was not to my tastes.  I found this to be a challenging game that does not yield its treasures easily: it took me some time to master the drift mechanic and I found the opposition pretty tough. I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but luckily I persisted and I now am having a ton of fun.  As others have noted, there is no longer a multiplayer server which is a shame, but the single player is content rich enough for that not to matter.  I am very surprised at the low marks given on Steam. This is a high quality racer in my juddgment. Luckily there is a demo so you can try before you buy.  My advice is to not quit too early: once you get the hang of the drift mechanic there is a ton of fun to be had.   Highly recommended.

1111	0	a	  This game is kind of fun with many different game modes (some are very boring, others not so much.) The thing is, you can't play in single player if you aren't connected to the internet which means you have to be connected to the internet  at all times  in order to play. honestly, that is the main reason I dislike this game. the graphics are OK, however, the colors on some maps are way too bright; I had to adjust the color settings on my monitor (I would go blind otherwise). I'm definitely  not  playing this game again.

998	1	a	Jeers: -Bad A.I. - A weird mix of rubberband and non-rubberband A.I, can be really unfair at the times. -Story was abit off - Could have gotten into more deeply into the undercover scene with twists in the plot along with a clear drawn story line on it.  -Cop A.I. doesn't catch other racers or give a flying â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the matter. (and sometimes doesnt even notice you pass by at 160kmh) -Some of the music choices arent really that great(,but there are some that are quite alright.) -First impressions of the driving controls I had, coming from the older need for speed games on pc, were awful. (But I got used to it.) -My version had occasionally civilian cars spawning from the sky and sometimes in the in-game cutscenes, the car's bodies were invisible. -Steering wheel support? You can dream about that.  Cheers: +Cop A.I. itself seems to be more agressive, more willing and more realistic than the previous need for speed games. +They carried over the most aspects from need from speed ProStreet in regards of tuning (though I would had wished for total exact experience ripped out from ProStreet, 3 Engine tuning stages etc, Is simply not enough) +Get a top tier level car and it feels like a god damn spaceship, sort of fast. +Gameplay itself seems solid, along with the graphics seem to be, well... as good as 2008 EA can put out. +Large map full of all kinds of roads  Overall:  Its quite fun game, would recommend if you would like some fast paced adrenaline rushes (although for that, I'd more likely recommend the ''Shift'' - series) with â¥â¥â¥â¥ing some cops up. Also you get a girrrrrlllll in this game too as your waifu, as was seen in the same way in Most Wanted and in Carbon, but that's besides the point. Basicly its a trainwreck, but that doesnt mean trainwrecks cant be fun.   I give it a 7.2/10

1684	0	a	4 hours may not seem like much, but it's an eternity when you're playing this game. I gave this a shot because I have great respect for Bandai Namco, but I was sorely disappointed. Once the novelty of blowing up fellow racers wears off, this game turns into an overhyped Micheal Bay style clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥. The drift system is awful, the vehicles are ridiculous, and the 'plot' is shallow. (and pedantic) I would also be remiss if I failed to mention that the multiplayer servers are no longer up, so if you play this game, you will be forced to experiecne this torment alone. Trust me, whatever the price is for this, dear reader, it is too much. I honestly wish I had my 4 hours back. If you were considering this because you like racers, pick something else. If you were interested in blowing up things while you raced, go play Burnout. It's way more fun and overall better built.

1605	1	a	In Short: If you are a huge fan or racing, adrenaline or destruction and the 'Burnout' series (which other than paradise, didnât make its way to PC), you will love this game. Definitely worth the pittance that it costs, fantastic game with a lengthy career, amazing track editor and plenty of Michael Bay to keep anyone happy.  One game mode in particular known as 'Frag Attack' is very similar to the 'Road Rage' events found in Burnout, except you can drive through buildings... and cars burst into flames in slow motion if you're an adrenaline junkie this is definitely worth your time.   You can even create custom events of all game modes with a fantastic track editor. A basic, but entertaining example of this is:  - Create a track with a lot of open space (this is done easily with pre-set assets) - Set game mode to frag attack. - Plant Petrol stations and explosives everywhere. - Let the destruction unfold.   Aside from this the game features a relatively difficult set of career events ranging from your bog standard racing to destruction based racing and drift events/time attacks, set out in districts of a city with the objective of which is to earn enough points to 'Dominate' the district - this is done by placing podiums, drifting, hitting objects, taking down opponents and smashing through buildings. If you like a challenge you should definitely give it a shot.   Closest thing to Burnout since Burnout. 10/10

886	1	a	Great game! Graphics are amazing for the time it was made, and cars are much easier to get than NFS Carbon. I beat the game in less than 30 hours, and it was great every step of the way. The cutscenes are terrific, gameplay is amazing, everything is perfect. The car customization is one of the best I have ever seen! Would recommend. 10/10 Rating.
243	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based driving game where you must deliver your cargo full of 'Snuggies' as fast as possible to the zoo. On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.  Snuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from 'Smuggle Truck' to 'Snuggle Truck'. Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game.   Overall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend 'Smuggle Truck' instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience. You can only access the original from their website.
