72	1	a	Small, fun to play racing game with guns. Nothing like original, but fun in its own way. Steering could be better, opponent AI could be better (there's no real AI, it all depends on difficulty and on harder races they'll turn you into dust on lap 1, and lose horribly on beginner level). Races typically last around 1 minute. Powerups are contained in boxes, some boxes have more health than cars and you can't directly aim at them, while most get destroyed (opened) in 1-2 hits.  Overall, the game is fun. Just don't bother trying to get 100% achievements, its quite long and boring.
864	0	a	While the game itself is fun, it's a horrible port. It's definatly gamepad focused so there's no excuse why the menues can't be controlled with a gamepad. It's also very poorly optimized.  Don't buy this, buy the excellent Trials Evolution instead, which is a far better game and has all the things this game is missing.
2219	0	a	Retro City Rampage looks like a throw back to the NES games, it sounds like a throwback.  But it doesn't play like one. RCP grabs almost everything that was rad during the 90's quotes, movies, games and slaps it into one box, that if was released during those times would have caused many children to die of cardiac arrest.   Unfortunately being bombarded with 90's references via storyline, background foreground etc and so on gets a little tired. It's the equavilent of a dubstep, raveparty on acid while injecting absinthe atop of an Euthanasia coaster.  When I muster the strength I turn it on for a short period so I don't have to use my NES emula.................Nintendo Entertainment System.  2.5 out of 5 chiliwigs

405	0	a	This was pretty obviously made by people who loved the hell out of Re-Volt on the Dreamcast. As well they should, because Re-Volt owned. This one tries but is a little too buggy and unpolished to make the mark. There's a good variety of cars but the tracks are pretty samey, with no good gimmicks or unique features and some frustrating invisible walls. The drifting mechanic is also pretty weird and stiff if you're used to Mario Kart, but I got the hang of it eventually. Races aren't too hard if you keep buying and upgrading new cars, though it should be mentioned that there's zero rubberbanding, which is both a blessing and a curse. If one CPU driver pulls away from the pack he can be impossible to catch, forcing a restart if you want gold. Most races are basic time trials or eliminations, but there is one neat one called Evade where the track is covered in mines, and the last place car is eliminated every 15 seconds. Those races are more about driving carefully than fast, and they can be pretty intense. It's not a bad game, just an unpolished one. I got all the way through it but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are dying for an arcade racer right now.

1324	0	a	This game doesnt deserve the flatout name for sure, the game doesn't feel or look like a flatout game, some of its maps are good, arena mode has to be the best of all modes but yet nothing compared to the real flatout, handeling is bad, crashes are bad, jumps feel terrible, visual damage is meh, cars are meh, multiplayers doesnt seem to work, graphics are blelow standards of its time and heavyish, and most of the stunt modes are crap, the game had potencial, maybe if they refined some stuff and fixed the game bugs it could be something good, but wat it really did was ruin a great franchise... I Just got this game bc the flatout complete pack was the same price as this game and it was included, otherwise i would never buy this game.

1116	0	a	  -Quick Review-   Zero Gear is an indie Racing game, the community is pretty much dead, but if you don't feel like you've had enough kart games, here you go, just for you. Disclaimer: I'm voting it down *not* because it's a bad game, but because the community is dead, you will play by yourself 9 times out of 10. (Maybe you don't mind that? Maybe you want to play a racing game by yourself? Go ahead and get it, lol)    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Instead of a telling the gist of the story (there is none) I'm going to tell my own story. The first time I loaded this game I listen to the soundtrack and though 'Woa! This sound really good' I called my brother over and said 'doesn't that sound like it has good potential?' I clicked 'quick game' and  BAM  all my hopes and dreams were crushed... This was in fact... a racing game.  To provide a back story, I've always strongly disliked racing games and driving games. But Saints Row 3, Mafia 2, and Just Cause 2 have all forced me to learn how to drive in video games.   Game Play:  The first game I played was some type of 'Soccer' (or 'Football' for those whom aren't in the USA), this is probably the worst game in the batch. There are several game modes: Tag, Race, and Soccer. All of these can be played and learned, however it takes a bit of getting used to the turning style... Much to my frustration when learning the basics of the game. Soccer/Football/Hockey, your goal is to get the ball/puck into the other team's goal (pun intended). Race is where you drive in circles for a few laps and try to beat the NPC's, because humans don't play this game anymore. Tag, for those of you with no childhood; is when you run away from one person because he/she was designated being 'it', whatever it is, who knows? In this game it's reversed. You WANT to be it, so you can score points and win.   Achievements:  There are 45 Achievements in Zero Gear, Most of them are easily obtainable, however a number of them are bugged, and still more require the assistance of one friend.   Price  the price for Zero gear, is $4.99 that's pretty fair, if you really want this game just wait for a steal sale, you can probably pick it up for a couple dollars.   Conclusion:  AHHH a racing game. *deletes the devil from my computer*  Again, I'm giving it the thumbs down because most people probably won't want to spend time playing this game. The game works, and I could go one way or another, but with my friends interest in mind; probably should just skip this game. You could get a more delightful indie games for the same price.

910	1	a	Honestly... when I first played this game, I had a great time. Usually I don't enjoy playings games without friends, but this one kept me busy for hours on end. The racing controls, even for a keyboard, are amazing. Most racing games on a PC with keyboard and mouse are frustrating, but this one is satisfying.   It's not some Triple A game, and it shouldn't be compared with those sorts of games. It does what it does very well. A lot of people say the story is bad, but the story really isn't all that important in this game. It's about racing, and I feel like the story is just there to give you a reason to be racing.   I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for time to kill. It's no masterpiece, but it can be a lot of fun.

1272	0	a	Well.. This is definitly not FlatOut. This might have been a decent game some 10 years ago, totaly not worth the money. They tried something with physics, which are way off. Graphicaly the game sucks, neither cartoonish nor real. There is no ingame music. If you ever loved the flatout series, stop with no. 2. I cannot believe someone would publish this and think it is an okay game to follow in the flatout series.
843	1	a	Never have I loved a game more. Never have I hated one so so much. Trials can be very addicting trying to get that 'perfect run' but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end. The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail. And you always know it. It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time. It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too. The controls are tight. There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced. The crashes can be hilarious. The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks. There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down. Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game. This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.

1609	1	a	Great game. It reminds me of all the crazy racing games I played when growing up. I would just drive in the wrong direction and crash into everyone rather than try to win anything! It's focused more on action than simulation which is perfect for me. If you just want some fast paced action then give it a try. But be warned it takes some time to master. The racing relies more on your ability to create shortcuts by plowing through certain obstables and blowing up your opponents rathern than pure racing skill. The best way to get power points for a boost is to learn how to drift properly and destroying objects. It's the only ridge racer game I've ever played so I cant comment on whether not it lives up to its predecessors.

1757	0	a	I love Bugbear's approach to racing games, and I really wanted to like this one, but with the very best intentions, it's only hit and miss, and even more miss than hit, unfortunately. Many aspects of Bugbear's trademark destruction racing is implemented well (good visuals and sound, visceral environment destruction, easy controls - though except drifting, etc.), but there's one big fault that leads to a string of others, making the entire game questionable. The culprit is car damage, which seems semi-random at best. It's annoying enough if I bang my bumpers at the end of the race and the game decides that I crashed, but due to the idiotic fragging mechanism, I feel like a sitting duck in any race where I can't get a 2-3 sec lead by the second part, where boost increase seems severely diminshed, at least for the player. The boost mechanism is rather stupid by the way, Flatout's nitro makes 100x more sense. Silly racing formats don't help things either. I mean, frag 20 police cars with a truck in a given time? Seriously? When every frag switches on slowmo event camera (at least it can be skipped, but stilll)?  All in all, the game feels like it tries to be too many things at the same time, and succeeds in very few aspects. It's moderately fun when the car damage randomness isn't geared against you, but it quickly loses appeal, and after dominating one location, I'm not sure I'll ever go back to the game. That's not a good basis for recommending a game, so I don't. Too bad.

1282	0	a	Flatout 3 is a joke to the great Flatout Franchise, You are better off checking out Ultimate Carnage or Flatout 2 for your destruction derby needs.  The game is something else, car handling and menus are some of the worst i've seen and you can really feel that this game has been thrown together to just grab your money. Stay the frack away from this title.  The main reason why this game is so diffrent (and therefor worse then Flatout 1/2 and Ultimate Carnage) is because its diffrent developer for this game (Not Bugbear). So i can't even call it a 'Flatout' Game... this is... something else.

1492	0	a	Edited october 1st 2014 I have come to a conclusion that it is even worst than when i first looked at it. The game feels just like a cheap arcade game. The vehicle physics is crap and wanky. The destruction is okay at times but it pretty craply done compared to the other games. Some items like cones and wood float and never move. I can no longer recommend this game to anyone, not even your worst enemy. Its like the just stuck the name FLATOUT 3 on a piece of crap and tried to sell it. You have a better chance at winning the lottery TWICE than enjoying this game for more than 30 mins! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ALL FLATOUT FANS BEWARE!!! This game is a horrible addition to the Flatout series. That is why I gave it a negative reveiw. It feels nothing like the originals.  Now on another note as a racing game it isnt the worst (still isnt that great). It is okay for people who have never touched Flatout if they can get it cheap. I highly recomend getting the complete pack mainly for the other games.  Overall I do not recomend this game. Once again FLATOUT FANS BEWARE!!!!

393	1	a	Played it through in about 4 hours and that's probably it for me, because it looks like Multiplayer mode isn't available on Mac (the main menu item is disabled). The achievements aren't working with steam either. Other things I think are annoying:     Some objects have invisible walls so you better shouldn't cut the corners to much.    The music. Especially this track that changes pitch all the time (or is this also a bug?)   So at the end of the day: Yes, it's a fun tabletop racer, especially on the higher levels, but there are better ones, like TableTop Racing (iOS, Android). With the bugs fixed it would be a little bit better, though.

Great for passing the time when you are bored. I'm making great progress in the story mode, it's not too easy, but it's not too hard either.  I'd personally recommend it, it's a good racing game with a pretty interesting storyline.
549	1	a	Instant Classic! fun game. look up graphics upgrades. ;^)
803	1	a	Awesome physics, but the difficulty is high. I see players on YouTube running through the tracks full speed, but I have trouble even finishing. Still fun to play.
1263	0	a	Unbelievable . . . I remember when I was a kid having a homework deadline and throwing it together at the last minute not caring for the details or the quality .. That is exactly what this game is. If you don't believe me, go ahead and waste your money on it. The first FlatOut is a MAJOR improvement over this latest release. These guys must have given up or just not cared?? I don't know, but it's just plain awful.  0 Stars (I would vote negative if possible).
240	0	a	Go buy yourself a hot coffee, then, remove lid and put it in your car. Now, drive a bumpy road somewhere with jumps and watch your coffee being spilled all around. That's what this game is.

766	1	a	Nice trucking game.  In short: Visually nice, truck drives were nice. Random accidents on the road, heavy traffic during daytime.. and then rain.. yup thatÂ´s how it goes sometimes.   Remarks: As said and recommended by others: turn cops and fatigue off makes it more relaxing to play.  Recommend: Yes.

137	1	a	Really smooth gameplay, along with an amazing soundtrack, but it had the potential to be so much more. Multiplayer would be wonderful but setting up a server is complicated, and never ended up working for my friend and I. Really could use more gamemodes and maps... but it's worth it for what you get.  Overall really well made, with satisfying fast paced gameplay, fun to kill a few hours with.
371	1	a	Super Toy Cars=Super Fun!!!  Its simple, yet challenging. I played it one weekend, and finally, just dominated every race. I was kinda disappointed, as I enjoy a good challenge. I then got busy for the next 3 days. When on the fourth day, I tried it, I was surprised at how rusty I was that I even failed at a race challenge that I usually had no problem with!  One down side is, that the online mutli-player lobby is usually empty. I first tried an online race, June 14, 2014. I was the only one on. I tried a second race. Again, only me. So I checked the time. 9:27pm Eastern time. This game will be complete once the online lobby fills up completely with racers.  This is also the perfect game to try to get used to racing games, bumper car type games, games where you get items to use against the other racers(such as MarioKarts.)  Ill be keeping my eye on the multi player lobby. Hopefully, it'll start filling up and I can fix the part of this review and say multi player is going smoothly.

1235	0	a	I picked this up in a multi-pack with several other games as I had played previous games in the series before. Honestly, I think I might have been better off paying more to buy the rest of the pack separately without this one.   Avoid this game and here is why: The graphics are at best mediocre. However, despite this expect to find the game stuttering and struggling to keep up (especially when turning corners). This quickly becomes more than a minor annoyance when you find yourself losing control because the game has stuttered on a corner. Textures applied to the walls around the track (such as graffiti on the concrete) will flicker. (Keep in mind this is on a PC with an i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a GeForce GTX 670).  The car handling is distinctly fishy. Half the cars will stick to the road like glue. The other half will be sliding all over the place. There is nothing in between.   The AI is even fishier. When they go around corners expect to see carnage as they drive straight in to walls. To make up for this the AI will quickly catch you on the straights â passing your car with no problems even when youâre burning nitro.   The damage modelling on the cars is all or nothing. Where Flatout Ultimate Carnage slowly added damage to the cars depending on the impacts in this game your car is either brand new or has been completely crumpled. There is no damage in between these two options. As soon as your car scrapes against anything expect to see the whole car appear as if it has been squashed by an 18 Wheeler.

1986	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a better technical achievement and a transplant of retro gaming than it is as an actual game. I'm impressed that something like this is able to have a lot of variety and not end up really collapsing in on itself. The mechanics themselves are not perfect but okay, doing that thing where misguided nostalgia brings back terrible gameplay elements and mechanics instead of doing the right thing and leaving them in the attic.  The references ground my gears more than the gameplay. The combined weight of all the references and cameos is like Neil Cicierega having a stroke and turning the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny from a five minute song into a ten hour long old-style Greek epic. And when that isn't irritating enough, it brings out the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ self-parodies of other games!  The real recommendation here is the developer. Brian Proviciano is a Carmack level magician who fiddles around with ancient hardware and creates 100%-hardware accurate ports of this game in Assembly. The game itself accomodates to every level and flavor of nostalgia. You can even play the game in EGA or on a simulated Game Boy screen, for crying out loud! You can even play the aformentioned NES port of this game inside the actual game! That's bonkers as hell. Brian needs his John Romero to make the most of his talents and create something truly amazing.

1708	0	a	From an arcade racing aspect, Ridge Racer Unbounded offers a decent amount of fun, but only after you have mastered drifting. Drifting takes some getting used to. Well, lets just say that it's a lot easier if you pick the right car. Not all cars are created equal drift-wise and trying to win with a poor drifting car is more difficult than it should be. The game does not leave room for mistakes; one crash and you are in last place--so don't even bother trying to finish.  There are many things about this game that I do not like: 1) The initial cars are not only slow, but they all have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ acceleration and the AI cars will pass you like you are standing still. Not only that, but the AI cheats when they crash and will spawn in front of you at full speed. 2) All the cars look and sound the same. 3) The graphics have an annoying orange hue making it difficult to focus on the road. 4) There are only a handful of areas with multiple events, but each event pretty much uses the same racing map and there is very little variety. 5) Music is kind of hit and miss, some good, most bad.  With so many better arcade racers out there, this one is easy to skip.
1448	1	a	Not as good as Flatout 2 but I still enjoyed this game.  I don't know what these peoples issues are. I've used this game on multiple PC's and it's never had any issues. It was working fine on PC's without the best parts either. No lag on a GT 9800 with a AMD Athlon II 2.91 GHz dual core, 4GB DDR2.  The controls are no worse than other games. Burnout Paradise, Need for Speed.. There's not much difference. I mean, you can re-map them if you hate them, so.. what's the issue?  I tell you to take the fact this game is 12% overwhelmingly negative with a pile of salt. Buy the game, try it, if it works, enjoy it. Don't just take confirmation bias to your head and hate it just to hate it.  This is a good game made by a good company.

I can't imagine it would have been too much effot to be able to change the keyboard keys, or to have added support for other gamepads, but it is beyond the expertise of Codemasters it seems.  Its a shame because it appears to be a reasonable game but these are serious hurdles to its value.  Go play Sonic All Stars Transformed instead.

The camera is annoying at times and the controls / driving just doesn't feel right, similar to Mini Motor Racing EVO, even though this game had the controls a bit better. As someone already stated, it feels like a flash game, therefore I cannot recommend buying this. Least I got it in a bundle that included some better games, so money wasn't wasted.  6/10

2045	1	a	Fun little game. Kind of like if GTA Vice City was on Super Nintendo, which is pretty sweet. Although I'm not even sure what the purpose of it all is, but you get to drive tanks, the DeLorean and the A-Team van, so that makes up for it.  Got it for $1, so in this case, I got my money's worth

2152	0	a	I think the developers executed exactly the type of game they wanted to make, and I love them for some of the funky stuff they've done, like creating an MS-DOS port and some of their assembly (ASM) stuff out on the web.  Unfortuntately -- and this is a purely subjective &amp; personal beef -- Retro City Rampage DX felt like a power-fantasy for children. I did not enjoy the pacing &amp; easiness of the game, and had to put it down after 0.7 hours - and I haven't had the will to pick it up since.  Hopefully I'll change my mind some day and play it again, and then commit seppuku because my opinion was made in haste. But these days, I value my time a lot more, so I'm not sure if it was wrong to judge it after my short time with it.

2011	1	a	It took me a while to get used to the controls for driving but then this game got really fun. It's a cocktail containing Grand Theft Auto / Mario / Teenage Munant Ninja Turtles / Cobra and other retro games. And they mix perfectly together.  The game offers a huge arsenal of vehicles, weapons, environments, challanges and missions to keep you occupied. I liked the game so much that I needed to 100% complete the game and it only took me 16 hours ;D  You can even change the screen settings to match all sorts of old game emulators and also features great soundtracks.  If you like old school games, pixels, gta and open world freedom get this game. It's more then worth the money.
2519	1	a	Its fun, enough said.
154	1	a	I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. I stared entranced, soaking in owlchemy Labs' new material, chiseling each gameplay moment into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only platform for the material for months.  This is an emotional, psychological experience. Snuggle Truck plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Owlchemy Labs hated being Owlchemy Labs, but ended up with the most ideal, natural game yet.  The experience and emotions tied to playing Snuggle Truck are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men created this, it's clear that Owlchemy Labs must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this game! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.

2245	1	a	All I can say is that I'm in love with this game. It controls beautifully, better (I personally think) than any of the top-down GTA games, and for the first time, I'm ACTUALLY interested in doing missions (as well as taxi shifts). I've also understood almost EVERY single reference I've seen, and had to do everything in my power to keep myself from dying of excitement when I found the fridge on the chain, the cow signs, and the definitely-not-earthworm hiding in a trash can. The game is seriously one of the funniest things I've played in a long time, and manages to pull this off while still being family-friendly. The ONLY thing that would be cool to add would be multiplayer, but, eh, I'll get over it. 10/10   Also, I play it with a Nintendo 64 controller, and have NO regrets.

2515	0	a	It's a neat concept, it really is.  you play as a street thug running around a retro-GTA inspired enviroment and be amused by 80's/early 90's gaming and pop culture references.   But I think it tries a little too hard with that concept, to the point where the game doesn't exactly feel all that fun to play. Maybe I just feel like the indie-gaming market is a little over saturated with 'old school' and 'retro' and 'pixel graphics' games, and this really shoves that in your face in spades.   Now, I could've gotten a refund but I do still felt like there was fun to be had here. And it is very clear that the devs had a real love for the game that they made and homages they were shooting for. And that's great, I support that. But as far as the game itself, I think it's just a little too much of a decent idea, leaving it feeling a little unfocused and not all that fun to physically play.

5638	1	a	 Early Access Review
838	1	a	Never have I loved a game more. Never have I hated one so so much. Trials can be very addicting trying to get that 'perfect run' but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end. The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail. And you always know it. It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time. It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too. The controls are tight. There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced. The crashes can be hilarious. The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks. There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down. Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game. This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.

There are also a lot of extras in the game, like optional shaders, secrets, character customizations, etc... In short, this is a great game that I would highly recommend playing if your nostalgic, just want a fun top-down-GTA-type game, or if your into the old GTAs.

7	1	a	one of the most funny arcade topdown driving games i played so far.
1155	1	a	This game is for offroaders, what else is there to say. It has plenty of cars that can be tuned to different terrains that consist of mud, sand, rocks, obsticles and more. There are multiple races and different events to attend across the map and each one has something unique.  It isn't really an easy game to play at first and needs some getting used to and the multiplayer funcion doesn't really work for some reason but overall it's an awesome Offroad Racing, it's hard to get better than that, maybe if the multiplayer functioned and the game had free ride mode with some open areas.

The near endless refrences to old school games will give you chuckles the entire time. Not just games, Movies, toys, events all from the 80's 90's. I would say a must have for anyone over the age of 20, you'll get plenty of nostalgic laughs and a solid little GTA clone to boot@ :-)

Also for some reason my gamepad suffers from dreadful input lag. Can i be bothered to search for a cure... no, not really. I will write the cash of as a bad investment and make a mental note to read the forum first before buying anymore of steam special offers. Steam you should really look at what your offering people!  Cheap does not always = bargain. :(

3540	1	a	Hello! Speedrunners Is a really good game for a party or if you just want to play a small game where you can stop (almost) instantly. It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game. 4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up. And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!
1685	0	a	This is an awesome racing game but the multiplayer is missing since they shut down the servers only 2 years after releasing the game. If you don't mind just running the same tracks all by yourself this is a really cool game. Reminded me of 'Burnout'. It was very enjoyable playing the online part because you could run tracks other players created. It was very challenging. It has been a big let down since they shut down the servers. Everyone needs to complain to Bandi Games until they turn them back on. This is only 1/3 the game without the multiplayer and world domination. I can't believe they still advertise online player when selling this game.

1026	1	a	Like the other people said itÂ´s not Underground 2 or Most Wanted, but I still like this game as well.   Gameplay any good and does it work well? Nice BMWÂ´s.. The gameplay is REALLY smoother on the pc than on the PS3, works on my win7 home premium 64 bit. The steering is really nice on my rumblepad reacts instantly, works well on widescreen, got all settings maxed out and still works smooth. Autosculpting is really nice with my rumblepad 2, works a whole lot better than the mouse.  What I do not like: Cops, so many cops.. it's almost like they are doing a parade in the game.  Gaming gear used: Logitech Rumblepad 2 corded.  Bugs: Had no startup issues playing the game. Few crashes like pc freezes were a common occurrence it seemed until I bought a different pc. Had one bug at the transporter mission, crashed to windows. If you get this just drive to the race and activate it.  Note: If your videocard is going nuts then try vsync in options, helps to calm it down alot. This happens even when you have a really good graphicscard.  Recommend it? Yes, the cars sound so good in this game.. I can almost smell the fumes playing it.
1038	1	a	I find it fun You feel amazing when your running from cops and you know something down and then find more on you. I love trying to drift and I love when you lose control it feels amazing I like it but yea the scenenry is kinda dull

I took my hands off the keyboard and the car continues to drive and compensate for my errors. WTF.  Can't believe this is $10. Don't buy this.     Accidently Reviewed

My only problem with it is that it can be inconsistent at times. I've hit a parked car on the side before and it threw my character out of my vehicle, but another time I hit an AI vehicle in the same place after it spun out and I hardly got dinged. I even got an achivement after that. That can be frustrating sometimes but it is not something that should keep you away from getting this game. One of the best racing games out there which I feel is underrated in my opinion.

On the other hand, that mostly ends up serving as a reminder of games you liked a lot more than Retro City Rampage.  If you want open-world mayhem, go with something like a Saints Row game, where the city is easier to enjoy. If you want referential humor, grab something like Shut Up And Jam Gaiden, which puts more effort into its punchlines than 'Hey remember that thing.'

15	1	a	Death Rally is a port of Remedyâs 2012 iOS racing/destruction game of the same name. I picked it up on sale for $3.50 and itâs proven to be a good value for the money. The mechanics are absurdly straightforward, the story is so shallow that it borders on pointless, and yet the upgrade system redeems this arcade racer and turns it from something tedious to something genuinely fun and engaging.  The story, such as it is, is that a Joe Arpaio-type sheriff arrests the player, a young punk, for some driving-related mischief and, rather than putting him in a pink dress and sending him to pick up trash along the highway like any normal insane Arizona law-enforcement official, he recruits the maverick to challenge other neâer-do-wells to deadly races in hopes of luring an archcriminal known as The Adversary out of hiding so that he may be captured or killed. Thatâs basically it. The story plays out through a total of three cutscenes interspersed among the story missions, which are unlocked as your fame level or upgrades are purchased.  Non-story gameplay consists of selecting from among a group of seven randomly-chosen tracks/difficulty levels or playing a challenge mode race, which generally has a specific objective or vehicle/weapon loadout. If you donât like the options provided, you can always click the âstoryâ button twice and the computer will present you with a new batch (I personally preferred the âPitâ track because itâs the least twisty and Iâm not very good at these kinds of games).  Winning or losing races will grant you varying levels of financial rewards which are used to purchase upgrades. There are six primary weapons to unlock and select from (not counting mines) and each vehicle has three characteristics to enhance (speed, handling, and armor). You get more money for killing your opponents or placing better than sixth (each race features five AI opponents).  Graphics are about what youâd expect from a top-down racer in 2012, neither spectacular nor underwhelming. Sound effects are serviceable and the cutscene voice-acting is atrocious (on purpose, I suspect). The music is limited to what you hear in the main menu, apart from one Poets of the Fall track that plays over the end credits (Remedy must have a long-term licensing deal with that band, as their music was all over the Alan Wake games).  The game is not without its quirks. It will not load in fullscreen by default at your computerâs native resolution, which means you have to take the following steps to resolve this: go to the Settings menu, change the resolution to something lower-than-native, click the âWindowedâ button to âNoâ, and then change the resolution to native. This would be a very trivial point if the game remembered your settings between sessions but it doesnât, so youâll be doing this every time you load the game. Your alternative is to play in a window but I wouldnât recommend it; given the amount of frantic clicking that the gameplay demands, you will inevitably click outside of the window, thereby losing the race for yourself and after you do this a few times, youâll give up and resign yourself to the above process. The PC controls for the mouse and keyboard work but theyâre not great; as with most racing games youâll want to use a controller and youâre best off with an XBOX controller (unless you enjoy fiddling with things like MotioninJoy). As with many PC games, the controller configuration is very limited and it doesnât work very well at all with my Logitech Rumblepad 2, although I can generally get the Rumblepad to play well with other racers like Burnout Paradise.  On the whole, though, itâs curiously satisfying to upgrade your vehicles and weaponry and kick â¥â¥â¥ in random races, which is the essence of this game. I put 13 hours into it, beating the story mode (that Adversary is a tough nut to crack) and getting most (84%) of the achievements in the process; you may get some extra value out of it if you enjoy competitive online multiplayer modes but these generally arenât my bag. I can say itâs well worth buying, especially if you nab it during a decent sale.

1589	1	a	I just picked this up on sale and I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the reviews that said this game was bad and gave it a thumbs down. I am having an absolute blast playing it ! It's a lot of fun and quite challenging if you try to get all the stars for each track. There are over 60 races to complete and you can create your own tracks as well. The Multi-player is shut down so don't buy it for online play.   I have played many Ridge Racer games in the past and I loved R4 back in the day. Some may complain that this doesn't feel like a Ridge Racer game and they would be somewhat right. It's Ridge Racer to the extreme. The Ridge Racer game series needed to evolve with new gameplay and this game does that. It still has the Ridge Racer 'vibe' with all the powersliding you can handle while listening to techno style music. But, it adds in destructible environments with alternate routes you open up by smashing through walls and buildings on each course. It also has opponent take downs like we have seen in games like burnout.   All of this destruction adds to your power/turbo meter. You can keep the meter filled up by causing destruction to the other racers and the environment. Keeping your meter maxed as often as possible is essential to winning races because the AI is not easy to beat. They drive well, boost often and will even 'frag' you when you are ahead of them. Even if you don't come in first you still get points so losing the race is not always a bad thing.  In additon to the main 'domination' mode there are several other game modes to mix things up. There is a mode called 'Shindo' that is a lot like recent RR games where you just get boost for powersliding and the envronment is less destructible. There's also drift attack, time attack and a 'frag' mode where you try to destroy as many oponents as possible. All are fun in there own way and you can apply these modes to the tracks you create as well.   My biggest complaint with Ridge Racer unbounded is that there needs to be more options to change the graphics and control settings for the game. They are extremly limited and it's obvious this is a console port. The game still looks good but more settings for the PC version would have been appreciated. Other than that it's a solid arcade racer.  Overall, the game is just plain fun and that's what counts to me. I don't understand why people don't like it. Maybe they are struggling to win the races. Some races are very difficult and require multiple attempts to win. As with other racing games it takes some practice to get use to the handling of the cars. Also, there is a button for drifting and you should use it instead of the brakes to start your drift.  Maybe the people who don't like it expect it to be like the older Ridge Racer games but I'm actually glad it's different than the previous games. Why make a new Ridge Racer game if it's doesn't add anything different ? Also, I don't care that the MP is dead. I don't play MP on many games anyway. So if your looking for a fun, challenging, over the top, arcade racing experience give this game a try.   8 out of 10
2401	1	a	WoaaahahwAW?! That's what this game will do to your mind. At least if you're an 80s-90s gamer of any age. The sheer amount of nostalgia will make your head explode, recompile, then explode again. Every mission is an adventure through time to the age of hardcore gameplay, simple (yet stylized) graphics, and amazing chiptune music.  I'd try to list all the references, but I think my fingers would ignite from the effort. If you know what NES-era gaming was like, and have fond memories (even of the awful bits, like the Ninja Turtles game, especially the dam level), you will absolutely f**kin' LOVE this game. Period.  The general gameplay recipe is this: take a decent dose of GTA, mix in some Saints Row shenanigans, add a hefty plethora of NES-era stuff (both references and gameplay... and graphics and sounds and...), as well as a generous portion of modernization in terms of controls and smoothness, and bam... you've got Retro City Rampage. Every single part of it is immensely enjoyable and relatable, while still being fresh enough to keep even the most ADHD-riddled brains occupied.  To top it all of the developer even added a truly 8-bit version (playable *within* the game itself)... so much so that the extracted version will work just fine on an NES emulator!!! Just take a moment to think: this (or at least a *version* of this) was possible back in the 80s. This kind of gameplay and variety and just general awesomeness... it was all possible. My god... what have we been missing?!  Look, this game is amazing. Hands down, flat out... amazing. From start to finish you won't be bored and, if anything, you'll just be craving finding the rest of the secrets and references. Get it NOW if you grew up playing NES-era games, and if not? Well... you'll enjoy it just the same (though I can't say you'll get the same sense of nostalgia that the rest of us will).  The dev is basically a one-man show (who I have spoken with personally and is a truly kickass dude), has supported practically every platform out there (and for the rest is working diligently on it), and is ABSOLUTELY someone you should follow for future releases. Zero complaints, nothing but praise... not much more to say!

I know it's not real ridge racer but I got it anyway for nostalgia etc. It's not even a decent arcade racer. I could of lived with the levels and cars it all looks pretty good even at 21:9. But the controls and handling make it an awful experience. Wish we had a real ridge on the steam store.
2273	1	a	This is a very fun game! A witty, rage inducing game full of funny parody's. Very similar style to Grand Theft Auto I, II, Advance and China Town Wars. The music is nice however sometimes feels like you are listening to one long song on each station (when there's more than one). The controls are a bit clunky with an Xbox 360 controller but still very much playable. 8.5/10

1592	1	a	This is one of the most underrated games i have ever played. I have been a fan of the Ridge racer series since Rage racer hit the ps1 in 1997, Iâve loved the way cars can drift around corners at impossible angles and speeds...and how its all about the skill of drifting. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE THE OLD RIDGE RACERS; in this game you can hit walls and it is not very likely you will keep your speed when you just turn and press the drift button, in unbound you have to control your car, or else you will be at the back of the grid. It also borrows from the burnout series with 'frags' (takedowns in burnout)...this adds another element to the exciting racing in this game. It is also made by bugbear (the makers of the flat-out series and Next Car Game), you can see game elements from flat-out throughout this game, as in the highly destructive environments and vehicle combat. The track-editor is also amazing, the editor lets you create many...MANY tracks in all different shapes with all different elements, the advanced editor lets you add ramps and explosives to the track you have created. Overall if you want a fun arcade racer to pass the time and have a lot of fun along the way, get this!! its a brilliant mix of many different racing games.

1058	1	a	One of my favorite arcade racing games. It has pretty bad graphics even for a 2008 game, it's quite buggy, it has a crappy menu system and poor controller support, and also has unskippable live-action cutscenes that fail to convey anything even resembling a story. However, it has just the right amount of customization, the cars are very fun to drive no matter if it's a Tier 1 or Tier 4 car. The game world is diverse for driving, though again, not in apperance. There's winding country roads, city areas, and long highways where you can take your car all the way to the top of its abilities. 252mph seems to be the speed limit in this game, with a fully upgraded Bugatti Veyron. The police system is just a tad too unforgiving, but it's relatively simple and it is a very, very easy game to learn and quite difficult to master. The game is oftentimes too simple in the beginning no matter what car you choose, but if you choose the wrong car later in the game, you'll have a hard time beating the game. Highly recommended considering its base price on Steam is $10. One playthrough will last almost 20 hours.

Retro-styled, anyone who ever played on the older consoles and machines will immediately recognise references to several series and games from those eras. Outside of that, it's a fun walk-around/drive-around game like the original GTA, with plenty of missions, side-missions, hidden bits and roaming to keep you happy.    And even in free-roaming mode, it's a good five-minute blast while you're waiting for other things.

271	1	a	This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!  UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything.   Pros: Kinda fun at times  Cons: Too easy Broken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join) Framerate drops  Just no  UPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!

2660	1	a	My favourite game at the moment. Easy to play, hard to master (perfectly) everyone can more or less move to the whole map without any experience. But there are so many alternative ways where you can go to be faster.   Good game to watch videos nextby. The Power-Ups are just amazing!   The only thing that I dislike are the characters, which I think could look a bit cooler.  Also I have some minor lags sometimes (once in an hour), which is quite weird, because my pc is a lot over the requirements.  Cool local-co-up game!   Wow that was a unorganised review.   - 9/10 Riggy

2336	1	a	Would definately reccoment this game. An amazing concoction of of 8Bit beat 'em ups and open world exploration. What initially seemed a close and simple clicky clicky game soon opened up to be an amazingly well thought out game with a great range of weapons, vehicles and a variety of things to do. Follow the main quest, or just go and goomba stop people while driving around shooting your rocket launcher and throwing baseball bats at people. Oh and don't forget the time travel. That's a lovely element of the game.  With a mix of awesome pop culture references, hilarious dialougue, and an overall aura of brilliance to the game, Retro City Rampage is a great game for a great price, Definately would reccomend it, already played for a lot of hours :D ~Savva

269	0	a	It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)

The control is good (with a gamepad), the graphics are full of eye candy and if you can find someone else to play with, it makes for some intense MP racing.   I reviewed the game at Techgage:  http://techgage.com/article/top-down_racing_destruction_death_rally_review/ 
1523	0	a	From what little I played I would NOT recommend this game. It is definately a step back from Flatout 2 and miles behind Flatout Ultimate Carnage....which is a better version of Flatout 2, &lt;--- get this one instead, it's better.

782	1	a	Not a bad simulator. I've driven and worked around trucks before and I like it. Not perfect but entertaining. Cons: Some of the world limits aren't visible so sometimes you bounce off invisible barriers. If you purchase the oversized load trailer and try to take it, it freezes the game. I even tried reinstalling and got the same issue. It needs a tutorial. I had to wait until I got fined to figure out what I was doing which means save regularly because some of the fines can break you off the bat. It's hard to tell what you need to do to be able to hire new employees which btw can be found at hotels. Not sure if it's by the number of contracts or garages or completed shipments.  Pros: It's quite similar to starting a company. You can take loans, buy better equipment, add accessories, hire employees. It's open world so you can just drive around or choose which company you want to ship for. All in all I'd give it a solid 4/5. Enjoy!

41	0	a	The English language is insufficient to fully describe the atrocities this game comprises.  It is an abomination in the eyes of God.  You look at a screen. You aim with a mouse. You shoot cars. You race cars. Their pixelated corpses fly comically through the air.  Sometimes the cars are close. Sometimes theyâre far away.   This isnât racing, but mental exercises in learning to keep a floaty polygon block (referred to in the game as a âcarâ) on a flat and blurry texture map (or âtrackâ) long enough to reach the first curve.  At which point, the oversensitive controls, nonexistent physics and spotty collision detection will invariably send your polygon block lurching wildly into the fuzzy green texture sometimes known as âgrass.â Start over.  âStay one step ahead of the lawâ? The game didnât ship with police included. âRace your modified carâ? It also forgot to ship with actual racing opponents.  â5 different tracksâ? When you try to load the fifth, the game crashesâ¦ âNon-stop drivingâ? Sometimes, when starting a race, the outstanding game engine believes youâve finished and rewards you with a congratulatory screen after five seconds. Genius!  Failure and embarrassment. From a playerâs perspective, Death Rally is an absolute mess. The controls suck. The graphics suck. The music sucks. The multiplayer sucks. Take whatever expectations youâd usually have for a piece of advertising for a Shovel and lower them by a few hundred percent. Tetris is a masterpiece in comparison.  There are some good things about this game.  Thereâs multiplayer. It doesnât work  [but]  thereâs a multiplayer button on the main menu. One beingâ¦that you can quit at anytime. No, wait you canât. In fact, Death Rally crashes your computer everytime you try to quit.  To be fair, there was a comic bookâ¦ created by the same people as the game, though, and published before the gameâs release as obvious promotional material. The comic book contained +18 scenes. Clearly, the designers were too focused on the comic book than on proper programming. But hey! The programmers used only their left hand to create the game, what'd you expect?  -Miyuki 2015

511	1	a	Amazing game, amazing developers, amazing engine, everything about this game is amazing. It's basically an arcade game on steroids. Fast-paced, adrenaline-inducing racing, and the music selection just adds to it. Even though it was made in 2008, it's still one of my most favorite games of all time. After all of the fun I've had so far, I still have yet to play multiplayer! 15/10
1867	0	a	I normally dont write reviews but... for this game i just had to! Because everybody has to know thats its totally extremly and absolutly... â¥â¥â¥â¥. Dont buy it. Dont let the shiny graphics, license and comparison with mario kart blind you into buying this! Why? Because the game mechanics is bad. The team did really a good job on polishing the game. But the mechanics... for example, if you get hit by an enemy extra, you get a double punishment. Not only for the extra that hit you, but also your car is broken now and you drive more slowly. You have to drive trough a pit stop (normally around 2-3 on the map) where you lose AGAIN time to repair your car. If you add the pit stop you get triple punishment... wtf... It also has no kind of fun mechanics like in sega sonic all star racing or mario kart where you can use your skill to get extra boosts. Instead you have Kers... and Jump Boots... where you just have the possibility on some occasions by simple button releasing and pressing to gain an extra boost. Yay again... Please DONT BUY Save your money! I am Sorry for the dev Team, You did a great job with the game overall, but your game lead designer should buy any nintendo mario kart game to see what good game design for fun racers is. Thx

2063	1	a	Really fun game!  The game is a parody of many others such as GTA, Metal Gear Solid, Sonic, and much more! It's packed with references to other games and even game development. The story is basically Back to the Future (and I'm sure it recognizes that) and a big scavenger hunt. You do all of these missions for the Doc to help repair the time machine. The first half of the game is just running around having fun. Once you get to the second half though, it's no more fun and games. The difficulty curve shoots up and the levels will take you a few tries (or a lot). It became a trial and error type game, kind of like Hotline Miami.   The game is definitely worth a buy! 8/10

5902	1	a	As someone who's a fan of both platforming games and racing games, I think SpeedRunners is a fantastic combination of both genres. It's kinda like classic 2D Sonic the Hedgehog with Mario Kart items, and it's hella fun. However, the online multiplayer experience suffers greatly from really bad desync issues. In a game that depends so heavily on the players' positions on the screen, it seems like it would be really important to have everyone's games synchronized, especially in ranked multiplayer.

2060	1	a	Like the GTA series, if the GTA series was good.
20	1	a	I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand its alot of fun to race and blow all your opponents up but on the other hand it can get frustrating to get shot at all the time. I have really enjoyed this game from start to finish even though some of the achievements are nuts and hard to get. The thing that was frustrating for me was the game never fully going in to full screen mode. The option is there but it would never do it for me. The gamemodes can get repetitive at times if you are trying to grind away at kills and other things. The nice thing about all the achievements is that you don't need to play against a live human to get some of them. The 'Online' play can be done with bots, and the achievements for 'Online' can be done just like if you were playing against the computer. The cars can be customize which is a nice feature to have. The controls can feel crazy at first but with some practice you can get really good at fully controlling the car. If you like a full on shooter/racer game then this is the game to get. I mainly got it because I thought the achievements would be easy to get and for the most part they were, but some you will need alot of patience to get. I would say get it but make sure you get it while its on sale, then you will feel like you got your monies worth.

2440	1	a	I wholly recommend this game to everyone. The game has a gorgeous retro-appeal and it's chock-full of funny jokes and references to gaming and 80s pop culture. The best feature of the game are the dozens of different vehicles, weapons and powerups you get to use, most of which are pretty out there. You can drive the car from Back to the Future, wield a sword and shield and fling yourself in the air by farting. All of these can be used to wreak delicious havoc on the city streets.  RCR also offers a lot of bang for your buck. Aside from about 50 story missions, there's two dozen rampages (wreak havoc in a certain way), you can replay some of the sections from the missions for highscores, dozens of skins, multiple color palettes (make it look like a NES or a C64 game), you can play the original version of the game made for the NES and play mods that change the look of the game.  The game is (or was) not entirely without its faults though. While some of the story missions were great fun with a lot of variety, some were also a bit tedious or frustratingly hard. The developer has done a great job dealing addressing those issues though, issuing a few patches that made the frustratring levels more accessible. These imperfections don't ruin the game though.  In the end, the good stuff far outweighs the bad stuff. Take a look at the trailer and if you like what you see, then you won't be disappointed with how the game turns out.

Its all about the winning the races and making a car that can get a 0 - 60 in 5 seconds while plowing through police cars. That being said, the story seems good till you play and in the end youl forget it, but thats not bad, its not good either. But today the racing games have you driving stock cars with nitros installed, so I can't complain.

2161	1	a	With the game being short, while having limited graphics, very limited side-missions, and lack of 'Steam Workshop', Retro City Rampage makes a good, clean alternative to the 'Gran Theft Auto' series....which it parodies, among many other franchises, as well!  As to remind you; THIS GAME IS A PARODY! For $9.99 bucks, it's rather short, and as soon as you beat the game, it's literaly over. For effort, I give this game under the rating of 7/10, saying that it makes a good, clean alternative to 'Gran Theft Auto'. (While of course, being NOWHERE beyond the whole 'PG-13' rating, in humor.)

509	1	a	Itâs the spiritual successor of Rush. Itâs Mario Kart for almost grown up adults. Itâs the racing game for people who find continually trying to drive the perfect lap in Forza or GT tedious yet kind of sort of actually secretly like it. I am a Forza/GT fan who typically despises games like Need for Speed, but I loved this. There are some annoying things like Microsoft basically holding you hostage nearly forcing you to make an account in order to play the damn game. Or the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port aspect â all menus have prompts like press âA and the mouse curser isnât even supported even when friggen annoying Microsoft menus pop up in which you really need a damn mouse. On the plus side it supports non-Xbox controllers. That being said, itâs really a decent game. The racing aspect is super fun and it controls well although thereâs obviously a bit of plasticity as itâs a smash up racing game. Youâre encouraged to run into other players and take high risks in order to get more boost as opposed to just straight racing, so go ahead, have another one and drive sloppy. Thereâre plenty of upgrades for cars albeit not as in depth or complex as Forza or GT. Thereâs a good amount of cars as well so you wonât get bored; thereâs always something to look forward to. And to top it all off thereâs a ridiculous arcade and mini-game section where youâve got to do silly things like make the biggest crash and fling your driver as far and high as possible. This section is particularly fun when you are too high/drunk to actually race. In summary, despite it being poorly ported and having Microsoftâs greasy finger prints all over it, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and ridiculous racer. Having not played any of the other ones in the series, it seems like Carnage is all you need. Apparently it has virtually all the features of 1 &amp; 2 and more and it doesnât blow barnyard animals like 3. Cheers.

The vehicles look very decent, even if they look like a utterly mess.   The soundtrack is very outstanding, it keeps you movitated in annihilating your competitiors from the road or anything that stands on your way.   My rating will be a 9/10

98	1	a	I played the demo of this game for years, back in the 90s, and then the fully game at another point. The game has always been a classic. I think those interested in the racer- shooter genre will be able to appreciate it, despite it's dated graphics - just picture yourself playing a super cool tablet game on your computer instead and you'll do fine =)

1673	1	a	Its so fun! Ridge Racer has come a long way. Feels like pretty polished arcade racer and gives a sense of speed and destructive satisfaction I haven't really felt since Burnout 3: Takedown on PS3. Even for being a 2012 rekease I think it holds up pretty well in 2016 with the visuals and soundtrack. Worth it.  P.S: While some argue it doesn't hold up to the way the original Ridge Racer games were, I'm honestly very ok with this because the old games were not this fun. 1 of the best improvements is the opponent cars actually move or crash when you slam into them.  Also, there is a problem where it cannot connect to the server...but personally, I don't see a need for it and or think it takes away from the enjoyment of the game. Im oldschool though.
1557	0	a	I bought this game, in hope that it would live up to Flatout games standard. Playing it with those hopes, destroys the game. The graphics, game play, the driving method and control, EVERYTHING is different and much more worse compared to Flatout 2. It used to be fun to crash into another car, but not anymore. This game is made so unrealistic, and the camera when you drive, yeah.... the baddest rotation I've ever seen. I really really REALLY loved Flatout 2 and still plays it, but this game is just a disapointment.  If you've played Flatout 2, and hope this new game is the same or even better, Don't buy it.

3953	1	a	The biggest fear I had when playing this game was that I wouldn't be able to control it well. Platform games are a dime a dozen, but one of my biggest banes is always wall jumping. Even in this game, I have trouble wall jumping sometimes.   But never have I had so much fun messing around with a platformer game. First try, maybe you won't do so well, but you'll have a great time playing and figuring it out with friends. Then you'll play again, and again, and with every match you'll be getting better and better at it. But even messing up all the time is one of the funniest parts. Everybody will do it.   I also have to praise the levels. There's a lot going on and you always feel cool when you manage to pull off the perfect swing around a corner or dodge every obstacle in an area. There's levels for beginners and advanced players and there's not stress when playing with your friends on harder levels because the fun of the levels is messing up until you get the hang of it.   This is by far one of the best multiplayer games I've played. Great style, interesting and fun gameplay: all in all a very great game.  Edit: Years later and I still hold the same opinion for this game. While it does have some glitchiness here and there, it is incredibly fun (even when you lose) and heavily skill-based. If you want to win, you need to get good- and it's fun practicing in order to get good. Play on some workshop levels for some extra hectic fun times.

2428	1	a	Definetly recommend to anyone who is a fan of 80's culture and 8 bit video games. I don't think I have managed to catch all the jokes yet. RCR shows how fun can it be to just run around and blow things up. I must warn though that there is pretty significant difficulty spike around the last half of the game. My other gripe is how you lose all your weapons when you die. Other than that anyone who loves parody games will certainly love this 8/10

1378	0	a	This game has nothing to do with the first great two instalments developed by Bugbear as it's developed by a bunch of other people. This game is bad on so many levels that it is hard to find the right words. Do yourself a favor and avoid it if you liked the first two Flatouts, otherwise you'll vomit after 5 minutes into the game.
1303	0	a	Let me give you the TL;DR right now. Worst game ever.  I played a single race (yes I made it that far, so I earned the right to judge the game). I immediately remembered a really funny parody of the FPS games of that era. Duty Calls. Now for those who aren't familiar with this name, let me describe it briefly. Duty Calls is a parody of many FPS games, based on Call of Duty franchise. It was made as an advertisement for Bulletstorm, whose trailer played at the end of this mocking game, with the message being 'nowadays FPS are like the one you just played, here is what it is supposed to be like (Bulletstorm trailer begins)'. Flatout 3 felt exactly like that. 'Here is a crappy racing game to depict everything wrong with racing games today, and now, real Flatout 3 begins where you get to have super fun just like you had in the previous games, even ultimate carnage, which was basically flatout 2 re-sold to you suckers, but turned out to be pretty good anyway'. Disappointment begins... It was no joke, no 'real' Flatout 3 started. Flatout 3 really is the horrible.... ummm..... I can't really say that it's a game.... It's...... a software...... where you control...... no not control........ more like........ watch a car that was based on the drawings of a drunk newborn...... cruise in a city designed by a band of autistic apes...... and think that you contribute to its behaviour by pressing certain buttons on the controller.  Ok jokes aside. Graphics are extremely unfinished. Simple and undetailed, but not intentionally, just due to lack of skill and/or effort. Just look at the screenshots. At the first glance they look pretty decent. Now look closer. Inspect details. Don't tell me it's a 2011 game. Compare it to DiRT or just Flatout UC. You will see it has horrible graphics.  Controls just don't matter. You don't feel in control of the vehicle, not even a little bit. The car just goes vroom vroom. No realism, no control, no fun. For those who will bash me for looking for realism, just go play the previous games. You will see what I mean. Junker cars used to slide, drift, bump, etc. Now they just perfectly hover over the asphalt. When you try to turn, it either doesn't turn enough (if you're too fast), or turns successfully (if you're slow enough). It doesn't drift, slide unless you pull the handbrake. But if you use nitro when your car is aligned with the road, it just immediately and magically stops sliding and continues it's hovering over the road. Here is a short list of games that offer a better and more realistic driving experience: Asphalt 8 (iOS and Android), The Need for Speed (1994), FIFA '96. Also, I'm using a Logitech F710. When I set the controls to the gamepad, it stops working. If I set them to keyboard I can use my gamepad with xinput mode. â¥â¥â¥â¥ logic!  Sounds. There are 4 sounds in total. One of them is the menu sound 'click'. Three in game sounds are 'vroom', 'bfffttt', and 'dufff'. Now 'vroom' is the engine sound made by the cars engines. The sound was produced by a pair of bored game devs, that just made the sound with their mouth. I can almost hear one of them saying 'screw the consumers, they will buy our games anyway', in the middle of the sound recording session, faintly hidden behind the sound of the engine. 'bfffttt' is the sound nitrous makes, and the artistic creation of this amazing sound was most likely based on an air refresher spray. 'dufff' is the collision sound used in every single collision to every single combination of objects. Again, it was probably made by devs dropping a heavy pillow from a distance.   Music. Literally non-existent.  Car tuning. Do you remember the simple, yet fun car modification system Flatout used to offer? It's gone. Here is the new system. 'Would you like to tune the car?' [Yes/No]. If you choose yes, then the car is 'tuned' by standards seen fit by the devs. I swear to god, I am laughing at the stupidity of this, as I'm writing, while crying on the inside because it isn't even slightly exaggerated. Ladies and gentlemen, a new era of modification begins where cars are either 'tuned' or 'aren't'.  Please just watch a single gameplay footage from any source. Even the official game trailers give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is. Don't take any of my word for it. Just look it up on youtube yourself. Watch some videos and see for yourself that every single sentence you read here, is describing that video.  I bought the Complete pack for 10$. I am not sorry because I love Flatout games. I played them on PS2 for long hours. I am glad to have 1, 2 and UC in my steam library for just 10$. But if you want a Flatout game, just buy UC. 2 was better than 1, even though 1 was a pretty solid game itself. And UC is just a graphically and realistically superior game, that is essentially Flatout 2 with additional content.

If you had played Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2, you'll understand the mechanics right away. And even if not? Still not hard to figure out.   Although for the most part it's not especially challenging, some of the minigames can be pretty difficult.    Completely absurd in a wonderful way.

1719	0	a	This game is a reasonable to good racing game with some positives (race statistics are displayed on the background, Sherlock style, which looks really nice). There are three major caviets:  1) The servers are no longer working. This means you have to wait a couple of minutes while the game desperately tries to find them and the game is now single player only.  2) The car mechanics are weird. As others have metioned, drifting feels odd. You have to be able to drift a considerable amount to win.  3) It is very difficult to knock another car off the road (unlike Burnout which takes skill but is feasible) but another car can nudge you if you are on very low damage and cause you to explode in a cloud of rubber, paint, mod kit panels and coconut airfreshners.  This game might be worth trying if it is second hand Vauxall Nova with a Baked Bean exhaust (one lady owner) cheap, but probably left alone otherwise.

1336	0	a	Not the worst driving game ever, but if you loved the hell out of FlatOut 2 and/or FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, then this release by a different developer will be a big disappointment. Still, it's not all that terrible, really, if you're not familiar with the older games (but they did make good effort to address issues). I would still recommend FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage instead (or FlatOut 2 for older computers); and/or if feeling adventurous, the next-gen early access Next Car Game from the ex-FlatOut devs. [Other great similar ones: Burnout Paradise, DiRT Showdown]
387	1	a	My first few races I didn't really care for this game, but after you get use to the drifting and boosting, it becomes really fun. You can drift nearly the whole time, even on straight aways, and it makes it way more fun trying to see how long you can keep it going.

I understand there are other racing sims out there but none like the Need For Speed Franchise. I have owned every version since the beginning of the franchise. I own it for both PC and PS3. EA and everyone else that was involved in the making of the game... keep doing what you do best and that is making the Need For Speed franchise better and better every year

1717	0	a	what if they made burnout but with worse physics and graphics and also handling? hoo boy...here it is. ridge racer unbounded still has its moments but the difficulty feels unfair at times and it gives you little incentive to keep playing, with drab and uninspired environments and cars. also, this game is very much 'bounded' as it's not free roaming, and there's tons of rubber banding. It should be called 'Ridge Racer Un-Unbounded' or 'Bad burnout'. The track builder has potential but nobody cares really

76	1	a	Although a lot of people find this a dreadful game, I played the original A LOT back in the days. It doesn't have that exact same ring to it, but it stays a good game. Just like the original, if you put some effort in it you can outplay the single player campaign in a few hours. It's a bit short, but I had my fun.  The upgrade system has become better and the graphics are very nice and maintain their craziness, like the original game (huge explosions, a bit over the top, but this is fun).  +: good single player, but a bit boresome after you finally have your pimped out max car. +: good fun for spending some time +: good graphics  -: no players found online (to be expected obviously, it's not the most played game on Steam) -: a bit boring after you max out your car -: a bit short single player campaign.  All in all: a good game, especially to be recommended to people who played the original.
3166	1	a	SpeedRunners is a fun racing game to play with friends,it has a great level system and funny powerups.The soundtrack is matching and the characters look very cute.Everything moves so fast which matches as it is a bright fast paced racing game.The game's obstacles are quite annoying yet needed as this game is also a platformer.

704	1	a	Very fun game i suggest the minigame sports, and the physics are very swell i give it a good 9/10
2058	1	a	A good Retro-Game. Tons of Reference , Open-World , Lot of Secret. What a Beautifull game.
1646	1	a	Great fun racer, loads of tracks and cars, and the track editor has been done superb, very easy to make tracks. Graphics are good. Some people i see dont like fact you cant change controller layout, but buttons chosen are same as nearly all racing games, so shouldnt be a problem to most people. Got it on sale, absolute bargain!. :)
1035	1	a	7 out of 10  Go under cover to take down some crooked street racing types.  A very good racing game. Its not the best racing game ever but by far not the worst.  The Good:  1. Good racing action.  2. As with all Need For Speed titles this one has a solid sound track.   The Bad:  3. A bit repetitive. Well its all about street racing isn't it?  4. Its not a new games which shows, but the action makes up for it. 5. A very limited choice of cars.   The Ugly:  6. Some of the cars you are forced to go on mission with are down right pathetic.  7. Some of the latter optional races are near impossible. You can still complete the main story without winning these races.   If you are looking for some enjoyable racing action look no further.

2642	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the games that can be proud that it broke the early access curse and was fully released not too long ago.   SpeedRunners at least in my eyes is one of the most fun games I've played in recent memory. The thrill of being in first and the feeling that you can't be stopped by your opponents is just purely amazing and I think everyone needs to experience it.  In the story mode of SpeedRunners you play as Speedrunner and you try to become the best by overthrowing the other speedrunners.   But enough about the story, let's get into the gameplay:  The entire game is based on speed. You try to outrun all your opponents and the last one alive wins, win three times and you win the game.   Anything goes, you can use weapons,grapling hooks, explosives and all sorts of stuff. Some stuff can backfire on you so be careful on how you use the power ups.  The Graphics are awesome and I love the art style. Everything from animations, backgrounds and characters, everything looks amazing.  The soundtrack at first, I liked, but it get's tiresome really fast and I just really prefer to either mute the game and put on something else or just don't wear headphones.  The main campaign took me 1 hour to finish, and there is some replay value. You can go through the campaign more than a few times and unlock more stuff like maps and characters.   I didn't encounter any issues while running this game and I highly doubt anyone will too, so you are good to go.  Overall I don't have anything bad to say about SpeedRunners. It's an amazing game and I highly suggest you check it out and you will get sucked into it.   Pros: +Great gameplay +Outstanding Art Style +Outstanding multiplayer   Cons: -Incredibly short campaign  Final Rating: 9/10  If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about it.

Cars to get Tier 4: Lotus Elise Tier 3: Nissan Skyline GTR-R34 Tier 2: Lamborghini Gallardo LP-540 Tier 1: Bugatti Veryon or Mclearn F1 Trust me these cars work out for me and I hope you guys have fun.

1047	1	a	Its a very good game especially on highest settings but only has 10-15 hours of gameplay. It is a 7/10 on challening my racing skills.
1025	1	a	its ok. after this the NFS series went downhill.
873	1	a	Simple control... gas, brake, forward tilt, backward tilt, nitro... but really have to judge speed and landing aim well to get the best times and the gold. Good graphics. Engine sound is okay for this type of game, but could have been better. Challenging levels. Reasonalbe menus. Cute design.  But considering the game is already 7 years old, I don't think it's worth $19.99... more like $4.99, or no more than $6.99.  I recommend this game, but not at a highway robbery price.

1947	1	a	No online players anymore.. :( But it's pretty enjoyable for people who likes playing career mode alone or with a friend, absolutely fun. Thumbs up! 
2078	1	a	A parody, a clone, and a Demake all in one. So how come I have more fun with this than GTA 3 or my personal favorite of the series, Vice City? Because it's a great game, with much to do. You may only get about ten hours out of the story if you â¥â¥â¥â¥ around, and possibly sixteen hours to 100% the game, but you'll have fun the entire way, and for ten bucks, that's pretty good. ALSO; YOU CAN ACTUALLY AIM! Finally!
596	1	a	I bought this game shortly after its release in 2008. It is a masterpiece and made me absent of social life and human interaction for two and a half years. Unfortunately, the game isn't as populated as it used to be, and the small player count is based off people of the same nationality and have their own lobbies. They don't usually want other players (especially of different nationalities) and tend to kick you from their lobbies. Other than that the game is outstanding. 10/10
611	1	a	This is a lovely game with gorgeous graphics....very fast indeed, great with xbox gamepad.. be mad , be very madddd  One of the few games you'll never get tired of !  According to some people flatout failed to start up, So you need to install DIRECT X SDK (winsdk_web.exe) first then re-install DirectX from ulitmate carnage's folder..  you may need to delete the DXError.log file in the windows folder.. C:drive&gt;Windows&gt; (scroll down the page and see both) DXError.log file.  If this dosen't works(above) then try download GFWL client  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977844   If you can't log in WLive 'cos you need to have the same password from your microsoft hotmail

461	0	a	I'd say this game was child friendly, but in reality they'd probably find it more frustrating than I did.  Visuals are fine, and there's a surprisingly punchy soundtrack, but it fails mechanically.
1021	1	a	It's more fun than I had on the ps3 years and years back... but it's not that good actually. I seem to have really bad lag for no reason. I'll run Driver San Fransisco on High res, high quality without ANY lag and this is just wow horrible for no reason. It looks like crap and it runs like crap. But... it's still fun. That's why I'm still recommending it, buy it on sale, couple of bucks, why not? But what I don't get is why the worst NFS's are on Steam? Where's Most Wanted, Underground 2, etc. I mean this one is alright but it doesn't look or feel anything like the better ones. It's still fun though.

Any version of the emulator should work, just dump the exe into your Ridge Racer Unbounded folder then create the profiles. It will create the following files in your folder: x360ce.ini xbox360cemu.ini xinput1_3.dll xinputtest.exe  Just not enough vehicles or custimization for me. My 2 year old gets a kick out of it when we play. That is about all it will be used for.

1651	1	a	Honestly, I was expecting another street racer when I bought this, but wow, I was wrong. This game is ridiculous, high speed, destructive fun. It's gameplay is instantly engaging and incredibly satisfying. Every race and event is enjoyable, and going back to get better scores is actually something I enjoyed, and I usually don't like replaying the same level over and over. It's stylish too, with a distinctive colour scheme and very pretty visuals all round. I was lucky enough to get this when it was on sale, and honestly I feel like I paid too little for it. It's worth it's full price easily.
417	0	a	This is one of them trashy games you pick for a few pennies or from a cheap bundle. Game play is okay I guess but itâs fairly buggy with random crashes and invisible walls. Decent amount of cars with extra boosts and power ups but it gets old after a short while. Again okay amount of tracks but they have the same or similar design. The tried with this game but failed and itâs differently not worth itâs 6.99 price. If you can get it cheap enough, then try it but you may find the game to get old very quickly or as I found a little too easy on some racers after youâve got all the fast cars with their upgrades.
1017	1	a	For an old-gen or current-gen game, I am very impressed with the port and the graphics. The graphics make the game seem a bit realistic, the game has beautiful scenery, and its fun racing or getting chased.  9.3/10 - Would High-speed to avoid arrest anytime (well, in the game)

1231	0	a	this game is a shame to the original flatouts, if you think this is good, you're an idiot, and let me go into gtreat lengths about why:  1: has no damage model. a flatout game without a damage model is like nfs 2015 without customization  2: no career mode. this dissapointed me greatly because all other flatout games had one  3: horrid controls  4: blatent rip-offs of todays popular cars, like the mitsubishi evo x (scroll through the car list and you'll see what i mean)  5: the biggest one, THIS ABOMINATION ISN'T EVEN MADE BY BUGBEAR! this is what really gets me, because it's in a pack with games by bugbear, and those games were and still are awesome to this day.

1713	0	a	Don't even bother trying this one. I wonder what kind of miracle happened so this product holds about  70  Metascore rating. This is way over the top, the  'real'  score should be somewhere near 20. It has absolutely NOTHING to show up as an advantage in comparsion to other games of this genre. If you still have an idiotic idea to try this 'reborn' 'classics', better play   Driftopia   - at least, it's free.  It's all the same. Same engine, same 'old school' graphics. Same uncontrollable cars that feel like a flying gliding bricks of iron metal. Same unimaginably frustrating gameplay. The only thing is good here - the soundtrack. That's the ONLY thing.  ..Oh. You can also check my review on   Driftopia    here   P.S.: Small Update, Dec 2015   Ridge Racer Dirftopia   got out like two years ago from now or something. You can guess why.

1656	1	a	Before I say what I need to say what I need to say I want to say that this game is very fun. I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.  The game occurs in a place called shatter bay where you pretty much participate in races and other challenges to prove you're the best driver on the road. You can even make your own courses. But since the servers are gone you can't share them or race anyone online.  Now for my complaints  Very little variety  The cars have a very small selection of colors to choose from, 4 max. The DLC cars get no color change options at all. All of the areas look similar, but they each have something to make them stand out from the other areas. For example Ghost Bay (the final area) is just every area combined, but the area is a lot darker than normal. The gameplay is pretty much Burnout's.  Drifting  I think the drifting in the game needs work, a little too much force and you spin out of control and it's tough to get back into control without resetting your car's position.  Fragging  I know some cars aren't very strong but geez one touch and my car gets totaled at times in the game. I feel like strength doesn't even matter because I can take out one of the strongest cars with the immortal, which has the lowest strength in the game, with ease.  Not that many cars  There is a car that you can only use during the last event in the game  The DLC cars are just reskins of other cars, same stats, same look, everything.  Regardless I think the game is very fun. I don't suggest buying the DLC if you plan on purchasing the game.

5212	1	a	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10
3951	1	a	An awesome party-with-friends game to play with your best buddies, with a large learn curve and a lot of strategy involved.  10/10 would grapple your friends again and screw them aha  Ps: Feels so good when you dodge a grapple doe, especially from your nemesis ahaha

2526	1	a	Here's a simple way of describing this Fantastic Game:  o Grand Theft Auto + 'Ready Player One' by Ernest Cline + Old School Graphics  = Retro City Rampage
1945	1	a	I think the whole grab a key to open a shourt cut thing is very gamebreaking making it almost impossible to catch back up with who grabbed the key and took the short cut. Otherwise, pretty good arcade style racing game.
1179	1	a	do you need a serial key i cant play multiplayer plz help
2086	1	a	This game is great, especially if you are an 80's/90's kid with a love for video game/pop culture nostalgia. The only downsides are that it can get repetetive near the end, and frustrating as well.
1621	1	a	A really intense racing game with several different game modes. It is quite a challenge for me to complete some of the levels. If you're looking for a challenging racing game, this is the game for you.
1046	1	a	I got it on sale for $2.49 and I played it on xbox and I loved it (but then it wasn't working not sure why) so I got it on pc 9.7/10 love it but if you look at it on lowest it looks awfull luckly I can run it on almost max and it looks great I think it is a amazing game and if you don't like racing games then idc what you think of it I love it one of the best need for speed games out there (well atleast i think its one of the best NFS games)
5734	1	a	 Early Access Review
52	1	a	A pretty good remake of the original. It goes 3D while keeping a very similar feel to that old DOS version. It could've done with more cars and tracks though. The sound effects from the original are also not present. Most importantly however, where is Duke!? Recommended but don't throw away your original Death Rally because you won't be 100% satisfied with this one.
18	1	a	I'm recommending the game because, after all, it's still mostly enjoyable top-down racing BUT please do not misunderstand: if you played and enjoyed the original, like me, this remake is not ANYWHERE near as good.  Let me summarize:  The visuals are effective - not great, but good enough. It's obvious that this game was first released on iOS and you can clearly see that the developers did NOT bother to increase the detail on the models (textures might have been improved, hard to tell, but the polygon count is very visibly low). Cars like the Deliverator definitely don't look as cool as they used to in the original, but that's subjective I guess.  Music and sound effects are bare minimum. Music was never a strong point of Death Rally so I'm not too bothered by the rather generic, boring and colorless rock tracks they put into this new version. The sound effects are okay, nothing to criticize too much here.  The biggest issue, to me, is the way they changed the in-game economy (ie. the shops - everything you did between races). In the original DOS game, you had the (legal) shop and the (illegal) black market. You had money and you would make important decisions what upgrade or car to save money for. This was a big part of playing the game and the separation between the clean shop and the dirty blackmarket (where you'd get all the good, ie. illegal, stuff) also added a very nice and grimy aspect to the game. Well, they removed ALL of this in the 2012 release. Now you don't even really have money anymore. Sure, you collect dollars but then, all they do, is fill up 'upgrade bars'. It was amazing to be able to safe cash to finally get to buy that amazing and mysterious Deliverator in the original - now cars don't even cost money anymore! You just unlock them by collecting parts on the race track! Now you just click on the armor, handling or speed bar and it fills it up automatically with your money. That's it.  The fact that they completely omitted the black market is also indicative of another change they made: the atmosphere, the vibe of the game, is now very typically iOS orientated. This new game is almost family-friendly while the old one was dark and, well, just plain cool. The writing used to be excellent, in my opinion, really putting you into that oil-stained illegal street-racing, loan-sharking, drug-collecting world. The new version you're buying here is bland and clean, almost sterile. The writing is bad (literally: there's a lot of typos and language errors in the game) and colorless. Even the interface is generic in its 'brushed metal' look.  Another annoyance is the length of the races. Once again, there's the iOS influence. The race length is between 30 and 50 secs average. It's often times NOT enough to kill opponents and it's definitely never enough to actually get 'into' a race. This is clearly designed to be played on mobile Apple devices on breaks, in the bus or on the train.  There's definitely more issues that set this 2012 version behind the original DOS release but those are the main points of frustration to me. However, as I said above, after all's been said and done, this is STILL enjoyable. The actual gameplay is, despite some flaws, still the same good old top-down driving, shooting and killing fun. I bought this on sale for less than two Euros and, for that price, it's a no-brainer must-buy, no question, I would however regret my purchase had I payed full price for it.

1760	0	a	poorly optimized,overused orange and yellow in color grading to the point where the game looks dull,the soundtracks just dont go with a racing at all,cars handle poorly and the levels are just mediocre at best you cant tell where you can go past them and where you can get stuck,there are some passages that look like a shortcut but when you try to go through it doesnt let you, from what ive heard they have moved away from what the franchise used to be and tried this expirment which is a massive failure, imo the overused orange is to cover up the hideous dated graphics which were dated even at the time of release, online is dead servers are down, the cities unlocking is meh and the customization is merely chosing colors for the car you driver.The only good thing i have to say about this game is the presentation looks nice along with the ridiculos amount of stuff you can blow up, it feels like a poor mans burnout or nfs imho, its hard to recommed this even when its on sale.
2327	1	a	Absolutely fun, would highly recommend this
2345	0	a	This game is terrible.  I'm a kid who grew up in the 80s playing 8 bit games, but this game is just a constant parody of the genre with no actual game. You are constantly watching cinematics in 8 bit style that try to showcase how clever the developer's jokes are when making reference to old games. I mistakenly thought this game might actually have a story, but the game exists as an excuse for the developer to sit us through his sense of humor.

Vehicle handling is horrid, some cars stick to the track like crazy and others with start drifting if you turn even slightly. Really bad aliasing issues reguadless of the setting, Boring power ups. Hitboxes on cars are terrible and invisible walls are everwhere. maps are so-so nothing really special. the toy cars simply don't feel like toy cars. Go grab toybox turbo or blazerush instead.
2	1	a	Death Rally is one of those game that gets lost somewhere between 'Hey this is fun' and 'Hmm, that could've been better..' The game looks pretty solid, but, looks are not everything. As soon as it comes down to the controls you might find yourself a bit lost. Not in the way of not knowing what button to press, bt more like 'Am I this stupid or is the game so sensible?' And to be honest, you won't get an answer. Sure, you need to develop some bit of a 'skill' to operate your vehicle of doom delivery, but you'll never end up with a ride that satisfies your control needs for a full 100% Maybe it's a design choice, maybe it's lack of understanding or interest concerning tuning final gameplay. Another thing is the actual upgrade and rank gaining feature. It's a bit like with that newer game 'Gimbal' looks nice sounds cool, need MORE!. Not enough options and not enough satisfaction for the upgrade part of the game. As a single player game it's a middle thing on the lower part. Let's say 6 out of 10 points regarding final concept. 3 Months more and $50,000 more would have done a lot for this game. Hmm, that probably goes for most games out there. Anyway, as a bargain price Death rally is good enough. But don't buy this at full price. It's not a game to feel bad about, you'll just don't get what you might expect if you buy this because of a similar movie franchise. It has nothing to do with that.

1334	0	a	This game would be an alright game if it didnt have the flatout name. Its actually kinda fun, just get used to the framerate. Nothing above 60 for me. On very very low settings. (AMD quadcore 2.2GHz cpu and AMD Radeon R5 1gb. Not the best, but i should be able to run it better.) You get to unlock tracks and race in unique cars. I had fun playing this for the first time, but i cannot recomend it.  Pros: -unlocking tracks if fun -racing is satisfying -unique cars and gamemodes (i.e. you can kill zombies, drive monstertrucks, ect.)  Cons: -terrible framerate -poorly optimized -doesnt feel like flatout -physics are TERRIBLE -ai isnt great -graphics arent that good for the fps -feels like the devs focused on making more characters, which have no effect on your racing, than real content  Graphics: 4/10 Gameplay:6/10 ai:5/10 satisfaction:7/10 overall: 5/10  GET IT ON SALE IF AT ALL
1999	1	a	Get this if you want to play something fresh.While it looks like just one more 'pixel indie game' at first sight of the screenshots, I assure you it is not.It serves as an example how 'GTA' would look like if we had it in NES/SNES era and has a lot of easter eggs along with a great humor in them.I nominate this game for a âI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Awardâ Award because I think it perfectly suits the category.It may not appeal to a regular 'Grand Theft Auto' fan, but purpose and importance of it's existence is undeniable because it provides a unique perspective to a sandbox genre that we know today.So, take a seat and prepare for your trip back to the future!

1182	0	a	This game sucks!!!!! Throw to the garbage this tutorial, make easier menus. Make open worlds and more to make a good game.  Instead that, this game is a piece of crap!
2006	1	a	When I picked this game up I honestly didn't expect it to be all that mind-boggling, but my mind was boggled almost immediately. A lot of other games in the same style tend to simply have pixellated graphics and vintage sounding chiptune music, leaving them feeling far less authentic than I'd like.  This game does it's very damn hardest to make it feel as real as possible and it does a hell of a job at it. It even allows you to play the unfinished prototype of the game that was actually developed to play on the NES. The music in the game is out of this world in how great and accurate to the era it is.  The story is fun to say the least and I found the humor to be very amusing. The gameplay is incredibly smooth and the controls are very easy to handle, especially when using a suitable controller. Pick up this game already and start running stuff over while stealing other stuff.
127	1	a	If only this game got some working on and more levels(plus a whole lot more recognition), it would've been an even better title! I absolutely love these kind of parkour games with high speed, lots of mobility, strong vibrant colors, etc.  Basically what you do is try to get through a level as fast as possible in one of two different modes, time trail and sphere hunt. The game mechanics are built heavily around momentum and wall-jumping, which is most of what you do to chain throughout the levels in order to perfect your run times. The action takes place in a first-person perspective, but third-person can be activated by pressing G. Your in-game character can be customized with different colors and such, which is always a plus, especially for someone like me who likes to personalize along with my character. There really isn't that much more to it, so it's entirely up to you if you want to try the game or not.  Like most games built on the unreal engine, the framerate is pre-capped at 62 FPS with vertical sync on by default, which can be changed in steamapps-common-inMomentum-Engine-Config-BaseEngine.ini. There you can either change the maximum frame under MaxSmoothedFramerate(search for it with CTRL+F in your text editor), or remove the cap by changing bSmoothFrameRate=TRUE into bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE.  For anyone interrested in a somewhat similar game that's a lot more recent, have a look into Celaria, which is a game on Indiedb that combines this with a lot more elements from Mirror's Edge! It's free since it's in alpha, but I think it so far has a lot of potential!

Thinking about selling a DLC... think better of it, Welcome to Flatout 2.2 ok maybe 2.3 since there are a few more cars, tracks and bots...  But SERIOUSLY.... WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. âZERO originality! A masterpiece of copy-craft.... Goodness me HOW did they pull this off? Honestly I think somehow they tracked down EACH and EVERY SINGLE team member to ensure the game was AN EXACT COPY... And SOMEONE FINANCED IT! âAs you were; tinker with a bit more... Add a little more content then give it a little polish.â   Personally more venom can be directed at:  'Balance' (too many bots now!!!)   A shocking choice in music I've turned it off.... I thought it was THAT BAD.   Needing to install games for windows live (in 'support' directory)  Very easy to get caught on scenery  The positive changes, some of the rear wheel drive cars ARE driveable now.... This might triple the number of driveable cars?   The game is something of a giggle... but I fear the same shortcomings will doom the game. Letâs wait and see? Be warned however.

83	1	a	One of the best vehicular combat games on steam , The controls are horrible remap them before playing it , after a few races it should stabilize.  Grinding is required to understand the tracks as well as unlock weapons on cars .  once you have the missile and Deliverator , The real death rally begins and you start to win . There a few bugs still , the game crashes after you defeat the final boss and the multiplayer is broken:( , i have requested the devlopers for fix no response yet.

I would ask that you fix something in the settings, i change the left and right controls to A and D but every time i exit the game and reopen it, the settings arent saved. it never saves?? Its just annoying having to change the settings everytime i play it. I also wanna suggest that you ad a free roam, so that you can explore the maps at your will without a time constraint or points, just so you can have a bit of fun and get some screen shots and stuff.

1066	1	a	One of my favorite arcade racing games. It has pretty bad graphics even for a 2008 game, it's quite buggy, it has a crappy menu system and poor controller support, and also has unskippable live-action cutscenes that fail to convey anything even resembling a story. However, it has just the right amount of customization, the cars are very fun to drive no matter if it's a Tier 1 or Tier 4 car. The game world is diverse for driving, though again, not in apperance. There's winding country roads, city areas, and long highways where you can take your car all the way to the top of its abilities. 252mph seems to be the speed limit in this game, with a fully upgraded Bugatti Veyron. The police system is just a tad too unforgiving, but it's relatively simple and it is a very, very easy game to learn and quite difficult to master. The game is oftentimes too simple in the beginning no matter what car you choose, but if you choose the wrong car later in the game, you'll have a hard time beating the game. Highly recommended considering its base price on Steam is $10. One playthrough will last almost 20 hours.

After you get to the snow mission in the story section, you can keep replaying it to unlock and upgrade everything (you win about $5k a pop, and since its 5 laps long its easy to just kill everyone on the track). I got my moneys worth at $3.50 its fun for what it is.

Worse still, it doesn't support force feedback. Not the one that makes your controller vibrates but the one that transmit surface, road-feel, grip level and such through your wheel, it doesn't have that.  Anyway, if you want a good looking game but don't care much about controller support then it's a jolly fun game. Once again it doesn't support force-feedback. You have been warned!

515	1	a	This is hilariously fun.  I love the racing mechanics and the destruction derby-style jockeying. The music is great for the most part. The engines sound amazing. You can customize your car. There are multiplayer servers.  Only one downside.  Games for Windows Live.  It's not really that bad, considering the fix is easy. The copy that comes with the game is broken, uninstall it and grab the one from Microsoft's website. That one works and well.  10/10 would fly car into billboard again

This game is probably the greatest thing that has come to the gaming world since Duke Nukem: Forever. And the price is reasonable, I only had to put one mortgage on my house! Everyone should own this game.

At the end of the day, even with its intriguing visual style and gameplay concept, it's just not worth it.

2605	1	a	This has got to be one of the most fun car racing games in this style I have played.  1. Use a gamepad. 2. Put camera mode to 'follow' in the games options menu. 3.

1409	0	a	Maby I was expecting too much. What I wanted from this game was something like Flatout 2, with that fun, cartoony art style and derby/racing game. First off, this game has aggonizingly slow load times and I run this game on a fairly modern computer! The soundtrack is so dark and mysterious which doesn't help with that fun part either. I also dislike how if you looked at Flatout 2 and Flatout 3, you would not see anything that represents each other. Set aside the bad stuff, I do like how this game looks, it looks absolutely goregous and I have to say I wasn't expecting Flatout 3 to be looking this good. I also like how you can finally choose your character which was something that was highly requested throughout the Flatout franchise. I also like how there is a whole new selection of cars to choose from. I don't like how there is no car from any of the previous Flatout games in Flatout 3. The number one thing that really bugs me the most, is the physics of this game, they are NOTHING like any other Flatout games, same with the camera angles. I won't get too much into detail with that because I have so much to rant on about with the camera angles and physics. I will probably play this game again being me who doesn't want to accept the fact that one of his most beloved franchises is now ruined by one simple game. I'd give it a 5/10.

1363	0	a	This game does not deserve to be named FlatOut.  It was NOT made by BugBear.  I'm not being an arrogant â¥â¥â¥ when I say that it looks more like it was made by your 10yo brother as his first attempt at making a game.  FlatOut 2 is the one you want. FO Ultimate Carnage is an upgraded version of FO2 with both benefits and downsides. I'll go and say I like FO2 better because the Bullet GT was ... well ... nerfed, I guess... Too bad, they could have buffed the other cars instead =/
2189	1	a	It's 8-bit GTA. I kinda felt like GTA was getting a little TOO real. So this is a refreshing break.  It's what GTA would have been if it was released on the NES and the NES was actually capable of such an expansive world.  I went to the Casino, spent $500 on a roll of the pokies, won death then died. Then lost $2700 from dying. 10/10. Would play again.

1683	0	a	Can't really recommend this one. Although drifting through a corner certainly gives you an amount of satisfaction, frustration with other elements are plentiful. Results in the race seem heavily dependent on luck, or moreso the absence of bad luck, wich you will have most of the races. The handling feels very mediocre and unpolished.  The scenery or city you race in seems a bit lifeless. The AI is tough as hell, but not in a good way. If you're looking for an arcade racer, i can happily recommend NFS: Hot Pursuit, Blur, Burn-out, Driver: SF or even a Sonic Racer. This one falls short of the quality one would expect from a game in this day and age. I say C-

2431	1	a	This game is a lot like the good old GTA 1 and 2, only with NES-like graphics and music. It also turns into Contra, Super Mario and so on at times, not to mention the minigames you can play in the arcades ingame. Nostalgic, fun and arcade at its finest.  The controls are well thought as well, you can move around with the arrow keys and fire in different directions with WASD and even lock on targets. Driving is also well made but it can get a bit dodgy at times for the sake of retroness. There's also a cover system in game which really surprised me, you can take cover almost anywhere, and then pop out and fire, and get back into cover.  An awesome retro game, only lacking some multiplayer. Great scott! BUY IT NOW!!

1608	1	a	Sadly, this game is just another example of how Bandai Namco can ruin a game with a lot of potential. You can feel the Bugbear influence with the action packed racing, and in some ways, it feels like you are playing Split/Second-lite. If you like arcade racing and can buy the game at a deep discount, I recommend picking it up. However, the online servers have been turned off, which means you will never be able to get 100% of the achievments, if that matters to you. Also, the graphics options are very limited with no brightness adjuster. That sucks because the game is dark.   Then there is the DLC, which is still full price. Can't have a Namco game without lots of DLC.
2458	1	a	Before buying this, make sure you are born before 1990 and you actually possessed a Nintendo Entertainment System: in this case, you will see this game as a funny 8 bit GTA with a ultra-nostalgic flavour, with a nice replayability and rockin' chiptune music. Else, this will be a quite boring and dull game with no significant meaning.

1668	1	a	There are a good few hours of fun to be had here! It's as simple as a racing game gets; you go as fast as possible, drift around corners and smash others out of your way.  The game looks great, plays well (once you get used to the physics that is) and the soundtrack works well (despite not being my cup of tea generally)  The track creation and publishing is a great addition, and I'm sure that it will create many hours of extra play. I love it when developers pull that off well. Portal 2 is so much better for it, and this is too!   Pick it up on sale, and don't expect a serious game people.
431	0	a	I really wish I could reccomend this game because I had rather high hopes for it, but I just feel like I wasted my money. I suppose you can't expect much from an indie game, but there are a lot of things that need work. The graphics aren't terribly interesting, and most tracks just look the same. The tracks themselves aso feel very self-contained, and not like they're part of a bigger world (which is what I'd expect from a game about tiny cars in a big house). The soundtrack is a few rather forgettable songs from some indie band you've invariably never heard of, and it will liekly leave you muting it and playing your own choice of music instead. And last but not least, the whole thing seems like it took big ideas from other racers (small scale, wepons, upgrades, etc), but didn't grasp what made them good. If you're looking for a new Micro Machines or Revolt, try something else. This just doesn't live up to its peers.

993	1	a	Need for Speed undercover the game that ign does not like but i love, and guess what its in HD. but it was made in 2008, the game in my opinion gave me three things I wanted, money, Cars to waste my money on, and infinite combinations. Its all about the winning the races and making a car that can get a 0 - 60 in 5 seconds while plowing through police cars. That being said, the story seems good till you play and in the end youl forget it, but thats not bad, its not good either. But today the racing games have you driving stock cars with nitros installed, so I can't complain.
828	1	a	wow if you want the apolyptic vision of the future imagine no further. take your bike on a spin around the tracks and see what can do. you can do a flip and land it, despite yourself. don't give it too much thought just ride like romantic image of motorcycles from the books, and when you had a thought about playing this game you should.

The story isn't exactly anything to write home about, but that's easily forgiven with how 'mature' this game is. From potshots at gaming companies, cameos out the whazoo from game devs and gaming icons alike, lookalike and soundalike references from games of the past and mixed in with a lot of tongue-in-cheek wisecracks that are designed to get you to bust a gut out laughing, there is absolutely no reason as to why this title should not be in your collection.

Combine that with near flawless AI that will nail turns perfectly while you struggle and no multiplayer servers (wasn't a big deal to me, but could be to others), and it's a game I can't recommend for any price.

1650	1	a	I've never been a huge fan of racing games. I have enjoyed the less realistic ones like Need For Speed, Burnout, and Ridge Racer.   This game differs from the old Ridge Racers games I used to play on the PS2 back in the day. RR: Unbounded is like Burnout and Ridge Racer got together and had a baby.   Its not straight arcade racing like the past RR games and its not over the top crashing like the Burnout Series. Its a great blend of the two with some nice Drifting elements thrown in. Its by no means a cakewalk. Heck the very first track you play I had to re-do numerous times and then eventually had to go back and finish it again with a better unlocked car to get first place.   If you miss the old Burnout games (not the turd that was paradise) and enjoy the Ridge Racer series then this is a definiate must buy at under $4. Lots of great gaming to be had right here!!!

1798	0	a	There's primarily two ways to go for a racing game. You can try to emphasize fun, or you can go for realism; rewarding skill and focus.   Ridge Racer Unbounded does neither. It feels as if someone received instructions on how to code and design a 'racing game' via telephone, while having no prior experience in creating such.   Avoid.
2397	1	a	Retro City Rampage is set in an old-school town, where you play as a person named ''Player'', who accidentally sent himself to the future, where he sees what has happened to the town now named ''Theftropolis'' after his rampaging. There is a lot to say about this game, it is mostly funny references, the protagonist's name being ''Player'' is a dead giveaway that this game is focused on comedy. It has no bugs that I have seen or heard from. There are some problems, for example, if you move too fast, you might get motion sick. It also has a scoring system, this makes the game far more addicting, I keep coming back to play the game, so I can built up my score. This game also reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, because it views the player from the top, it has a scoring system and the tendency to drive on sidewalks and run over people. My rating: 9/10

524	1	a	*I don't have much time but I had this game on XBOX*  Overall it is a great game and I think it is the best game in the series. Graphics where good at the time and still look alright today. One think about this game is setting it up for the first time. You have to make a Games For Windows Account which is pretty difficult considering it isen't really supported anymore. Just to launch the game you have to have it installed but you can still get the installer from the Microsoft website. Once you get into the game you HAVE TO connect to Games For Windows to save your progress. Which isen't hard but it has to happen lol. As far as gameplay goes it is like any other racing game but I think it is better in a way. There a minigames and stuff like that and has come to be my favorite racing game ever. Yea sorry for this rant.

2403	1	a	Better than GTA V. Do I smell butthurt? DEAL WITH IT.  GTA5's humor is not crafted like this game. From obvious references to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Contra to the more subtle and obscure Wayne's World and Apple 2 references. And the gameplay is basically GTA1+. So if you don't like that you won't like this unless you love parody games. I like this game alot! Slightly overpriced though, so get it on a deal at some point.

1836	0	a	Terrible stuttering issues where the game slows down and speeds up with no apparent reason. Drifting is inconsistent and seems to not work consistently, sometimes you don't drift at all and sometimes you do a spin. Collision damage seems unpredictable, sometimes you'll wreck another car with a tap and sometimes you'll hit them at high speed while boosting and get nothing for it.  Also, too many obstacles that slow you down (rather than destroy you). The game tries to be fast paced, but obstacles that force you to stop/spin around/slow down massively ruin the flow. Seems like to get the pace it wants a collision should either wreck you, or slow you down a tiny bit. You end up wasting time trying to turn a sluggish-â¥â¥â¥ car around, wishing you'd hit the obstacle that little bit harder to get wrecked because then you'd get back in the race faster.

135	1	a	If only this game got some working on and more levels(plus a whole lot more recognition), it would've been an even better title! I absolutely love these kind of parkour games with high speed, lots of mobility, strong vibrant colors, etc.  Basically what you do is try to get through a level as fast as possible in one of two different modes, time trail and sphere hunt. The game mechanics are built heavily around momentum and wall-jumping, which is most of what you do to chain throughout the levels in order to perfect your run times. The action takes place in a first-person perspective, but third-person can be activated by pressing G. Your in-game character can be customized with different colors and such, which is always a plus, especially for someone like me who likes to personalize along with my character. There really isn't that much more to it, so it's entirely up to you if you want to try the game or not.  Like most games built on the unreal engine, the framerate is pre-capped at 62 FPS with vertical sync on by default, which can be changed in steamapps-common-inMomentum-Engine-Config-BaseEngine.ini. There you can either change the maximum frame under MaxSmoothedFramerate(search for it with CTRL+F in your text editor), or remove the cap by changing bSmoothFrameRate=TRUE into bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE.  For anyone interrested in a somewhat similar game that's a lot more recent, have a look into Celaria, which is a game on Indiedb that combines this with a lot more elements from Mirror's Edge! It's free since it's in alpha, but I think it so far has a lot of potential!
429	0	a	This is horrible! You can drive thru some obstacles, and others have invisible walls.  The physics are wonky at best, useless at worst. You can't invite people to multiplayer or actually start and/or end the races. You have to wait for a rediculous timer. 'Online multiplayer' seems to mean lan play. Every time you get back to the lobby, your car and color choices have been reset.  On the plus side, you can turn off the music.

5913	1	a	PROS: -SUPER fun game! Either ranked or unranked, you will have fun, trust me! -Has ranked and unranked modes -Community is very very very nice 99% of the time. -No hackers -Very few smurfs to ruin your experience (1%, maybe?)  CONS: -Matchmaking system is pretty bad. You can go against people a LOT better than you. If you are in entry league (lowest rank), you might end up playing against silver league players (that's high) -Can get pretty frustrating if you are going against people much better than you in ranked (but if that's the case, just go ahead and play unranked .-.). -Community is small and probably will be until the devs decide to lower the price of the game.  8/10 Would DEFINITELY recommend speeedrunners

903	1	a	This got quite a lot of bad press, but for me it was one of my favorite Need for Speed titles because of it's open wold like feel. It was quite similar to the first Test Drive unlimited, tohugh with slightly better graphics in that you could wander aroun the large area covering several smalll towns and pick up missions as and when you felt like it.   It's well worth picking up when Steam have one of their sales. you'll probably get it for a few pounds. It doesn't have race tracks, basically this is a road racer unlike the next two titles in the seris. :)

2887	1	a	I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only played through the story mode, but I feel like that actually captures the essene of what the game is, if not the entire spirit of it.  I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow. I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game. Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?  The game is hectic. Chaotic. Deliightfully retro. There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish. Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration. I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too. Probably a party.  Long story short: buy it. It's a good time, even on your own. It only gets better from there.

5893	1	a	A return to what games are supposed to be, addictive and just fun.  Speedrunners is a wonderful return to the fun platforming days of the NES. This is a quick to learn, yet difficult to master game that is simply just fun to play, and can be enjoyed in just a few minutes.   Essentially, the crux of the game is to just run and beat your competitors by being the last one still running. However, there is much the game and other players can throw at you to insure that is not always as simple as it sounds.  Gameplay is a wonderful mash-up of old-school NES platformers. Gameplay can best be described as a mix of Super Metroid, Bionic Commando and Mario Kart all rolled into one. You and three other racers (bots, online or even local games) charge through dozens of different levels jumping, ducking, sliding, avoiding boxes, swinging on grappling hooks, and shooting different weapons at other racers. In addition, the screen itself starts to slowly get smaller and you must maximize your speed and minimize mistakes. Game winners are determined by whoever wins three rounds first, and rounds themselves are over quickly, this is a great game to play if you can only dedicate a little time to gaming.   This is a fantastic game that I recommend to all.

44	0	a	In my eyes is this game unbelievable junk. I played original and lot of similar games on market so I can say I can compare.
2551	0	a	This game is missing the joy of a true skill-based racing experience. It has some of the most obvious rubber-banding I've ever seen. You easily pass the lead car then it will suddenly become fast and pass you after awhile almost no matter what. It doesn't feel like its about driving skill but rather about timing of taking the lead at the right time so the rubber-banding will not take effect until after you have passed the finish line. The AI cars will try to take you out if you are near them, even if it costs them race position. For instance, I was heading down a straight section of track nowhere near a corner and when I came up to another car it made a sharp left turn straight towards the wall to knock me off course. The turning of your car is so sharp and immediate that it doesn't feel like it is a real car and it makes it difficult to try to drive a perfect line around the course, which again subtracts from the skill-based aspect you expect to find in a racing game. Also, the camera is very disorienting and probably could cause some people to have motion sickness. Overall I think a person would be lucky to get more than 4 hours of enjoyment out of this game before becoming bored.

1628	1	a	If you can catch this on sale definitely pick it up. This isn't a racing sim. And it's no Need for Speed. But it is fun arcade style racing with decent graphics even for 2015. There's also a race track editor but I haven't played with it yet. And it seems you unlock more parts for the track editor as you race in single player. So it has a nice side incentive to racing.  Multiplayer doesn't work and the servers have been taken down. But for single player action type racing it's worth $3 to $5 sale price.

Worst racing game ive ever played  -Edit- Decided that it might be with my pc, so now that I have a new PC that can outdo the graphics  So I reinstalled the game  One of the worst decisions of my life  Still, the worst racing game on the market. Steering is STILL off, even with a new pc. If I could, I would give this game away to anyone. To the point where I want it REMOVED from my steam account. Dont even want it attatched with my name.  The graphics are good, they really are. I will admit that. The layout and the races are good too. But the steering.... HOW CAN THEY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THAT UP. The steering is off, it always has been. From the moment you move the joystick to steer/hit the button to steer, it will wait a little less then a second and THEN steer. Its as if it has input lag like a HDMI tv and a low end console.   Once they fix that, which I doubt they will ever do. I will never touch this game again.

It is also exceedingly frustrating that the AI will ram into each other, the player, and course items and take absolutely no damage whereas they can pretty much total the player's kart from the very start of the race and seemingly at will any time during its duration.   Bottom line: Stay away from this kart racer unless you are a masochist, or want to give a gift to a person you hate.

The way the cars 'feel' when driving is lame, way too arcadey. The tracks suck, and there's no flow what-so-ever. Also didn't care for the lack of a 'Campaign' for single player. It's just free-race mode. Please don't waste your time on this one. Play Flatout 2 or 4. Both are far superior.

Well I played Ridge Racer Type 4 in Playstation 1 and really enjoy the track and handling (not to mention the energetic music tracks). This version is a poor rip-off of Burnout that the drift mechanics wasn't explained throughly, making me lost control most of time. The AI is cheap as every time I use boost, I can't cut them off unless I'm real close to 'frag' (crash) them.  As said before the handling of cars is poor and the music is forgettable. Even dozen of DLCs won't saved it. Better off with Burnout Paradise.

2176	1	a	Awesome game get it got it on xbox 360 first then here worth every penny FUN fun FUN Would buy again even if I had to trade the last Ben&amp;Jerrys box on earth. It would be empty, of course. I'm not stupid. But I'll get away with this awesome, fun, ridiculous, fun, sometimes high paced, fun, sometimes challenging, AWESOME, game of lets-play-something-where-we-can-just-â¥â¥â¥â¥-around-and-wont-have-to-do-anything-cause-i-don-wanna-get-up-from-the-couch.  10 out of 8 would pay double for the game.     I think you got me after all that...
2324	1	a	This game is basically like Grand Theft Auto 1, if it came out on the NES.  The music is good, the gameplay is good on the whole and it has a good sense of humour and tons of references to 80s and 90s movies, shows and games.  From Saved by the Bell, to Ninja Turtles, to Back to the Future and Metal Gear Solid, nothing is sacred!  There's also some sweet arcade games based on Super Meat Boy, Bit Trip Runner, and Epic Meal Time .

1007	1	a	Definately one of the best NFS games that has been released. This game although the graphics are simple provides the perfect storyline and the perfect gameplay for anyone. Even if your computer is not very good for most games this game has low specs so that almost any computer would run it. NFS Undercover runs with no lag and offers accurate versions of cars and what is most to love by any car enthusiast is that it includes the almighty 1969 Shelby GT500 and also includes the other great cars like the classic Dodge Charger. This game is perfect from head to toe and is a no brainer to purchase. 10/10

1454	1	a	If you like offbeat car racing games, Flatout 3 is a game worth buying. It has 9 modes that include all of the old modes such as stuntman and demolition derby, Thereâs also Monster Trucks, Speed Racing, Off Road, one called Night Shift where you race at night and another that has 50 different challenges. Many more than previous titles in the series.  That said, I was really disappointed with the graphics and vehicle handling. Graphics seem to have taken a retrograde step and handling is much more difficult in Flatout 3. Overall I donât regret purchasing this title, but itâs not what I expected. If you are familiar with the previous Flatout titles youâll see what I mean. Bugbear Entertainment disappeared back in 2007 so a new developer has created this new title and probably explains the differences. At this time, after trying all the modes I much prefer the previous game Flatout: Ultimate Carnage.

1961	1	a	This game might honestly be one of my favorite games ever. There's a lot of fun to be had here, and the number of good things immensely outweighs the bad.  Pros: -Awesome visuals. -Fantastic soundtrack. -Absurd yet hilarious dialogue. -A large open world to explore with lots of neat places to visit. -A fun story mode with fun yet challenging side missions. -Tons of customizable visual filters to spruce up the viewing experience. -Loads of references to video game and moie characters of times past. -Minigames inside of a game. Always welcomed.  Cons:  -The core gameplay finds itself to be a little bit repetitive, but it's still fun nonetheless.   This game just a blast and, like I said earlier, one of my favorite games of all time. It's loaded with charm and obvious care from the developer. It's SO worth paying the full price for, you won't regret it. 10/10.
787	1	a	I personally love dirt track racing and try to watch as often as my local track run. Sprint Cars Road to Knoxville is a great game IF you love dirt track racing. The game is very specific to dirt track fans, and while not perfect, is the best one that is still readily available. Although to be frank, some playstation 2 models were indeed better games but are harder to get ahold of now. If you cannot race with a keyboard, I wouldn't bother because some seem not to work. The car sound can occasionally be garbled, and sounds bad but isn't detrimental to the gameplay itself. Also, I've seen many gripe about creating drivers taking forever. You don't have to, as long as your driving you can hire the cheapest driver and get to work. If you love dirt track racing, I think you'll find this game soothing enough to eat up some of your day.  Good luck and hope this was helpful.

1890	0	a	One of the biggest disappointments of the triple-A titles this year. Cheap AI, uninspired tracks, and boring multiplayer.
2420	1	a	8-bit spoof supreme. Retro city rampage is a spoof of several games and movies and will throw you for a thrill ride. The easiest comparison to this game is 8-bit grandtheft auto/saints row chaos. You will classicly only have your 3 hearts as lives inwhich you'll need to find more throughout your world as you do whatever the hell you want.  This game is packed with random missions and mini-games for the player to do alongside the random main storyline of the player. Long story short, you're in a pixel world and your a ganster... GOOMBA STOMP. yes, they allow you to goomba stomp. Ontop of goomba stomping you have a large arsinal of weapons at your disposal that you will pick up between smg's pistols, cricket bats, baseball bats, crowbars and stealing peoples cars to run over masses of people.  Overview: Pros: The randomness and silly chaos of this game is exciting and never gets boring along with the dozens of chaos filled mini-games scattered about such as USE THIS TANK AND BLOW UP THINGS TO GET POINTS or use a smg to shoot as many things to get points ect. Its a relatively silly game and has spoofs that people will instantly know when they come up such as back to the future and mario's goomba stomp.  Cons: The only cons about this game that may bother someone is if you do not save frequently - this is a retro game you will lose all your things even if you have hearts remaining. This may frustrate some people as they lose their mass arsinal of weaons.  Final thoughts: when this game is on sale for a few bucks I would highly reccomend picking it up if you're into 8-bit chaos. The graphics reminds me a little of terraria and its alot of fun to casually play every so often. All and all, it was worth the $4 I spent on it and even possibly its full price.

727	1	a	This game runs perfectly on Windows 10 still. The fact is, it's an old game from SCS published around 2007 as one of 18 Wheels of Steel series. SCS is also the author of the overwhelmingly postive Euro Track Simulator 2. Theme of this game is logistics, you buy a tow track, transporting stuffs like evacuator, to destination anywhere you want from job list.  However since this game is pretty old, it has poor sorta suck 3D support IMO (Prism3d engine? Not even heard of that), plus AI is dull to hell. When you meet cops, just cut out the engine and wait there. After a while you can continue, or just save &amp; reload (a little bit tricky). I coulnd't find anywhere like this amidst countries I've been to.  A simulator of real life circumstances/experience should provide acceptable graphics for targets at least, but this game is not that case. If you enjoy truck driving, buy it without regret but don't expect too much. It can't offer you endlessly fun in game, but only driving, what, you mean you want to enjoy the landscape? You will feel sorry about that again. For kids in new era, don't expect them whiling hours in 18WOS ALH.  I suggest you all buying ETS2 since it has massive imporvements of graphics, less bugs like falling from ground or suddenly out of screen, and more intelligent elements regarding AI, and so on. If you insist on buying this for whatever reason, do it during sales.

1195	1	a	I bought Off Road Drive awhile back, and I can honestly say it's the closest to reality out of all other off roading games I've played. It's awesome, almost as fun as off roading for real. But, it's not without it's flaws. The first one I noticed is that despite it's description there is no snow courses in the entire game. Another is that for game modes you have a choice of career or.. career. While you can go back and replay courses, you can't choose the exact track you want to play on, rather you have to play an entire series of tracks. Oh and I should note that if you lose in the series while replaying it will override your previously clearing it and possibly make trucks you've unlocked unavailible. But the biggest flaw is that the game does not have a free roaming mode, and is abosultely humorless if you try and do anything other than drive on the course in the exact way it wants you to.   I wouldn't have bothered with writing a review if I hadn't noticed that 1c just released a French translation a short while ago, which must mean the developers still care about the game on some level, and perhaps they'll listen to me. Please add a mode where the game doesnt force you back on to the track. Possibly add inverted courses to change it up a bit. And maybe add some snow tracks if the first two things end up being easy fixes. Don't let this game's potential go to waste! :)  TL;DR Game is good if you get into real off roading, but don't expect to have as much freedom as you'd have in an older game like MotorM4x.

1732	0	a	You're in your twenties and you still jerk off to cartoons, other questionable material, and play make believe on imageboards infested with pedophiles and children with too much time on their hands, with parents who punish their children in the form of timeouts and soft-spoken words used as intimidation. Do you see what's going on? You are going nowhere, you sit in your room all day and think about the most asinine â¥â¥â¥â¥, but you don't progress, you stay stagnant. As the years go by, you fall deeper into the abyss of degeneracy. You're depression gets worse, you start to pick up fetishes you never once dreamed of and you hoard pee bottles and shower maybe once a month at best. You find solace in other people on various communities that are just like you.   You think being a neet and collecting social security is a great thing. You make fun of people who work calling them 'wage-slaves', but you've never worked in your life. You're parents probably hate your guts, but that's not all of your fault, the fault lies with them partially, for not being their enough or not parenting the way they should have. Or maybe they enable you, because they love you so much, and know that there is something wrong with you, but you choose not to get help. You will always stay the same.   You are probably logged in right now, you've been logged in all week and during the entire week, you did nothing. On the off chance you are one of the unlucky ones you will die of thromboses, but hey, it's better to die, than to die trying. That's ok though, because I forgive you for who you are, and I forgive humanity for what it is. We are all lost to time eventually, some of us make it and some of us don't. The world isn't just, life is what you make it.

1238	0	a	The worst incarnation of this series; this game was not developed by the original dev team of Flatout 1, Flatout 2, and Flatout: Ultimate carnage.  While the previous titles sported a delicate balance of racing, wrecking, and arcade-like elements... this game throws it out the window and shares little in common with previous games aside from the genre of being a demolition-style racing game and it's title.  Visually the game looks worse than it's predecessor. The two are not even comparable; It looks more like a game I would have expected to play on the originally PlayStation or maybe an arcade.  Game-play-wise the cars have no real 'life' to them, and again feel like something I would expect from an arcade game I pop $1 into. In previous iterations, cars felt like they had weight; you could slide beautifully around dirt corners, drift through tight turns, and could manipulate AI cars by using your force/speed/inertia. All that is gone in this game; even the most difficult looking turns are easily mastered by simply momentarily letting off the gas and simply hitting your left or right key; gone are the days of worrying about oversteer, understeer, or compensating for loss of traction. Even the ways cars bounce off each other seems more like you are in a pinball machine getting popped around by the bumpers --- you don't really have much control or force over other AI vehicles so you are at their mercy if their 'line' gets in your way.  Also gone are the days of customizing your car tuning. Probably one of my favorite parts of any racing sim or, for lack of a better term, any 'car game' in general is the ability to swap X for Y and make your car, YOUR car. All the white knuckle driving done to take 1st pays off for that next much wanted upgrade. Not here ---- you pick from the standard layout of cars, and then you can pick from 2 or 3 different pre-defined 'tuning' settings which invariably just give you more speed for less durability or vice versa. But in reality, it doesn't matter because EVERY CAR FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME.  I'm not usually too harsh but I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for an arcade-style racing game I am sure there are many alternatives that would be better. If you are looking at this game because you've player previous FlatOut games, then skip it entirely as it is not the same development team and therefore not the same game at all. I've just installed 'DiRT Showdown' and while it seems a little different than flatout, it has many of the same feelings and elements and a bit more up-to-date graphics. I have also heard that the original developers of FlatOut have been developing/developed already a new demolition racing game which I will be eager to check out, so maybe do a quick google if you would be interested in that!

4359	1	a	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10

2037	1	a	This game is amazing! I love retro games and if you loved em I have a good feeling you will enjoy this game. The story is great and you will have a blast just pointing out all the old school game references. It's fun as hell!! AND it offers tons of video options that just make the game so much more fun to play with scan lines and different old system colors, arcade cabinet style and many many others.. it feels like emulating the classic consoles and monitors. I could tell you more but I think you should experience this game youself!

2141	1	a	So I found this game in my basement the other day and I decided to pop it into the toaster. It was all burnt up and the copy got destroyed. So then I decided to go and steal it from the Steam Store and it play it on my computer.  Upon actually getting into the game itself, I found myself attacked by a bunch of nerd-drawings all over the place! At first I was a little startled, then I realised that upon pressing my Xbox 360 controller's guide button, I was actually still sitting in my caddie playing on my Xbox 360! It was a little jarring to see that they had made another old game again.  So after about an hour of cursing at the game and making up my own words with the f-bomb attached to them, I decided to get really mad. I pulled the game out of my Sega Master System and threw it into my fireplace/smashed it with a hammer/made it 'explode'/cuss at it for an extended period of time/let Mike Matei play it. I then told everyone to never play this game and went back to making my feature-length movie about old games.  Thumbs up if you're an 80s kid.

1340	0	a	This game is horrible, it is not the flatout we know and love (if you are a fan). I was a fan of all of the previous flatout games, but this is trash with my reasons for calling this below.   1. The physics of the car feels like you're driving on ice, and the cars don't respond as expected at all. 2.The menu system is horrible. 3.It looks like they picked random models online and gave them names and a random bio. 4.The game is no-longer made by bugbear interactive, this is probably why its completely different. Its still published by the same company however. 5.This game doesn't feel like a member of the flatout series at all, i wish they would have released it as something else.  Things they got right?: 1. Integrated music player, its nice having your own music.   I really wanted to like this and i was genuinely excited to see it appear, but now i'm just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off one of my favorite racing game series has been ruined completely. Stick to flatout 1 &amp; 2!!!

2226	0	a	ATTENTION: I recommened buying over Humble Store, when it is on sale!!!  Simply start playing the story. Do not start playing the game with open world ambitions. The world is too small and the retro style music is too annoying over time. That said get it over with, do some challenges and have some 'retro-feel'. Oh before I totally forget it, it is a game with many hints about other games , movies, cartoons etc. That is it in a nutshell... for 50% off it is a solid buy for random fun, nothing serious and you should really tune down that cr4ppy retro music! *blerch*

262	0	a	A simplistic mobile game with awful controls.   PROS: -Graphics are amusing  CONS: -Controls are awful and heavily oversteer (in a game with 4 buttons total that is all about speed runs and control...) -Mobile game -Awkward, exaggerated physics  The game itself is extremely simple: you accelerate your truck (going from left to right) with a bunch of animals loose in the back. As you hit bumps, jumps, etc, you have to even out so the animals dont fall out of the back of the truck.   Sounds simple, but due to over-exaggerated physics and awful controls this one leads to a frustrating experience. The 'Easy' levels were enough for me.

1593	1	a	Well, it's not really Ridge Racer. I mean, there's drifting.. and there's a heavy arcade feel to it. That's it.  I'll keep things short. Unbounded is not bad, not bad AT ALL. Graphics are fine, sense of speed is ok. Handling is something you need to get use to, but nothing awful. Yes, track design lacks a real punch and the difficulty can be frustrating. But in the other hand - Unbounded is a fun game, being a weird, twisted child of Ridge Racer and Burnout/Flatout. If you find it on sale, for about 3-5â¬, it's defnitly worth it!   Yes, there's plenty other, better racing games.But i still find Unbounded charming and... it puts me in a special mood. This game killed Ridge Racer franchise. Not because it's bad - developers just didn't know what to do with it. Innovate or stay the same? It's all sad, i remember playing Ridge Racer on original Playstation.   Oh well. Try Unbounded. It has a demo, so why not ?

This game is exactly the type of thing I've always wanted. It's a retro-style game with a fantastic sense of style, a fast and fluid gameplay dynamic, and just 'more' of what made the old days of gaming so great.

1759	0	a	Guys this is kinda bad.  Doesn't really play like a Ridge Racer game, doesn't really have a tutorial so figuring out the not-so-arcadey drifting is kind of a mess, and it's actually got a huge â¥â¥â¥â¥ move in that most of the early cars are just... not good. At all. Like, 'potentially impossible to get first place' not good.  There are high points, but you're gonna have the opposite of fun getting to them. When the game gets silly it's awesome. Time trial courses in what are effectively Mario Kart cities with jumps and halfpipes and things are great. There is a mode where you're in a â¥â¥â¥â¥off-huge big rig just smashing through cop cars which is also snazzy. The problem is the RACING sucks. Even the DLC is underwhelming: oh, I have Pac-Man and Soul Caliber and other Namco cars? Oh they're... they're just the awful starter cars with a new paintjob? Oh.  :(

934	1	a	I know it says I have little time played but I have plalyed it for a long time on the PS3(Not Anymore) But I figured I'd leave a review for the hell of it...  In the end I vote the game 8/10.  The story is cheesy and feels like almost no work is put into it, you see scenes with cops, handling stuff... Chase Linh shooting a guy... and some gangsters, but in the game play itself all you have is driving, most of what the player does doesn't feel connected to the scenes/story line.  My goal each time I have played was to complete the lame story ASAP to unlock the map, tracks, cars, etc..  Those are the best aspects of the game. You get all the good vinyl cusomiztions from older games like NFS Carbon. You get an extensive car list, featuring EU, Japan, and American models.  The track and world is the largest map(I have seen in a NFS Title) - and I've played every NFS since HP II on PS2.   You have your standard freeroam, and cop chases like the old Carbon and Most Wanted did.  There is a huge selection of tracks and game modes, like High Way Battle where you struggle to gain 1000 feet ahead of the other car, while avoiding HUGE levels of traffic(comparing traffic to other NFS games).   My personal favorite track is 'East I-85' its the best track for me because it's an all interstate course, and you can really test the handling and top speed of cars.   Next I will discuss the handling and driving, it is not bad, it is different from other NFS games.  You can do more realistic moves with your cars than in other games, but some times the handling is overkill, put max parts on a high end car, you can catch yourself turning, then snapping into an object as if the object were attracting you.   It's easier to drive if you don't hold it left or right for too long, or use nos while turning.   Next I will discuss the glitches, there is lots of them. I've plalyed online matches where players could, on some tracks, exploit the driving engine and launch over clear barriers(and basically access a online-like freeroam)  There is also this god-awful(but halarious) falling glitch, where you begin a race and upon starting you fall in the ground, stuck at 460mph(rounded that up), and the car doesn't reset. This glitch happens randomly and you basically have to wait to loe or quit :P  There is other glitches... I turned too hard eon time using the Audi R8?(Le Mans?, forgot) and hit an object, bounced several hundred meters in the air doing almost endless flips.   You can also reset your car during freeroam and quickly drive inside a civilian car before your car becomes solid, then pause, swap cars, and you can twitch, flip, and do odd stunts involving yourself and your little civilian :D I made a semi truck literally bounce away doing that one.   The glitches are fun, helps make up for the bad textures and story.  Yeah the sky textures, and ground textures aren't great. The ground almost seems yellow, yellow concrete... ew. The car details are great, and that's probably the best part.   Then we have the music. It's what you expect from any EA game, you get a random list of songs(that were popular when what ever game was released). Rock, Rap, and some Techno stuff, similar to MW 05 song list and Burnout 3.  8/10 game, would launch the semi again.

It's primarily nostalgia-bate, but it plays great, and as an open world game is actually has more mommentum and a brisker, more satisfying pace than it's contemporaries. Mostly good looking, but sometimes it can be a little forgettable. I mostly recommend it, especially if you haven't played it.

A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person 'dies' by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.

It's bizarrely bad, the kind of bad that makes you pause in awe of its epic, sweeping suckitude and instills you with the immediate urge to warn other people lest their lives too will be tainted. There is no point in getting into details about the different aspects of this game. Just assume it's worse than any racing game you have ever played in every aspect.  I'm not exaggerating. Don't be like me. It's not too late for you. You can still save yourself.  Don't get FlatOut. It doesn't run on modern machines. Don't get FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. It's Windows Live. Get FlatOut 2 and wait for Next Car Game.

224	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based 2D racing game, much like Trials. You have two goals: get to the goal as quickly as possible, and keep as many stuffed animals in the back as possible. To complete the stages, you need to perform both tasks well enough, with more rewards for a speed run or a perfect run. I found it to be a lot of fun. Getting through the levels with both speed and grace is an entertaining challenge.  The truck controls decently well and the art is vibrant, though the sound is a ittle obnoxious. The game doesn't seem to have the same skill/strategy depth as Trials, but there is quite a lot to do, and getting through the harder levels can be very difficult. I found that this game is best played in short sessions (though, for later levels, a short session may not be enough time to accomplish much).  If Snuggle Truck looks at all interesting to you, it will be well worth your five dollars.

After the less then stellar Pro Street, i was extremely hyped for this game at the time and when i played it, initially i thought it was an absolute blast and lived up to Most Wanted in every way.   But again, that was in 2008. How does the game hold up to today's standards?  Well. Suprisingly well id say. Its not even close to how good i thought it was back in the day (Bare in mind, this was back when i loved racing games and i was a Total NFS fanboy) but its still a pretty exciting racer and the hate it received wasnt exactly what it deserved. It truly was the last TRUE Need For Speed, before the series would become Burnout (Hot Pursuit was basically Takedown, MW2012 is Paradise 2, as stated). That being said, lets get a few things out of the way. If your expecting a truly engaging story with memorable characters, unexpected plot twists and perfect pacing with pitch perfect acting...then just stop, like seriously. The story is completely disjointed and random. Stuff happens for no reason and characters come and go without any rhyme or reason. And the cutscenes...my god...the dialogue is without a doubt completely unbearable. Most Wanted and Carbon were cheesy, but in a way that gave it style. Here, it just feels forced...that or these people cant write or act at all. A particular character, Rose, is without a doubt the worst. Her dialogue is just the worst ive heard in awhile. Suffice to say, im sad that the story failed. The idea of being deep undercover of some kind of crime syndicate always intrigued me and EA couldve really did something here.  Anywho, enough of the story. The racing and cop chases are where this game strive off of and i feel that while its not at the heights of Most Wanted, its still good enough that you can see yourself having allot of fun with this game. The sense of speed is crazy, and the car handling is less torpedo like and allows you to casually cut corners like a pro, which goes really far into making you feel like a real bad â¥â¥â¥! The courses are layered out with plenty of ways to overcome other racers and you always feel like you have a chance even if the race isnt going good. Then the police chases, which is one of my personal favorite mission types, are just pure intensity, particularly when your Wheelman level goes up and the odds against you get higher and higher. Also, i love the small touch of being able to press a single button to hop into another race on the spot. It allows you to simply hop into a match without surfing into map screens and i for one love the small touch. The game is extremely easy to run too. Throwing it on max settings shouldnt be too difficult and 60FPS isnt going to be far from reach either.  This might be a preference thing, but the keyboard controls are Meh at best. You can totally work with it, as i found it atleast playable...but if you have a 360 Remote laying about, or any other form of Gamepad, id highly reccomend using it. The game feels much more slick this way and it really pays off.  Now for the things i didnt like. The AI is inconsistent to say the least. In races, expect to always see the opponents lag MILES behind you. Even towards the end of the game, this happens pretty often. Im under the assumption that you could EASILY beat this game with the starter vehicle, which is kindda sad. Then theres the 'Master Races' which is the perfect showcaser of why the series frequent use of Rubber Banding is a joke. You literally have to ensure you make NO mistakes...yet even when your doing perfect, someone will be glued to your â¥â¥â¥ like a Magnet and side swipe you when your close to victory. You can try to rear end them but they stay glued to the road as you plumet to the side of the road in shame. At these moments, i really wish we had the progression of Need For Speed Most Wanted, where the game got more and more difficult as you made your way down the blacklist. Hell, even Carbon with its Rubbery AI had a feeling of progession. As for the cop chases...they have issues too. Dont get me wrong, they are still fun, but the Police are just too forgiving. Cops often stand back, allowing you to easily out run them, and even in the higher intervals, they give you space to escape being boxed in. Also for whatever reason, they eventually call off all their units after awhile, abruptly ending a chase. The only thing that really gets you off guard is the Spike Strips, but thats only because you never even really see them.  In the end, the game is definetly flawed. But id say its worth it. Especially now that its cheap and easily attainable through Steam. The racing is fun, and the chases can be a blast. The awful story and Inconsistent difficulty drag it down but nowhere near to the levels of a bad game. Its a solid racer and if your looking for something to play, look no further. PERSONALLY though, if you still have a Playstation 2 or a Nintendo Wii (Or a Wii U even), id reccomend hunting down a copy of Need For Speed Undercover on one of those consoles. It may not be the prettiest versions, but the AI is much better and consistent, the cars feel and handle better, the cop chases are a challenge and it just overall just feels more like a Most Wanted sequel then this version does.

2093	1	a	  People tend to compare this game to GTA a lot. Which I understand due to it being open-world and whatnot, however the humor, writing, etc. is nothing like GTA games and is more of in the essence of Saints Row games. While that's not the point of the review, I needed to get that out of the way for people who plan to get this game thinking it's the same exact thing as GTA with a serious story.  Retro Rampage DX is by far one of the best open-world indie games I've played in a while, and while my time on Steam doesn't reflect this, I have played RCR on PS3 in 2013 and I believe DX is the best remake this game has gotten.  Lots of improved mechanics and the driving doesn't feel as bad as it did when the first game came out, I really do recommend getting this game if you want something that's along the lines of Saints Row games and has a pretty good singeplayer story.

The worst thing is u can't drift cornering in game, same as a real F1. but it make game boring QAQ. About the Multi-player mode?come on, forget it.  If u want to play a Casual RAC game,Sonic All Stars Racing would be better. Remeber,buy F1 RACE STARS only when it come out at Bundle Stars as a bundle(including all DLC)

1939	0	a	F1 race starts is a arcade racing game that is similar to mario kart. The racers are real f1 race stars, and the items have been changed to fit the game. Unlike mario kart this is not a very good racing game.  Personally I've played almost all of the mario kart games, so this game was not very hard in the slightest for me. The reason it's so easy is that fact that you have no ârivalâ racers. In Mario Kart, you usually have a few characters that get 2nd or 3rd place as you get first and keep really close to you in points for the standings. In this game I would be able to finish 5th and 6th at times and still win because some other person with no points would win the race and I'd still be in first.  There are not that many different tracks and you will go over the same tracks over and over again in different cups. There are 30 cups, which vary in the amount of tracks they have. At first they are just slandered races but eventually the other cups apply a variety of challenges instead. Sometimes you have to stay in first to get points, other times you have to collect cups on the road to add to points. Each track also has a shortcut system that I personally never used, but if you are having troubles I'd recommend looking their locations up you can win races just by using them.  The racers are not really exciting, and the attributes each pair of racers have didn't alter my experience. The power ups are balloons, and other real world things that aren't creative, like a torpedo, a ghost boost that makes you invulnerable and move quickly. One of the most awful idea's the game put in is this stupid pit system. If you get hit by a balloon or something, your car is damaged and moves slowly, and you have to go out of your way and lose placing to drive through the pit stop. Really stupid idea in an arcade racer.  One more thing to say about the difficulty there are 2 cups that are an insane spike in difficulty. In these they have the damage set to extremely high so if another racer even touches you you have to go pit and they all pass you. It took me 3 hours to do the first and 3 to do the second. They are quite random and will aggravate you so much you might just quit the game.   I bought this game for about 5$, it has a few dlc's that are for multi-player which doesn't exist. This is not a very good game unless you are a diehard mario kart fan. Even then go play that instead.

2288	1	a	Review: 7/10  The developer of this game has shown what's the outcome of years of hard work, and no doubt the outcome is good! This game is basically GTA in retro/pixel graphics. You get everything you experience in the GTA games in addition to a whole new level of craziness (Not Saints Row The Third crazy, but close enough), with lots of nostalgia from other 8-bit arcade games like Duck Hunt for example. The gameplay is fun as hell and causing chaos is actually better than the older top-down GTA games! Being an open world action game, do expect lots of variety from it, along with some mini games that really makes this game a bang for the buck. However, the game does get repetitive when it comes to combat. You'll actually find it to be like an arcade game which is precisely what it's intended to be. So buy it instantly if you are into the older arcade games, and if not - Still buy it for the stuff you get for the low price, okay?
1868	1	a	i didn't expect this much funny and cute game from codemasters. they are making games as racing simulations. f1 race stars has all licenced drivers and ads. graphics are amazing. drivers talking is very funny and it depends on driver's country. if you like mario kart or like funny games you should try it out.
1665	1	a	There's one main ingredient I find missing in most modern racing games, it's speed. This games delivers on that in a big way. Also the graphics and game set-up with different goals to reach, like going fast, drifting much, fragging cars or just wreck mayhem gives a nice variety to the game while the speed just goes faster and faster. Also it's nice with a game that you don't need to click and load through several screens before you get to the racing, basically you can open a race within half a minute and the race takes like 5 minutes and then you can log out. That's anyway how I do it, not enjoying to be stuck too long in a game. Great game, best racing game I come upon since the 90s.
2361	1	a	Great game for anyone who has grown up with a Nintendo.. TONS of retro references.. Very fun casual game :)
1754	0	a	First time starting the game -&gt; 'Can't reach server'  First place, I drift around a corner, brush a wall, the car suddenly turns into the opposite direction and boosts straight into a wall. Car explodes, suddenly 12th place. Hit car #11 from behind, suddenly I get fragged from it and I'm 10 seconds behind.  Start a 'Shindo' race which promises a standard race without destructions and with normal overtaking of cars instead of fragging them. 20 seconds into the race, get fragged by an enemy.  Worst soundtrack I've listened to in a game.  2/10 won't ever ridge race again

2543	1	a	Bang Bang Racing is a good overhead racing game with major issues to overlook. The first issue is every time you turn your car, the chase camera swings to adjust. Its a gentle sway, but it often goes back and forth for the most minor of adjustment. It can be stomach churning, but there is always a fixed camera angle. The second issue is that an entire event can play as if its in slow motion when others are fine. Sometimes the slow motion accelerates to the smooth speed the game usually has. Even the fireworks at the end make the game slow down. I can recommend adjusting your screen resolution, but on a computer that can play ultra max settings on grander games, its just odd.  With those out of the way, I can tell you about the game itself. The game plays great with a keyboard and mouse or just a 360 controller. It plays like a lot of overhead racers, left and right to steer with a nitro boost and you have car health. If you take enough damage your car is crippled and you'll need to crawl your way to the pit lane. You can tell a damaged car by the bellowing smoke coming out of its tailpipe. Driving through the pit near the finish line will replenish your health and nitro boost, but its out of the way and its just easier to avoid completely. Like most overhead racers you can turn on a dime and there are a number of hairpin turns on each closed circuit course. These ultra sharp turns ensure that you'll need your brake or in this game's case reverse.  You compete against seven other racers in typical races and elimination rallies that eliminate whomever is in last place when the clock runs out. There are time trials where you race against the clock. Finishing in third place or higher will unlock the next track or two. The races are brief, several laps that take half a minute each depending on the track. Coming in first unlocks a few new vehicles for the current series.  Rather than showing stats for each car, it gives you a hint and a description for each one. I assume a steering wheel means that its good at handing or steering. The roll bar icon indicates that its durable and can take a beating. The nitro means that its better at nitro and what looks like either a tire or a fan could mean its exhaust is efficient? Perhaps it accelerates faster. I assume the speedometer means that it has a better top speed. Wait I have that backward, the speedometer is the car better at acceleration and the wheel is the one with the better engine.  The meat of the game is the career that has you competing in four brief stages that I'd call a series of events rather than stages. Each one has a minimum of five events that increase by two for each stage. With the exception of the first stage, these stages are punctuated with a final championship that has you racing in several races back to back as a sort of endurance event.  The aesthetic is nice and clean and the cars are stocky little cubes that represent race cars, stock cars and muscle cars in a sort of chibi caricature form. Speaking of chibi, there are no people in the game, just bouncing heads on bleachers to cheer you on. Its a look that several other overhead racers do and Bang Bang Racing is the cleanest. Each track is beautiful and full of color. Japanese cherry blossoms on some tracks, a crystal blue watery port on another. It just looks like a game I want to play.  Each track is compact and littered with things like cones, tires and barrels that will get in your way. The barrels are either full of water or tar, they'll slow your car down depending what you hit. The real obstacle is your opposition, because they all cluster together and usually jam up early turns in each race. There's no logic here, they just cram together. You can push other cars out of the way, just as you can be pushed sideways. With the cars being so stubby, its tough to turn anyone around although I have seen a few racers get stuck driving into walls.  There's good use of stand and it will scatter onto the pavement if you drive through it. This is a nice touch of detail and it seems to affect gameplay. As you progress, you'll find tracks with shortcuts which is another nice touch. One thing that was overlooked is the game's snowy winter track without icy roads. It plays like every other track.  For anyone interested, there's four player on the same game and it could make for some fun times if you have a big screen and enough friends to play it. If you're alone, you can always play against bots and even select their difficulty. You can play through all four championship endurance races, but if you're looking for a quick fix, there's free play that lets you select the mode, track, class, laps and difficulty of your opposition.  Despite its two major flaws its still a fun game and a real toss up as to if it earns a recommendation. If the game slows down this bad for me, what will it do for you? Its only on a few early races, but those early races are your first impressions of the game.

2025	1	a	Ever played the original Grand Theft Auto games on PlayStation?  Did you like them? Then you'll love this! This game uses the play style of the classic GTA games but with an 8-Bit twist! You'll experience lots of references to many games/movies during your time exploring the small, yet satisfying city of Theftropolis. Not only are the games missions/stages fun but there is lots of things to find, unlock and do outside of missions too! Just watch the trailer, it shows all you need to see to make a desicion on whether to buy this game or not. But if you do buy it... I hope you enjoy it as much as I am :P
3625	1	a	I played it for a bit. It's alright.
80	1	a	I remember the original game from my childhood. It was a real classic and one of my favorite games. I bought this remake immidiatly after I found out it was made. Played it many hours and noticed that it was still the same old game I knew from my childhood. For anybody else who remembers the old game this new one will remind you of the fond memories playing it. Its action racing game as its finest.
11	1	a	I loved the original, I still sometimes play it. So when I got this on a sale price I could not resist getting it. I have not been sorry at all. It is not the exact copy of the original, but it has kept a lot of what made the original a classic. The handling of the cars is not overly difficult, but just so that it is not to easy. I love the fact that you donât have to be in front to win when your weapons are well upgraded and used in the game. One feature I do miss is how you pick the venue and then you can see who is up to race and then you can decide if you want to race. So if I could ask for one chance that would be it. All and all this is a fun game that can be played over and over again.
2054	1	a	This game is one of those games you don't get any more then you bargained for. It has some thrills and some fun parts, and it can be pretty funny. Don't get too excited and exceed what your expectations should be, and this game will give you some fun times. Be warned however, there are some very frustrating moments in-game...

Just, don't explore everything before doing the story...you'll wind up going to places in the Story that you already found while exploring and it kinda ruins it. I wish I hadn't done that. :(  DX stuff: + The new cop system is GREAT! One of the most annoying things was constantly getting the cops on me accidently and having to sit around in a store till it passes. now you just kill them off the screen. + The new overlay is nice. + Scoreboards! + You can mark waypoints on your map now. Pretty awesome.   Unfortunately, if you've already played through the game there's no real reason to play again because of DX, unless you just want to score on the leaderboards.

What I recommend to the devs 1. Level editor- I love the freestyle map, but I want to make a map with a flow of my style, get what I mean? 2. Oculus Support- Ohgodyes that would just make the whole experience SO MUCH better. 3. I know it might sound a bit weird, but weather effects.

3655	1	a	SpeedRunners is a competitive indie racing game with a 2-D artstyle and a fun soundtrack. It has both single player and multiplayer modes and a variety of fun characters with different personalities. The goal of the game is to knock out your enemies by making them hit the edges of the screen, and you can race through a variety of unique levels with an arsenal of items to do so. This game is pure addictive multiplayer chaos. It's fast paced, it's competitive, and it even has a story! I see this game as a must-have if you're into indie games and is a joy to play with your friends.

2066	1	a	It's hard no to recommended this game for so many reasons but here some:  1- it's made in Canada ( yeah most don't care.... but who cares ! Right ! ) 2- it try and manage to bring back so many good moments from the past 3- and i guess some might like the humor some not, but it ain't serious at all!  Now that it's 10 $ it's a great deal, story wise it's about 7 hours long if you take a lil time, and there is some challenge and free roaming wich give to the replay value. Even though I didn't play much after the story i'm pretty sure it coul had at least 2 hours more.  Nostalgia is something great to help a game out so I don't know if I could say it's for everybody, as younger one might not understand all the references.  Was a great 8 hours, don't regret it

3824	1	a	SpeedRunners is not a good consistent day after day game. However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.   Final thoughts:  - BUY THE GAME - If you want a good party game to play once in a while. - DO NOT BUY - If you want a game to play everyday.

1473	0	a	This game is basically a piece of unrespect towards bugbear, this game has been made by another studio Team 6 and they not only didn't maintain the original Flatout idea, they smashed it and not even in the good way, the physics are pure rubbish, the cars look like matchbox toy cars (forget nice flatout 1 or 2 bangers.), The car tuning is just a text saying what changes to the car (seriously? are we back at text rpg's?), Oh I forgot, the graphics even if I do not need nice graphics to love something, here they are disastrous, there is the bloom and motion blur effect on everything and you can't turn them off.    I bought this in the complete flatout bundle, just because I wanted all flatouts since i had owned 1 and 2 on disc but played them so much they got scratched and didn't play anymore. But this Is just a huge piece of unplayable material, I mean even 3 years later on a SuperPC compared to it's requirements I got screentear and graphics buffing.   This ain't worth a dime, maybe a nice try for a indie studio trying to make a name with forgiving fans and a pricetag of a handfull of dollars but not a game called: Flatout 3:Chaos and destruction, the only chaos and destruction you get here is the game itself.    Installed, started it up, found it funny looking... tried it out... uninstalled, piece of utter rubbish.

466	0	a	It looks like a fun game, then why the negative review? I cant control the car, I have a 360 controller, an xbox one controller and mouse and keyboard, for some reason, I CANNOT throtle, or break for that matter with anyone of them, even after rebinding keys for the keyboard, but I am able to turn the camera... I wont even bother to unplug the controllers to see what is causing the conflict.

2500	1	a	This game is excellent and I recommend it for any retro-gaming fan and old school gamer alike! I originally played this game (the DX version) on the Nintendo 3DS, and then when I joined Steam, I purchased Retro City Rampage DX for the PC. And I have got to say that this is definitely a well-done and proudly made game! You play the villain in the city, trying to do various entertaining deeds, while, well, destroying a bunch of buildings and running over a few 8-bit citizens on the way.  One of the biggest things that makes this game so great is that there's a bunch of cool EASTER EGGS hidden in the game as well; for example Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, and other newer series are referenced and more! And oh boy the number of pop culture references! One of the more noticeable ones is constant references to the hit 80s trilogy film series 'Back to the Future'. The game includes a story mode, where you as the main character can choose two paths, blue or orange; there's a free-roam mode where you get unlimited ammo, money, and you get to roam around the city to unlock secrets, play in the arcade, and buy weapons.  That pretty much sums up the best of Retro City Rampage DX, and honestly, if you haven't tried the game or bought it, yet, well... please do! -RetroPac ##++Retro Video Gamer &amp; Website Creator++##  http://retrogameblogger.net  Like this game?

1900	1	a	+ Some of the most original creative maps you will can find on an arcade kart racer + Very hidden unlockable shortcuts  + Great graphics + Intense races + plenty of races / game modes to unlock and play in career + Insane jumps, inclines, loopty loops, and gravity defying tracks  - No drifing / sliding - Power ups are pretty generic  - All characters / cars are the same / no upgrades  (Price paid: $5 with DLC)

This game doesn't take itself too seriously but it nails the gameplay and execution of everything. It stinks to see some of the leaderboards ruined by cheating but it is what it is.  On a side note, for some reason, I keep getting my save file deleted. I have no idea how and perhaps I'm accidentally doing it myself but it sucks :(

2616	1	a	 SpeedRunners  is exactly what the game says it is - A cut-throat competitive platformer. And it. Does. Not. Disappoint.    Pros  :  1. Simple, easy, and extremely fun (With friends, ten times that). 2. Soundtrack is amazeballs. 3. Progressively challenging. 4. Wide variety of funky characters to choose from. 5. Brilliant level designs.    Cons  :  1. Minimal amount of players during matchmaking. 2. Lack of advertising for the game. Not many people buy it. Please, buy it.  It may not look visually appealing, or promising, but that's what even I thought before I actually went ahead and bought it. This is a  must-buy  for those who love party-oriented games.

865	0	a	Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.  First, you're impressed. It's pretty good! The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.  Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice. Superb! Well done!  And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper. Well, I mean... why? It's quite good the way it is. You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.  And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish. Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right? You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice. Spice, spice, spice.  Difficulty is good in a game. A little spice is more than nice. But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point? Who wants to eat THAT dish?  A bad chef is one who sucks at chili. An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili. The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like 'XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?' I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.

2021	1	a	Its a silly top down retro-flavoured homage to old 80s NES games that started out as an NES demake of Grand Theft Auto 3 and its sitll fun to play. Even if it does use '8-bit' as its chief aesthetic, since that's apparently 'the big thing' amongst indie devs.  The difficulty works too. Its difficult but not flatout 'f*** you' hard like most. There's a nice amount of customization options too including screen borders homaging old Arcade bezels and the Game Boy's old â¥â¥â¥ sepia screen.  Plus its a near-recoloured Claude from GTA3 and a hilarious ripoff of Doc Brown trying to stop a Potara fusion Doctor Robotnik/Wily from takin gover the world. How can you go wrong?

1373	0	a	I can't belive i paid money for this tripe. Flatout 1 is worlds better than this. Do yourself a favor and get the previous titles to this series. For starters, the gameplay is absolutely broken with garbage physics,  nonexistant handiling, and incredibly bad AI there is no reason to try to play this game. The visuals are late PS1 early PS2 quality, with way too much motion blur and bloom that can cause siezures there should be a warning to those that have epilepsy; the courses themselves are unimaginative and poorly put together. The cars look and feel like rejects from a Hot Wheels game along with some that  were foisted from the previous FlatOut titles to give some impression that this is a sequel.  There is no structure to the gameplay mechanics, for starters the damage calculations are randomly generated so hitting an opponent can result in either doing little to no damage to you or taking most of your health away. There are no boundries on the tracks so you pretty much can drive where you want with no penalties. There is no way to regain boost except crossing checkpoints; hitting cars or objects does nothing here. If they want you to use boost to 'heal' your car then they should have more ways to obtain it.  The tracks seem to be made to fully expliot the nonexistant handling and for most of time you are riding the handbrake to get around the corners. There are tuning options for your car but they make no difference here.  The AI is the worst seen in any racing game; from the start they just smash into each other and into objects for no reason. In derby mode they all pile up on you and in no time your car is running on a sliver of health while your oppenents have most of theirs.   The game modes themselves are poor attempts at variety, speed mode is depressingly easy to win on account of the absymal AI. Offroad is the only mode that elevates this game to very bland. Nightshift is almost impossible to win because of the deplorable handling. Stunt is probably the worst here in that the requirements to win are so arbitrarily steep and each stunt course can only be figured out through trial and error( there is no tutorials here like in the previous titles) as well as being poorly put together that when you do win it you have no incentive to do it again. Challenge mode is just an excuse from the developers to extend gameplay. Even monster truck mode had any fun removed by the lousy handling, bad physics, and damage calculations.  There is nothing to say about mulitplayer because that is simply broken.  This game is nothing more than a cynical cash grab from Strategy First to profit from the FlatOut name along with the technical incompentence of Team6 games in developing this sorry excuse for a game it can be safe to say that the FlatOut we know and love is now too badly damaged that there is little hope that it can be brought back.

1216	0	a	Don't be stupid like me and don't buy this game, it's total garbage. If you want nice destruction derby game, get FlatOut2: Ultimate Carnage, soo much better than this crap. Or get Bugbear's new game called Next Car Game, thats a great destruction derby game (but still in making).  The real problem with this game is, that it isn't made by Bugbear but by some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ company. Graphics seems (at least to me) like downgrade from FlatOut2. It have horrible original 'music' and not licensed music from rock bands like the other flatouts. From what else i saw in that half hour i wasted on it was horrible maps like simple square with some houses around and thats it, thats your city race track. No destructible props at all. The 'throw your driver out of car' minigames are worthless, so much better in FlatOut2.  My verdict? It's 1/10. One point for cool name that can charm fans like me who played and loved previous FlatOut games. Seriously, don't buy this crap, hell, don't even pirate it, it's just waste of time.  P.S. On the other hand, if you want to torture some clueless friend, get this game for him/her. He/She will get this monster big mindf*ck and will do anything for you, just not make him/her see this game again.

And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!

1958	1	a	  'EVENNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WE PRESNT TO YOU TONIGHT, A CLICHE BANK ROBBERY!    References has always been the part of every sector of the entertaintment industry. Musicians puts hate or love to their lyrics, as the reference to someone or something, most of times, it has affected them. Directors and screenwrites puts to their movies references of another famous movies or people affected movie industry. And so, game developers trying to put references of games, poeple who are/was or affected gaming industry. And sometimes, we can find developers from diamonds, who puts references of all kinds, into their game - Vblank Entertaintment.  These guys made out of nothing something and that's Retro City Rampage (RCR) -  little indie game, which contains more references, that megabytes that game has.   Most epic adventure for those, who was born before 1990, and biggest nightmare, and 'Lost World' for those who wasn't. RCR be like - A-Team GMC van gonna run over you. Green pipes from Mario are everywhere. Brown Dog from my childhood is everywhere. First mission and first reference totally blew me away. School bus runs through the wall of the bank, to stole looted money alias the Batman. And so, almost every minute, you'll find something, from your childhood, or not only.  Difficulty and game-design of this game is just tribute to good old video-game machines - tough difficulty, dozens of secrets, score multipliers, memorable characters, unblockable characters, crazy weapons, aliens and sh*t.   If you looking for nostalgia, and wants to go back to your childhood, go for indies, Playstation 1/2 or Retro City Rampage. Salute to you Vblank.  PS: Main parallel of the game is Back to Future movie from 1985.  PS2: Between the writing of this review and this update, the game has been updated to DX version which is another thumbs up.   Bonus Point: There is nothing wrong with this game for real   Rating: 9/10

This game also allows for 4 player co-op through the career, which I think is a nice touch.

1335	0	a	This game is horrible, it is not the flatout we know and love (if you are a fan). I was a fan of all of the previous flatout games, but this is trash with my reasons for calling this below.   1. The physics of the car feels like you're driving on ice, and the cars don't respond as expected at all. 2.The menu system is horrible. 3.It looks like they picked random models online and gave them names and a random bio. 4.The game is no-longer made by bugbear interactive, this is probably why its completely different. Its still published by the same company however. 5.This game doesn't feel like a member of the flatout series at all, i wish they would have released it as something else.  Things they got right?: 1. Integrated music player, its nice having your own music.   I really wanted to like this and i was genuinely excited to see it appear, but now i'm just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off one of my favorite racing game series has been ruined completely. Stick to flatout 1 &amp; 2!!!

1595	1	a	Do you like Burnout? Enjoy the destruction of Split Second? Then this game is for you!  If your expecting classic Ridge Racer then look else where.  This game should have been its own franchise but it`s not, it has the Ridge Racer title, RR style cars and music but that is where similarities end. Do I care? Hell no! This game puts Michael Bay to shame with its crashes and destruction. I loved it on PS3, and I love it on PC.  The sad truth though is that there is no online, the servers were shut down some time ago and Namco opted not to modify the game to allow peer to peer connection, or even stop the game attempting to connect to none existent servers on launch. But this does not stop the game being fun, so if you see it in the sale buy it and have a smashing time!  One last thing to note, for achievement collectors sadly you will not get all achievements for this game as there are a couple that are awarded for online play, no online play = missing achievements :(

1837	0	a	I came from playing the original Ridge Racers. The games were fast-paced, joyous, and celebrated the mechanical marvel of the automobile.   Unbounded disagrees. The game takes place in Shatter City, where for some reason, people live oppressed or something. The story of fighting the system through vehicular mayhem just kinda feels silly to me. It's like the game treats cars as a way to complete its objective, rather than celebrating racing.   And that's disappointing. While it is alright, I can't say in good confidence that I'd reccommend this as a Ridge Racer game. Maybe a new Burnout title or a Flatout title, or even its own IP. But this is not Ridge Racer.

2318	1	a	It might say I only played 3.5 hours but I played about 50 hours offline at my grandparents and I must say it is one hell of a game and the nostalgia in this game is the best. If you are a fan of old top view GTA games and Old retro games this is for you.
2350	1	a	Not bad, but not great by any stretch. A typical entry into the retro rebake catagory of games. Might keep you engaged for a few hours, but the tiny map and constant references to old school games gets tiresome quickly. 6/10.
1988	1	a	This game is fantastic. It's funny, fun, and well worth $10. It has parodies of movies and other games *cough cough Back to the Future*. In a sense, it's retro GTA. Still waiting on multiplayer (a player can dream).

1123	1	a	Really a fun game, tons of customizes,Funny and raging gameplay and if you have friends playing it, it's so much fun! I love the minigames too like hockey,football or pachinko, not only races!  10/10 I love this game
679	1	a	Take my word for it, not a dull moment in this game, just good old fashion fun. When you're not crashing into stuff or other stuff you're tryin' to keep it under control.
29	1	a	The classic Death Rally has returned! Though without a lot of the personality that made the original game such a favourite of mine.  Some of the weapons and abilities don't seem as useful as others. The camera angles are sometimes a bit off putting and I find it hard to dodge objects at times, due to the camera not showing me what's coming up ahead.  Recommended, but I remain disappointed that this game could have been much better.
21	1	a	Decent mobile port of a remake  Story: 15/25 Gameplay: 20/25 Graphics: 18/25 Sound: 16/25  OVERALL: 69/100  This is a game where you race cars with pew-pew guns. So, the story is pretty nonexistent most of the time, but it's there. The gameplay is fun and fairly satisfying most of the time. However, in later stages when your car is maxed out and you know what you're doing, it gets really boring as you just get ay ahead and you just ... turn. Te graphics and sound are okay. Everything starts to look pretty bland and you start to tune out the sound, but ... oh well. Pretty solid for a mobile port and a remake of a game from 1996.
139	1	a	Snuggle Truck attempts to do something very simple in what it offers, and for the most part it succeeds. The main problem comes with the frustration of acquiring all medals available.  The basic premise of the game is to go through groups of increasingly difficult levels and achieve specific goals in order to earn medals. There are easy, medium, hard, and extreme groups of levels. In easy and medium, it's actually fun to hone in your skills and fight for all the medals. In the hard levels, the fun begins to diminish into something comparable to an annoying task or a dreadful job. The extreme levels are so much worse than the hard levels, that the experience ceases completely from being a game and fully becomes a terrible chore, or a punishment.  If getting the basic medal for all levels is enough to please you, then you'll be able to easily beat the game in less than an hour. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, and getting all possible medals is your goal, I'm sure that there may be at least ten hours of entertainment here for you. There are also some bonus developer created levels, as well as thousands of user created levels for you to download from within the game, but actually wanting to experience this much content will depend on how patient you are and how much fun you are able to get out of Snuggle Truck.  Snuggle Truck is okay.

The flimsy icons of your childhood will be mocked, your reflexes will be tested, and your funny bone will be tickled even if you are too green to get the allusions.

16	0	a	If you don't want to read the tl;dr below I'll sum up this game like this: 'Race, Kill, Upgrade,' rinse and repeat all over without emotion until you win.  First of all It's a fun/good game in all matters. If you buy this thinking about the good old times of the 1996 version then you might get a little bit dissapointed. The depth of story and mechanics lacks short and if you though racing was about winning... Well in Death Rally it's all about staying behind and killing people to get parts to the next car.  There is no actual difficulty settings, as you can get in trouble by the first tier of vehicles when you already have a fully upgraded top car. Killing cars is also a bit more annoying as you never know for sure how long will it take to finish one off.  Game is indeed fun an all, but lacks emotion when comes to important aspects. Fans of the first version of the game will be sad to think this is the best they could make, and I'm glad I bought this on a sale because at full price I'd be a bit more sad.

1098	1	a	This game would be great, as it was on the console, if they had ported it correctly. Quite a few notable glitches, one of which being the game has a chance to improperly close (it just goes into the background). I could list many others, but that's what a forum is for. For some reason (of which is beyond me), it was seen fit to lock the resolution to a 4:3 ratio, making the game look rather uncanny, to say the least, on any other monitor resolution. There isn't even an option in the game settings, that's just how it is. Needless to say, with all the changes they made to it, along with poorly optimizing the game for PC, this has to be one of the worst PC ports I've played in a while. The game is still fun to play, but it could have been far better than it had turned out.

1861	0	a	This game could be really fun. Could be. For starters, server's dead. So you load in after a slightly annoying wait while the game fruitlessly tries to connect to the server. So no multiplayer, that's fine. I can forgive that, I love singleplayer games. But to get into the game and spend over an hour trying to beat the first race, hell, even place in it. The drift mechanic is so damn finicky that I end up either spinning out or fishtailing at every corner. And to know that the devs abandoned this years ago...  Thank God I got this from Humble Bundle.

2469	1	a	Sometimes the missions seem too easy or repetitive. Itâs a game that youâve already played before. If youâve played any GTA game especially GTA 1 or 2, Retro City Rampage doesnât bring anything new to the theory. Sure itâs nice to see a GTA style game in 8-bit and all of the references to other popular things from decades past, the gameplay and story at times has no substance. Youâre going to either love it or hate it. Iâve always felt this way with GTA games. There are parts in the games that I absolutely love and missions I can play over and over again. With the ability to finish a mission multiple ways and the vast amount of options available doesnât over shadow the fact that missions are the same. If you love the GTA series you will love this game. If youâre like me, you are looking for something different that Retro City Rampage doesnât provide.   http://iamericm.com/2013/04/retro-city-rampage-indie-game-review-2/

305	0	a	'Game of the Year 2006!' - A very very dismal year. This game has it all: horrendous optimization, the tinniest voices my ears will never hear again, the disgusting artwork, and o top it all off I bought this game  twice , I want my $0.88 back and all 31 minutes of my life back. 10/10 would hang myself with my laptop charger before getting this game for free. Thinking back on this, I do wish I killed myself before playing this atrocious pile of code called a 'game'.
1866	1	a	10min of gameplay (i show 1 lap for each of the dlc tracks)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01w8wpPml1M   This is a cart racing game with real f1 drivers. Since this is linked to f1 there is no drifting so you'll need to use your breaks on turns or pump the gas also hiting the other cars drops your speed. You get 11+4 dlc tracks, 28 drivers in 14 cars in 1, 2, or 3,000cc. Each car is shared by 2 drivers and each car has a different ability, stuff like better boosts, more of a item, off road, and many more. Items come from stares on the track and give power-ups like, speed boosts, bubbles (can be placed behind you to block or shot forward &amp; stops a driver), a shockwave (disrupts cars around you), a teleport (jump ahead a bit), a rocket (become a rocket and fly forward), rain cloud (slows) balloons (if hit will cover your screen with confetti), and a pace car (slows the head cars). Tracks have hidden paths (i think you need items to use some) and it will sometimes rain. Cars can get a boost at the start if you hit the gas right, and again sharp turns are hard with no drifting. Boost pads on the track charge up a battery on the back of the car before you can use it. Taking damage or hitting a object head on will damage your car and you'll be slower and handle worse until you can drive down a pit lane.   The game is polished, runs without errors, and can be fun though i know some complain about the turning it wasn't a deal breaker for me also the purple car at the end has a off road ability so you won't lose as much speed when your off the track. The character motions are campy but they also give the feeling of sportsmanship and that they don't hate each other, also the opening race thing is skipable.  The dlc The 4 tracks are ok, not sure they are worth $5 each and if you want to see them i have all 4 in my video. As for the accessory packs, these change your skid marks (you wont even notice), what your tailpipe kicks out when you boost (you'll barley notice), &amp; your horn (you'll notice this most and i can see people liking the air horn in the party pack) Though i didn't feel they give enough for the price (all 9 for $9). If it was all in 1 cheaper pack maybe but how it is now, i'ed pass.

Was afraid to waste money again but found it on sale and took a try. Felt exactly the same Trails Hd on the 360. How same you might ask, well Evolution Gold includes Original Trial HD levels. My times are for the most part exactly the same. I most likely will never reinstall this game. Get Evo Gold instaed of this, just my 2 cents..

217	1	a	Extremely simple concept and controls which provide more silly fun than imaginable. Great for both adults and children, even extra emotionally sensitive types who might otherwise cringe and be disturbed by cute animals flying outta the back of a truck that's hurtling over all sort of wonderful hazards. Yes, they get run over. Yep, the truck can roll-over and land on the whole lot, but they're drawn to look like inert stuffed critters thereby making the whole deal grandly hilarious instead of traumatic.  Get from start to finish. Keep as many critters in the truck as you can. Catch a few falling extra if possible. Do it all as quick as you can for trophies. Each level has 5 trophies to be earned and many will be maddeningly difficult to obtain. As a bonus you can even come up with your own diabolical levels in the editor. What fun!   I highly recommend this game. Wait for a good sale for extra appeal!

Graphics are worse than in Flatout 2, but it lags as hell, even though my pc runs Crysis 2 on high settings without any problem. Music is worse, physics and camera are much worse, interface feels very uncomfortable. The only good thing about it is that it doesn't have GFWL support, when the UC did. Overall it is a really, really bad game. It wouldn't be such a big deal for me, if it wasn't a sequel to flatout games, but, unfortunately, it is and it makes it the worst game i have played in a last few years.

2191	0	a	This game is a good example of why it's important to also check the negative reviews on a game that have a lot of positive reviews.  As many others have expressed, this game shoves parodies &amp; references down your throat every single moment and that seems like all the game is good for and even then, it does get annoying especially if you're familiar with all those since it's like- where the hell is the new, fresh content we haven't seen &amp; experienced before?  The dev can make an excuse saying it's meant to be a homage to retro games but I think that's cheap if it doesn't have much of it's own content &amp; flair to back that up. I know it's a parody, but at this level it's just plain cheap reuse of existing ideas &amp; scenarios from other games put randomly in it. That said, it tries hard to be funny but you'd just get a few chuckle here &amp; there. That said, newer gamers who hadn't played the games it's parodying would not get most of the joke and to me, that's bad since like a bad parody (either games, films, cartoons, etc.), it fails to make the joke happen for those unfamiliar with the source material.  Moving on, even with the story, parodies &amp; jokes aside, this game is still â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's just like the most of those pseudo-retro games with retro graphics but in terms of gameplay, it's anything but. Broken stealth system, you can't run at full speed right away after moving from standing still (seriously, not even newer games do this anymore), the game auto aims for you &amp; the Mario-stepping-on-enemies are clunky as hell. I also haven't found a reason to do this when you have other alternatives to kill the enemies. There's also the boring take cover &amp; shoot when the enemy is not shooting &amp; standing there like an idiot waiting to get shot. It happens too often &amp; takes too much time.  That said, control is rigid. For a game focusing on rampage, this is totally the opposite experience I'm looking for. If you want a pseudo-retro game that excels in gameplay &amp; still have a touch of their own (as in not being cheap copies of existing games &amp; makes it a 'homage to retro games' as an excuse), get Hotline Miami or Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead. Those are heaps &amp; bounds better.  If I could refund the hell out of this game, I would. Luckily I bought it at discounted price.   
2084	1	a	Retro City Rampage (DX) is a typical 'retro' game which isn't afraid of making fun of itself and the whole 80, 90's genre of gaming with many reference to TV and movie from that times as well. In fact the whole game is full of references everywhere , some obvious , some more obscure which will only make sence if you have knowledge or even better experienced the shows or games they are making fun of.  The graphics are over the top retro 8'bits and many gameplay mechanics reminds me of the games of that era, packed in a GTA aspirated but of course over the top game-frame. The creator of this game used a lot of time to give you the feeling of playing those antiquated systems .   There are also many funny commentaries of the state of gaming both practical and moral which can even apply today. At one point the hero of the game regret one of his past transgressions, the other character listening to the 'player' (yes the player's name in the game is 'player', another pun) comments ironically that he should maybe stop routinely running over and killing innocent bystander while he is at it.  This is a funny comment on heroes in games (and medias generally) sometimes committing large scale genocide in order to 'save the day'.  The gameplay is actually ok and refreshingly diverse, but it's obvious the creator prioritized putting references and puns in almost every frames of the game. As a result, the game itself might feel too short and small, the city especially could have been a tad larger, and I can understand the criticism. I still would recommend the game for the well done retro feeling , funny puns , especially but not only if you grew up in the 80's and 90's.   It's not very expensive to begin with but if you get a discount at some sales, it's really worth it as long as you have some interest in game culture and ready for a game that doesn't take itself very seriously.  
1746	0	a	The game starts with 2 minutes of trying to connect to the multiplayer servers. Servers which are no longer there but the game was never programmed to acknowledge. When you get in it's almost a shell of a game, there's a single player campaign mode which lets you select a single car (unless you get the dlc) and a single track. When you get into a race the entire pack jostle around within a few hundred meters of each other, so a single slip can easily send you form first to last place and failing to adequately drift around a corner can cost several places. This makes progression feel random as it is quite easy to play a race three times and come in last, first and 5th place. A little bad luck can leave you playing the same track over and over before breezing past the next few.

2095	1	a	This game honestly has it all. It's fun, with catchy tunes and lots of classic video game/pop culture references.
2342	1	a	It takes work to re-create an already amazing game (or so I've heard, never played GTA III) in certain restrictions lower than the original product. Brian Provinciano (I think that's his name) did it. And did it well.  Retro City Rampage is hilarious, action packed, and above all, fun to play. I haven't played too many sandbox games other than Minecraft, but I easily jumped into this game with few problems. It's everything the first two GTA games were, and plenty more. Decent sized map, full of secrets and multiple characters to play as in free-roam mode, including Super Meat Boy and Commander Video. Even though I've heard people say that the game lacks it's own ideas, and that is sort of true. The game is a massive parody of tons of stuff from the 80s and 90s. Featuring Back to the Future, Metal Gear Solid, Contra, Duck Hunt, and many, MANY more.  The stroy is very confusing at first, which is a down side, but once you get into it... at the least hilarious and kinda creative. The levels themselves are usually fair and difficult. However, that being said, due to the awkward controls (believe me, you'll know what I mean if you buy the game or already own it) and the level design itself can be downright ridiculous, the levels aren't always fun.  Overall, the game is fun, hilarious, and at some points creative. 8/10

1718	0	a	Ridge Racer even three years after the original release it manages to have technical issues such as switching from 30-60 fps out of nowhere causing the game to slow down to account for the frame switch. This makes the game hard to play, especially with what seems like an ai that cheats. You'll be going as fast as your car can go and the ai with the same car will somehow race ahead of you by miles.   Ridge Racer is at best mediocre, and at worst an infuriating waste of time.  4/10

74	1	a	A reasonable successor to the old MS-DOS game, but I don't find it as enjoyable.   For starters a player MUST upgrade his vehicle after a game or you simply can't continue. Sabotage and all that have made events that trigger randomly and I haven't seen the structo-bumper yet. I also noticed how the developers didn't like driving without ammo, as you seem to have an unlimited supply for at least your starter gun.  The difference between the cars are a lot better, it it's a lot harder to win from several pickup trucks when you're driving a beetle.  All in all a reasonable game, but I'm not so sure it should bare the name Death Rally, at least not in the traditional sense. But then again, I still play the DOS version...so...call me a nut...

175	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a strange little game that I purchased because I was dumb enough to buy something simply because it featured something related to something completely different. That is not to say that it was necessarily a bad decision in the end, rather something that I have learned not to do. None the less.  The game is a simple physics game requiring you to get from point A to point B while still keeping your cargo inside of your truck. There isn't really much more to it than that. It's a bare bones game that is great when you feel like having some stupid fun, but is definitely something that could use a little more polish. It gets boring if you play too much of it at once. I suppose in the end it is worth the price of $5.00.  Also, for those curious of the origin of the name, the game was originally named Smuggle Truck and required you to bring foreigners past the border. See, learning can be fun!
744	1	a	Bad Game, don't buy :(
600	1	a	I strongly recommend all of you buy this game. FlatOut Ultimate Carnage is better in all ways, graphics improved (everything), better musics... i just say, flatout 2 is more for PS2 age, one year later, came the UC, made for PC, seriously, im not joking, you will feel a huge difference playing this game. WORTH BUYING MORE THAN ANY THING. 
422	0	a	Table of Contents: - Foreword - Graphics - Gameplay - Sounds - Controls - Quality - Overall Experience   -Foreword I expected way more than i got. I've played a RC Car game yesterday which was like 10x more enjoyable.  -Graphics The graphics are really bad. Some textures are only loading when you're in the range of 10m.  -Gameplay The gameplay was weird. Quick races are only for local multiplayer, so i've only played one race of the carrer. Didnt even try the multiplayer. I cant expect many people to play it. And even less i believe that it works flawless.  -Sounds Thats the main point why i quit the game so fast, besides to it being weird and bad. The Sound Effects had such a low bad quality, only the music quality was good, i didnt like the music though. There is no sound for crashing into a wall, which is definetly way more important than many other sounds it actually features. Well, all sound bad.  -Controls The game uses the arrow keys when started first. I changed it to WASD, Handbrake was on CTRL btw...  -Quality The overall quality was just really bad. I know some people will probably say i cant judge about a game after 10 minutes of playtime, but i think i can. Its clearly much worse than other 'Toy Car' games. Also, the game says 'Are you blind man?' and something else when driving backwards and then just resets your Vehicle...  -Overall Experience Bad. Seriously, i would not recommend you to get that game. Search for other games instead.

Lens Flare EVERYWHERE!!!   Two of the three DLC cars that was brought in from the prevous installments, (Type 4 Machine + 1 Machine) getting hammered by other cars even though they are the most decent looking.   EXPLOSIONS!   Flatout Crashes + the glorius Michael Bay slow motion camera.   Pretty much nothing to do with Ridge Racer cept the drifting and the boost (which I also hate).  Go get this.  Otherwise don't. Even the damned Grid 2 can pull something better than this.

244	0	a	A simple racing/physics game.  Your goal is to get one or more stuffed animals to the finishing line (with a raising flag a la Mario) in the shortest time possible.  The simple premise is good, but the art/sound direction leaves a lot to be desired. Words cannot describe how irritating it is to listen to those pesky stuffed toys' squeaks. My goal quickly changed to tossing those animals on the ground then to roll all over them, back, and forth, back, and forth.  Overall, there's not that many levels, but the last ones are quite challenging. Then you can also create your own levels with the built-in level editor, and even download levels made by other players.

From a scale a 1 to 10, I would give this game a 7.5/10.

144	1	a	The mechanics are solid, there is depth in terms of content, and the execution is superb. I wouldnât call this one a âthrill ride,â but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when youâve got three minutes to spare.  Itâs hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that itâs highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you donât do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truckâs trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned.   Thereâs a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the 'zoo': thereâs an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: thereâs a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.  Hitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.  Snuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But thereâs a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know whatâs around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.  To its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so itâs not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since thereâs so many in each tier.  Of course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.  While Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if youâre in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value.

1365	0	a	I love the Flatout series..I really do love it! And I heard from alot of sources that Flatout 3 is like the unwanted child of the series. But I couldn't believe it..I looked at so many reviews and tbh I thought that the gameplay doesn't even look that bad. So I tried it just now..I never ever regretted playing a game that much.  This series was once known for it's incredible driving physics and its fun races including a partly destructable circuit..well forget about that in Flatout 3: Normally you would slow down when you aren't driving on the track but offroad..well here the speed is always the same and therefore nobody drives on the track. The car flips after every single â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the environment is non destructable. If you ram a stone then you have to respawn. Also respawning makes you stand still for a few seconds which is a huge disadvantage. There is no career mode and you have all the cars from the very beginning which sucks. There are a lot of modes, but they are either other car models or the challenge mode, where you have to complete 50 random challenges. Also the 'Stuntman' Mode is back, but because of the poor physics it is no fun.  The handling is so bad that it doesn't matter if you take a car with good handling and bad speed or bad handling and good speed, because the handling is exactly the same..utter bull****.  The Graphics are slightly better than Flatout 2 but because of the overused motion blur it looks stupid. And the best feature: If you finish below 1st in any race you automatically lose and have to start over the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ again..  DON'T BUY THIS JOKE OF A GAME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

It's a short shallow experience that doesn't even have multiplayer anymore but bought heavily discounted as I did it's a pleasant one.  There are two things I don't like about it tho (safe the previously mentioned multiplayer situation)  1. There is no 'instant race' option. I'd love to be able to tweak some stuff up and/or randomize it and just let it go. 2. The soundtrack is attrocious. I liked a single track from Skrilex in there thus every game start I had to shuffle till I got it... ofc, this is a PC so I easily fixed it but still.  It's as arcade as it gets but on that regard it offers a great 'chill out' gameplay while still being kind of challenging vs the AI thus, NOT FOR THE FULL PRICE, buy it and see it for yourself. The gameplay is samey enough that you can find out whether it's for you or not before the Steam refund period expires.

It is not simple racing game, but destruction race as well, you do not need to finish 1st, it is enough to crash and destroy all opponents - therefore you are only one in the race and you win automatically. All the tracks are full of destructible objects and they look different in the start and in the end, when all the rails, trash and destroyed cars of opponents cover the track. Plus the soundtrack â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rocks.

A couple of things are dodgy here and there (hitboxes for some parts of some tracks are dodgy, objects and other cars tend to stay on your car for too long, either slowing you down if it's a car or obstructing your view of the track if it's an object), but aside from those few criticisms, it's great fun.

953	1	a	EA's Need for Speed franchise has been in an odd position the last couple years. While the franchise often worked to mix up the formula from year to year a decent bit, the release of EA's own Burnout Paradise posed a bit of a conundrum for the publisher. With Burnout switching to an open world setting, it meant that it competed directly with Need for Speed in that space. Last year's Need for Speed ProStreet was a diversion for the series from recent years, going to track-based racing, plenty of tuning options and focusing entirely on the events than exploring the city or running from the cops. ProStreet didn't turn out too well, so Black Box went back to the drawing board and returned to an open world setting with this year's Need for Speed Undercover, but that wasn't the only design change. Undercover also seems to be directed right at the casual market, both in terms of presentation and its extremely relaxed learning curve.

1704	0	a	I tried to like this game I really but if I'm honest my one true racing love will always be Burnout 3 and everything else just pales by comparison. The handling, the AI, the track design, the variety in cars and customisation but most important the sense of speed and actual enjoyment are all sorely lacking from Ridge Racer Unbounded.  On the plus side I don't think I paid much for it, the graphics aren't too bad and, apart from the fact it keeps attempting to connect to an authentication/online server that no longer exists every time you start it, it's actually been bug-free.   I unlocked all but the last two areas before finally admitting I wasn't really enjoying myself beyond satisfying my OCD need to complete every game I own. As much as it will annoy me I have to stop and uninstall it. Life is just too short and my 'To Play' list is too long to continue playing mediocre games.

1138	1	a	I some what enjoyed this game but I did not understand the keys and how you do stuff.  I did the tutorial but to me it did not make any sense to me, I was still confused.  For the short time I played the game, I enjoyed it.  It was nice to take a slower pace tackling some insane courses instead of throwing all your power into them and driving like a bat out of hell, you play this and slow right down and drive logically because you can drive in at the wrong angel and get stuck easy.  Enjoyable game, just wish it had more people on the multiplayer.  I actually got mine cheap as hell from a Bundlestars bundle which was amazing for me!
2994	1	a	SpeedRunners - My personal review  I bought this game in the official steam shop after it was mentioned in one of PewDiePieÂ´s slightly older videos. It has been reduced by 75% from the original price so I payed about 4 euros in total, at this point my expectations werenÂ´t that high so I first thought that iÂ´d spend about 20 hours in the game. After a few matches and when i started to figure out the special mechanics that the game has it really started getting interesting and fun to play. Now I spent 46 hours in the game and that after about 6 weeks of buying it and after all this time its stil enjoyable and on top of that it became one of my favourite games iÂ´ve ever played.  It is a jump nÂ´run multiplayer game without any type of story you need to mention, so there is a tutorial but the game is just about the gameplay and not about the graphics or the campaign. You shouldnÂ´t buy this game if youÂ´re looking for a revolutionary game in every point but if youÂ´re into games like this its definetly worth youre money although i have to say that you should wait until its getting reduced again.

1638	1	a	 &gt; Short version:  Gameplay: 8/10 - Graphics: 9/10 - Music: 8/10   &gt; Long version:  Ridge Racer Unbounded is a bit different from the PlayStation Ridge Racer games most of us know. The whole setting is less 'party racing' and more 'dark fight for domination', you're out to take the city - a bit like in NFS titles where you want to climb up the ranks to become the leader of the street gangs, just better ;-) Also, unlike in PS Ridge Racers, you can crash and there is a (very simple, though) damage model (cars have a certain 'health level'), this adds fragging your oponents, or be fragged by them, like known from BurnOut and the likes. You also can destroy (and earn bounus points by) certain parts of the city along the track you're racing.  Yet, with all those differences to the PS versions, Ridge Racer Unbounded is a great game and a lot of fun! The different setting is interesting and an OK change from usualy more 'party' like arcade action of the other RR titles. The damage model and intentional destruction of the city adds well to the gameplay and makes things more interesting and fun.  Also worth mentioning are the 'frag cams', where your frags, crashes and destructions are shown in from a cinematic perspective.  Last but not least does the game feature a couple different game/race modes like normal races, drift attacks and the such.  The graphics are absolutely amazing and eye candy, the music fits well to the overall experience.    Bottom line:   If you enjoy arcade racers, you will likely have a lot of fun with this one. This is kind of a mix of PS Ridge Racer + NFS + BurnOut and the result is a very fun and solid arcade experience. If you're still unsure wait till you can grab it at a deal, definitaly worth it's money, esp. with a few % off :-)

5549	1	a	i found this game by watching some youtubers and i thought that it looked like a good amount of fun, however i didnt have much money so i was a bit hesitant to buy it. After a couple of months i recieved a notification that the game was free for the weekend so epople could try it out. after about 10 hours in two days i bought the game the moment the trial ended. its an absolutely great game which i have never regretted buying because it has gameplay which is always entertaning. whether you're struggling to keep up with a pro, slowing down for a noob or having an intense match with someone on par you can always have a laugh about the result. And probably one of the greatest hings about this game is the community, this game gets nowhere near the same amount of toxic players as other games, almost all of the players are friendly happy people (i honestly believe that in all of my time playing i've only come across 10 toxic players and 1 bot). as a result i could not recommend this game enough and encourage you to get it as soon a you can.  I look forward to seeing you on the race track.

Physics are worthless in it, you can't control anything to save your life, no in race music, no force feedbad (The worst part in my opinion), lack of throttle control from what I can tell, and an overall discrace to BugBear and the Flatout name.

1207	0	a	The game name says Flatout. But do not think of it as Flatout. It is not even made by same developers as the original Flatout, Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage. This is made by Team 6. Team 6 has not made a single good game ever. And this is not exception.  This game is absolutely horrible, I do not recommend it for anyone. The physics are one of the worst I have ever seen in racing game. Crashing does not feel good when it should in this type of game. The graphics look just ugly. Even the first Flatout from 2004 looks better than this in my opinion. There is not even a proper career mode, just a boring challenge mode that has random single races you can complete. This game is overpriced, it should cost 5â¬/5$ at max, and even then I would not recommend the game to anyone.  Play the good old Flatout instead, or check out the Next Car Game by the developers of original Flatout games (Bugbear Entertainment). That will be a true demolition racing/derby game.  DO NOT BUY FLATOUT 3

It doled out mindnumbing fetch quests, kill X of Y missions, and brief corridors of cannon fodder, all backed by irritating, disposable music and laced with witless 'parody' and facile social commentary. It is amongst the most insanely boring gaming experiences I have had in recent memory and I recommend it to absolutely nobody. 1/5

1824	0	a	A few years ago, a friend of mine talked me into this game. I did horribly and assumed it was because I was terrible at racing games (spoiler alert, I'm not THAT bad). I came back to the game for some entertainment while Dirt 3 is installing, and some poor entertainment it was. And I'd like to think I've got a little bit more racing game experience behind me at this point. The drifting controls are abominable, the boost mechanic is overpowered (rear-ending someone while boosting kills them). Also, I've heard tell that the multiplayer is down. And the car selection is pretty limited as well, even if you bother to go through and unlock things. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game.
1184	1	a	Simply an amazing game, one of the best off road experiences out there today, a true off road adventure.
2042	1	a	Amazing game, classic but awesome. This is very fun if played with a controller: D 
470	0	a	An extremely tepid, generic, forgettable experience. It's a decent time-waster, for sure, and I genuinely have to admire the sense of scale and speed, as well as the colorful track design. However, the concerningly massive number of typos are a first sign that the experience is a bit slapdash, and the downright uncomfortable drifting mechanic makes Ridge Racer Unbounded seem comparatively intuitive (this game has two ways to use the handbrake and neither really works well).  AI competitors are inept to a childish degree, and I don't mean how a child plays a video game like this. I mean when they're bored inside a real car and run the car up a wall and then keep bumping it against the seat. I watched in amused awe as no less than three of the AI at once all decided not to take the turn ahead and instead wedge themselves into a corner, respawn before the corner, and do it again. And again. And again.  Visually, it's a mess. I mean, it's very neatly modeled and colorful and well designed, but this is all marred by a very questionable blurring effect that applies depth of field or... something, extremely wonkily. It just looks like vaseline smeared on random parts of the camera.  Audio-wise, the actual vehicle audio is decently okay. The pop-style soundtrack is genuinely impressive, except for the very repetitive main menu tune. Like, seriously, I see why the soundtrack provider is shown prominently in advertising for the game and on the first loading screen. It's pretty damn good. Though with lyrics about having women in one arm and booze in the other, it makes me figure this isn't supposed to be a kid's game, which makes me wonder who it actually IS for. Bored twenty-somethings and up looking for a bit of nostalgia of the good old days banging toy cars against each other like myself, I suppose. In any case, I totally want to find more of the musician's work, because it's really great, really serene. The high point of the game by a long shot.  I have extremely fond memories of Mad Tracks, and absolutely love racing games in general. Toy car racing games are a rather rare niche, especially outside of top-down games in the vein of Micro Machines, but even then, this fails to stand out. I obtained it in a bundle with many other cheap indie racing titles. I switched vehicles and noticed that the one I picked, the WRC4, bizarrely steered itself around the track for some reason. After that and a rehashed mission type with mines added where it turns out all the AI immediately steered into mines and blew themselves up, only for me to hit one and launch ahead  faster  and win, I gave up. Not terrible, but there are so many great racing games crying out for your attention, time, and wallet that this just isn't worth it. As it is, I'll likely just leave it running for cards and not bother booting it again.

TOO BAD FOR YOU, IT IS THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW THE GAME CRASHES RIGHT BEFORE YOU FINISHED IT !  'Ah Ah' should add the developers.  Don't buy this, it is not finished and it won't be. No more updates since 2012.  You CAN'T EVEN REMAP THE KEYS !!  It was unplayable on windows XP, it is still crashing on Windows 7 with 8 Giga of Ram and GTX560ti...  It's a shame because, even if graphics aren't HD but oversized for 1080P, the game is pretty challenging. Sometimes good driving by cornering and braking at the right time is rewarding, but at the harder levels, many of the A.I. cars always overtakes you with extra nitros and brakes in front of you to block-passes you and ruins your race.  Sometimes you are blocked by a pile of cars, all trying to block you at the same time, instead of rushing to victory.  So, there is the 'codemaster's solution' = RESTART RACE ! ... if it hasn't crashed before to windows desktop.

48	0	a	Death Rally will set you back $10 normally, and $5 on a discount sale which is still $3 more in quarters than I would have put into it if it were sitting in an arcade cabinet at the mall. Yes, it's fun in an old school mindless fashion with your little car racing around small repetitive tracks but due to the mechanics and swimmy control input you can't really 'race' in any proper fashion so killing the competition is the only choice to get ahead. Frankly, the controls are weak even when using the must-have gamepad controller. You're never seriously penalized for coming in second or even last place, you just get less money awarded to you for the purchase of upgrades to your guns and car performance, and you can't carry the money over between rounds to help in purchasing the pricier goodies. Sadly even when you do upgrade the results don't feel like a significant improvement. Graphics are passable while the sound quality is merely functional; neither have flair or panache. The game tries to create some personality in certain key opponents you face off against but they come off as cookie-cutter archetypes and pose little more challenge than the basic racers which ends up making them boring. Boring and uninspired gameplay is really the biggest drawback to this game. I played for 3 hours total and during that time I was able to fully upgrade 4 cars and the gatling gun weapon and once I got to that level I realized I wasn't have any fun and none of the other upgrade levels were going to get any more compelling and I called it quits. Death Rally was a fun diversion but completely forgettable and only worth playing during a free weekend. Save your time and money and go buy Renegade Ops instead as that game handles this approach to automotive combat a thousand times better.
159	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game on Steam that was previously a flash game called 'Smuggle Truck', a game commenting on the trials of immigration to the United States from Mexico. This is a narrative thread with satirization that works quite well.  Snuggle Truck is about transporting stuffed animals to the zoo, which makes for incredibly confusing commentary. First of all, where are the stuffed animals trying to escape from? Are they escaping from the bedrooms of a particularly stultifying suburb? Suburb living is the safest, blandest living there is to offer in the United States. Are they going to Burning Man or something?  No, they are going to the zoo. For some reason. Why? Are you playing as an international stuffed animal trafficker? What kind of demented mind steals teddy bears and stuffed elephants from the bedrooms and playplaces of children everywhere to take them to the zoo? What is to be gained from this action, especially when there are real animals to look at and already existing stuffed fascimiles to buy fresh from the gift shop at manufacturer suggested retail prices? THIS GAME MAKES NO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ SENSE AND THE MESSAGE IT OFFERS TO THE PLAYER IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CLOWNSHOES.  It is a solid physics flash game and it'll entertain you for twenty minutes before it starts to get boring. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE.
693	1	a	Bought this on a whim as I already had the first 3 Flatouts, and was aware of the comments that it was basically a remake of Flatout 2. Ignore the reviews that say don't bother with this if you already have Flatout 2. It's got all of the high octane fun of Flatout 2 with none of the frustrating bits. The gameplay is so much smoother, the handling better, and the higher res graphics mean that you can better see what's coming up and act/avoid accordingly. And at the moment it's in a bundle with all of the other Flatouts, which if you own none of the other titles makes it a complete no brainer. Even if you do, buy it. I did and I'm loving it.

You can change your graphics mode to other console form the 8-bit and 16-bit era and you can change the border of the game giving you the intention the you're playing on a real console from 2 decades ago.Taking it's cues from Volgarr The Viking (another great Retro Game) Giving a good beating to the player in other words meaning the game is difficult (At least for me) and this is where some of the games problems start to show , Control My GOD the car driving is horrifyingly bad , but I figured that you could change it in the control menu. But in the end I would Highly Recomend this game

1680	0	a	I just couldn't stand it anymore.  That's my short-review of Unbounded.   Is a long-review really necessary? *Sigh* Well if nothing can be done about it, let's dive in.  I've been a Ridge Racer fan for quite a long time. Aside from Ridge Racer Vita, R: Racing Evolution, and maybe Rave Racer, I've played all the games. I'm extensively familiar with the series, but that's irrelevant. Unbounded is...I don't know what it is. Was it some game Namco bought and then had some RR music and cars included to tie everything together? I don't know. So yeah, if I compare this game to RR, or hell if I so much has even mention that game, then I've lost.   Unbounded takes place in Shatter Bay, where a mysterious group is involved in illegal street racing. Apparently they hate the city almost as much as they hate each other. This is one of those racing games where not only can you obliterate your rivals, but you can also bust through cafes, government buildings, and construction sites for a shortcut. The similarities to Burnout are pretty obvious, though in this game 'checking' a rival is a bit more binary.  By catching air, drifting, and/or receiving various in-race awards, the player gets boost. Aside from a temporary increase in speed, anyone you run into during that brief period is going to get wrecked. This is about a 95% chance. If you're grinding next to someone (oh my) and you hit the boost, they're going to turn into flaming wreckage instantly. When not boosting you have a 5% chance of wrecking someone. This is a neat way to reverse all the dirty tricks that can happen in a usual race. Say you're one of two racers making a turn. You're on the outside, and the inside guy is using you as a buffer to avoid hitting the wall. This is a great time to boost because they'll suffer dearly. Also whenever you wreck an opponent, the game auto-corrects your car, so you don't drive into a wall or anything. Exploiting this mechanic can be quite handy.   Your opponents can boost as well, and aside from the red trail there's no obvious indication that they've boosted. Something like a sound effect could have been really useful. As it stands you're better off handling the other racers with kid gloves (especially if they're cheating AI), because they could boost at potentially any moment and take you out. Boosting is also necessary for certain destructable objects. Their usefulness in the actual race varies, and they could just as easily glitch out and cause you to flip over or get turned around. To unlock more races you have to amass a lot of points, destroying stuff is how you get them.  There are no shortage of tracks in this game. That's because they're all created via a track-editor. It's a neat idea but not really fleshed out. Basically each track is divided into sections. Let's say there is a straight-away, a curve to the right, a squiggly line, a hard-angle right, a dip, a long-easy right, a hairpin right, and that's the track. A lot of time in arcade-racers is spent learning the track itself, but with this game it doesn't seem to matter much at all. Instead you familiarize yourself with particular turns (the 1 or 2 difficult ones to be precise). While the track-editor allows further customization by adding objects and other tools, it's not as deep as it could be. Let's call it a limitation of the game-design. It's difficult to create ornate tracks when it's expected that a handful of racers are trying to destroy each other. There are a lot of created tracks floating around, and some are really interesting. Consider spending some time checking things out online.  I don't like the handling. Normally I'd just tack this on to the end of a huge paragraph, but it's the #1 reason why I couldn't take anymore of this game. The main reason I don't like it is because it's inconsistent. With some games drifting has either A) a sizable learning curve, or B) can be picked up in the first few seconds. Both A &amp; B work on their own. Daytona USA** is an A type, while Ridge Racer (I lose!) is a B type. Both games have appropriate learning curves, and mastering them is an exceptional feat despite the wildly different barriers of entry. Unbounded can't be an A type because the tracks aren't nearly as involved and well-designed. There's only so much you can do with such a base-selection of turns. Unbounded isn't a B type either because the cars have more weight, it takes more counter-steering not to lose control, and deciding between what type of brake to use to initiate the drift is more important. Essentially the system just doesn't gel for me, but I guess it doesn't matter.  This game apparently considers good drifting somewhere towards the bottom of 'things you should actually be concerned about in a race'. In the career mode there are very few time-attack races, and even then they have gimmicks like icons you pick up to freeze the clock. There are drifting events too, but you don't think about applying what you've picked up in an actual race. It's hard to appreciate a good drift in this game, when it's usually more effective to barrel through the opposition with a boost. Sometimes the winner is merely the racer that managed to get away from the chaos. More often than not, driving skill takes a backseat.  Altogether Unbounded just isn't satisfying. It never flicks the 'Hell Yeah!' switch in my brain. Quad-kills, surviving a brutally difficult platforming section, or just executing the perfect drift through the hardest turn, these are just some of the many 'Hell Yeah!' moments. Unbounded has never in my 7 hours* of play elicited that same response. I do all these supposedly awesome things but it's just not exciting at all.   *Yes I realize that by playing the game for a sizable amount of time, I've opened myself up to comments such as 'If you didn't like the game, why'd you play it for that long?' I was ready to quit this game after 2 hours, but that wouldn't be fair would it? Although, I probably should have beat the game, but playing Unbounded for 10+ hours is just too much to ask of me.  Sorry.  **In Daytona USA it's called power-sliding. It's the same but different. DETAILS.

2144	0	a	So yeah, this is a parody of GTA that relies on the unsurmountable amount of pop culture references to make you think it's doing something intelligent when it's not. The plot is completely neglectable, as it simply doesn't make sense. It's repetitive and so are the missions and dialogues, that try to be really clever with the most teen and buttdick humour ever. I was enjoying the sillines of it all until I realised that the dialogues were skippable and not funny, and that everywhere I went it was a hassle because the police was, well, hassling you everywhere. Not only that, but towards mission 40, the combat spikes up so much that it's frustratingly difficult and unfair - particularly for such a basic and not-thought-through system. It's simply not funny or engaging, and too frustrating. As a whole, yes, it's a mildly clever statement 'videogame plots never make sense and are over-the-top self-aggrandising rampages!!!'. But you can do exactly that with a much cleverer writing, humour and mechanics. Also, this game should have lasted two hours top, and it goes on and on and on and on unnecesarily. Man this is the first game that has made me rage quit and outright uninstall the game.

1761	0	a	If you look at the game piece by piece - it is good game, but when you put it together - it doesn't work well. It seems to have identity crisis and it doesn't seem to be able to choose - or it wants to be NFS or Flatout. By not establishing itself - it competes with those titles while failing to deliver on par with them. I would definitely prefer a racing game without essentially useless (unpredictable) destructible environment and weird physics (on one occasion my car went into air after driving over knocked sign or some debris) or game similar to Flatout, but not this hybrid. At first - I was enjoying this game, but after playing more I will definitely not recommend this game as it is less than sum of its parts.

1212	0	a	Awful in every sense of the word, ESPECIALLY when you compare it to its predecessors.  But, before I begin, there's something you must know - The first two FlatOut games were made by Bugbear Entertainment, and they were phenominal racing games, especially FlatOut 2. This game? Totally different company that completely misunderstood everything Bugbear had done right.   First things first, the AI is pitiful. I know the name of the game is destruction, literally, but it's a RACING game, and I'd rather have people using force to win the race than veering off the track in the first lap to wrestle in the grass like kittens.  On this note, *everyone* targets you. I went into one demolition derby round, and it was hilariously stupid the way it worked. As soon as the countdown hit zero, the twenty-or-so other non-player racers veered to the opposite side like the Persian army and all ganged up on me at once, with the exception of, what, like, two motorists smashing each other's bumpers in. I mean, I played FlatOut 2's derby mode religiously, and it sometimes feels like the AI prioritizes you over their brethren, but even in it worst state it was nothing compared to this insanity.  Now, it's time to compare it to its predecessors - Yes, Flatout 3 was made by a different company than the first two, but being a sequel by its title, I have to rate it in comparison to its past successes in the franchise.  The other NPC's -- The way this development team tried to recreate Bugbear's non-player character gimmick is awful. If you haven't played FlatOut 2, lemme give you the jist of things - There were seven NPC's that were the only opponents in the game. They all had distinct driving styles, color schemes, and skills in different racing areas. They were so memorable thanks to this that you had those names ingrained into your brain after your first couple of races and figured out very quickly whose names to curse every time you launched out of your windshield.  Well, 3 messes this all up. There are something near 15 characters, and some of them are so similar that you have no hope of remembering them. The character models are all very idealized, if you catch my drift, and there's one fully anonymous man wearing a motorcross helmet with practically full-balanced stats that you'll choose every time if you're sane. That's another thing, too - Unlike the original, where you were your own identity, you have to choose one of these punks.  Anyway, 2.5/10, because it technically functions, I guess. Go buy Next Car Game instead, it's made by the same company that made the other FlatOut games. Speaking of which, go buy the other FlatOut games, too, they're super cheap and also on Steam. It's a shame those two don't have online multiplayer anymore, because if they did, I'd force you to buy them at gunpoint.

1864	1	a	F1 Race Stars is ALMOST a very good game. But ultimately it is frustrating and somewhat lacking in comparison to other top kart racing titles. It is fun to play as your favourite F1 drivers in cartoon form, with lots of nice power ups, and some truly original and very innovative racing modes which keeps interest levels high. The graphics are quite good, though of course they are meant to be very cartoon-like as opposed to photorealistic. Overall, there's a lot of good to be said about the game. It is certainly a challenge!  But here's the rub: the game is challenging in the most frustrating of ways. Firstly, there is essentially no difficulty level. The 1,000 vs. 3,000 cc only changes the speed of the cars. Facing the AI is like a baptism of fire. It is relentless, and one can win only with a mix of skill and luck (luck being by far the most important factor). I don't like to win every race, but when I lose I want to be able to remedy that by improving my skills. Not so in F1 Race Stars. You can be racing at your very best and come dead last by virtue of a bit of bad luck; likewise you can race like a drunkard and come first with a contrary amount of good luck. This, unfortunately, is a very nearly game-breaking fault. As a result, what could have been a classic kart racing title will be one to forget in comparison to a Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing. But all in all, it isn't a bad game. Fun but frustrating. 7/10.

2457	1	a	'It's like an 8-Bit Grand Theft Auto!' That is what I'm sure you've heard before, and are probably expecting me to say -- and you're right! And guess what? It's just as awesome as it sounds! Only... it's so much more than that, even!  This game parodies just about anything and everything from the 80s and 90s: from video games, tv shows, movies -- I'm talking everything from TMNT, Metal Gear, Mario, Back to the Future, Duck Hunt, River City Ransom, The Three Stooges, Die Hard, Skate or Die -- and even freaking Saved By The Bell! And these are merely the things I can remember from the last couple of times I've played! Plus, the first couple of Story Missions are so jam-packed with references that I'm almost positive I've missed a few.  This entire game was made completely by one guy (save for the AMAZING 8-bit soundtrack, by various artists), and it took FOREVER to release, but it's finally out, and worth the price of admission.
1338	0	a	Kind of hard to belive how bad this game is.
605	1	a	Find it CHEAP and the stunt mode can keep you entertained for hours.
2374	1	a	You grow up with the NES? This game will remind you how great of a console it was. As well as remind you what a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ some of the games were. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ball-sacks, it's only fair that I play this game after watching AVGN because I can point out things that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ the living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me (and probably you too) much easier than just from memory alone. And mega â¥â¥â¥â¥, can this game be hard.  Also this game is full of epileptic lights and has some of the most nauseating screen rippling I have ever seen in a video game. This is the first game I have ever played that made me have to quit so I could go lie down and not vomit.  I'd recommend this game to everyone who wants a nostalgia trip. Or to people who want a stupid fun barrage of different ways to kill the living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of pixelated pedestrians. But beyond that, this game doesn't have too much substance post references and cameos (John Romero is in this game, and he gives you the Konami Code). Controls are pretty good and the game-play is solid, also the music is really nice, just this game will more than likely make you angry at one point or another. Just like the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing NES.  Protip 1: Borrow a bus, run into every pedestrian you can (They need help sleeping, the town has an insomnia epidemic), then get the threat meter to red. Then steal every tank and park them in the Pay 4 Spray.  Protip 2: Enable blood with this 'innocent' cheat (it doesn't disable achievements or saving); A B A Y A B B / X O X Tri X O O (360/PS controller) or just Jump Grab Jump Use Jump Grab Grab

104	1	a	I didn't expect much from the game, but what I got was a lot.
2574	1	a	A surprising little game. It plays and looks like a souped up micromachines game from days of yore. It has lots of nice little touches like oil slicks, sand, exploding barrels. And tons of unlockable paint jobs. Not to mention quite a few well designed tracks with the standard elimination, race, time trial options. The multiplayer bonus and shortcuts add to this and it's a shame more people aren't playing it.  The downside is the standard rubberband AI that you get with racers, but if you've played racing games this is kinda goes with the territory. It's not terrible with it, but it is noticeable. Especially in elimination races. The other downside is multiplayer is limited to unlocks, so if you plan to play with friends you may want to spend some time unlocking at least the extra tracks, modes, and cars.   I recommend this as a fun little party racer with a lot of nice little touches that nobody should be disappointed with. If you like unlockables, all the skins/paintjobs should keep you going for quite some time.

1175	1	a	Great surprise! I found this gem when I was looking for another game, I saw the screenshots and it sorta looked like a revamped, trials focused version 4x4 Evo with a 'lil bit of Spintires thrown into the mix. I added it to my wishlist and to my surprise it went on sale a week after that, so I bought it, played a bit and I wasn't dissapointed.  Indeed, Off-Road Drive reminds me of 4x4 Evo 1/2 and Spintires, even better cause the latter, from what I've watched and read, looks like it doesn't offer much and gets old quickly. This game offers many different tracks, vehicles and customization options. You race against the clock and other opponents but you don't see 'em during the race tho, except for a ghost of the first and second cars when they're getting close on you, so it feels kinda like a rally game in that regard, you still feel the competitive pressure and rush; During each race, depending on the surface you're on, you'll have to change the drive mode, gears, differentials, tire pressure and you'll even have to use the winch to attach the vehicle to a tree -or something else- a few times in certain levels just to get out of the most difficult situations.  A really fun game overall if you're into more 'cranial', simulation-y type of racing games, specially off-road ones, I truly recommend it.

1878	0	a	...  ... ... ...   I'm done. I quit. I can't take it anymore.  Pure Racing is the worst game mode I've ever played in any game, EVER. Spent two hours restarting Monaco over, and over, and over just so I could finish 4th. Despite the fact that it's IMPOSSIBLE to finish 1st in this gamemode unless you started first, somehow the AI that had won previous races also won again at Monaco and I ended up 2nd in the series. All that work, just to get my best possible finish of never-higher-than-fourth and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t AI wins, AGAIN.   Once you strip this game down of all its mario kart clone mechanics, there is literally nothing left -- this game accomplishes absolutely nothing. I had already grown weary of these ridiculous physics at this point. You can't make any corner because you just drift back and forth across the track, sometimes completely unpredictably. If any of the moronic AI get within an inch of you, which they seem incapable of NOT doing, they will trigger an absolutely unforgivable knockback effect that COMPLETELY stops all of your momentum. Naturally, it affects the AI less than it does the player so navigating through the clusterf*ck of garbage AI seems perfectly legit.   This is quite possibly the worst AI I've ever raced against in any game, at least in recent memory. Maybe it's just emphasized by the ridiculous physics which are, I suppose, designed to discourage less than optimal racing. Trying to retain a faint connection to real F1 racing, they make it abundantly clear that COLLISIONS ARE BAD, MMKAY. Be a respectful driver.. and wreck them with power-ups like a good boy/girl.   However, optimal racing is an impossibility, especially when comparing a play to an AI. All of these problems are almost mute when a part of this merely acceptable Mario Kart clone. Then, strip the game down to 'Pure Racing' and you just get slapped in the face with its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  Unbelievibly, despite the AI never taking an optimal race line or hitting any of the apexes of any corner, they are still consistantly as fast as if not faster than the player, unless you rely on the ridiculous draft system. If you brake into a corner properly, you WILL get rammed from behind and your race ruined. If you try to carfully overtake an AI through a corner on the outside and miraculously don't get hit from behind or have an AI slow to a crawl right in front of you, then the car on the inside WILL turn into your line and ruin your race.   So to recap, the AI never brake in corners and overtake you with easy, an often ram into you from behind. Yet, often times when entering a corner they will brake unpredictably and cause you to ram into them, even though they never brake. Despite the fact that the AI never take an optimal race line around the track, they make perfect time around corners, never missing boosts, while the player is in a constant struggle not to drift out of bounds while somehow managing to brake in a way to not get hit, enter corners in a way you can't be surprised by AI braking, or allowing any AI an opportunity to try and pass you on the side or enter your racing line.   Honestly, even though this game is a Mario Kart clone I expected it to have a stronger more realistic racing feel than it does. Furthermore, the amount of control I actually feel like I have over the car feels about comparable to ice tracks in Mario Kart, but not quite that extreme.  The power-ups lack any originality.  Oh, and the pit stops, oh my god the put stops. I could rage about them forever, about how AI will go into the pits on the last stretch and still win or even pass me, how if I go into the pits I will get passed by 3 other cars, all this mostly due to the fact that some pits are LONG AF and waste so much time while others might even be faster than the main race line.. seems legit. Ultimately, this inconsistancy leads to times where the standard of not pitting on the last stretch ends up with you losing the race. So, just keep in mind that whichever decision you make is probably the wrong one.   I would die for some online matchmaking to this game so that I don't have to deal with these AI, but I have yet to see a single person any of the times I've looked for a match.   Perfectly decent party game -- it's exactly what you'd expect. I'm not disappointed with my purchase, as these types of games are fun just to mess around on. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is into this type of game, despite the fact that they are probably better off just continuing to play their kart racer of choice. Jimmy Johnson's Anything With an Engine, right?  Edit: Just spent the last couple days playing Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed and it blows this game out of the water. It really made me realize how all the parts of F1 Race Stars work against each other, making it an incredibly unfluid and irritating experience. I'm not sure if on top of everything else that the tracks or poorly designed, or if it's just the terrible gameplay and uncontrollable cars that make it feel that way.   In the end, I could only recommend this game if you already know you want it. If not for the ridiculous collision effects, this game would still be passable. Truly one of the worst mechanics I've had to struggle against in any racing game.

2333	1	a	Some will say that Retro City Rampage is a 8-bit verson of GTA 1 and 2, but 1 million times cooler....  That someone is me, and every word is true, but I will say more. Retro City Rampage does remind me of a 8-bit verson of GTA 1 and 2, but 1 million times cooler - but the chreey on top is how it also says homage to a ton of classic 8-bit games, but turning them into funny and comforting parodies that everyone will remember and laugh over.   At the same time, it's a very well designed game. The Game mechanics are on point: Tight and responsive, no lag or difficulty, the game music is spot on perfect - classic 8-bit music. And the side quests and main missions while vast and interesting, are always fun and entertaining.   And yes, there IS a mission or two, where you MUST run people down.  How could you not love this game?  I highly recommend this game for casting online (twitch/hitbox/etc) and just playing on your own or with a buddy. Oh, and joystick support is easy to setup. Takes like a minute to config a controller.

79	1	a	For a Super Sprint clone, Death Rally is pretty impressive. The car handling actually feels right with an analog stick, but it does take a little getting used to around the hard turns. There is a standard assortment of weapons and vehicle types. Plus, each vehicle has three basic upgrades which includes speed, handling, and armor. The unlock system for weapons and vehicles offers an incentive system that isn't overly challenging.  The game is not deep by any stretch, but it manages to include a nice little short story along with the races. Races typically last only about 60 seconds providing a quick fix. There aren't too many maps, but what is included is fun and the game has a nice variety of challenges and achievements. Super Sprint was one of my favorite race games back in the day and Death Rally helped me revisit some of those lost memories.
914	1	a	Im going to start off by saying yes it is an old need for speed game but it's graphics are good even stannding up today and it makes me keep playing the game but lets get to the gameplay  The gameplay can be slow at times but the game makes up for it through all the type off things/races you can do. You could go from going to escaping the cops to a highway battle to making your car better and it goes on and on. The cars are even cool to look at even when not fully customized the graphics on high makes everything better.  The graphics are amazing. I know the last good new graphic was advanced warfare on the ps4 but graphics cant make up for gameplay but the graphics here are good even to me. Say you played advanced warfare then played this game on all high and you would say wow because it stands out for a racing game which is amazing but if your thinking to buy this for $5.00 do it. It's worth it in the long run

It uses most of S. Sprint's tricks with oil slicks, exploding barrels and shortcuts.  The games does have it's fair share of problems though, the biggest of which is those oil slicks and barrels. Look at it this way: you are about to win a race, you hit an oil slick, you lose the race. I know that this is old school, but it's pretty annoying and takes some of the skill from the races. Also you will notice that the camera spins around the car making it feel like a little RC racer. Unfortunately it just can't keep up, especially with faster cars which makes it precise driving difficult. Of course this isn't that much of a problem unless you care about the time trials.  Having said that racing is usually quite fun and opponents race fairly. You can use the exploding barrels and other hazards against them which even things up a bit.  On the whole I found that I enjoyed it more than I disliked it which means it's a recommendation from me.

1962	1	a	Think 8-bit GTA1/2 meets the ridiculousness of Saint's Row 3 paired with a HUGE amount of videogame and movie references. If you can't relate to that, think GTA1/2: Blood Dragon. True to it's old school nature, It's everything you can expect and more from a top down homage to nes gaming.  It has a neat little story mode with millions of references, arcade challenge mode where you can do fun weapon or kill challenges of the sort, and a free roam mode where you can create mayhem as you please. There are even arcade machines you can play within the game as fun little minigames. Also included, are tons of skins for the game. The controls for aiming can get a bit of getting used to but it is far from a deal breaker.  This game is a must have for any old school gamers.

The story line is whacky but well done and the overall smooth flowing levels and menus keeps your attention for long periods of time.

1129	0	a	ORD wants really badly to be an off road SIM-style game, but it just falls short in too many aspects.   From a gameplay perspective, the game just overdoes the multiple obstacles and approaches and throws them all at you at once. Imagine being taught how to build a birdhouse in a tutorial then the first race asks you to build an entire apartment complex on your own. Even with 5 hours under my belt there were simply some courses I could not win.  Now from a game design perspecive, ORD is almost an embarassment. The graphcis are... Okay at best. This would have looked good in the PS2 era of gaming. There are sometimes neat lighting effects and the draw distances are surprisingly detailed but everything else is left to be desired. Also the game cannot and will not remember your control configurations. So unless you want to use the up, down, left, right, arrow keys, you'll be remapping your control scheme every time you open it up.  I'm willing to let all of that pass... but the one thing that really gets under my skin is the AI design. Basically if you don't win 2 out of the 3 courses in a circuit and place SECOND in the one you don't win... you will never come in first in a circuit. The same AI driver WINS... EVERY... SINGLE... TIME. There's no coming back from any finish less than 2nd place in any given race. That's just awful game design.  Even if you absolutely LOVE anything offroading related, I cannot possibly recommend this game. It's just underdesigned on so many levels and in the few places that it does shine, it overly complicates things to the point where they are frustrating. Skip this game at all costs unless you are a fan of mental toture and self-harm.

850	0	a	Christ this game has not aged well. Dodgy physics and little-to-no controller support really kills it for me, stick to newer Trials games I'd suggest
1691	0	a	Apparently the online servers don't work anymore because they've been shut down. Unfortunately, the multiplayer would probably be the only reason to keep playing this game.  As far as gameplay goes, this game is unlike any proper Ridge Racer game before it. Unbounded is trying to be something akin to a (pre-Paradise) Burnout but it falls short of being better than any Burnout game. The drifting mechanics aren't great and the cars you start with all feel heavy, clunky and slow (even the DLC cars). You don't get the drifting you come to expect from a RR and you don't get the speed you would expect from a Burnout.  RR Unbounded is a game with an identity crisis and as a result it doesn't execute well in anything. I only got this game and some DLC for it as part of a Humble Bundle. With all the issues the game has on top of it's current multiplayer-less state, there is no way I can seriously recommend anybody spend any amount of money for this game.

726	1	a	If, like me, you are too impatient to wait for American Truck Simulator to be finished then this game is the best when it comes to driving trucks across the United States from coast to coast.   It is by no means a perfect game but it is one of the best in the 18 Wheels of Steel series. The series includes seven games, but only three of them are on Steam. Most fans prefer the previous ' 18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin' ', but I think that's only because the modding community was more active for that one. Unless you absolutely need replicas of popular trucks then I think it's okay to do without them. Other than that, both games are nearly identical to each other. The only major difference is that American Long Haul has more cities to explore. Not only is the mainland United States traversible (not Hawaii and Alaska), but you can also visit parts of Canada and Mexico. I think that alone makes American Long Haul worth playing over any other trucking simulator.  Like I said, the map is huge; covers all of the country with most major cities being represented. The ony downside to this is that there is no route advisor. A world map and a mini-map on the screen are the only tools that can help you get get around. It's kind of annoying at first having to go back and forth to the map to familiarize yourself with the roads. But then I started liking the challenge because it reminds me of the old days before GPS was available and drivers actually had to use road maps.  One thing I really like about this game and which I think is sorely needed today is the CB radio feature. During your travels you can hear other drivers on the radio asking for weather and traffic reports and you can actually respond to them with a response menu by pressing the 'v' key. It doesn't appear to do anything at first except give you a warm feeling inside, but apparently it helps your reputation grow and opens up more drivers for hire later on.  There's no option for using internet radio like you can in other SCS games, but you can import your own music. In that case you must convert your MP3s to the OGG format and there are websites you can use for doing that without downloading anything. I imported a few radio stations from GTA and they sound very nice and natural in this game.  My biggest gripe would have to be the steering. There is a mod somewhere that lets you steer with a mouse, but I prefer using a keyboard for steering. It works for me in other driving games, and until I actually buy a steering wheel that is what I'm going to use. Unfortunately, in this game, the wheel auto-centers itself too quickly so you're having to constantly jam on the 'a' and 'd' keys when making a sharp turn. It's not a total inconvenience, but it takes some time to get used to. If it bothers you that much then I would suggest a controller.  Hard to believe that SCS made this game so many years ago and there's actually more ground to cover than in any of their recent games. American Truck Simulator was released with only two states and Euro Truck Simulator 2 is being finished by modders. But they have stuck with the same formula over the years and, aside from graphics, their games have remained the same.  American Long Haul is not much different from ETS 2 or American Truck Simulator. You're still a truck driver managing your own company; you take jobs and deliver loads; you hire drivers to work for you; when you get tired you pull off the side of the road and sleep; when you need gas you go to the filling station; police give you a hard time; and when you get money you can buy more trucks. And really, what else do you need? Why not just skip the DLC fest and play this game instead?

397	1	a	I just bought this game today. And I really enjoy playing it. Because the game sometimes plays for you. Giving you the opportunity to watch how the tracks are designed and how the car controls ever move. Except for flipping.   But there was one other reason why I bought this game. I was interested in the Workshop feature. For creating a track and then clicking share. Which I'd assumed it would've uploaded it to the Workshop. But after I exit the game and view the uploaded Workshops. Super Toy Cars track that I had shared that I can see with my other Workshops are blank. There doesn't seem to be any writing which I did include a name and description. Also the screenshot. But the Workshop content is bare. I would've not recommended this game but since the main game theme is marvelously designed. I would still recommend this game, regardless to the Workshop problem which I hope will be fixed in the future.

3179	1	a	SpeedRunners is as if Mario Kart and Super Meat Boy had a baby. It's a fast paced platforming race where you knock your opponents out with items found on the track, going off-screen results in death, and the last person alive wins the race.  I'm not a multiplayer person at all, but I enjoy playing this competitively in ranked mode, or casually with friends. To my knowledge, there is no other game like this, so I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys platforming games.
2645	1	a	This game is literally all I play now. SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game with up to four players where you choose and unlock all sorts of comical characters to play as. Racing on foot has never been this fun. Wait, it's never been fun... Well, this Makes it fun! You can play this game both casually with friends, and competitively with anyone. Learning the physics of this game and it's crazy tricks raises the skill ceiling so much higher! You can play ranked with people of your skill level, or jump into a quick match and have just as much fun grappling and kicking off walls to your leisure. There's even a single player story mode, with unlockable comic book chapters! Not to mention, this game's soundtrack and art style makes it feel all the more like you're inside a comic book! While many players buy this game on sale and give up early, this game is most definitely not dead, and seeing its success and competitive scene, won't ever die. This game is simple fun for absolutely anyone! Grapple far and hit slopes hard, runners! This game is amazing, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes any sort of platformer game!
1426	0	a	Take Carmageddon, take out the gore, the good gameplay, and add some new cars to it, upgrade the graphics to  Worse-Than-FlatOut 2  tier, mix it with horrible performance and put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 200Â°C.  Wonderful, you've got FlatOut 3! Except it's not wonderful. In fact, throw it in the trash and think about what you just did.  This game is the downfall of the FlatOut franchise. Not only because it was made by a game dev studio that usually does Wii games. No, this game also lacks of pretty much everything that made FlatOut fun. Realistic damage models, good driving physics, nice visuals, funny minigames, multiplayer fun. This game has nothing of those. In fact, it is probably the purchase I regret the most. Not only because the game is not worth the money, but also because you get nothing for your money.   All your good expectations are shattered in the very first race. The driving feels awful, the physics are horrible and don't get me started on the damage model. You'd expect a game that looks like this to run smoothly, but it doesn't.  I don't even know if I want to go trough the pain of writing a full review here, but there's not much to say than  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU EXPECT THE FLATOUT EXPERIENCE .  Please support the  real  FlatOut 3 instead, Bugbears 'Next Car Game' which you may find in the recommendations above.

Everything seems very polished and it is hard to find a fault other than it is so fast paced, I find it hard to keep up at times as I'm not in the mood for anything taxing with my cold.  The Mac version runs flawlessly and uses native full screen mode which I was impressed by. First game I've actually seen use this feature.  For the price, this game is a steal and much better than many of the other Indie games on steam as it seems to have loads of content and be very polished.

Cons: - AWFUL HANDLING (the main reason I can't stand this game) because of this the game is unplayable - There is NO map so you have no idea what kind of turn will be next and should you drift or not. - Music is just boring. The best track is scary sprites and nice monsters by Skrillex and that says a lot. - The graphics aren't even that good.. - No car customization (other than color change) or even rotating and viewing them while selecting a car so no eyecandy for you.  Pros: ehh.. umm... can't really think of any.  I did not try the multiplayer but with handling like this why would I bother...  Don't buy this. Just don't... eh..well, you can play this if you get this for free from someone but remember to feel sorry for the poor soul who paid for this.

781	0	a	This game used to be where it was at, but that place is no longer there. Eurotruck Simulator 2 completely smokes this game, but you don't get the American trucks though. I have actually owned several of the 18WOS games but they just do not stand the test of time. If you want this game, either find it in the WalMart bargain bin for $5 or wait to see if it available on Steam for $2-$3.   Now, if you still want to play this, go ahead. It isn't a bad game and there are tons of mods out there. The problem is that it is really old and has a very 'stiff' feel to it.
1982	1	a	First of all , the only con is that the game is too short... And that it only lack one element... local multiplayer.  But apart from this the ambiant, the look, the music and every character you will find in this game is an open love letter for retro gaming.  From Megaman to TMNT passing by Metal Gear in an open GTA world you incarne Player and do errend for everyone. Every text makes reference to a video game or a movie from 80's up to 90's.  Seal of approval!
2012	1	a	A solid game. It will take you back to the days of the original Grand Theft Auto mixed in with all the classic tropes and in-jokes to your '80s and '90s gaming. I stopped playing at one point, not because it was a bad game, but because I got overwhelmed with the Open-World stuff like the various challenges and time attacks and everything else. I'll probably be revisiting this game shortly, but take it from me, there's PLENTY in this game to do and to keep yourself busy with. Not to mention all the retro mini-games they have like a Virtual Boy styled Super Meat Boy game and other Arcade games included in this.

The race suxx as hell. you alway play on the same 3 maps on the absolut same 4 game modes (elimination, time attack, race, minesweeper) against the same stupid drivers (in diffrent cars) theoretical there are cars that can be choosen, but why should anyone drive another car than the beginner car to the max (in under 30 min) and after you buy it you have already the best for all races. For the gameplay itself its mario cart on very bad copy. you drive and maybe drift, than pickin up some powerups that you fire at your enemys. the problem is that the AI is so damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ that the always ram and not even try to avoid a collosion (with you or enviroment)

1820	0	a	I'm not quite sure what I expected with Ridge Racer: Unbounded. The title sounded cool and I had heard decent things a few years back, but I never realized that Namco Bandai had tried their hand at a Burnout game. When I first loaded the game, I was delighted that this was taking a more destructive approach to racing.  After I finished the first event, I knew something was very wrong. The previous Ridge Racer games were all about speed. Tight turns, tighter controls and hilariously awful translations; that is what gave Ridge Racer its charm. All of that gets thrown out the window for Unbounded in an attempt to modernize the series.  For starters, the graphics are darker and more realistic than ever before; the pace has been slowed a bit and the cars feel far too weighty. Drifting, which is an integral part of the track design, is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing busted that I nearly quit in fury a few times. Busted explains a lot of things with Unbounded, but it applies more to the controls then the arenas you'll be tearing apart.  The newest addition with Unbounded is the destructible environments. I have to give credit where credit is due; Unbounded does offer an impressive amount of course carnage. While the props are basically made of styrofoam, your car can glide through things and not immediately crash. Sadly, that's about the only decent thing in the tracks.  As for regular buildings, your car typically gravitates towards them. Barely clipping them will usually cause your car to smash up, but sometimes you go flying through the air or spinning in circles. While that should be realistic, the game has an awful tendency to reset your car before your crash site. This causes a tremendous amount of wasted time in Time Attack events and often causes you to lose up to 7 places in race mode.  These should be fun, but the physics and AI of the game are so borked that I couldn't wrap my head around them. At times, you fly out of the gate and pass everyone with ease. Other times, the opponents are beyond hard and you'll hardly catch them. Sometimes you'll smash through highlighted objects only to immediately crash once the automated cutscene ends. You'll even make jumps only to see your car barrel rolling through the air, despite not clipping anything.  There is also some horrible graphical glitch that causes constant flickering for upwards of 15 seconds at a time. It obscures some of the track and leads to wiping out or missing turns. It also looks terrible and gives me a headache, but that may be a personal issue.  What isn't personal is information about your cars. The stats are shown before you decide on your vehicle, but they aren't really reliable. Maybe this is more down to individual playstyles, but the car with the highest speed stat should be the fastest one on the track.  There are also some cars that are carbon copies of others (excluding the pointless DLC) and others, still, that have mostly the same stats, but are higher in key areas. It makes certain cars completely worthless after reaching higher driver levels.  Then there is the lack of course diversity and the general sluggishness to the controls. It just doesn't feel pleasant to play Ridge Racer: Unbounded. I had fun, at times, but not enough for me to recommend this to anyone. The lackluster campaign and hilariously anti-climactic ending just rub salt in the wound.  The online portion is completely non-functional. From the sound of what it included, it could have remedied this package. Racers were given the ability to customize events and challenge others worldwide. While it may have been frustrating to deal with the controls, I could see smashing people into walls as being a blast.  Still, that doesn't work. Namco Bandai shutdown the servers in 2015 and have basically cut the game in half. The price tag, at least, reflects the lack of multiplayer, but it still sours the overall package. Having courses made by other players would be outstanding, even if the game feels rushed and sloppy.  It doesn't help that there isn't a split-screen mode at all. I know PC games typically don't offer split-screen, but even the console ports of Unbounded lacked the feature. In other words, the multiplayer was basically a bulletpoint on features for the game. No one actually cared about molding it into a celebrated feature (something that should be sorely missed upon it's closure).  Overall, I just wouldn't bother playing this. Unless you just have a fondness for the Ridge Racer name, there isn't much here that hasn't been done better in other racers. Unbounded mostly made me pine for a new Burnout or to return to Burnout: Revenge. Even the crappy portable Burnout games are better than this drivel.  3/10

1851	0	a	I like the Ridge Racer series a lot. I like the Flatout Series a lot. I'm mostly indifferent about RR:U. However, if I were simply indifferent I wouldn't review this game at all. I have to go through the effort of disuading purchase of the game simply for the removal of its online services. But while I'm here for that I may as well talk about its snoozefest content.  So accessing other user's content and the majority of online services are gone. What's left of it is a mediocre racing game having little of the charm of either Flatout or Ridge Racer. Yes, stuff blows up and Yes, there's super exaggerated drifting. A clear connection is drawn to RidgeRacer and Bugbear, but sadly, the drift mechanics feel weak and are poorly implemented compared to other RR games. As for the destruction, it comes off as canned and grows largely unimpressive as believeability escapes with the game choosing what can and cannot be taken apart. That and the cookie cutter maps and environment start running together and weren't that great looking in the first place.  As it is, it should be in an arcade cabinet at Chuckee Cheese. If you're looking for an arcade racer to really stay with, I'd pick up almost anything else. If it's priced at like a dollar and you're only expecting that much out of it, you wont be as disapointed.

I really like how it parodies many games and films like Back to the future, Super Mario Bros 2 and Bionic commando and how it uses these ganres to produce humour. The key bindings fit the game perfectly and allows the player to easily control the character.Overall, the game is probably better than the first installments of GTA. 9/10

Show support for the original series and buy FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage, or support those guys directly and go check out Bugbear's Next Car Game, but pleast do not give these guys any more money. This is not deserving of the FlatOut name.

Its not a pay to play game! Everything you buy just effects how it looks and not how its played, to be good you must play! The soundtrack fits the tone of the fast paced, cut-throat gameplay! All the sound effects are great and really immerse you! I hate long reviews so ill keep it short. The game is fast paced, fun to play, cut throat and with every victory your friends will hate you more and more! Mentioning hate, Ive sseen NONE of it in the games ive played, everyone is nice and fair with each loss, and complementary with each victory! Worth. Every. Penny.

1695	0	a	I never played any Ridge Racer game before, and from what I understood this game is very different from old ridge racer games. What I can say with certainty is that this is one of the most soulless and bland games I've ever played. It feels like it was made by a computer.  Doesn't help that the driving isn't particularly fun. The game's emphasis on drifting just makes it very imprecise. I never felt like I did anything on purpose.   tl;dr game sucks.
471	1	a	In case your confused Flatout Ultimate Carnage is Flatout 2 with a few extras. Basically Flatout 2 with a DLC in it would be the best way to describe it. In truth it was a re-release of Flatout 2, not exactly sure why.  I hate racing games. So for me to like a racing game it must be pretty damn fun. A garage where you can purchase and upgrade many vehicles. Your car takes lots of damage and so do the other cars. You can visibly see the damage of all the cars. You can totally wreck your car out of the race and you can also take out opponents by causing enough damage to the AI cars.  Some of the best feeling cars in a simulation. It doesnt feel 'arcadey' yet cars become very managable at high speeds. There is even a crash durby mode.  WARNING - Don't even think about Flatout 3. Totally different company did that one and unless you want to see an example of the worst race game ever don't bother. Flatout 2 is the best in the series.  SERIOUSLY - No idea if the forum is still up for Flatout 3 but at some point I was wondering if they were going to shut it down because of SOOO many complaints. Have you ever bought a game programming book with an example race game in it? Flatout 3 was worse than that.

1445	1	a	Ok, I was honestly expecting that the latest release of Flatout will be the best so far. I have never been so wrong in my entire life and yet they got the name right: 'chaos&amp;destructrion' which fits perfectly to my hopes and dreams about this game. But here it goes, allow me to start with the good parts of this 'masterpiece':  +it has steamworks +it has achievements +it has multiplayer and works well with the steam incorporation +it gives you a good reason to appreciate the classics and your life in general +it has wacky looking characters and vehicles, always good for a good laugh (since this entire game is a laughing matter)  And now...for the long and tedious negative list...I could probably just sum it up to: 'It sucks!', but I will mention just a few of the downgrades (in comparison to it's predecessor it seems lesser of a game) and downfalls of the game:  -it crashes, sudden unavoidable and uncontrollable exit of the game (I have everything up to date, but not only for me, but also for others...it just gives an error and crashes) -bad handling (not sure if this game was supposed to have handling that you would only see in those old car games, really rudimentary and quite disappointing) -bad graphics (I know I played it on low, but I wasn't expecting to look worse than the first title) -no community (hmm, I wonder why? *sarcasm* ) -the crashing effects suck (apparently every time you crash, you lose all of your wheels and other unaesthetic looks for the crashing events) -from what I noticed, it lacks the story part or something related -the physics are broken most of the time -limited maps, barely new features compared with the previous titles etc. -it was not worth the price I paid at the time  And the list can easily continue for a lot...this is my experience from only an hour or so of gameplay...but, I will still recommend this game, because it really helps you to learn to appreciate what you have and, heck, how knows, you just might enjoy this game while you are drunk or feel like doing something really dumb, so why not keep it close for just those special occasions when you 'dare to be stupid'. This game really deserves it's metacritic score 2/10 .
2468	1	a	I will keep this short: if you combined GTA with everything from the 80s and 90s, you get this game. I may have only racked up about 8 hours on this at the time of this review, but I have quite a few hours on the 3DS version (I have so few on PC becuase my Afterglow 360 controller doesn't agree with RCR). It's a fun game I reccomend to people who like open-world games and/or retro stuff in general.

In time of forza and project cars itÂ´s nice to play an arcady racing game like split/second, but Unbounded is not the game you should play for an arcade racer if you can choose between better games.  The controlles are laggy, whacky and bad. The gamemodes are so boring. Actually youÂ´re repeating four games modes over and over and over.  The rubber banding AI drives you nuts. ThereÂ´s no room for skill cause the AI will always get you.  I beat the game, but iÂ´m really glad being done with it. Now i can spend my time with quality racers...

The cars range from not handling at all to soap bars with wheels. The Mine Race mode is the worst thing ever. Physics and collision boxes are just completely random. There's only 4 different variations on track themes, which don't add anything except a different look to the tracks. It's almost hard to believe that with such an enormous breadth of games to draw inspiration from that this somehow ended up being worse than any of them.

2429	1	a	Retro City Rampage flops between excellently recreating the challenging and frustrating gameplay of a bygone era of videogames, and falling into the trap of sloppy, overused jokes ranging from stale internet memes and tired 80s references. The last portion of the game is great fun, and it's a shame the rest of the game is quite different from it. The approach to design seems to be to insert as much content as possible with no sense of an overall idea or quality, meaning the game shines when it gets a level or concept right, but feels boring and repetitive when it misses the mark. The usual 'indie game' circlejerking with cameos from Phil Fish, Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Destructoid and others also irks me, just because I really don't like the culture that has sprung up around indie games. Overall, though, it's still got a lot of bang for your buck, with plenty of extra game modes and challenges to take on once you've done the rather short story mode, and all kinds of collectables and customisation.

There are callbacks to Mario, Mega Man, Contra, Battletoads, even Castlevania. Looking forward to the sequel!

The look and most particularly the feel of Super Toy Cars does make you realise just how much research and development goes into big name titles such as Mario Kart.  If you're of a mind to have fun with this type of racer, this is certainly one whose concept, features and artwork jump out at you. But it's a disappointment in almost every department.  The fact the Update History page shows the last entry as 5 Jul, 2014 should be all you need to not make the mistake of buying it.
656	1	a	The BEST car racing game in ... well EVER!!!
2371	1	a	Combining GTA/Saint's Row like gameplay with 8-bit graphics and gaming nostalgia, Retro City Rampage will take you back to the days of simple NES games making you wish you had a game like this. This is one of the best nostalgia trips anyone can take.

975	1	a	The best/worst racing game ever, it's so bad, it's addicting!
1326	0	a	Flatout 3, simply put, is just bad. This is what happens when a different developer tires to take advantage of an existing franchise with 3 previous titles. The first time I played this, it was so very different from the previous FlatOut games I didnt really know what to think. After a few hours, I was disappointed. Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage are a better choice.

888	1	a	Most underated racing game of the past generation. Solid mechanics, great driving feel, kinda on the unglier side, but still super fun. Not as good as Most Wanted 05, but that game isn't even on Steam so this is as close as you can get.

2478	1	a	Within 2 hours of playing this game I have run around in a Luigi hat beating people up with a mop, infiltrated a military base and fought Bionic Commando to fix my time machine, and stolen Donkey Kong from a harbor, plowing through oncoming traffic like nothing.  Best 3 dollars I ever spent (I got it on sale)

1865	1	a	If you can get this game on sale, like I did, then it is a pretty decent time killer for a few hours (I recommend it on sale, but not if its standard price). However, the novelty factor quickly runs boring and there are a few issues with the game: it looks and plays like they tried to rip off mario kart, the boosters are ridiculous and can get you from anywhere, if you are dominating then it seems to rain a hell of a lot to bring you back to the field.  If you like this sort of game there are plenty of levels and steam acheivements to work through, and if you are a fan of F1 then its a bonus novelty to have real drivers and teams (I am not).
2435	1	a	It's hard to tell what the key word in 'Retro City Rampage' is, but it's probably not 'City.' It's definitely retro as hell; in fact, it lets you choose your preferred flavor of retro by choosing from several old TV-tube-style screen frames and an impressive number of old color pallettes, including Game Boy and ancient green-screen styles. Game structure follows GTA format in a top-down perspective. Soundtrack is 8-bit excellence and features some beloved 8-bit composers like Virt. 80's and 90's pop culture references deliberately run absolutely rampant, and are actually done quite well for referential humor -- the whole game is pretty darn funny, in fact. Gameplay itself works pretty well and is satisfying. My biggest complaint is that some of the missions are real jerks which almost seem to be deliberately recalling the worst and most annoying GTA missions. If that's the worst I can say about it, though, this game is well done and hells of fun.

43	1	a	Death Rally was a fun game, not as fun as the original Death Rally game but imo they haven't failed the first game in any way... except Duke Nukem is not in this game... It's still a great game imo and i can gladly recommend it. Online racing is abit dead nowdays tho.

954	1	a	Let me get the elephant out of the room first, this game is what I would consider a 'REBOOT.' When a franchise is stale, it tries to relive the successes of yester-year (EX. Most Wanted (2005)) and sometimes it works, unfortunately for Undercover, the sales at launch say it was too late. Carbon had at least a 7 million unit sales DECREASE! Then ProStreet lost another 4 million unit sales at launch! Before you click away, this is NOT the same as bad, just for Undercover, it was a day late and a dollar short.  Gameplay:   The game tries to mesh ProStreet's engine, with Most Wanted's narrative format. This was an... INTERESTING result. We got control that was MILES better than ProStreet's, but still wasn't as great as Most Wanted (2005)'s. There are new modes such as highway battles and outruns. These do add some variety, but don't really feel, (to me), warranted. The car selection is the best of the series. We got your typical street cars like your RX-8's and Camaro's, but then you got LFA's and Pagani's, holy ****,. that is awesome!  Graphics:  This is to me, the game's key strength. The shaders look real, and the textures look superb. The car modeling and damage are so fun to see your hood fly right off your car and fly away to no man's land.   Music:  Eww, I know most people bash on this, but to me this seems like a sign of how the times can change over the course of 4-8 years. Where'd did the good jams go?  Verdict:  Yes, this game has some issues, plenty. But most are not game breaking and this game gets too much hate despite no one knowing how tight this game's development was. EA Black Box/EA Canada was split in 2007. one team made ProStreet, the other made Undercover. Knowing what they accomplsihed with only half the team makes me want to give this game 4.5 stars, but I can't. It tries to be Most Wanted 2.0, but fails in terms of gameplay design and music choices. I can only give this a 5/10, which is not a bad score, in fact, five is a middle ground. It's the most subjective score I can give it.

1292	0	a	Wow, Just WOW.  Ok, I'm just going to tell you my experience with this game. My entire 8 minutes, That's all I played of this, and that's all I will EVER play of this. So, I've heard past reviews, I've seen videos of it, And I was convinced that this was a disgrace. So how did I end up with it? Because I bought the pack that came with it. I legit only wanted Flatout 1 &amp; 2, and this thing tagged along with Ultimate Carnage (can't get that to work, but that's probably still way better than this). Because of that, I decided to try it. 'Maybe it isn't so bad,' I thought to myself. 'Maybe it's just a letdown and that's why it's lower rated than Ride to Hell: Retribution.'  Oh, I was wrong. So, SO wrong.  So, after this thing eats 11GB of my hard drive (yes, 11 Gigabytes of valuable space), I hit play and brace myself. The loading screen pops up, the game loads, and I configure my controller. I choose a race, select my car and character, there's another loading screen, and the race starts.  Now, here's my first of many problems with this game. The visuals. Why do all the cars look like the toy cars from that Burnout Paradise DLC? Excuse me, even worse than those? Not to mention the stage I was racing in was completely bland and uninteresting, with only right corners. Yes, only 90 degree turns in this stage. Even Flatout 1 had curved corners in it's first track. And yes, I know this was done by a different studio then Bugbear, the original creators, but still, have some variety in your stages to get the player interested (not like I was to begin with).   Second of all, and by far the biggest complaint from everyone who's played this, the controls and physics. DEAR GOD. The car turned so stiff around the corners. It was literally the most unresponsive control in a racing game I've ever experienced. And the physics? Do you know how crazy and wacky the physics were in previous Flatout games? Well, there's little to no physics here. When the car hit the one ramp in the stage, it was like it was on a preset jump path. It only went up and down, it didn't even turn to the side. It was kinda like that jump in the original Ridge Racer. Except this isn't 1994 or on a Playstation 1, this game was released in 2011. Also, do you know what was one of Flatout's main selling points or what made it fun? The crashes and ragdoll physics. Here, you tap one wall going 30 miles per hour and explode. And there's no ragdoll cam. And it doesn't even look cool. Have any of the developers who made this even play or SEE a Flatout game before? Because it doesn't feel like it.  And now for my last point which kinda ties into the physics point, the stunts. That's right, I actually played a different mode after the race. I tried something that I don't think anyone did before. I went one step further and tried a stunt event.  So, after the stunt stage loads, I hit the accelerate button, press eject at the ramp and.... OH MY GOD WHAT? If you don't know (which you probably don't), you can pick different characters/ragdolls at the menu. I picked the first guy, who has a trenchcoat on. When I launched him during the stunt, it cut to a ragdoll camera for once. And, well.... You know how sometimes games have that bug where a hair piece or piece of clothing stretch out in an odd way? Like into a wall or something? Well, my ragdoll's trenchcoat did that the first time. Then I retried the stunt, and it did it again. I actually think the developers gave up after the first stage of this game and never bug tested it. You hear that a lot with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, undeveloped games, but I truly thought that when I saw it.   So.... in conclusion, don't buy this. Please don't buy this abysmal mess. Even if you got it with the pack, don't download it. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics, controls, physics, this game has it all. Did I mention that this takes up 11GB of space? I did, but did I also mention this game costs $30 normally? THIRTY DOLLARS? You can actually get Flatout 1 and 2 on sale, which are way WAY better than this for less. Even when this thing is on sale right now (at the time of posting this), you can still get the original 2 for less.  I now know why everyone despises this game. Why it's the lowest rated game on Steam. And it's still up.  Don't waste your time with this game. It took me longer to type this than play it, and this was a better experience than that.

439	0	a	This game is merely a merely competent cart racing style game with absolutely nothing that makes it stand out. The vehicles handle pretty differently, but there's little reason to not use the fastest one you can afford. The collision detection isn't great, you can drive through some objects and get stopped by blank space sometimes.  There's no real reason to play this over existing games in the genre like Mario Kart, Re-Volt, or RC Cars since it does nothing unique or exceptional.

2028	1	a	The game starts out well touches a lot of good old gaming memories....but then by the end it just starts to copy the worst things you dont want to have in your game and becomes just die-&gt;reload-&gt;die missions no fun , no meaning. Left a bad taste by the end , would not want to play this game again :X Proceed at your own risk.... Music is good, a controller is highly recommended   why cant we have the the good parts from the retro old games instead of the annoying ones.... Scorewise i would say 7/10  My screenshots showing how the game goes from nice nostalgia to Pure rage[spoilers]  http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidsnakehpks/screenshots/?appid=204630&amp;sort=newestfirst&amp;browsefilter=myfiles&amp;view=grid#scrollTop=0   Hoping for a pure story in the next game they make using a similar retro style

1283	0	a	Joke. I describe this as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, non-organized stack of codes. There is no graphics, nor sound, nor gameplay. Upon opening up this program, all that is left in you is complete pain. If you loved Flat Out series before, continue playing those old games because this is done by completely different people, who most likely have no idea how to create a playable game.

2108	0	a	On the one hand, a tremendous amount of work went into creating tons of mini-games in service of making a reference a minute, and that merits respect. On the other hand, that mostly ends up serving as a reminder of games you liked a lot more than Retro City Rampage.  If you want open-world mayhem, go with something like a Saints Row game, where the city is easier to enjoy. If you want referential humor, grab something like Shut Up And Jam Gaiden, which puts more effort into its punchlines than 'Hey remember that thing.'

1016	1	a	A Need for Speed game, what else can I say? Love this racing franchise. :)
2690	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.
